As of August 2025, the SEC confirms that liquid staking and staking receipt tokens (SRTs) are not classified as securities under federal law — as long as specific conditions are met. The implications are enormous. For top protocols like Ethereum and Solana — and emerging players like MAGACOIN FINANCE — this new clarity could unlock a fresh wave of participation, innovation, and capital. Staking is no longer a gray zone; it’s now a green light — for protocols that follow the rules. Ethereum: Regulatory Clarity Fuels Institutional Inflows Ethereum stands as the largest staking ecosystem by volume — and the SEC’s guidance couldn’t have come at a better time. With ETH 2.0 fully operational and over 30 million ETH staked , the decision not to treat liquid staking as a security eliminates a critical overhang. The ETH community has long pushed for clarity around liquid staking providers like Lido and Rocket Pool, and now with this clarification, institutions that were once hesitant can move in with confidence. Analysts believe this could trigger a 15–20% increase in ETH staking participation within the next 90 days. More importantly, this removes friction for ETH ETFs to integrate staking yields — a feature that could dramatically enhance product competitiveness and returns in regulated markets. Solana: Fast and Nimble, Ready to Scale Solana’s staking model has always emphasized speed and simplicity. With validator participation on the rise and mobile access through the Solana Saga ecosystem, the protocol is now better positioned to scale user-facing staking tools — especially under compliant frameworks. With the SEC confirming that purely administrative staking models are exempt, Solana-based dApps can now confidently integrate SRT functionality into their DeFi layers without triggering securities concerns. Projects focused on gaming, yield optimization, or RWA tokenization may now find staking easier to integrate — and easier to market. Solana also benefits from low transaction costs, making staking and redemption of SRTs fast and affordable — a major advantage over Ethereum’s fee-heavy ecosystem. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Regulatory Tailwinds Meet Early Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE is fully audited, supported by a strong and growing community of investors. Still in its early phase but rapidly gaining traction, MAGACOIN FINANCE is among the few presale tokens to have fully embraced staking from the start. The project is showing serious conviction from early adopters. More importantly, MAGACOIN’s architecture aligns perfectly with the SEC’s clarified criteria — it performs purely administrative tasks, distributes yield from the protocol itself, and avoids discretionary management. Analysts now suggest that this regulatory alignment, combined with upcoming exchange listings and meme-fueled virality, could drive 35x–50x ROI potential through Q4. Final Take: The Path Is Clearer, and the Race Is On The SEC’s guidance on staking is more than just legal clarity — it’s a catalyst. Ethereum can expand institutional use. Solana can scale integration. And MAGACOIN FINANCE , with its early compliance-ready design, is emerging as the undervalued gem investors didn’t see coming.

Last month, XRP reached a yearly high of $3.66 but later declined to $2.70, failing to maintain momentum. Currently, the asset is attempting to recover and re-establish support above $3 . In this context, EGRAG’s historical trend analysis offers valuable insights into potential long-term trends. The Chasm Line – A Recurring Barrier Since 2014 According to EGRAG , the Chasm line is an upward-sloping resistance trendline on XRP’s monthly chart that has historically restricted its price growth. The line has served as a critical point of resistance in multiple market cycles, with XRP reacting strongly each time it approached this level. #XRP – The Chasm: Touching it , $11 and Surpassing it $37: This is the ‘The Chasm Chart’ https://t.co/40pb8cxpQq pic.twitter.com/vpd66zzAea — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) July 19, 2025 During the 2017–2018 cycle (referred to as Cycle 1), XRP reached a local peak of $0.3988 by May 2017, which coincided with the Chasm line. This resulted in a sharp correction followed by a six-month consolidation period. Eventually, XRP regained momentum, broke above the Chasm line, and surged by approximately 2,000%, reaching an all-time high of $3.31 in January 2018. In the subsequent 2020–2021 cycle (Cycle 2), XRP again approached the Chasm trendline, peaking at $1.96 in April 2021. Although this represented a 420% increase from earlier lows, XRP attempted to breach the resistance line but was unsuccessful, leading to a decline shortly after. Current Cycle and Price Projections Now, in what EGRAG refers to as Cycle 3, XRP is positioned for another potential retest of the Chasm line. The analyst outlines two possible scenarios based on historical price behavior. In a conservative outcome, XRP could repeat the 2021 pattern by only reaching the Chasm line without breaching it. This would represent a 420% gain from its recent price levels, resulting in a projected peak of $11. In a more aggressive scenario, XRP could mirror its 2017 breakout by not only reaching but surpassing the Chasm line. If it were to follow a similar 2,000% price rally, EGRAG estimates a potential price of approximately $37 per token. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additional Bullish Perspectives from Chart Nerd Supporting the broader bullish outlook, another market analyst known as Chart Nerd recently suggested that XRP has broken out of a bull flag pattern. In his analysis, XRP is currently targeting $15, with interim price levels to monitor. He places the immediate breakout support around $2.60, indicating that sustained support above this level could lead to a continued move toward $8 and eventually $15 if momentum persists. While XRP continues to consolidate around the $3 range, technical analysts remain focused on long-term resistance levels and historical trends. EGRAG’s Chasm line framework provides a data-driven lens to project possible future price points, ranging from $11 in a limited rally to $37 in an extended breakout. Combined with complementary bullish signals, XRP’s next major moves could be shaped by how it interacts with this historical resistance level.

The dismissal marks the resolution of a lawsuit which was initiated in December 2020 when the SEC accused Ripple that its sales of XRP tokens constituted an unregistered securities offering. Ripple and the SEC move to end litigation According to court documents submitted to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the parties “reached an agreement-in-principle, subject to Commission approval, to resolve the underlying case.” The case had been on appeal after a final order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (No. 20-cv-10832), which gave Ripple a partial win in 2023 by stating that XRP was not a security in secondary market sales. The joint dismissal had signatures from attorneys representing Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, Christian A. Larsen, and the SEC, confirming that Ripple and its executives authorized the agency to file the stipulation with their signatures included. It is a fitting end to a tumultuous lawsuit that has lasted five years and had huge implications on the industry. Now that the appeals have been withdrawn, Ripple is cleared of any further federal litigation linked to XRP’s regulatory status. The decision is expected to influence how other tokens are treated under U.S. securities law, especially as lawmakers continue to hash out crypto regulation frameworks. What’s next for XRP following the dismissal? The conclusion of Ripple’s case with the SEC is bullish news. Following the resolution announcement, the XRP token surged in value, crossing the $3 mark, proof of growing investor optimism. XRP price rallied after news of SEC settlement. Source: Coinmarketcap According to data from Glassnode, over 80% of XRP’s supply is in wallets that have not been touched for over a year, evidence of strong holding conviction. Long-term holders are already in profit, and short-term holders have been cautiously loading up in anticipation of XRP ripping higher. Another possible catalyst for XRP’s great price action movement is the use case that it has in Japan where Aplus, a credit card firm owned by Shinsei Bank, has partnered with SBI VC Trade to allow customers to convert their reward points into XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. The token price is currently hovering around $3.27, but going by the bullish sentiments on X since the end of the SEC’s case against Ripple, XRP may be touching new heights soon.

Waller has met with members of Trump’s team but not the president. Meanwhile. Trump announced his nomination of Stephen Miran, current chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, to replace Adriana Kugler on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.

Which Crypto Is Best to Buy This Month?,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/solana-or-xrp-which-crypto-is-best-to-buy-this-month/,"Crypto investors are watching closely as two major players regain focus. Solana (SOL) stands out for its ultra-fast transactions, affordability, and thriving DeFi and NFT ecosystem. Meanwhile, XRP remains a go-to for institutional-grade cross-border payments, backed by real-world partnerships and growing adoption, despite past regulatory overhang . Yet, amid the buzz around these established tokens, a fresh opportunity is gaining serious analyst support. MAGACOIN FINANCE, fully audited and backed by an expanding investor community, is emerging as a top altcoin to buy now . Solana (SOL) – Performance Meets Innovation Solana’s network can handle thousands of transactions per second at a fraction of the cost, making it a favorite among developers and DeFi users alike. Forbes reports that SOL has delivered massive returns since launch, and the platform continues to attract both retail and institutional app builders. It’s fast, scalable, and has cemented its place in the smart contract arms race. Still, the question remains whether most of Solana’s gains have already occurred. Without new catalysts—such as blockbuster app launches or protocol upgrades, the token may face consolidation as speculative interest cools. XRP – Utility and Institution-Friendly Momentum XRP’s appeal lies in its utility: it’s built for fast, low-cost settlements between financial institutions. Many analysts see this as a real advantage over speculative tokens. According to Forbes, XRP has gained substantial value over the years, solidifying its spot among the top cryptos for long-term investors. Its infrastructure and partnerships give it credibility many altcoins lack. That said, XRP’s future depends heavily on adoption and continued regulatory clarity. Much of its upward trajectory hinges on renewed global usage, a pace often slower and steadier than the rapid flips seen in more speculative markets. MAGACOIN FINANCE Offers Audited Security and Community-Driven Momentum While Solana and XRP both hold appeal, analysts are increasingly turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE as a new gem . This project has earned its credibility through a fully audited codebase , a clear roadmap, and growing investor interest writing on forums and social channels. That foundational trust, combined with rounds selling out in minutes , makes it a rare example of early – stage entry with structural integrity. In trending markets, newer coins that build trust and community often outperform older, acknowledged assets. Analysts predict MAGACOIN FINANCE could return exponentially more compared to tokens like SOL or XRP in a fast-moving bull run. With exchange listings approaching, the project’s timing and promise make it a favored option for traders seeking momentum without sacrificing credibility. Why Early-Stage Still Beats Big-Cap Momentum While Solana and XRP offer stability and proven narratives, their price actions are increasingly tied to macro headwinds or sector-wide events. In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still largely uncorrelated – offering a rare chance at fresh entry before broader crypto investors arrive. Its combination of security, community, and presale scarcity gives it a workflow similar to early Avalanche or Polygon – both of which surged dramatically once awareness hit. Now, analysts see a comparable setup unfolding in the early stages of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion If you want a reliable bunker for crypto exposure, SOL and XRP both make compelling cases: one for innovation, the other for utility. But if you’re tracking the next breakout – the altcoin that could rally sharply after exchange listings – MAGACOIN FINANCE is earning attention as a smarter speculative entry. With its transparent credentials and growing base, it’s one of the most talked-about picks right now among traders who believe the next major rally starts before the crowd catches on .

This milestone, shared by blockchain analytics platform Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock), underscores just how central stablecoins have become to global crypto flows in 2025. Dominated by Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), this explosive surge in activity paints a picture of growing reliance on stable digital assets not only by retail investors but also by institutions seeking seamless liquidity, cross-border settlement, and DeFi utility. Analysts say this momentum is fueling what many are calling “Stablecoin Summer” – a wave of capital inflows and integration deals that’s reshaping how value moves across chains. For new investors scanning the market for smart entry points, these dynamics are reinforcing the need to find opportunities before they become saturated. That’s exactly why interest is surging toward early-stage crypto launches offering strategic incentives – such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, currently in presale with a 50% bonus code active for a limited time. USDT and USDC cement market dominance According to Sentora’s August 5 report, USDT remains the undisputed king, processing over $1.6 trillion in cumulative monthly volume. USDC holds firm in second place, with its usage rising steadily across Ethereum, Solana, and newer blockchains like Base and Blast. Smaller stablecoins are also getting traction. DAI, FDUSD, and PYUSD posted sizable growth, hinting at increased experimentation and utility diversification among users. Even niche assets like GUSD, FRAX, and TUSD recorded measurable volumes, further illustrating the space’s fragmentation and evolution. Regulation fuels confidence One of the most significant tailwinds behind this growth is regulatory clarity. The GENIUS Act, signed into US law on July 19, lays out clear federal guidelines for stablecoins and digital asset-backed financial products. The legislation includes reserve mandates and oversight mechanisms from the Federal Reserve – factors that are making stablecoins more palatable for traditional finance players. Combined with Europe’s MiCA framework, the clarity is opening the door for deeper institutional involvement in on-chain transactions, from tokenized bonds to real-time remittances. In effect, stablecoins are no longer fringe – they’re becoming financial infrastructure. For early investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a strategic edge As capital flows increasingly favor stable platforms and secure token infrastructures, one presale is catching serious attention: MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project is offering new investors an exclusive 50% bonus with the code EXTRA50X, a move analysts say reflects growing urgency as supply tightens ahead of listing. The project has already drawn comparisons to early-stage SHIBA INU and DOGECOIN, not just for its viral potential but also for its commitment to secure infrastructure and strong community growth. Early participants aren’t just betting on hype – they’re positioning ahead of what could be a parabolic launch into major exchanges. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out isn’t just its community engagement. It’s the timing. The presale window is closing fast, and the bonus code gives newcomers a rare chance to maximize their allocation before broader market access and exchange-driven volatility set in. For those who missed out on early-stage Avalanche or ADA, this could be a second chance. Stablecoin utility is expanding fast Outside of trading volume alone, stablecoins are increasingly the glue holding DeFi and cross-chain apps together. From yield farming to NFT marketplaces, from on-chain payroll to Layer-1 bridge liquidity, the use cases keep growing. Institutions, fintech startups, and payment providers are all integrating stablecoin rails to reduce costs and increase speed. And as users become more comfortable with using digital dollars, the barrier to entry for altcoins with smart distribution models like MAGACOIN FINANCE also drops. Conclusion Stablecoins are no longer just a place to park capital—they’re powering a financial revolution. And with $1.5 trillion in monthly activity, that revolution is moving fast. But while the top stablecoins cement their place, the real alpha lies in emerging assets. MAGACOIN FINANCE is grabbing headlines not just for its infrastructure, but for the rare opportunity it offers: early access and bonus rewards. As legacy assets mature, many investors are shifting toward undervalued, secure, and community-backed presales – and MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading that pack.

New SEC filings show Buffett’s short-term Treasury bill holdings declined by $42.867 billion at the close of the second quarter of the year when compared to December 2024, with total holdings of T-bills now at $243.605 billion. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway purchased 5,030,425 more shares of Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI) last month at around $21 per share, bringing its total holdings of SIRI to 124,807,117 shares. SIRI is trading for $20.97 per share at the close of the market on Wednesday. Also last month, Berkshire Hathaway dumped nearly $1.23 billion worth of shares in the domain name giant Verisign. Verisign announced the Omaha-based investment giant would sell 4,300,000 shares of the company’s common stock to the public for $285 per share. The sell-off materialized after Buffett’s firm acquired multiple new stocks in the first quarter of 2025. Filings with the SEC earlier this year showed Berkshire added 865,311 shares of the swimming pool supply giant POOLCORP (POOL) for nearly $262 million in Q1. The firm purchased an additional 6,384,676 shares of the alcohol producer Constellation Brands (STZ) for nearly $961 million and it acquired 238,613 new shares of Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) worth approximately $204 million. Berkshire also bought 112,401 new shares of Heico Corporation (HEI), an aerospace and electronics firm, worth nearly $50 million in Q1.

49717477,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=800645,1754611206,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/49717477.jpeg,Bitcoin Faces A Black Swan — Bitwise Sounds The Alarm,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-faces-a-black-swan-bitwise/,"Last Friday’s US July Employment Situation release has delivered the kind of statistical jolt that rarely shows up outside crises, forcing traders to re-evaluate both the macro outlook and Bitcoin’s near-term path. Payrolls grew by just 73,000, but the shock lay in the record-large negative revisions: May and June were marked down by a combined 258,000 jobs, slicing the three-month hiring average to 35,000 and erasing nearly all of the second-quarter’s reported momentum. The Bureau of Labor Statistics notes that revisions of that magnitude have been seen only during the Covid collapse. Is Bitcoin Really Facing A Black Swan Event? Bloomberg Economics chief US economist Anna Wong wrote: “The downward revisions to May and June payrolls in the July jobs report constitute a black swan event – a three-standard-deviation move with less than a 0.2% chance of occurrence in the last 30 years. Adjusted for our estimate of the job overstatement from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ birth-death model, the three-month hiring pace turns outright negative.” The data, she wrote in a terminal note circulated Friday, “flipped the labor-market script” from re-acceleration to abrupt cooling. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could See Another Crash To Fill This Imbalance Before Rally To $120,000 The market’s crypto voice on the issue has been Bitwise Europe’s head of research, André Dragosch, who spent the morning posting a string of warnings on X. First came the news, ”According to Bloomberg chief economist Anna Wong, the most recent payroll revisions were a ‘black swan event’.Will probably get even worse before it gets better…”, then the maxim, “Yes – bad for payrolls = good for bitcoin, at least over the medium to long term.” Minutes later he argued that deeper revisions could force emergency easing: “NOTE: There is a strong case for a negative June jobs print after further downside revisions which could lead to a 50 bps rate cut in September… Plan accordingly. #Bitcoin” By mid-afternoon he pushed the point to its logical extreme: “ATTENTION: We are probably just a single negative NFP print away from a significant repricing in Fed rate cut expectations. US labor market & inflation data surprises are still as bad as during Covid but traders only price in 2 cuts until Dec 2025… Printer is coming… ” Interest-rate futures moved sharply in Dragosch’s direction. On Wednesdays, the CME FedWatch Tool showed a 91 percent probability of at least one cut at the 17–18 September FOMC meeting. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari acknowledged that “the real underlying economy is slowing,” while Governor Lisa Cook called the size of the revisions “concerning.” Related Reading: US Delay On Bitcoin Audit Is A Bullish Red Flag, Says Strike CEO Bitcoin’s price action captured the tug-of-war between recession fear and liquidity hope. The flagship cryptocurrency slumped to $111,920 on 2 August, its lowest print since early July, immediately after the payroll release and President Donald Trump’s subsequent firing of BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. A tentative rebound toward $111,500 followed as rate-cut odds ballooned this week. Yet, Bitcoin remained tethered to macro headlines rather than its own cycle. Still, the first clear sign of positioning for easier policy has emerged in fund flows. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net $91.6 million inflow on 7 August, snapping a four-day outflow streak that had drained more than $380 million from the vehicles. Whether Bloomberg’s and Dragosch’s black-swan framing proves prescient will depend on the next few data prints and the Fed’s tolerance for risk. For now the market is caught between those poles: one bad jobs number away from a full-blown policy response, but one more shock away from a broader risk-off spiral. The only certainty, as Wong’s probability math and Dragosch’s full-throated alerts both imply, is that the margin for error has evaporated. At press time, BTC traded at $116,359.

49717482,550290,1754611219,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49717482.jpeg,"Bitcoin Price Down, But Hashrate Sets New All-Time High",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-down-but-hashrate-new-all-time-high/,"Bitcoin miners have taken the 7-day average Hashrate to a new all-time high (ATH), despite the fact that the token’s price has been down recently. Bitcoin Hashrate Has Just Set A New Record The Bitcoin “ Hashrate ” refers to the collective amount of computing power that the miners as a whole have connected to the blockchain. Miners use their computing resources to compete against each other, so this power never actually works as a collective, but the Hashrate is nonetheless a useful metric as it provides insight into the sentiment among the chain validators. When the value of the metric rises, it means new miners are joining the network and/or existing ones are expanding their facilities. Such a trend implies BTC mining is looking lucrative to this group. On the other hand, the indicator observing a decline suggests some of the miners have decided to disconnect their machines from the blockchain, a potential sign that profitability is going down. Now, here is a chart from Blockchain.com that shows how the 7-day average value of the Bitcoin Hashrate has changed during the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day average Bitcoin Hashrate fell to a low of 889 exahashes per second (EH/s) on August 3rd, but since then, the metric has seen a sharp jump that has taken its value to 952.5 EH/s. The low in the metric coincided with the price plunge to $112,000 for the asset. This trend wasn’t anything unusual, as miner revenue is correlated to the cryptocurrency’s value. Miners earn the major part of their income through the block subsidy , which is denominated in BTC. Moves up and down in the coin’s exchange rate, therefore, directly impact the USD value of their rewards. Interestingly, the rebound in the Hashrate to the new ATH has come despite the fact that Bitcoin has been unable to make a recovery from its earlier price plunge. Miners sometimes expand in anticipation of future action, so the new power that has just come into the network could be a sign that miners are hoping bullish winds will return for BTC. Only time will tell, though, whether this bet will work out. The latest jump in the 7-day average Bitcoin Hashrate has meant that its value has broken the previous record of 943.6 EH/s set back in June. A consequence of this ATH in miners’ computing power is that the Difficulty is also set to see an adjustment to a new high. The “Difficulty” is a feature on the BTC blockchain that controls how hard miners would find it to perform their duty. It exists to limit how fast miners can solve blocks and earn the block reward. Increases in Hashrate speed up the miners, so the network responds by upping its Difficulty just enough to bring them back to the standard pace. The next automatic network adjustment is estimated to occur on Friday and will take the metric’s value to a new ATH of 129.13 terahashes, according to data from CoinWarz . BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $116,300, up more than 2% over the last 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin All-Time High|bitcoin hashrate|bitcoin price|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-08 00:00:19

With 200,000+ holders, 2.5 million global users via its mobile mining app, and 19,000+ ASIC miners already sold, BlockDAG is achieving in months what most Layer 1 projects take years to build, and it’s doing it before public trading even begins. As the GLOBAL LAUNCH release nears on August 11, this rapid ecosystem growth is catching attention beyond retail buyers. Developers, miners, and even institutional observers are watching closely. With more than $364.5 million already raised in presale and a $600 million goal in sight, BlockDAG’s progress is being driven by working products, expanding user participation, and technology that’s already operational, not just planned for the future. An Active Community Driving Early Growth BlockDAG’s 200,000+ holders aren’t just watching, they’re using. Many are deeply involved through the X1 mobile miner app , which has reached 2.5 million users worldwide in just a short time. This app, available across markets, allows users to simulate daily BDAG mining, building habits and increasing exposure to BlockDAG’s mission as a high-speed, decentralized Layer 1 platform. But this isn’t just for show. The app offers functional value now and will unlock real benefits after launch. It also leads into the mining ecosystem, where over 19,000 ASIC units have been sold. These devices are part of BlockDAG’s hybrid Proof-of-Work model, providing critical support for decentralization and securing the network at scale. This hands-on involvement is a major factor behind BlockDAG’s viral adoption. Unlike many presales that depend purely on speculative interest, BDAG is gaining real users before launch. That early momentum has helped generate over $364.5 million in presale participation, making it one of the top-performing offerings in the past seven years. How a Growing Ecosystem Supports Future Price Potential BlockDAG’s growth isn’t just in user numbers. Its Demo Trading Platform is already live, giving buyers a chance to purchase BDAG at $0.0016 and practice trading risk-free ahead of the confirmed $0.05 listing. A Cold Wallet is also on the way, providing secure storage and expanding token functionality. Meanwhile, more than 4,500 developers are contributing to over 300 dApps across the network. This expansion is built on solid technical ground. BlockDAG’s hybrid DAG and Proof-of-Work setup has shown throughput of 10 blocks per second in testing and supports between 2,000 and 15,000 TPS, outperforming most current Layer 1s. This infrastructure ensures the network can scale without risking centralization or congestion. These developments are fueling growing speculation that BDAG could reach $1 within its first year of trading. With the current price at $0.0016, this suggests a 625x return for early buyers. Even the confirmed launch price of $0.05 offers a 3025% ROI, a rare figure that’s backed by real-world adoption and live tools. BlockDAG’s presale is about more than buying early, it’s about joining a network that’s already delivering results. With every user, miner, and dApp, the value of the ecosystem increases, encouraging further growth. That cycle is well underway and speeding toward the August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release. A Live Ecosystem Preparing for Public Trading BlockDAG’s platform is no longer a vision, it’s live and growing fast. With 200,000+ holders, millions of users, and live infrastructure in place, the project is shaping up as one of the strongest early crypto platforms this year. The window to buy at $0.0016 is narrowing, and with it, the chance to be part of the next growth phase. For those focused on adoption and utility, not just hype, BlockDAG’s expanding ecosystem shows there’s a lot more ahead, and it’s just getting started.

According to fresh data from Glassnode, long-term TRX holders have booked over $1.4 billion in realized profits in a single day, the second-highest daily figure of 2025. What’s more, daily profits have remained close to $1 billion for several days straight, signaling a calculated cash-out phase by seasoned holders. Many of these exits trace back to the 2020–2021 cycle. These aren’t fluke trades or panic sales. They’re strategic exits from early investors, who are taking advantage of favorable prices and booking hefty gains while keeping TRX’s price steady around $0.33. This quiet profit-taking wave stands in contrast to the sharp, panic-driven dumps typical of crypto downturns. New Project Earns Investor Trust with Top Ratings While some early TRX investors are cashing out, others are redirecting their capital into promising new opportunities—MAGACOIN FINANCE chief among them. This rising project has been gaining serious momentum, not just for its growth potential, but for its credibility. Backed by top-tier security audits and a rapidly expanding holder base, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing comparisons to early-stage breakout tokens. Its community has grown over 10x in the past few weeks, and analysts point out the project’s low entry price and unique tokenomics could set the stage for significant ROI . For those watching the smart money flow, MAGACOIN’s traction is hard to ignore. Tron Outlook: Stability or Slip? With early holders stepping aside, Tron now faces a delicate balancing act. If new investors absorb the selling pressure, TRX could maintain its price levels and possibly trend higher. But if buying slows while exits continue, a dip may be on the horizon. What’s important is that these aren’t desperation moves—TRX’s long-term holders are simply rotating profits. And as new narratives take shape across the altcoin market, many of them are choosing to back fresh projects with better upside—projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion Tron’s recent surge in realized profits shows that early holders are finally cashing out after years of waiting. This isn’t a market crash—it’s a reshuffling of capital. And as whales move on, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a top choice , armed with security credentials, rapid growth, and bullish investor momentum.

Uniswap’s recent dip has left traders wondering whether it signals a broader shift or just a temporary pause. Meanwhile, Ethereum price prediction models are growing more aggressive, fueled by institutional flows and ETF activity. But Cold Wallet ($CWT) takes a different approach. It already delivers cashback rewards for swaps, gas fees, and on-ramp activity, making it one of the few projects offering tangible utility before launch. Its $270 million Plus Wallet acquisition brought in over 2 million users, proving that traction is not theoretical. Now listed on CoinMarketCap, Cold Wallet ($CWT) is no longer just a promising idea. With the token still in presale, its price sits far below its confirmed listing value. That combination of live product, user growth, and structural upside positions it as the best crypto for payments heading into 2025. Uniswap’s Dip Could Open’s Door to Stronger Upside Push Uniswap’s recent 6% decline from $11.19 to $10.36 surprised some traders, but it appears to be more of a breather than a breakdown. The broader trend still leans bullish, with UNI comfortably trading above its 200-day simple moving average of $7.79 and an RSI of 61.45 suggesting balanced momentum. Trading volume remains robust at over $77 million, a sign of continued engagement rather than fear. Support sits around $10.30, and resistance is near $11.60. If UNI holds $10.60, a renewed push upward is possible. This pullback may ultimately serve as the launchpad for a stronger advance. Ethereum Builds Toward $6K Target as Accumulation Accelerates Ethereum’s technical and on-chain signals are aligning for a major leg up. Institutions are moving ETH into cold storage, reducing exchange supply, while staking activity continues to lock more tokens away. These trends suggest long-term commitment and reduced sell pressure across the board. Forecasts now extend beyond $4,500, with some analysts pointing toward $6,000 to $8,500 targets by 2025. Technical charts show resistance clusters near breakout zones, and whale accumulation confirms growing confidence. Ethereum is no longer just building momentum; it is building structure for the next wave of upside. Cold Wallet Presale Steps Into Spotlight as Real Utility Meets Global Visibility Presales often generate noise without delivering substance, but Cold Wallet is flipping that pattern. Its CoinMarketCap listing has brought serious visibility, transforming it from a niche project to one gaining attention from analysts and global trading communities. With a working cashback system already live, Cold Wallet rewards users for gas fees, crypto swaps , and even on-ramp or off-ramp activity, turning everyday crypto transactions into tangible returns. This is not just future-facing talk. Cold Wallet recently finalized a $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet, immediately integrating more than 2 million users. The wallet’s reward structure is already functioning, allowing users to earn Cold Wallet Token (CWT) directly through blockchain activity. That core mechanic has helped shift perception, placing Cold Wallet on a growing list of serious contenders in the utility token space. Now in stage 16, the project has raised over $5.7 million, yet the token is priced at just $0.00942. With a confirmed launch price of $0.3517, this represents a 36x gap on paper. Some analysts suggest the true potential could be closer to 1000x, especially if Cold Wallet’s cashback system gains traction across the global crypto user base. In a market filled with speculation, Cold Wallet is offering functionality and scale. The timing of its CoinMarketCap debut aligns with rising adoption and working mechanics. That mix of momentum, utility, and exposure is placing Cold Wallet on watchlists as the next major breakout in crypto payments. Key Takeaways Uniswap’s price swings and Ethereum’s forecasts continue to depend on market sentiment and institutional trends. Cold Wallet is taking a different route by building real systems with measurable utility. Its cashback feature is already live, its $270 million Plus Wallet acquisition has added over 2 million users, and its CoinMarketCap listing now positions it on the global stage.

49717544,https://timestabloid.com/?p=77316,1754611254,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Shiba Inu (SHIB) Potential Price In a $45B Market Cap Scenario,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-shib-potential-price-in-a-45b-market-cap-scenario/,"Shiba Inu has recently seen a decline in price and market position, falling to the 22nd largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Currently, SHIB’s market valuation stands at around $7.3 billion, following a 1.58% decline over the past week and a 20% drop over the last two weeks. This performance reflects a broader trend across the crypto market, with Bitcoin also down 1.24% in the same seven-day period and XRP struggling to stay above the $3 level. Analyst Projects SHIB to Hit $45B Market Cap Despite recent setbacks, some market observers maintain a bullish outlook for SHIB. Prominent crypto influencer Jake Gagain recently projected that Shiba Inu could achieve a $45 billion market capitalization before the end of 2025. This estimate, if realized, would represent the highest valuation in the asset’s history. My 2025 Price Predictions: $DOGE : $87 Billion MC $SHIB : $45 Billion MC $PEPE : $32 Billion MC $PENGU : $25 Billion MC $BONK : $18 Billion MC $BRETT : $12.5 Billion MC $TRUMP : $9 Billion MC $SPX : Flips The Stock Market $WIF : ZERO — JAKE (@JakeGagain) August 6, 2025 Previously, Shiba Inu reached its peak market value of $39.3 billion in October 2021, temporarily surpassing Dogecoin. However, it did not exceed the $45 billion mark at any point . Gagain’s projection would therefore establish a new all-time high, implying an increase of $37.7 billion, or approximately 516%, from SHIB’s current market value. Price Estimation Based on $45B Market Cap Scenario At the time of writing, SHIB is priced at $0.00001262 , with a circulating supply of around 589.24 trillion tokens. If the market cap increases to $45 billion, the price would rise proportionally to approximately $0.00007636. This prediction implies a 516% surge from current levels, bringing it near the asset’s all-time high of $0.00008845, set in late 2021. Moreover, if the projected price is measured against SHIB’s recent low of $0.00001004 observed in June, it reflects an even more pronounced appreciation of approximately 660%. This projection is consistent with another forecast by analyst Hunters Company, who suggested that SHIB could approach $0.000070 after rebounding from a critical support zone, as highlighted in his TradingView analysis. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Capitalization Forecasts for Other Meme Coins In addition to SHIB, Jake Gagain also shared his end-of-2025 projections for other meme-related cryptocurrencies. He expects Dogecoin to reach an $87 billion valuation, followed by PEPE at $32 billion and PENGU at $25 billion. BONK is forecasted to rise to $18 billion, while BRETT could grow to $12.5 billion. Gagain also noted a bullish view on SPX, suggesting it could outperform traditional equities. However, he expressed a bearish outlook on WIF, predicting that its value would decline to zero. While Shiba Inu is currently facing market headwinds, long-term forecasts remain optimistic among certain analysts. If SHIB reaches the projected $45 billion market cap, it would not only establish a new record but also restore prices near their previous all-time highs. These forecasts reflect growing confidence in the asset’s potential to regain momentum as market conditions improve.

Trump’s administration is following through with its promises to safeguard free expression, economic participation, and fairness in the U.S. financial system . President Trump signs executive order to end politicized debanking President Donald J. Trump has signed a sweeping executive order prohibiting banks and federal regulators from denying financial services to Americans based on political beliefs, religious affiliations, or lawful business activities. The order, titled “Guaranteeing Fair Banking for All Americans,” directs federal banking regulators to eliminate guidelines and practices that facilitate what it calls “politicized or unlawful debanking.” The policy also targets the removal of the widely criticized “reputational risk” as a factor in bank decision-making. The administration describes these guidelines as systemic abuses by financial institutions and regulators that have, in some cases, frozen payrolls, denied account openings, or refused payment processing to lawful individuals and businesses. The White House fact shee t noted several examples of such cases including a major banking institution that denied ticket-payment processing for a Republican event and only reversed its decision after receiving backlash, federal regulators encouraging banks to flag individuals for transactions with companies like Bass Pro Shop or Cabela’s, or for using terms such as “Trump” or “MAGA” in payment descriptions without any evidence of criminal activity. Two major banks also allegedly denied services to Trump’s own business. “The banks discriminate against conservatives, they discriminate against religion, because they’re afraid of the radical left, I suspect,” Trump said. “Nobody knows the banking industry better than me, and I’m not going to let them take advantage of you any longer.” The executive order requires federal regulators to remove all language in their guidance and examination materials that supports politicized or unlawful debanking. It instructs regulators to review financial institutions for current or past policies encouraging such practices and take remedial actions, including fines or consent decrees. Cases of unlawful debanking based on religion are to be reported to the Attorney General. The order instructs the Small Business Administration to push financial institutions under its jurisdiction to reinstate clients previously denied services for these reasons. Finally, it states that federal regulators should develop a comprehensive strategy to prevent such practices in the future, including potential legislative solutions. The White House said the order also addresses issues raised during a Senate Banking Committee hearing earlier this year, where witnesses testified about being “debanked” for political or ideological reasons. Trump opens retirement vehicles to crypto Trump signed a second order , this one titled “Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors,” which will allow more than 90 million American private-sector workers to invest in alternative assets, including digital assets, that have previously been available mainly to government employees and certain institutional investors. Under the current system, many private sector workers with 401(k) accounts have access only to a limited selection of mutual funds and traditional investments. According to Trump’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, who praised the announcement on social media platform X, the change will “allow more than 90 million American workers… to access the same range of alternative assets… that are available to government workers, for better returns and diversification.” The White House said this move is designed to “level the playing field” between private and public sector workers and offer Americans more tools to achieve long-term financial security. Digital asset advocates see the policy as a major win for the cryptocurrency industry, which has often struggled with access to traditional banking services. Within the cryptocurrency community, Trump’s orders are being viewed as a means to dismantle structural barriers that have hindered innovation and financial participation. “No American should be denied access to financial services because of their political or religious beliefs,” the fact sheet states, adding that investment opportunities should not be “limited by outdated rules or unfair restrictions.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Imagine a scenario where a significant portion of your retirement savings, specifically your 401(k), finds its way into the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. This isn’t just speculation; the potential for substantial crypto retirement funds flowing into the market is becoming a tangible reality. The Astonishing Potential of Crypto Retirement Funds Recent analysis paints a compelling picture of the massive influx that could occur. Ryan Rasmussen, a research analyst at crypto asset fund manager Bitwise, highlighted on X (formerly Twitter) that U.S. 401(k) plans currently hold a staggering $8 trillion in assets as of September 2024. New capital continuously flows into these plans each week. Consider this: If just 1% of these existing assets were allocated to crypto, it would inject an impressive $80 billion into the digital asset market. Furthermore, this would establish a steady, ongoing flow of new capital, deepening the market’s liquidity. Bloomberg’s more optimistic estimate places the 401(k) market at an even larger $12.5 trillion, which would translate to a monumental $125 billion inflow if just 1% was invested. This illustrates the sheer scale of potential crypto retirement funds . Why is 401k Crypto Investment Now Possible? This significant shift isn’t accidental; it’s backed by crucial policy changes. A pivotal development occurred when former U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order. This order specifically allowed 401(k) retirement plans to explore investments in alternative assets. What are alternative assets? They include diverse options such as real estate, private equity, and, importantly, cryptocurrencies. This executive action opened a new pathway for traditional retirement vehicles to consider what was once seen as a niche or speculative asset class. The move signaled a growing recognition of digital assets within mainstream finance, paving the way for increased 401k crypto investment opportunities and broader acceptance. This growing acceptance underscores the potential for future growth in the sector. What Are the Benefits of Retirement Crypto for Investors? For individuals looking at their long-term financial health, including crypto in a retirement portfolio offers several compelling advantages. Diversification is a primary benefit, as cryptocurrencies often move independently of traditional markets, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Potential for Growth: Historically, some cryptocurrencies have shown significant growth potential, offering a different return profile than stocks or bonds. Inflation Hedge: Certain digital assets are viewed by some as a potential hedge against inflation, preserving purchasing power over time. While the allure of high returns is strong, it is crucial for individuals to conduct thorough research and consider their risk tolerance. Consulting a qualified financial advisor before making any retirement crypto decisions is always recommended to ensure alignment with personal financial goals and to understand the nuances of retirement crypto strategies. Navigating Challenges in Institutional Crypto Adoption Despite the immense potential, the path to widespread institutional crypto adoption is not without its hurdles. Volatility remains a key concern for many traditional investors. The crypto market can experience rapid price swings, which may not align with the conservative nature of typical retirement portfolios. Regulatory clarity is another ongoing challenge. While progress has been made, a comprehensive and consistent regulatory framework is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Investor education is vital. Many individuals are unfamiliar with the technical aspects and inherent risks associated with digital assets. However, the presence of specialized crypto asset fund managers like Bitwise helps bridge this gap, offering structured products and expert analysis to facilitate safer institutional engagement and responsible digital asset investment . This ongoing push for institutional crypto adoption is a positive sign for market maturity. The Broader Impact of Digital Asset Investment The potential inflow of billions from 401(k)s into the crypto market signifies more than just new capital. It represents a profound shift towards mainstream acceptance and maturation of the entire digital asset ecosystem. This increased interest in digital asset investment signals a growing confidence in the long-term viability of cryptocurrencies. Increased investment from retirement funds could lead to greater market stability and liquidity, benefiting all participants. It also signals a vote of confidence from a traditionally conservative investment sector, potentially encouraging further innovation and development within the crypto space. This expanding landscape of digital asset investment underscores a future where cryptocurrencies play an increasingly integral role in diverse financial portfolios, including those built for long-term retirement planning. The future of 401k crypto investment looks promising. The prospect of tens of billions of dollars flowing from U.S. retirement funds into cryptocurrencies is a powerful indicator of the evolving financial landscape. Fueled by policy changes and growing interest, the integration of crypto retirement funds into mainstream investment strategies holds immense potential for both individual investors and the broader digital asset market. While challenges exist, the trajectory points towards a future where digital assets are a recognized component of a diversified retirement portfolio. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can all 401(k) plans invest in crypto? A1: No, not all 401(k) plans currently offer direct crypto investment options. The executive order opened the door, but individual plan administrators must still decide to include alternative assets like crypto. Q2: What are the main risks of investing retirement funds in crypto? A2: Key risks include high market volatility, potential regulatory changes, security concerns (e.g., hacks), and the complex nature of digital assets. It’s crucial to understand these risks before any 401k crypto investment . Q3: How much of my 401(k) should I allocate to crypto? A3: There is no universal answer, as it depends on individual risk tolerance, financial goals, and overall portfolio diversification. Financial advisors often suggest a small percentage (e.g., 1-5%) for highly speculative assets within a well-diversified portfolio. Q4: Is there a specific type of crypto that 401(k) plans can invest in? A4: Typically, if a 401(k) plan offers crypto exposure, it’s often through a fund or trust that holds established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), rather than direct individual coin purchases. This approach is part of the broader trend of institutional crypto adoption . Q5: What role do crypto asset fund managers play? A5: Crypto asset fund managers, like Bitwise, create regulated investment vehicles that allow traditional investors and retirement plans to gain exposure to digital assets. They manage the complexities of custody, security, and market analysis on behalf of their clients, facilitating digital asset investment .

A recent notable development involves Jack Dorsey’s payment company, Block (formerly Square), which has significantly boosted its Block Bitcoin holdings . This move underscores a growing trend of institutional confidence in digital assets, particularly Bitcoin. Why Are Block Bitcoin Holdings Significant? Block’s latest increase in its Block Bitcoin holdings highlights a deliberate and consistent approach to integrating Bitcoin into its corporate treasury. In the second quarter, the company added another 108 BTC, pushing its total reserves to an impressive 8,692 BTC. This steady accumulation is not merely an investment; it reflects a broader commitment to Bitcoin as a foundational technology and a strategic asset. For years, Block, under the leadership of Bitcoin advocate Jack Dorsey, has been at the forefront of crypto innovation. Their dedication extends beyond simply holding Bitcoin; they actively invest in its ecosystem. This includes initiatives like Bitcoin development, mining, and fostering greater accessibility through their Cash App. A Closer Look at Block’s Strategic BTC Acquisition The data regarding Block’s recent BTC acquisition comes from crypto investor HODL15Capital, shared via X (formerly Twitter). This consistent accumulation strategy positions Block among the leading public companies with substantial Bitcoin reserves. It demonstrates a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and its potential as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. This crypto strategy is multifaceted. Beyond direct investment, Block aims to make Bitcoin more usable and accessible for everyday transactions. Their ongoing projects, like the TBD division, focus on decentralized financial services built on Bitcoin. This integrated approach suggests that their Bitcoin holdings are not just passive investments but integral to their future business models. The Broader Impact of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Block is not alone in embracing corporate Bitcoin . Many public companies, including MicroStrategy and Tesla, have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This trend signifies a maturing market where digital assets are gaining legitimacy as viable treasury alternatives. Companies often cite reasons such as diversification, inflation hedging, and the potential for capital appreciation. However, challenges exist. Bitcoin’s price volatility can impact corporate balance sheets, and the regulatory landscape remains fluid. Despite these hurdles, the growing number of companies like Block adopting corporate Bitcoin suggests a fundamental shift in how businesses view and utilize digital assets. It builds trust and paves the way for wider mainstream acceptance. What Does This Mean for Jack Dorsey’s Block and the Future? The vision of Jack Dorsey Block is clear: to build an open financial system for everyone, with Bitcoin at its core. Their increasing Block Bitcoin holdings reinforce this mission. This commitment could inspire other corporations to explore similar strategies, further accelerating institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. For investors and enthusiasts, observing Block’s consistent Bitcoin accumulation provides valuable insight. It signals a strong conviction from a major tech company regarding Bitcoin’s future. As Block continues to innovate within the Bitcoin ecosystem, its strategic moves will likely influence broader market trends and the ongoing evolution of financial technology.

This significant rise firmly places the market in the “Greed” zone, signaling a strong shift in positive crypto market sentiment among participants. What does this mean for your investment strategy, and how can you interpret this crucial market indicator ? What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reveal? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by the software development platform Alternative, offers a powerful snapshot of investor sentiment in the dynamic cryptocurrency market . It simplifies complex market data into a single, understandable number from 0 to 100. 0 (Extreme Fear): Investors are overly worried, potentially leading to panic selling. This can present buying opportunities. 100 (Extreme Greed): Indicates the market might be due for a correction, as prices could be overinflated by irrational exuberance. As of August 8th, the index stood at 74, a substantial 12-point jump from the previous day. This upward movement clearly reflects an improving mood across the crypto space, indicating growing confidence. Key Factors Driving This Market Indicator Understanding how the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is calculated enhances its reliability. It aggregates data from several critical sources, providing a holistic view of the cryptocurrency market ‘s emotional state. Six primary factors are considered: Volatility (25%): Measures Bitcoin’s current volatility and maximum drawdowns. Higher volatility often signals fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Analyzes current volume and momentum. High buying volume on positive days suggests greed. Social Media (15%): Scans social media for crypto-related hashtags, measuring sentiment and engagement. Surveys (15%): Polls investors directly. (Currently paused.) Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Tracks Bitcoin’s share of total crypto market capitalization. Rising dominance can indicate fear or strong Bitcoin bull run. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google search data for crypto terms, looking for spikes in fear-related or greed-related searches. By combining these diverse data points, the index offers a comprehensive, data-driven perspective on prevailing investor sentiment . Navigating the “Greed” Zone: Implications for Your Portfolio The index’s current position at 74 firmly places it in “Greed” territory. While exciting, it demands a balanced perspective. High greed levels can be a double-edged sword: Potential for Further Gains: Strong crypto market sentiment often fuels upward price movements as more capital flows in. Risk of Correction: Historically, extreme greed can precede market corrections. Widespread optimism might lead to profit-taking. Savvy investors often use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as a contrarian indicator. When it’s in “Extreme Fear,” some see it as a buying opportunity. Conversely, “Extreme Greed” might signal caution or time to consider taking profits. It’s one of many valuable market indicators to consider. Leveraging This Market Indicator Effectively The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool, but most effective when integrated into a broader investment strategy. It helps you understand the prevailing emotional climate, vital in volatile markets like cryptocurrency. Actionable Insights: Gauge Market Psychology: Use the index to discern if the market is driven by emotion. Avoid FOMO: A high index helps resist buying into hyped assets at inflated prices. Identify Opportunities: A very low index might signal a good time to research and potentially invest in projects you believe in. Complement with Research: Always combine the index’s insights with your own fundamental and technical analysis. Do not rely solely on one market indicator . The current 74 reading suggests a robust and confident cryptocurrency market . However, continuous monitoring of the index, alongside other research, remains key to making informed decisions. Conclusion: Understanding Investor Sentiment is Key The surge of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 74 signifies heightened confidence and positive investor sentiment within the cryptocurrency market . While this “Greed” zone indicates strong momentum, it also reminds prudent investors to stay vigilant. By understanding what this powerful market indicator represents and how its components work, you can better navigate the ups and downs of the crypto world. Remember, informed decisions are always your best asset. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index measure? A1: The Crypto Fear & Greed Index measures the current emotional state of the cryptocurrency market , ranging from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed), by analyzing various market factors. Q2: Why is the index currently in the “Greed” zone?

Q3: How can investors use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A3: Investors can use this market indicator to gauge overall market psychology, avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) during periods of high greed, or identify potential buying opportunities during extreme fear, always complementing it with further research. Q4: Are surveys still a factor in the index calculation?

On this day, a massive volume of Bitcoin options expiry contracts will mature, potentially stirring the waters of the digital asset market. Traders and investors are closely watching as billions of dollars in derivatives prepare for settlement. This event is not just about numbers; it reflects market sentiment and can influence future price movements for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. What Does the Bitcoin Options Expiry Entail? On August 8, at 08:00 UTC, a staggering $4.11 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) options are set to expire. This event, tracked by leading crypto options market data provider Deribit, is a major point of interest for market participants. Options contracts grant holders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price by a specific date. Understanding these mechanics is crucial for anticipating market behavior. Put/Call Ratio: For BTC, the put/call ratio stands at 1.45. A ratio above 1 indicates more put options (bets on price decline) than call options (bets on price increase). This suggests a prevailing bearish sentiment among option holders regarding Bitcoin’s immediate future. Max Pain Price: The max pain price for BTC is currently $116,000. This is the strike price at which the largest number of options contracts will expire worthless, causing maximum financial loss for option holders. While not a definitive price prediction, this level often acts as a magnetic pull for the underlying asset’s price around the expiry time. Such a substantial expiry volume for Bitcoin options expiry could lead to increased volatility, as market makers adjust their hedges and traders manage their positions. How Will Ethereum Options Expiry Compare on August 8? Simultaneously, on the very same day, around $864.16 billion in Ethereum options expiry contracts will also mature. This colossal figure highlights the growing maturity and immense scale of the Ethereum derivatives market. Understanding the dynamics of Ethereum options expiry is equally vital for a holistic market view, especially given its significant valuation. ETH Specifics: Ethereum’s put/call ratio is 1.14, also indicating a slight bearish lean among ETH option holders. The max pain price for ETH is $3,650. This point represents where most ETH options would expire without value for their owners. Market Implications: Such large expiries, especially for both major cryptocurrencies, can lead to increased volatility across the entire crypto options market. Traders often adjust their positions ahead of these events, which can significantly influence spot prices for both BTC and ETH. The sheer scale of these expiries demands attention from all market participants. Why is This Crypto Options Market Event So Important? The sheer volume involved in this upcoming crypto options market expiry means it can significantly impact short-term price action for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Large expiries often lead to increased trading activity as market makers adjust their hedges and traders close or roll over their positions. This creates both opportunities and heightened risk for participants. Volatility Spikes: Expect potential price swings around the expiry time. Market participants might observe increased liquidity or, conversely, rapid price movements if a significant number of options are exercised or allowed to expire. Strategic Positioning: Savvy investors analyze these key metrics, including the max pain price and put/call ratio, derived from Deribit options data . This analysis helps them inform their trading strategies. Understanding these indicators provides valuable insights into the collective sentiment of options traders and can help predict potential market reactions. The August 8 expiry acts as a significant liquidity event, drawing attention to how these derivatives influence the broader market structure. Understanding Max Pain Price and Deribit Options Data Insights Navigating the complexities of options expiry requires careful analysis of available data. While the max pain price offers a theoretical anchor for where the underlying asset might settle, the actual market outcome can deviate based on broader market sentiment and unexpected news. Challenges include predicting how market makers will rebalance their portfolios and the overall direction of the spot market. Data Interpretation: Deribit options data provides crucial transparency into the derivatives landscape. Traders utilize this information to gauge potential support and resistance levels, anticipate market maker behavior, and effectively manage their own risk exposure. This data empowers informed decision-making. Risk Management: For those holding options or planning trades around August 8, it is prudent to review positions carefully. Consider the potential for increased volatility and manage leverage accordingly. Derivatives markets are complex, and understanding these expiry dynamics is a key component of robust risk management. The convergence of these significant expiries on a single day amplifies their potential impact, making diligent preparation paramount. Conclusion: Navigating the August 8 Expiry The August 8 Bitcoin and Ethereum options expiry presents a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. With billions of dollars in contracts maturing, understanding the put/call ratios and max pain prices is essential for all participants. While these events can introduce volatility, they also offer valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements. Staying informed and prepared is key for navigating these significant derivatives milestones successfully. Traders should monitor real-time data and adjust their strategies as needed. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin options expiry? A Bitcoin options expiry is when derivatives contracts, which give the holder the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell BTC at a specific price, reach their maturity date and are settled. What is “max pain price” in crypto options? The max pain price is the strike price at which the largest number of open options contracts will expire worthless, causing maximum financial loss for option holders. It often acts as a magnet for the asset’s price near expiry. How does the put/call ratio indicate market sentiment? A put/call ratio above 1 suggests a bearish sentiment, as there are more put options (bets on price decline) than call options (bets on price increase). Conversely, a ratio below 1 indicates a bullish sentiment. Will the August 8 expiry definitely cause price volatility? While large options expiries often correlate with increased volatility due to hedging and position adjustments, they do not guarantee specific price movements. It is a significant factor to consider, but not a definitive prediction. Where can I find reliable crypto options market data? Leading crypto options exchanges like Deribit provide comprehensive data on options contracts, including expiry dates, strike prices, put/call ratios, and max pain levels.

The company reported revenue of $998 million for the three months ended June 30, ahead of the $976 million analysts had forecast. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.33, below the $0.36 consensus. Monthly active users totaled 578 million globally, and Pinterest said it had 102 million monthly users in the U.S. and Canada — unchanged from the prior quarter. North America remains the source of the vast majority of the company’s revenue. Robert Biggar, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, noted that user numbers are stagnant in all regions except outside the U.S., raising concerns about growth in Pinterest’s most lucrative market. Pinterest sees revenue surge as AI and shopping push pay off Despite the mixed results, Pinterest projected stronger-than-expected revenue for the current quarter, forecasting $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion versus the $1.02 billion analysts expected. The results suggest the company’s advertising business is expanding even as the broader online search landscape adapts to new AI-driven dynamics. Under CEO Bill Ready, Pinterest has focused heavily on shopping and “visual search,” showing posts that make it easier for users to discover and buy products directly within the app. The company has also leaned into AI to sharpen ad targeting and content recommendations — moves that helped drive the revenue beat. Pinterest shares had risen about 35% year-to-date ahead of the report, but the stock has shown large swings around earnings in recent quarters — jumping double digits after upbeat guidance in May and surging following its holiday-quarter results in February. More men are flocking to Pinterest Just days ago, Pinterest released its first-ever trend report, revealing that men now make up more than one-third of its 570 million global active users—over 171 million, most of them Gen Z. These users defy the usual social media stereotypes, with Pinterest noting they “largely reject the toxicity you might find elsewhere online” and prefer authentic, positive engagement. Male users are diving into diverse content—from Pilates and smart parenting to product research and unique travel ideas. To capture even more of this audience, Pinterest has launched a dedicated “Pinterest Man” hub, showcasing trending topics and shoppable styles—a move that could heat up competition with TikTok, whose TikTok Shop is expected to attract 50 million U.S. buyers this year. Wellness is a major draw. Searches for Pilates outfits are up 300%, rock climbing up 115%, and hydration-related terms up 50%. Interest in health boosters like electrolytes and coconut water has climbed 45%. According to GWI, half of Gen Z and millennial men on Pinterest care about their appearance, fueling spikes in grooming and fashion searches. Sea salt spray hair routines are trending, as are skincare practices like microneedling. Men’s facials are up 230%, and male nail art searches have surged 115%. Goth, grunge, and even jorts are making fashion waves. Men are also embracing tech and finance content. Searches for 3D printing designs have skyrocketed over 1,200%, eclipsing the 800% rise in AI video interest and 265% growth in programming tutorials.

This surge comes amid major price swings in Bitcoin and Ethereum, pushing institutional and retail traders to hedge aggressively and speculate on coming market shifts. With altcoin derivatives now representing over 83% of all Binance Futures activity, capital rotation into higher-beta assets appears to be accelerating—further fueling volatility across the board. Daily futures volume peaked at $134 billion and while Bitcoin still anchors the market with $79B in open interest, the broader narrative is shifting. Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and meme coins are dominating the charts—suggesting a growing appetite for leveraged bets as the market braces for another breakout, or breakdown. Bitcoin Eyes $135K While Traders Hedge on Pullbacks Bitcoin (BTC) is currently hovering around $113,000–$115,000 after dipping from a recent local high of $123,000. Analysts attribute this pullback to long-term holders cashing out and short-term capitulation following the initial ETF-driven surge. However, the broader sentiment remains cautiously optimistic. The Fear & Greed Index sits at 60, reflecting moderate bullishness. Technical charts suggest neutral-to-upside potential, with $135,000–$140,000 still in play for year-end targets. Notably, leading voices like Scaramucci and Beard continue to back a $150K–$170K BTC by 2025-end, barring any macroeconomic disruptions. ETF flows remain strong, institutional inflows are stable, and many view the $110K–$115K range as a key accumulation zone. Ethereum Derivatives Pop as Institutions Accumulate Ethereum (ETH) has also seen sharp corrections, currently trading near $3,500 following outflows from ETH-based ETFs and broader market weakness. Yet on-chain data and trading desks point to quiet accumulation by institutional players—particularly in the $3,400–$3,600 range. ETH remains a strategic play. Despite short-term turbulence, traders see a return to $3,800–$4,000 in the near term, with bullish projections calling for $6,000 by late Q3 if momentum continues. Derivatives activity for ETH futures is heating up, echoing early 2021 setups. While meme coins and alt-bets gain traction, ETH is still considered a “liquidity anchor” by major funds. Momentum with Surge in Institutional-Scale Inflows The explosive rise in futures trading isn’t just benefiting BTC and ETH. As traders hunt for the next breakout asset, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a prime candidate. In recent weeks, Top market analysts have list MAGACOIN FINANCE among the best altcoins to buy for long-term gains . Community momentum is rising fast, fueled by utility-first design and viral meme culture. This hybrid appeal—combining fundamentals with meme coin energy—has driven massive whale inflows and community traction. With its current presale model offering scarcity-based access, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining real traction as a strategic bet in a volatile altseason landscape. For traders looking beyond the noise, it’s becoming a serious consideration. Conclusion: Binance Liquidity Signals New Cycle Binance Futures activity is more than just a number—it’s a barometer for risk appetite. And right now, that appetite is returning. Bitcoin and Ethereum remain at the core, but traders are increasingly rotating toward altcoins and derivatives to capture the next big leg of this market cycle. Amid that momentum, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are being watched closely—not just for their community strength, but for the asymmetric upside they may offer in the months ahead.

Currently, a key metric, the Altcoin Season Index , stands at 36. This figure signals a significant period often referred to as Bitcoin Season . This index, tracked by platforms like CoinMarketCap (CMC), provides valuable insight into which segment of the digital asset market is leading the charge. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Tell Us About Bitcoin Season? The Altcoin Season Index is a widely watched metric that helps investors gauge the prevailing sentiment and performance within the cryptocurrency market. When this index registers below 90, it generally indicates that the market is in a Bitcoin Season . This means that Bitcoin (BTC) is outperforming the majority of altcoins over a specific timeframe, typically the last 90 days. A score of 90 or higher suggests an Altcoin Season , where altcoins are performing better than Bitcoin. A score below 90, like the current 36, confirms that Bitcoin is currently dominating the market’s performance. This dominance isn’t just about price appreciation; it often reflects a shift in investor focus and capital allocation. During a Bitcoin Season , capital tends to flow into Bitcoin, often seen as a safer or more stable asset in volatile times, or simply as the primary driver of broader crypto market trends . Why Are We Seeing This Bitcoin Season Dominance? Several factors can contribute to Bitcoin’s renewed dominance and the current Bitcoin Season . Macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and significant institutional interest often play a pivotal role. When global economic uncertainty rises, investors sometimes flock to Bitcoin as a “digital gold,” perceiving it as a hedge against inflation or traditional market instability. Furthermore, major developments specific to Bitcoin, such as halving events, ETF approvals, or significant technological upgrades, can attract substantial capital. This inflow naturally boosts Bitcoin’s performance relative to other digital asset performance , drawing attention and liquidity away from altcoins. It’s a natural ebb and flow within the dynamic crypto ecosystem. Historically, Bitcoin often leads market recoveries or major bull runs, with altcoins typically following later once Bitcoin has established a strong foundation. This pattern reinforces the concept of a Bitcoin Season as a foundational phase. Navigating Your Portfolio During a Bitcoin Season Understanding the implications of a prevailing Bitcoin Season is essential for managing your cryptocurrency portfolio effectively. While altcoins might experience less significant gains or even corrections during this period, it doesn’t mean they are without opportunity. Instead, it encourages a strategic approach. Key considerations for investors: Risk Assessment: Altcoins, especially smaller cap ones, can be more volatile. During a Bitcoin Season , their downside risk might be amplified if Bitcoin experiences a correction. Capital Allocation: Some investors may choose to increase their Bitcoin holdings or convert some altcoin positions into BTC to capitalize on its potential dominance. Research and Patience: This period can be an excellent time to research promising altcoin projects that might perform well once the market shifts back towards an Altcoin Season . Patience is key, as altcoin rallies often follow Bitcoin’s lead. Observing the Altcoin Season Index helps you anticipate these shifts, allowing you to adjust your strategy proactively rather than reactively. What Comes After Bitcoin Season? Preparing for the Next Altcoin Surge While the current Altcoin Season Index points to Bitcoin dominance, the cryptocurrency market is cyclical. A Bitcoin Season often precedes or is intertwined with periods where altcoins eventually catch up or even outperform Bitcoin. This is when an Altcoin Season typically begins, driven by renewed investor confidence and a willingness to explore higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities. To prepare for the eventual shift, keep an eye on: Bitcoin’s Stability: A period of consolidation or steady growth for Bitcoin often signals that capital might soon rotate into altcoins. Emerging Narratives: New technologies, sectors (like DeFi, NFTs, GameFi), or specific project developments can ignite altcoin rallies. Market Sentiment: A general increase in positive sentiment and retail interest can broaden participation beyond just Bitcoin. By staying informed about these crypto market trends and monitoring the Altcoin Season Index , you can position yourself to potentially benefit from future shifts in digital asset performance . In conclusion, the Altcoin Season Index at 36 clearly indicates we are navigating a period of Bitcoin Season . This phase highlights Bitcoin’s current leadership in the broader crypto market trends . While this means altcoins may take a backseat for a while, it also offers a valuable opportunity to reassess portfolios, conduct thorough research, and strategically prepare for the inevitable return of an Altcoin Season . Understanding these market cycles is paramount for long-term success in the dynamic world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Altcoin Season Index?

49719786,550835,1754614806,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49719786.jpeg,Ripple to Acquire Stablecoin Payments Firm Rail for $200 Million,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-stablecoin-payments-firm-rail-200-million/,"Ripple has announced plans to acquire Toronto-based payment infrastructure company Rail in a $200 million deal aimed at strengthening its footprint in the stablecoin sector. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025, subject to regulatory approval. Rail is known for its cross-border payment capabilities using tokenized dollars and is backed by investors including Galaxy Ventures and Accomplice. The move signals Ripple’s intention to scale its stablecoin initiative, RLUSD, at a time when regulatory clarity around stablecoins is increasing in the United States and globally. With the recent enactment of the GENIUS Act and updated guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on stablecoin accounting practices, Ripple’s acquisition appears to be strategically timed to align with new compliance requirements. The comapny’s President Monica Long stated the deal will help broaden RLUSD’s reach as institutions adopt stablecoin-based payment systems. Rail’s Market Position and Ripple’s Expansion Strategy Rail projects that it will manage approximately 10% of the estimated $36 billion global business-to-business (B2B) stablecoin payment volume. By utilizing tokenized US dollars for cross-border transactions, Rail seeks to reduce settlement times from multiple days to just a few hours. Ripple aims to use Rail’s infrastructure to support regulated payment processing in key markets including the US, Canada, and selected emerging economies . The acquisition gives Ripple a customer-facing payments platform at a time when fintech firms and corporations are increasingly exploring compliant digital dollar solutions. According to the company, this will enhance RLUSD’s appeal among institutions seeking transparent and efficient payment rails. The deal also builds on Ripple’s previous acquisition activity, following a $1.25 billion agreement in April to purchase Hidden Road, a multi-asset prime broker focused on liquidity and custody services. Stablecoin Competition and Regulatory Context Ripple’s broader stablecoin strategy includes recent steps such as applying for a US banking license in July and partnering with Bank of New York Mellon for custody services . RLUSD, launched in December 2024, has grown to over $500 million in circulating supply. Despite this growth, the stablecoin market is still largely controlled by Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. Ripple’s recent acquisitions suggest an ambition to position RLUSD as a serious competitor by providing both infrastructure and compliance under one umbrella. The GENIUS Act, signed into law earlier this summer, represents the first federal legislation in the US focused on payment stablecoins. As more institutions enter the space and demand for regulated stablecoins increases , Ripple appears to be preparing for accelerated adoption by enhancing its network capabilities and compliance infrastructure.

49719783,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=800824,1754614809,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/49719783.jpeg,"Bitcoin Investors Turn To ‘Smart DCA’ As Market Trades Below On-Chain Fair Value Of $117,700",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-investors-dca-market-chain-fair-value-117700/,"Following a brief dip to $112,200, Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered slightly, trading around the $116,300 level at the time of writing. While concerns remain about BTC’s inability to decisively break the $120,000 resistance level, on-chain data suggests the asset may be in an accumulation phase – potentially gearing up for its next breakout toward a new all-time high (ATH). Bitcoin Currently In Accumulation Phase, Analyst Says According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor BorisVest, a strategy called Smart Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) may help Bitcoin investors accumulate the asset more strategically and improve long-term performance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rejected At $120,000: Binance Whale Inflows Suggest Possible Drop To $110,000 In his analysis, BorisVest noted that investors often struggle to time their entries into BTC. Many tend to buy during local tops due to fear of missing out (FOMO) and avoid entering the market during bottoms out of fear of further declines. Smart DCA offers a way to bypass these emotion-driven decisions. The strategy recommends accumulating BTC when its market price falls below the 1-week to 1-month realized price – a period during which short-term holders are often in loss, resulting in heightened sell-off. BorisVest explained: At these levels, short-term holders are usually underwater, leading to increased sell pressure. Smart DCA activates hourly purchases during such periods, helping to bring the BTC and USD cost basis closer together. Currently, the 1-week to 1-month realized price stands at approximately $117,700. As long as BTC trades below this level, Smart DCA continues to flash an accumulation signal. Once BTC climbs above this threshold, the strategy advises gradually selling previously accumulated coins. With Bitcoin now trading near $116,000, the analyst suggests that the asset is still in an accumulation phase – though it’s approaching the realized threshold. According to data from CoinGecko, BTC remains about 5.2% below its ATH of $122,838, recorded on July 14. Is BTC Unlikely To Hit A New ATH? Despite holding steady around $115,000, some analysts warn that Bitcoin’s realized price is slowly beginning to show signs of fragility. A drop below the $105,000 mark could lead to increased downside momentum, potentially triggering a larger sell-off. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Rising New Investor Dominance, Old Holders Yet To Capitulate Notably, Binance’s net taker volume has slipped back into negative territory, raising concerns about a near-term correction. Additionally, rising Bitcoin ETF outflows have shown signs of weakness, adding another layer of uncertainty. Still, not all indicators are bearish. Some on-chain metrics suggest BTC may simply be entering a cooling-off period after a brief overheated phase. At press time, BTC trades at $116,316, up 2.1% in the past 24 hours.

These companies hold Ether (ETH) as a primary asset in their corporate treasuries, offering a unique form of exposure to the Ethereum ecosystem. However, even with this exciting development, a crucial voice of caution has emerged: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin . He acknowledges the value these firms bring but issues a stark warning against the dangers of excessive leverage. Understanding the Rise of ETH Treasury Firms What exactly are ETH treasury firms ? Simply put, these are businesses that choose to hold a significant portion of their corporate reserves in Ether. This strategy provides them with direct exposure to the potential growth of Ethereum, aligning their financial health with the success of the blockchain. The market for these firms is substantial, reportedly valued at around $11.77 billion. Leading examples include BitMine Immersion Technologies, holding $3.23 billion in ETH, and SharpLink Gaming, with $2.02 billion in ETH. Buterin sees this trend as a positive development, offering a robust way for companies to gain exposure to ETH. These firms represent a growing institutional interest in Ethereum, moving beyond speculative trading to integrate crypto assets into traditional corporate finance. This shift is a testament to Ethereum’s increasing maturity and perceived long-term value. The Peril of Ethereum Leverage : A Vitalik Buterin Warning While supportive, Buterin’s primary concern revolves around the potential for excessive leverage within these firms. He specifically warns against the risk of turning this valuable investment strategy into an “overleveraged game.” What does excessive leverage mean in this context? It refers to borrowing significant amounts of capital against existing ETH holdings. While leverage can amplify gains, it dramatically increases exposure to crypto market risk . If the price of ETH drops significantly, highly leveraged positions can face margin calls. This could force firms to sell their ETH holdings to cover debts, potentially triggering a cascading price collapse. Such a scenario could destabilize the broader Ethereum market, affecting all participants. Buterin highlighted that current ETH treasury firms are generally more resilient than past failures like Terra, which collapsed due to unsustainable leverage models. However, vigilance remains key to prevent similar pitfalls. Navigating the ETH Price Rally and Future Considerations Ethereum has shown remarkable strength this year, experiencing a significant ETH price rally of 163%. This impressive performance has helped ETH narrow its performance gap with other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana. A portion of this demand has indeed come from the increasing interest and holdings by ETH treasury firms . For firms considering or already employing an ETH treasury strategy, Buterin’s advice underscores the importance of prudent risk management. It’s about balancing the desire for exposure with the need for financial stability. Maintain healthy collateralization ratios if using any form of leverage. Diversify assets where appropriate, even within a crypto-focused treasury. Regularly assess market conditions and potential volatility. Ultimately, Buterin’s insights serve as a valuable reminder that while innovation and growth are vital, responsible financial practices are paramount to ensuring the long-term health and stability of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Summary: A Balanced Approach to ETH Treasuries Vitalik Buterin’s stance on ETH treasury firms offers a nuanced perspective: embrace the innovation and value proposition of holding Ether, but remain acutely aware of the dangers of excessive leverage. The recent ETH price rally showcases Ethereum’s potential, yet navigating the inherent crypto market risk requires a disciplined approach. By prioritizing caution and resilience, these firms can contribute positively to the Ethereum ecosystem without succumbing to the pitfalls of overextension. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an ETH treasury firm? An ETH treasury firm is a company that holds Ether (ETH) as a significant portion of its corporate treasury reserves, aiming to gain exposure to the Ethereum ecosystem’s growth. Q2: Why is Vitalik Buterin warning against excessive leverage? Vitalik Buterin warns against excessive leverage because borrowing too much against ETH holdings can lead to forced liquidations during price drops, potentially causing a cascading collapse and increasing overall crypto market risk . Q3: How large is the market for ETH treasury firms? According to reports, the market for ETH treasury firms is currently valued at approximately $11.77 billion, with major players like BitMine Immersion Technologies and SharpLink Gaming. Q4: Has the demand from ETH treasury firms impacted the ETH price rally? Yes, the increasing demand from ETH treasury firms is cited as one factor contributing to the significant ETH price rally seen this year, helping ETH narrow its performance gap with other major cryptocurrencies. Q5: How can firms mitigate the risks of holding ETH in their treasury? Firms can mitigate risks by avoiding excessive leverage, maintaining healthy collateralization ratios, diversifying assets where appropriate, and continuously monitoring market conditions and volatility.

Wagering clauses, max cashout limits, and provider exclusions can turn a solid promo into a losing deal. To find the easiest bonus to cash out casino fans can count on, it’s not about who offers the biggest match, it’s about who offers the fairest terms. This article compares three notable platforms: Spartans , BetMGM, and PartyPoker. The goal? See which one delivers a deal that actually lets players withdraw their bonus winnings with minimal friction. Spartans: The Bonus with Straight Rules and Clear Rewards Spartans have earned attention in the crypto gambling world by offering simple and well-defined promotions. Their welcome bonus gives players a 300% match on a $5 deposit, capped at $200. The standout here is the 35x wagering requirement, which is reasonable by current industry standards. Combined with a 10x max cashout rule, this gives players achievable targets and removes the confusion that clouds most bonuses. For those chasing the easiest bonus to cash out casino platforms can provide, Spartans check the key boxes: clarity, structure, and fairness. Excluded providers like Popiplay, 3Oaks, and Pragmatic Play are listed clearly, helping players avoid mistakes. The bonus remains valid for 7 days, giving a practical time frame to meet the wagering terms. Thanks to full crypto support for both deposits and withdrawals, players also avoid long waits or third-party banking delays. Every element here keeps gameplay smooth and straightforward, making Spartans a rare example of a bonus that feels worth claiming. BetMGM: Well-Known Name, But Conditions Are Heavier BetMGM is a major player in the casino space, but its bonuses aren’t as player-friendly as the branding suggests. Their common 100% match offer comes with a 40x wagering rule, meaning a $100 bonus requires $4,000 in play before withdrawal becomes possible. This is a typical setup in traditional casinos, but it hardly fits the category of easiest bonus to cash out casino players are seeking. Game contribution rules are also tight, slots may count just 10%, and table games often count for nothing. Without a payout cap, BetMGM’s bonuses might seem generous, but the high wagering often wipes out player balances before reaching the cashout stage. The platform’s narrow game eligibility list forces players to stick to select slots, reducing freedom and strategy. For those who value flexibility and efficient progress, BetMGM’s structure creates more hurdles than help. PartyPoker: Focused on Poker, Not Bonus Payouts While PartyPoker is best known for its poker rooms, it also extends some bonus offers for casino users. Most include a matched deposit deal with wagering requirements in the 35x–45x range depending on geography and campaign. At a glance, these seem close to Spartans’ terms. However, the lack of a defined cashout cap is misleading. Pair that with limited game contribution options and tight regional limits, and it becomes harder to finish the wagering without major risk. Many bonuses here rely on “missions” or timed challenges to unlock progress, which makes them more complicated than helpful. This approach adds layers that casual players might find overwhelming. Compared to Spartans’ simple structure, PartyPoker demands more speed, volume, and game-specific grinding. For players who just want to play and withdraw winnings without chasing a gamified reward system, PartyPoker doesn’t deliver the easiest experience. Spartans Sets the Standard for Cashable Casino Bonuses When placed side by side with BetMGM and PartyPoker, Spartans clearly offers the easiest bonus to cash out casino players can use with confidence. Rather than complex wagering rules or hidden limits, Spartans provides upfront clarity. From the 35x playthrough to the 10x payout cap and visible game exclusions, every element is built around fairness. Players can focus on actual gameplay instead of navigating tricky bonus mechanics. BetMGM asks too much in terms of wagering volume and restricts game variety, while PartyPoker complicates the process with missions and limited liquidity. Spartans simplify everything. With fast crypto payments and straightforward conditions, players have a real chance to turn bonus funds into withdrawable winnings. It’s not about handing out the biggest numbers, it’s about making those numbers realistic. For those looking to play smart and actually cash out, Spartans stand as the top option.

49720470,https://thecoinrise.com/solana-rallies-4-eth-volume-nears-240b-but-blockdags-10-btc-auction-steals-the-spotlight/,1754614841,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/49720470.jpeg,"Solana Rallies 4%, ETH Volume Nears $240B, But BlockDAG’s 10 BTC Auction Steals the Spotlight",https://thecoinrise.com/solana-rallies-4-eth-volume-nears-240b-but-blockdags-10-btc-auction-steals-the-spotlight/,"As capital rotates across the top crypto for 2025, a clear trio has emerged: Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), and BlockDAG (BDAG) . Each is registering a headline-worthy breakout—but only one is fundamentally shifting the investment narrative. Solana surged 4.05% to $168.48 after Artelo Biosciences became the first pharmaceutical firm to commit $9.475 million of its treasury to SOL. Meanwhile, the latest Ethereum (ETH) recent update reveals July’s on-chain volume surged to nearly $240 billion—its highest since December 2021. Yet, the loudest buzz is around BlockDAG. With over $364 million raised, a 10 BTC auction in play, and a price set to jump 17x on August 11, BDAG is no longer just a presale—it’s the market’s main event. And the window to act is closing fast. Solana (SOL) Price Surge Sparks Institutional Interest Solana’s 4% rally to $168 was more than just a market bounce, it was driven by institutional confidence. Artelo Biosciences became the first pharmaceutical firm to commit part of its treasury to SOL, allocating $9.475 million in a move that could influence other biotech players eyeing digital asset diversification. Technically, Solana is flashing bullish signals. The price rebounded cleanly from the lower Bollinger Band at $156.83, while MACD crossover indicators point toward a possible continuation. With volume backing the move, $180 is the next key resistance, and a breakout there could open a path toward $185 or even $190. Beyond price action, the Solana ecosystem is expanding. Solaxy, the first Layer-2 on Solana, is nearing mainnet launch and offers up to 70% staking APY. That momentum reinforces Solana’s reputation for scalability. Still, BlockDAG presents a sharper value proposition. With entry prices still low, broader infrastructure, and stronger upside, the smart capital is watching BDAG closely. Ethereum (ETH) Recent Update Shows Revival at Scale Ethereum isn’t sitting out this cycle either. July’s on-chain data shows that ETH processed over $238 billion in transaction volume, a 70% jump from June and the highest since its December 2021 peak. It also logged 46.67 million transactions, surpassing its previous monthly high set during the last bull cycle. That level of activity signals real demand. With ETH trading at $3,700 and breaking into multi-year highs, the bullish momentum now has fundamental support. The seven-day moving average of Ethereum transactions reached 1.64 million, just below its all-time peak, while active addresses hit 17.55 million, the highest since May 2021. Investors are watching for continued momentum as Ethereum’s L2 ecosystem expands and staking rates hold firm. Still, with its valuation already running hot, it’s less about catching the next 5x and more about long-term positioning. That’s precisely why eyes are drifting toward BlockDAG, where the runway for exponential growth is far longer and cheaper. BlockDAG’s 17x Opportunity, 10 BTC Auction, and Viral Momentum While Solana and Ethereum are posting gains, BlockDAG is rewriting the script entirely. The presale has now raised more than $364 million, and the clock is ticking: its discounted $0.0016 Global Launch release price expires on August 11, after which it jumps 17x to $0.0276 (Batch 29 rate). With a confirmed launch price of $0.05, the near-term upside is clear and measurable. Buyers entering before the August 11 cutoff are automatically enrolled in BlockDAG’s 10 BTC Auction. The more a user spends, the higher their odds of winning a share of the Bitcoin prize pool. It’s a clever incentive that’s driving even more volume into the platform ahead of the price jump. BlockDAG is far from a meme play. It’s backed by infrastructure: Dashboard V4 just went live, allowing real-time charting and simulated trading, while the X1 mining app now has 2.5 million users globally. Exchange listings are also locked in with five top-tier platforms, including MEXC, BitMart, XT.com, CoinStore, and LBank. What sets BlockDAG apart, however, is its architecture. Combining blockchain with DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) technology, BDAG delivers high-speed scalability, EVM compatibility, and a low-code smart contract builder. This mix positions it as not just another Layer-1, but a multi-use ecosystem with real-world performance baked in. If BlockDAG hits its projected target of $0.05 post-launch, today’s $0.0016 entry represents an over 3,000% return; and that’s just at the first listing. While SOL and ETH chase new highs, BDAG offers the one thing investors crave most: asymmetric upside at the ground floor. The Bottom Line The crypto market rarely moves in sync, and this week proves it. Solana’s 4% surge is backed by real adoption, Ethereum’s $240 billion July confirms its dominance, and both show strong potential in 2025. Yet neither offers the raw upside of BlockDAG. With over $364 million raised, a 10 BTC auction running, and a 17x discount set to vanish by August 11, BlockDAG isn’t just participating in this cycl; it’s leading it. The platform’s real infrastructure, including the X1 app, Dashboard V4, and exchange presence, makes it far more than a speculative flyer. For those scanning the top crypto for 2025, Solana and Ethereum remain strong bets. But if you’re looking for maximum return on capital in the next major wave, BlockDAG is the one stealing the spotlight, and for good reason.

With many meme-focused names losing steam, a few projects are steadily gaining traction and earning more attention in research discussions. Below are four names often ranked as the best crypto coins for 2025, starting with a presale that some say is still quietly undervalued. 1. Cold Wallet (CWT): Analysts See a 37x Gap Before Listing Cold Wallet is emerging as one of the best crypto coins for 2025, with analysts calling it a “rare high-upside setup.” Recently listed on CoinMarketCap, it is now in stage 16 of 150 in its presale, selling at $0.00924, while the launch price is locked at $0.3517. That’s a gap suggesting a 37x jump before it even reaches public markets. Cold Wallet lets users earn CWT as cashback on everyday actions like gas fees, swaps, and on/off-ramp moves , all through a self-custody, non-custodial wallet. The acquisition of Plus Wallet, with over 2 million users, has boosted its growth plans. With over $5.7 million raised, Stage 16, and an overall ROI of 4,900%, early-stage watchers say such pricing gaps are rare this late in a presale. Those entering in Cold Wallet ($CWT) at $0.00942 could see returns of about 3,633% if it lists at $0.3517. Its CoinMarketCap listing has already sparked more buying, and several community analyst groups have added it to their “long-term” watch lists. 2. Chainlink (LINK): Real-World Oracle Demand Builds Long-Term Trust Chainlink remains a regular mention among the best crypto coins for 2025 thanks to its key role in blockchain data delivery. As DeFi and smart contracts spread across multiple chains, Chainlink’s oracle system is seen as essential infrastructure. LedgerScope’s Felix Orman noted in June, “Chainlink has the first-mover advantage in decentralized oracles, but the real edge is in integrations; more than 1,800 projects now use it.” The Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is awaited by multi-chain builders, while enterprise use from SWIFT and Vodafone adds long-term credibility. Though LINK might not offer extreme early-stage style gains, its consistent progress and critical network role keep it a strong choice for those seeking reliable infrastructure exposure heading into 2025. 3. Stellar (XLM): Payment Network Finds New Institutional Backing Stellar is sometimes overlooked in the layer-1 conversation, but analysts say it belongs on the best crypto coins for 2025 list due to fresh interest from the traditional finance space. Deals like the Stellar Development Foundation’s partnership with MoneyGram and USDC integration have turned it into a real tool for remittances and payment rails worldwide. Quant researcher Angela Li said, “Stellar is expanding its on-ramp network in regions where banking is broken. This is more fintech than just blockchain.” With low-cost transactions and KYC-ready design, it’s well placed as a bridge between fiat and crypto for regulated payments. While price growth has been modest in recent quarters, rising developer activity and adoption in cross-border use could push recognition as bigger financial platforms bring it into their systems. 4. Cardano (ADA): Careful Growth and New dApps Could Shift the Trend Cardano remains a frequent topic in best crypto coins for 2025 discussions, with its focus on peer-reviewed progress and formal methods setting it apart. Its slower development pace compared to faster chains has also made it appealing in markets facing tighter regulation. Technical analyst Jared White says, “ADA’s strength is in its careful but complete design. With the extended UTXO model and Hydra update, it’s now ready for real-world dApps.” New DeFi projects like Liqwid and Indigo Protocol are adding gradual activity, though total value locked still lags behind top competitors. Analysts agree that if clearer rules arrive in 2025, Cardano’s academic roots and methodical build could make it a preferred platform for those wanting compliance-ready options. Final Word From early presales like Cold Wallet, offering a rare utility setup with a 37x price gap, to established infrastructure names like Chainlink, Stellar, and Cardano, analysts suggest the shift is toward utility over hype when picking the best presale crypto coins for 2025 . Each one here serves a key Web3 role , self-custody, data oracles, payments, or smart contracts , and all share a clear path to adoption. For long-term portfolios, mixing early-stage chances like CWT with strong foundations like LINK and ADA could create a balanced approach with both upside and proven utility.

49720168,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=186836,1754615411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/49720168.jpeg,Unlocking Crypto Investment: 90 Million Americans Gain Access to Digital Assets,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/invest-crypto-access-americans/,"BitcoinWorld Unlocking Crypto Investment: 90 Million Americans Gain Access to Digital Assets Exciting news is emerging for millions of American workers eager to invest in crypto . Recent statements from David Sacks, the White House’s AI and crypto czar, suggest a significant shift. A new executive order by President Donald Trump is poised to grant over 90 million U.S. workers a direct path to alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies. This development could reshape the landscape of personal finance and crypto investment across the nation. What’s Driving This New Path to Invest in Crypto ? The announcement by David Sacks, as reported by Cointelegraph on X, highlights a pivotal moment. The executive order aims to broaden the investment horizons for a substantial portion of the American workforce. Essentially, it seeks to empower everyday Americans by providing them with more choices for their retirement savings and long-term financial planning. This initiative recognizes the growing interest in digital assets and their potential role in a diversified portfolio. For decades, traditional investment vehicles have dominated retirement plans like 401(k)s. However, the rapid evolution of the cryptocurrency market has sparked a demand for greater access. This executive order could be a direct response to that demand, potentially opening doors for millions who previously found it challenging to incorporate crypto into their official retirement accounts. It signifies a governmental acknowledgment of crypto’s increasing relevance in the broader financial ecosystem. Understanding the Potential of 401(k) Crypto Allocation The financial implications of this move are substantial. Bitwise research analyst Ryan Rasmussen previously estimated that even a modest 1% allocation of 401(k) assets to crypto could inject a staggering $80 billion into the market. Consider the sheer scale: 401(k) plans represent a massive pool of capital, designed to secure workers’ futures. Allowing even a small percentage to be directed towards cryptocurrencies could lead to significant institutional adoption and liquidity. Increased Market Liquidity: A new influx of capital from 401(k) plans could enhance the overall liquidity of the crypto market. Broader Adoption: Mainstream access through retirement accounts could accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrencies as legitimate investment vehicles. Diversification Benefits: For individuals, adding crypto might offer diversification benefits, potentially enhancing portfolio returns, though it also introduces new risks. However, it is crucial to approach crypto investment with a clear understanding of its volatility and risks. While the potential for growth is attractive, careful consideration and professional advice remain paramount for any investment decision, especially when dealing with retirement funds. Navigating the Landscape of US Crypto Access While the prospect of 90 million Americans gaining access to digital assets is exciting, there are complexities to consider. Regulatory clarity has long been a challenge for the crypto industry in the United States. This executive order, therefore, could be a step towards providing a more defined framework for how cryptocurrencies integrate into traditional financial systems. Clear guidelines are essential for both investors and financial institutions. Furthermore, education will play a vital role. Many individuals may be new to the concept of cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology. Financial advisors and educational resources will be crucial in helping these potential new investors understand the nuances, risks, and opportunities associated with this asset class. Empowering individuals to make informed decisions will be key to the success of this expanded access. Beyond 401(k)s: Expanding Digital Assets Horizons While the focus is currently on 401(k)s, this executive order could symbolize a broader shift in how the U.S. government views cryptocurrencies. It suggests a move towards integrating them into mainstream finance rather than isolating them. This broader acceptance could pave the way for other forms of crypto investment , such as expanded access in other retirement accounts or more streamlined processes for direct crypto purchases. The ripple effect could extend beyond individual investors, influencing institutional interest and innovation within the blockchain space. As more Americans get a direct path to invest in crypto , it could foster a more robust and mature digital asset ecosystem, encouraging further development and utility for various cryptocurrencies. In conclusion, the potential for 90 million Americans to gain access to crypto investment through their 401(k)s marks a transformative moment. This executive order could significantly boost US crypto access , inject substantial capital into the market, and accelerate the mainstream adoption of digital assets . While opportunities abound, responsible investing and continuous education will be essential for navigating this exciting new frontier.

The jump was powered by Cash App’s lending growth and steady payment volumes across its platforms. The company had previously forecast $9.96 billion in gross profit for 2025. News of the appointment caused Block shares to rise 8% in after-market trade in New York on Thursday. Cash App, Block’s peer-to-peer payment and banking platform, pulled in $1.50 billion gross profit for the quarter—an increase of 16% YoY—topping an expected $1.42 billion by analysts. The signature player here was Borrow, a short-term lending service, Cash App said, which sold faster than anticipated. Card spending also supported the buy now, pay later features. Monthly active users remained steady at around 57 million, but the company expects revenue to climb without adding more users. Chief Financial Officer Amrita Ahuja said revenue acceleration in the year’s second half does not depend on active user growth. Square and efficiency bolster results Square , Block’s merchant-facing division, continued to deliver solid gains in the second quarter, reinforcing its role as the company’s second major growth engine alongside Cash App. The business, best known for its sleek card readers and point-of-sale systems used by coffee shops, restaurants, salons, and small retailers, saw gross payment volume (GPV) climb 10% year-over-year to $64.25 billion. While this fell slightly short of Wall Street’s $66.33 billion forecast, analysts noted the growth was still strong given the challenging macroeconomic environment and tighter consumer spending in some sectors. Higher transaction volumes and broader adoption of value-added services lifted Square’s gross profit 11% over last year. The company’s buy now, pay later (BNPL) service, which enables customers to split payments into installments, is seeing strong growth across merchants and consumers on the platform, driving better sales and customer retention for sellers. Square has also started shipping its Bitcoin mining chips to clients as part of a wider strategy targeting the cryptocurrency infrastructure market over the long term. I say go, and the revenue on these deliveries should be more material as the year progresses. Operation efficiency is also increasingly a core focus for Block, with Square playing a large part. Artificial intelligence tools for product development, fraud detection, personalized merchant servicing, and lower operational costs have been deployed across the company. The savings from all of this will be funneled into Block’s pockets to redeploy that money toward growth initiatives, which the company hopes can increase margins. Perhaps most importantly for Square, the future of the business is clouded in as much uncertainty as ever: Bloomberg Intelligence analysts identified three main growth catalysts for the business -deepening engagement among Cash App users to drive transaction frequency higher, growing Square’s merchant base across not only small and mid-sized businesses but larger enterprises and in geographies outside of its existing markets, and optimizing operations to further profit without sacrificing innovation. If macroeconomic conditions stabilize and small-business spending rebounds in those areas, Block could be better poised for growth starting in 2025. Firm stays upbeat despite headwinds Block reported an adjusted net profit of $385 million for the second quarter, or 62 cents per share, up from 47 cents a year ago. Revenue came in at $6.82 billion, matching market expectations. The company has also enjoyed a boost in investor confidence since joining the S&P 500 in July. CEO Jack Dorsey also addressed the rise of stablecoins, noting their role in remittances. He said if stablecoins became more common in payments, Block would consider entering the space, but he stressed that Bitcoin remains the company’s focus. Dorsey said Bitcoin remained unique as it was entirely new and possessed qualities no stablecoin possessed. He added that the company’s goal was to make Bitcoin a native currency of the internet and to see it used as everyday money. He noted that Block’s strong quarter underscored its position as a leader in digital payments, with growth in Cash App lending and an expanding Square merchant base. He focused on Bitcoin, signaling confidence in the company’s future — a sentiment reflected in Wall Street’s reaction. Get seen where it counts.

While ETH continues to dominate headlines, all eyes are now on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi protocol under $1 that’s gaining serious traction for its innovative approach to asset lending. Mutuum Finance is in Phase 6 and is presently valued at $0.035. The next price increase will bring Mutuum Finance to $0.04 in phase 7. Investors in this stage of investment will earn a return on investment of 71.43% once the token goes live at $0.06. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has crossed more than $14.1 million raised and welcomed more than 14,900 distinct holders. Mutuum Finance could outpace Ethereum with 55x gains. Ethereum Eyes $5,000 as Utility Tokens Gain Spotlight Ethereum is currently trading around $3,660, consolidating above key support in the $3,550–$3,700 range after rebounding from recent highs near $3,800. Institutional flows remain robust, with over $150 million in spot ETH ETF inflows recently recorded, even as futures sentiment stays cautious, signaling renewed confidence in the network’s trajectory. Experts forecast ETH could reach $5,000 in Q3 2025, supported by shrinking exchange supply, DeFi demand, and upcoming protocol upgrades. While Ethereum remains central to the DeFi ecosystem, some investor attention is shifting toward smaller utility-based protocols like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Reveals Phase 6 of Its Presale Mutuum Finance has concluded Phase 5 of its presale and advanced into Phase 6, where its tokens can be bought at $0.035. Its next price increase will be another 14.29% to drive the price of its tokens up to $0.04. Early adopters shall be rewarded with a 71.43% ROI when the token reaches $0.06 upon listing. MUTM presale has already raised over $14.1 million and accumulated over 14,900 individual holders. Mutuum Finance Joins Hands with CertiK to Unveil $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance is in collaboration with CertiK to bring onboard a Bug Bounty Program. The program’s reward fund stands at $50,000 USDT. Four categories i.e. low, minor, major and critical will be rewarded under the program. The program shows the vision of Mutuum Finance to establish community-driven, secure and sustainable ecosystem. The project has also been rigorously audited by Certik on user fund security and security of the blockchain. This is a milestone on Mutuum Finance’s vision for an open institution-grade DeFi protocol. Mutuum Finance Launches MUTM Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is giving away a $100,000 giveaway where the users will be rewarded in $10,000 MUTM tokens. Its recently launched leaderboard system will also reward the top 50 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) holders. Ethereum may be headed toward $5,000, but the spotlight is starting to shift. With over $14.1 million already raised and nearly 14,900 early adopters on board, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a serious contender in the next wave of DeFi growth. Its unique dual-lending model, strong security focus, and early-stage value under $0.04 have investors eyeing potential 55x gains, returns that even ETH might struggle to match. As the next bull run gains momentum, it may not be the big names that lead, it could be the builders like MUTM.

Public companies are actively accumulating SOL to earn passive income and gain long-term exposure to the network. Staking rewards of up to 8% are making Solana attractive to treasury strategists. The move marks a shift in how companies manage idle capital in the digital space. Instead of just holding Bitcoin, they are now diversifying into proof-of-stake ecosystems that offer real returns. Three public companies have this week disclosed major SOL acquisitions. Their holdings combined now exceed 3.5 million tokens. As this trend gains momentum, investors are also turning their attention to early-stage opportunities—most notably MAGACOIN FINANCE. Public Companies Move Big into Solana Three publicly listed companies—Bit Mining, Upexi, and DeFi Development Corp.—are leading the current wave of Solana accumulation. Each has made major purchases and plans to stake their holdings to generate yield. Bit Mining, once focused mainly on Bitcoin operations, bought 27,191 SOL this week for $4.5 million. The firm launched its own validator and announced plans to raise $300 million to build out its Solana treasury. This move signals a deliberate pivot toward proof-of-stake assets. Upexi, a U.S. supply chain and brand management company, made the largest move. It raised over $200 million in July and increased its SOL holdings from 735,692 to more than 2 million. Most of the tokens have already been staked, earning the company around $65,000 daily in passive income. DeFi Development Corp., formerly Janover, also joined the race. The company added another 110,466 SOL to its reserves, bringing its total to over 1.2 million tokens. It now plans to stake the full treasury across multiple validators. The firm’s shift to blockchain began after its acquisition by former Kraken executives. These companies now control over $590 million in SOL. Their strategies reflect a growing shift toward blockchain-based yield models in corporate treasury management. XRP Attracts Quiet Institutional Attention XRP is building its own case for institutional inflow as Solana pivots to staking. Ripple’s recent regulatory clarity in the U.S. has helped restore confidence in the token. Analysts note that the real-world use case of XRP in global payments makes it a strategic choice for institutions that want exposure without high volatility. If market conditions stabilize, XRP could attract more capital from investors rotating out of Bitcoin and into altcoins with regulatory strength. MAGACOIN FINANCE Named the Best Crypto Presale As corporate capital crowds into large-cap assets, some investors are looking earlier in the cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention in that space. Analysts have named it the best crypto presale for the upcoming bull cycle because of its low entry point and focus on decentralized finance. Unlike hype-driven projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE has a roadmap focused on governance tools, staking utilities, and integration into emerging DeFi ecosystems. Its early-stage profile appeals to traders looking to front-run the next wave of adoption. Conclusion Companies are no longer just holding Bitcoin. They’re building active, yield-focused treasuries around Solana. XRP is quietly gaining favor as regulatory clarity improves. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers early exposure to those seeking value ahead of the next bull market rotation.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Manufacturers of bitcoin (BTC) mining equipment won't be feeling the pinch of a new round of tariffs the White House has imposed on the semiconductor industry, as the largest chip manufacturers like TSMC and Samsung have an exemption from the new rules due to their investments in the U.S. Officials in Taiwan confirmed to local press that TSMC would have an exemption from the 100% tariffs because of its facilities in Phoenix, which opened in 2023. South Korean officials also confirmed that Samsung would have a similar exemption because of its fabs in Texas . TSMC and Samsung manufacture the Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) designed by BTC mining companies like Bitmain, Canaan, and Bitdeer. Bitmain and Canaan didn't respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk. A spokesperson for Bitdeer confirmed that they partner with TSMC to manufacture the ASICs used for their miners, and thus wouldn't feel the pinch of tariffs. The spokesperson also said that they expect to bring online a U.S.-based factory to assemble the miners within a year. Broadly speaking, the market seems to have shrugged off the new tariffs. In Taipei, the TAIEX, an index of Taiwan's stock market, is set to open trading Friday up 2.3% with TSMC up 3% and approaching record highs. Even the targets of these tariff policies are in the green. SMIC, the Shanghai-based rival to TSMC, which lacks a U.S. facility, is up on the week in Hong Kong, outperforming the Hang Seng index. Market Movers: BTC: Bitcoin has entered a bullish cooldown after hitting a $123K all-time high, now trading at $117,386.04, with softer momentum and weaker on-chain signals pointing to short-term consolidation or mild downside risk, according to a report by CryptoQuant. ETH: Glassnode data shows short-term capital flow has shifted from Solana to Ether, with ETH/SOL at a year-to-date low and ETH/BTC breaking above its 200-day EMA for the first time in two years, as ETH trades at $3,905.42 (+6.43%) and approaches $4K, with open interest at $58B and network activity at record highs. Gold: Gold is trading at $3,387, up 0.5%, as the market weighs the impact of tariffs on India for importing Russian oil. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets opened mixed Friday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 1.18% and the Topix hitting a record 3,031.78, led by sharp gains in Nippon Chemical Industrial, Miyakoshi Holdings, J-Lease, and Japan Electronic Materials. S&P 500: Stocks rose Wednesday, with the S&P 500 up 0.73% to 6,345.06, as Apple jumped 5% on news it will boost U.S. manufacturing investment by $100B to a total of $600B over four years.

A massive £9 billion ($12 billion) crypto class action has reached the UK Supreme Court. This high-stakes case involves investors who are appealing a previous decision regarding the Binance delisting of BSV in 2019. It’s a development that could set a crucial precedent for the entire digital asset industry. What is the BSV Lawsuit All About? At its core, this legal claim is about seeking damages for alleged losses. A group of Bitcoin SV investors initiated the claim against several prominent crypto exchanges, including Binance, Kraken, Bittylicious, and ShapeShift. Their central argument revolves around the 2019 delisting of BSV. The investors believe this action prevented the token from achieving its full price potential. The case has been a long and winding road through the UK legal system. It represents one of the largest cryptocurrency-related legal claims to date. Why are Bitcoin SV Investors Challenging the Binance Delisting? The investors argue that the Binance delisting , alongside similar actions by other exchanges, constituted anti-competitive behavior. They claim these actions essentially stifled the market for BSV, thereby impacting its value and their investments. This is a common concern in the fast-evolving crypto space, where exchange decisions can significantly influence token prices. The investors initially sought substantial damages, believing they were unfairly disadvantaged. They contend that had BSV remained listed, it would have experienced significant price appreciation, similar to other digital assets during that period. The Legal Journey: Reaching the UK Supreme Court The path to the UK Supreme Court has been challenging for the Bitcoin SV investors . Their case has navigated various levels of the British legal system. Previously, the Court of Appeal largely dismissed their claim, finding in favor of the exchanges. However, the investors have shown resilience, now seeking permission to appeal that dismissal to the highest court in the UK. This pursuit highlights the determination of the investors to have their arguments heard at the highest judicial level. The decision by the Supreme Court to grant or deny permission to appeal will be a pivotal moment for this ongoing BSV lawsuit . What are the Broader Implications of This Crypto Class Action? This crypto class action holds significant weight beyond just the parties involved. If the appeal is granted and ultimately successful, it could establish a precedent regarding the responsibilities of crypto exchanges concerning token listings and delistings. This might lead to: Increased scrutiny on how exchanges make listing decisions. Potential legal challenges for future delistings across the industry. A shift in how investors view their rights when an exchange removes a token. Conversely, if the appeal is dismissed, it would reinforce the existing legal framework and potentially limit future class actions based on similar grounds. Therefore, the outcome of this BSV lawsuit is keenly awaited by market participants. The pursuit of this £9 billion legal claim by Bitcoin SV investors against major exchanges like Binance underscores the growing maturity and legal scrutiny within the cryptocurrency market. As the case reaches the UK Supreme Court, the industry watches closely. The decision will not only impact the investors and exchanges involved but could also shape the future landscape of digital asset regulation and investor protection globally.

The post was accompanied by the caption “Bitcoin vs XRP” and a direct appeal to viewers stating, “If you don’t know XRP Army, you really gotta check this out.” The video primarily focused on the environmental concerns surrounding Bitcoin mining and presented XRP’s consensus mechanism as a more energy-conscious alternative. Garlinghouse Criticizes Bitcoin’s Energy Consumption The footage showed Garlinghouse addressing the significant energy demand required for Bitcoin mining , which he said now consumes approximately one percent of global energy usage. He described this figure as a “holy shit moment”, indicating that the scale of Bitcoin’s energy consumption, particularly in light of growing environmental awareness, should be a cause for serious reflection. Garlinghouse emphasized the disconnect between Bitcoin mining practices and the ongoing push by environmental activists and organizations for greener alternatives. He questioned the logic behind continuing to expand Bitcoin’s energy consumption footprint, stating that the practice “makes no sense at all” in the context of modern environmental expectations. #Bitcoin vs #XRP pic.twitter.com/9pzRmxN0E4 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) August 5, 2025 XRP Ledger Built to Avoid Energy Waste The Ripple CEO acknowledged that the environmental foresight behind the XRP Ledger predated his involvement with the company. He credited the early architects of the XRP Ledger with recognizing the unsustainable trajectory of proof-of-work models. According to him, these engineers foresaw the exponential energy demands associated with proof-of-work mining and intentionally chose to implement a consensus algorithm that did not require high electricity usage for transaction validation. Garlinghouse explained that Bitcoin’s design necessitates increased computational effort as it nears its hard cap of 21 million coins. As more coins are mined, the difficulty level increases, leading to greater energy requirements. He described this compounding energy demand as a structural feature of Bitcoin that the XRP Ledger was specifically built to avoid. Alternative Consensus Mechanism Emphasized According to Garlinghouse’s statements, the XRP Ledger employs a different consensus model that is considerably more efficient. He described it in simplified terms but stressed that the energy implications were a key design decision from the outset.

By promoting Garlinghouse’s remarks, Rietveld drew attention to the contrast between XRP’s consensus approach and the energy-intensive process associated with Bitcoin. The video serves to reinforce the long-standing narrative within segments of the crypto community that XRP offers a scalable and environmentally viable infrastructure for digital payments, particularly when compared to legacy proof-of-work systems. While Bitcoin continues to be defended by its proponents as a decentralized and censorship-resistant monetary network, the concerns raised in the video bring renewed focus to the ongoing discourse around the environmental impact of blockchain technologies. Garlinghouse’s remarks, as shared by Rietveld, highlight a continued effort by Ripple and its supporters to position XRP and the XRP Ledger as forward-looking and sustainable components of the digital asset ecosystem.

The Case Is Over,https://timestabloid.com/big-news-for-xrp-sec-and-ripple-jointly-dismiss-appeals-the-case-is-over/,"On August 7, 2025, defense lawyer James K. Filan announced that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs Inc. had jointly filed a dismissal of their respective appeals, bringing an end to one of the most closely followed cases in the digital asset industry. Filan shared the update on X, stating, “The parties have filed a Joint Dismissal of the Appeals. The case is over.” The Joint Stipulation of Dismissal, filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, formally concludes both the SEC’s appeal and Ripple’s cross-appeal. The document, dated August 7 and signed by the legal representatives of both parties, confirms that each party will bear its costs and fees. This effectively terminates the litigation stemming from the original lawsuit filed by the SEC in December 2020 against Ripple Labs, Bradley Garlinghouse, and Christian A. Larsen. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP BREAKING: The parties have filed a Joint Dismissal of the Appeals. The case is over. pic.twitter.com/QMATRLnxnS — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) August 7, 2025 Legal Framework and Signatories The legal notice specifically cites Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 42(b)(1) as the basis for the dismissal. According to the filing, the Commission, Ripple, Garlinghouse, and Larsen have all agreed to the terms. Attorneys from Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick, as well as Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP and Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, acted on behalf of Ripple and its executives. On the SEC’s side, the document is signed by Acting General Counsel Jeffrey B. Finnell, Solicitor Tracey A. Hardin, and Appellate Counsel David D. Lisitza and Ezekiel L. Hill. The Certificate of Service, signed by Ezekiel L. Hill, certifies that all relevant parties were electronically served through the Court’s ACMS system on August 7, 2025. Impact on Ripple and XRP This joint dismissal brings closure to the long-standing legal battle, which has significantly impacted XRP’s market position and the broader regulatory outlook for digital assets in the United States. The litigation originally revolved around whether XRP constituted a security under U.S. law, with the SEC alleging that Ripple conducted unregistered securities offerings. Ripple disputed the claims, leading to years of litigation, several partial rulings, and a great deal of public interest. With the appeals now officially withdrawn, there will be no further judicial review of prior rulings from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, presided over by Judge Analisa Torres. That decision had partially favored Ripple, ruling that XRP sales on public exchanges did not constitute securities transactions, though it held Ripple accountable for certain institutional sales.

Market participants had long awaited a resolution, as the case’s outcome had implications for token classification and enforcement actions across the sector. Responding to the announcement, the XRP community expressed a range of reactions online. One X user, Tailan, commented humorously, “I was used to this case now is going to be a bit boring who should we fight now? Bank cartels?” As the legal uncertainty lifts, Ripple can now focus on business expansion, including its global payments network and potential U.S. regulatory advancements. The SEC, for its part, appears to be shifting its focus to other digital asset enforcement cases still ongoing in various jurisdictions. The conclusion of this case clears a major legal cloud hanging over XRP and removes a critical overhang from Ripple’s operations. The digital asset community will now closely watch how this final development influences regulatory frameworks, industry innovation, and the positioning of XRP in the evolving financial landscape.

If enacted, this landmark policy would redefine the relationship between digital assets and the US financial system. Bitcoin Steps Into The Political Spotlight Bitcoin has officially entered the hall of power, as the US President Donald Trump is preparing to sign an executive order that would prohibit banks from refusing services to Bitcoin and crypto-related companies. This move signals a major shift in the US policy and ends years of financial censorship against the crypto industry. Related Reading: Strategy Expands Bitcoin Holdings With Massive Third-Largest Acquisition According to a crypto enthusiast, Henry, with this impending order, the crypto industry appears to be getting serious respect from the White House, after years of regulatory uncertainty and political pushback. In the coming days, Henry suggests that positive developments are on the horizon, especially involving Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. This kind of attention from the highest levels of government could shake up the entire market and trigger a wave of institutional interest and volatility. If this happens, it would be more than just good news, as it would be a game-changer. Not only could it act as a major catalyst for BTC, it would also open the doors for crypto businesses to access traditional financial services, which they need for growth. Bitcoin is gaining recognition among the highest forms of governments across the world. Reports show that the Indonesian Vice President Gibran Rakabuming Raka is exploring the possibility of adding Bitcoin to the country’s national reserves, according to a recent post from Bitcoin Indonesia. The move represents a bold step toward integrating digital assets into sovereign finance. If implemented, Indonesia would become one of the first major Asian economies to formally recognize BTC as a reserve asset, signaling a shift in how governments hedge against inflation, currency risk, and geopolitical uncertainty. The global spotlight is increasingly turning to crypto adoption at the state level. The Bhutan Government Moves $59.2 Million In BTC Several countries are engaging BTC globally at a rapid rate. In a significant and quietly executed move, the government of Bhutan has transferred 517 BTC, valued at approximately $59.2 million, to a new cryptocurrency wallet. This substantial transfer of BTC, reported by Crypto Rover on X, has sparked speculation among analysts and the crypto community about potential custody changes or strategic moves.

49722139,550903,1754618434,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49722139.jpeg,"India Escalates Crypto Tax Enforcement With Over 44,000 Notices To Traders",https://bitcoinist.com/india-crypto-tax-enforcement-44000-notices-traders/,"India’s Income Tax Department has intensified its efforts to curb tax evasion in the cryptocurrency sector, sending more than 44,000 notices to traders who failed to disclose their virtual digital asset (VDA) transactions in their income tax returns. Indian Tax Watchdog Ups The Ante In a recent session of the Rajya Sabha (Upper House of the Parliament), India’s Minister of State for Finance, Pankaj Chaudhary, revealed that the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) had launched enforcement actions against non-compliant crypto users. These include reassessment notices, surveys, and search-and-seizure operations under the Income Tax Act, 1961. To promote voluntary compliance, the CBDT has initiated targeted awareness efforts through its NUDGE campaign (Non-Intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable). Under this program, a total of 44,057 emails and messages were issued to individuals who were found to be investing or trading in crypto assets but had not reported these transactions in their tax filings. The Indian government introduced a tax on digital asset income starting in the 2022-23 financial year. Since then, taxpayers have reported approximately ₹705 crore ($80.6 million) in crypto-linked income for FY 2022-23 and 2023-24 combined. However, enforcement actions such as surveys and raids led to the discovery of an additional ₹630 crore ($72 million) in undisclosed income related to cryptocurrencies. It’s worth noting that accusations of tax evasion have been directed not only at individual taxpayers, but also at crypto exchanges. Notably, the CBDT is leveraging data analytics tools such as Non-Filer Monitoring System (NFMS), Project Insight, and its internal databases to increase oversight of crypto transactions. The report adds: These tools help cross-reference information provided in tax filings with actual transactions reported by Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) via TDS returns. Discrepancies identified through this system are followed up with enforcement actions to ensure accurate reporting and recovery of tax dues. Uncertainty Plagues India’s Crypto Ecosystem While India ranks among the top countries globally for crypto adoption, its taxation and regulatory stance have been a point of contention. The combination of a 30% tax on crypto profits and a 1% TDS on every trade has discouraged many retail traders and investors. As a result, a number of crypto exchanges in India have reported dwindling trading volumes, leading to businesses announcing layoffs or getting shut. Earlier this year, crypto exchange Bybit announced it was temporarily halting its operations in India due to lack of regulatory clarity. In contrast, neighbouring country Pakistan has shown a more receptive approach toward digital assets. Earlier this year, the South Asian country stated that it would tap excess energy to mine more BTC. Similarly, the UAE continues to cement its place as the global hub for crypto businesses. In November 2024, the nation eliminated Value Added Tax from all transactions in cryptocurrency exchanges and conversions. Despite these challenges, there are signs that India may be reassessing its approach. In July 2025, Pradeep Bhandari, spokesperson for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), called on the government to explore creating a national Bitcoin reserve, suggesting potential long-term interest in integrating crypto into the financial system. Adding to the momentum, Coinbase, the largest US-based crypto exchange, is set to re-enter the Indian market later this year, signaling that global firms remain optimistic about India’s long-term crypto potential, even amid short-term uncertainty. At press time, BTC trades at $116,720, up 1.2% in the past 24 hours.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto taxation|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|Income tax department|india|India Crypto Tax|Tax Evasion,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-08 02:00:34

Pete Bannon, the company’s chip and Dojo supercomputer chief, has departed after nearly a decade of service. He joined Tesla in 2016 from Apple, where he had been a key figure in designing the company’s A-series chips. At Tesla, Bannon became instrumental in building the company’s custom silicon capabilities, overseeing projects to help define the automaker’s AI ambitions. Bannon’s most high-profile responsibility was leading the development of Dojo, Tesla’s in-house supercomputer designed specifically for artificial intelligence training. He reported directly to CEO Elon Musk and was considered central to Tesla’s strategy to reduce reliance on external AI hardware providers like Nvidia. His departure comes as Tesla makes a significant strategic pivot. The company has decided to shut down the Dojo program entirely, dissolving the team that has been working on it for years. Engineers from the project are being reassigned to other computing and data center initiatives within Tesla’s broader operations. Bloomberg was the first to break the news, later confirmed by multiple industry sources, that Musk personally ordered the change in direction. At Tesla, Dojo stood out as one of the company’s most ambitious technical projects. The system was intended to be a bespoke AI training platform driven by Tesla-designed chips that could handle the vast amount of video and sensor data collected daily from its global fleet. That data is essential to advancing Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) and robotics programs, for which Dojo was expected to be central. Tesla winding down the project represents a huge departure from its AI roadmap. The move suggests the company is stepping back from a strategy of building its own AI chips effectively from scratch toward working more closely with established chip and hardware makers. Musk orders reboot of AI strategy Elon Musk is changing Tesla’s AI strategy . Instead of developing its own computing hardware, Tesla will outsource more to vendors like Nvidia, AMD, and Samsung. The deal signed with Samsung by Tesla for its future-gen A16 AI chips is estimated at $16.5 billion. The company is also rapidly ramping up using Nvidia’s AI training high-performance GPUs. The move is a significant departure from Musk’s initial vision for Dojo, which was intended to become the AI equivalent of Tesla’s well-regarded Supercharger network and a point of differentiation that would help it outpace rivals. The Dojo project has faced technical challenges and delays since its unveiling in 2021. Many engineers who worked on the system have left the company. Around 20 have already moved on to launch an AI startup called DensityAI . Tesla’s decision to close the Dojo team effectively ends its in-house supercomputing push. The company will now channel resources into other AI infrastructure and driver-assistance projects. On the company’s July earnings call, Musk had said Tesla expected the latest Dojo version to run at scale next year. But the abrupt shutdown suggests priorities have shifted. Tesla eyes partnerships for compute needs The service marks a shift for Tesla, which, up until now, has been doing all training computing internally. Most of the heavy lifting will be done by Nvidia’s latest GPUs . AMD is also likely to contribute processing for some projects. Samsung will play a key role in Tesla’s chip production. It’s a way for Tesla to tap into state-of-the-art hardware at little risk and cost instead of just building its gargantuan supercomputers from scratch. The move comes as Tesla tests limited Robotaxi services in Austin and San Francisco. In Austin, a human safety supervisor still rides in the passenger seat. In San Francisco, human drivers operate the vehicles while users hail them through a “Tesla Robotaxi” app. Tesla has seen an exodus of senior talent this year, with the departure of Bannon adding to the list. Former Optimus robotics head Milan Kovac, software VP David Lau, and Musk’s former chief of staff Omead Afshar have also left. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Just recently, a significant Pendle PENDLE deposit of 900,000 PENDLE tokens, valued at approximately $4.65 million, was observed moving into the major crypto exchange Binance. This substantial Binance transfer immediately sparked discussions and had a notable impact on the token’s value. Understanding the Pendle PENDLE Deposit: What Happened? About half an hour before the initial reports, a multisignature wallet linked directly to the innovative Pendle protocol executed this sizable transaction. The transfer, amounting to 900,000 PENDLE tokens, was swiftly moved to Binance. This information was brought to light by crypto analytics account @EmberCN on X, providing timely insights into the blockchain’s transparent movements. Volume: 900,000 PENDLE tokens. Value: Approximately $4.65 million at the time of transfer. Origin: A multisignature wallet associated with the Pendle protocol. Destination: The prominent cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. Such large transfers from project wallets to exchanges often precede significant market events or strategic moves, making them crucial points of interest for investors tracking crypto market activity . Why the Binance Transfer Matters for PENDLE Price Surge Following this substantial Binance transfer , the PENDLE token experienced a remarkable uptick in its price. According to data from CoinMarketCap, PENDLE was trading at $5.09, reflecting an impressive 27.2% increase in just 24 hours. This sudden PENDLE price surge highlights the immediate market reaction to large-scale movements of assets. Several factors could contribute to such a rapid price response: Increased Liquidity: Depositing tokens to an exchange can prepare for increased trading volume, which might be interpreted positively by the market. Strategic Intent: It could signal an upcoming partnership, listing, or a strategic treasury management decision by the Pendle protocol team. Speculative Trading: Traders often react quickly to large transfers, anticipating potential buy or sell pressure, leading to volatility. The market often interprets such a move as a sign of forthcoming developments, leading to a surge in demand and price. Implications for the Pendle Protocol and DeFi Yield Pendle Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to tokenize and trade future yield. This innovative approach enables users to lock in future yield at a fixed rate or speculate on yield fluctuations. The recent Pendle PENDLE deposit into Binance could have several implications for the protocol’s future and its role within the broader DeFi ecosystem. For the Pendle protocol , this transfer might be part of a broader strategy: Ecosystem Development: Funds might be allocated for new initiatives, partnerships, or expanding the protocol’s offerings.

Understanding these potential reasons is key to grasping the full scope of this significant Binance transfer . Navigating Crypto Market Activity: What Investors Should Know For investors, observing significant transactions like the Pendle PENDLE deposit offers valuable insights into potential market shifts. While a PENDLE price surge is exciting, it is always important to approach such events with a balanced perspective. The crypto market is dynamic and can be volatile. Here are some actionable insights for navigating such crypto market activity : Research Thoroughly: Always look beyond the headlines. Investigate the protocol’s fundamentals, its use cases, and its long-term vision. Monitor On-Chain Data: Tools that track large wallet movements, like the one used by @EmberCN, can provide early signals. Consider Risk: High volatility can lead to significant gains but also substantial losses. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversify: Spreading investments across different assets can help mitigate risks associated with single token movements. Staying informed and exercising caution are paramount in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency.

Sheetz, a popular convenience store chain with locations across multiple states, is offering 50% off all purchases between 3 pm and 7 pm when paid with cryptocurrency through Flexa.

Steak ‘n Shake just reported saving 50% on payment fees by using Bitcoin over credit cards. These are signs that US businesses are starting to view digital assets as not just investments but as functional payment tools. Regulatory Divergence Between the U.S. and EU Across the Atlantic, the European Banking Authority has finalized draft rules giving “unbacked” crypto assets like Bitcoin a 1,250% risk weight, meaning EU banks would need €12.5 million in capital for every €1 million in BTC holdings. While the measure may limit crypto exposure in Europe, it also formalizes Bitcoin’s place in the financial system, a step analysts say could strengthen long-term adoption. By contrast, U.S. policy is moving in the opposite direction. President Donald Trump announced plans to allow cryptocurrencies in 401(k) retirement plans, opening the door to a $9 trillion market. Ether rose 4% on the news, and crypto-related equities rallied, with Coinbase gaining 3%, Galaxy Digital 6%, and Bitmine Immersion 8%. Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz called it a “milestone” for integrating digital assets into mainstream finance. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technicals Signal Bullish Continuation From a charting perspective, Bitcoin remains in a bullish flag pattern that has been consolidating since late July’s high of $123,255. The pattern’s lower bound aligns with an upward trendline from April and the 50-day SMA at $113,154 — a key support confluence that has drawn consistent buying interest. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum is turning positive, with the daily RSI at 54 after bouncing from earlier oversold conditions. Defending the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement at $113,682 has reinforced the case for an upside move. A breakout above $117,350 could open a path back to $123,255, with further targets at $126,981 and $131,574. If $113,150 fails, however, short-term sentiment may turn cautious, exposing $110,725 and $107,768. Traders eyeing an entry may look for a high-volume move through $117,350 to confirm the breakout. Bitcoin is coiling inside a bullish flag at $116.8K, holding trendline + 50-SMA support. A breakout above $117.35 could target $123K, then $127K.

The Ethereum Foundation , a cornerstone of the blockchain ecosystem, has stepped up in a major way. They are committing to match up to $500,000 in community donations to bolster the Roman Storm legal defense . This move directly supports the co-founder of Tornado Cash, Roman Storm, who is currently navigating complex Tornado Cash legal issues in court. Why is the Ethereum Foundation Stepping Up? Hsiao-Wei Wang, the executive director of the Ethereum Foundation , publicly announced this significant commitment on X (formerly Twitter). This decision highlights the foundation’s dedication to supporting individuals facing legal challenges within the decentralized space. Furthermore, it sends a clear signal of solidarity from a prominent entity in the blockchain world. The matching fund initiative aims to provide crucial financial resources for Storm’s ongoing trial. He faces serious charges, including money laundering and sanctions violations, which stem from his involvement with Tornado Cash, a well-known crypto mixer. This support is viewed by many as a defense of core decentralized principles. What Are the Charges Against Roman Storm and Tornado Cash? Roman Storm is a co-founder of Tornado Cash, a decentralized protocol designed to enhance transactional privacy on the Ethereum blockchain. Users deposit crypto into a pool and withdraw it later from a different address, effectively obscuring the link between sender and receiver. While this technology serves legitimate privacy needs, it has unfortunately also been exploited by illicit actors. The U.S. government sanctioned Tornado Cash in August 2022, alleging its use in laundering billions of dollars, including funds stolen by North Korean hackers. Storm’s arrest and subsequent trial have sent ripples through the crypto community, raising profound concerns about developer liability and the future of crypto privacy regulations . How Will This Impact Crypto Privacy Regulations and DeFi Legal? This case extends beyond Roman Storm himself. It represents a critical test for the entire decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and the fundamental principle of financial privacy. The outcome could set powerful precedents for how governments approach open-source software development and the responsibilities of developers whose tools are used for illicit activities. Many in the crypto community view the prosecution of developers as a direct threat to innovation and the fundamental right to privacy. The Ethereum Foundation ‘s support, therefore, underscores the perceived importance of this case for the future of decentralized finance (DeFi) legal frameworks globally. It highlights the ongoing tension between regulatory oversight and the ethos of decentralization. How is the Community Supporting Roman Storm? The announcement from the Ethereum Foundation has invigorated the community’s efforts to support Storm. Already, there have been significant grassroots fundraising initiatives from various corners of the crypto world. The foundation’s matching pledge amplifies these efforts, demonstrating a collective commitment to protecting developers and defending privacy-enhancing tools. This collective action showcases the strong sense of community and mutual support within the crypto space. It is a powerful example of how the decentralized ethos can translate into real-world action when foundational principles are perceived to be under threat. Furthermore, it reinforces the idea that the community stands united against what they see as overreach. What Lies Ahead for Tornado Cash Legal Issues? The legal proceedings involving Roman Storm are complex and ongoing. The outcome will undoubtedly have far-reaching implications for developers, privacy tools, and the broader regulatory landscape. This case will likely shape future discussions around the intersection of technology, privacy, and law enforcement for years to come. As the trial progresses, the crypto world will be watching closely. The robust support from the Ethereum Foundation and the wider community will be vital for Roman Storm as he navigates these challenging legal waters. This situation emphasizes the urgent need for clearer crypto privacy regulations that effectively balance innovation with legitimate security concerns.

Ethereum Open Interest Has Gone Up By More Than 8% As explained by CryptoQuant author Maartunn in a new post on X, the Ethereum Open Interest has heated up during the past day. This indicator keeps track of the total amount of derivatives positions related to ETH that are currently open on all centralized exchanges. It takes into account for both short and long positions. Below is the chart shared by Maartunn, showcasing the recent trend in the Ethereum Open Interest. From the graph, it’s apparent that the Ethereum Open Interest has just gone up by around $1.9 billion and reached the $24.5 billion mark. This corresponds to a notable increase of 8.5%. The jump in derivatives market positions has come alongside a price rise for ETH. Generally, sharp price action like a rally attracts the attention of the masses, so speculative activity can note an uptick. The scale of the Open Interest increase, however, does stand out this time around. The cryptocurrency’s price has gone up by 4% during the past day, which, while certainly not small, is only half the rise in the Open Interest. This would indicate particularly intense speculation in the market. Historically, a spike in the indicator is something that has often led into volatility for Ethereum. The reason behind it is that new positions mean the leverage in the sector goes up. This can make mass liquidation events more probable, which tend to unravel in a volatile manner. Considering how strong the climb in the Open Interest has been relative to the asset’s price, it’s possible that sharp action could be ahead for ETH this time as well. A significant amount of liquidations related to the coin have already occurred over the past twelve hours, as data from CoinGlass shows. As is visible above, liquidations related to Ethereum have totaled at $119 million in this period. This makes ETH the coin with the largest derivatives flush, far ahead of Bitcoin’s $32 million in second place. Naturally, the majority of the liquidations have involved short positions. In total, the cryptocurrency sector as a whole has seen $284 million in liquidations during the past day, $233 million of which have come inside the past twelve hours alone. ETH Price With its latest rally, Ethereum has broken away from the rest of the market and recovered above the $3,820 mark.",Ethereum|ETH|Ethereum Derivatives|Ethereum open interest|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-08 03:00:00

The Chainlink (LINK) price outlook is becoming increasingly bullish as it aims to reclaim the $22 range. Litecoin (LTC), despite facing an ETF ruling delay, is showing signs of a strong technical setup that has analysts intrigued. But the most unexpected and aggressive move comes from Cold Wallet. Still in presale, Cold Wallet (CWT) just acquired Plus Wallet in a massive $270 million transaction. This deal not only brought in over 2 million users, but also confirmed that over 645 million CWT tokens have already been sold. With a potential 4,900% ROI from its current $0.00942 price to launch, Cold Wallet is doing more than promising; it’s delivering. Chainlink (LINK) Price Outlook Turns Bullish as $22 Comes Into View Chainlink’s rebound has flipped the narrative. With a 2.44% bounce pushing LINK to around $14.66, confidence is returning to the market. Analysts tracking the Chainlink (LINK) price outlook are now revising short-term projections upward, with targets ranging between $22 and $28 if momentum continues through the next quarter. This is a notable recovery from July lows and reflects growing belief in Chainlink’s real-world relevance. At the core of Chainlink’s value is its decentralized oracle network, which enables smart contracts to securely pull off-chain data into on-chain environments. With new integrations rolling out and institutional interest growing, LINK’s role in Web3 infrastructure keeps expanding. It remains one of the few projects that bridges traditional data with decentralized ecosystems. While crypto volatility remains a factor, Chainlink’s history of uptime, security, and ongoing development puts it in a favorable position. Should demand for reliable oracles rise, LINK may not just return to the top 10, it might lead a new wave of data-centric crypto adoption. Litecoin (LTC) Recent Update: ETF Decision Paused, But Bullish Pattern Holds The Litecoin (LTC) recent update focuses on the SEC’s delay in approving the proposed Litecoin ETF. While delays typically rattle confidence, this one hasn’t shaken LTC’s technical structure. The price continues to consolidate within a bullish flag pattern that suggests potential for an upward breakout. A confirmed move past $95 could open a run toward $110 or even $120, according to multiple technical analysts. Litecoin continues to attract attention as a reliable and efficient blockchain. Known for fast transactions and low fees, it holds many of the same traits that have kept Bitcoin popular, but operates with higher speed and greater flexibility. Its capped supply and consistent network uptime give it staying power as a hedge in the altcoin market. Despite institutional approval being postponed, underlying market behavior shows steady accumulation. If technical support remains intact and price action confirms the breakout, Litecoin could quickly return to its status as a reliable top crypto performer in the current cycle. Cold Wallet Transforms Presale Model with $270M Acquisition and Real Utility Cold Wallet isn’t just riding hype, it’s creating infrastructure. While still in Stage 16 of its presale, priced at just $0.00942, Cold Wallet has already moved over 645 million CWT coins, raising more than $5.75 million. That alone would make it notable, but the bigger story is the $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet, bringing more than 2 million active accounts into its network. This is more than a merger of names. Cold Wallet is absorbing Plus Wallet’s proven usability and integrating it with CWT-powered cashback functionality. Users now earn rewards on every gas fee, token swap, and fiat transaction, automatically and with no staking or complex onboarding. It’s a clear shift from the standard crypto presale that sells ideas without showing results. ColdWallet.com, valued at just $2 million, wasn’t the centerpiece. The value here lies in the platform’s capacity to deliver a real product to a sizable audience before hitting public markets. As the user migration finalizes, full access to the Cold Wallet rewards system becomes available without delay. This kind of rollout, with features, functions, and users in place, is rare in the presale space. All indications suggest that Cold Wallet is preparing for aggressive expansion post-launch. With a structured roadmap, active user base, and embedded earning mechanisms, it’s setting a new standard for self-custody crypto solutions. This isn’t a theoretical play; it’s one of the top crypto performers stepping into the spotlight with proof already in hand. Who’s Really Leading the 2025 Crypto Field? Chainlink and Litecoin are both showing clear signs of life. The Chainlink (LINK) price outlook continues to climb, backed by renewed confidence in its oracle utility. The Litecoin (LTC) recent update, although clouded by ETF delays, still points to an imminent technical breakout if resistance breaks. But Cold Wallet is moving differently. While others wait for catalysts, Cold Wallet has created its own. A $270 million acquisition during crypto presale , over 645 million tokens sold, and a live reward ecosystem make it a standout. Where most projects offer roadmaps, Cold Wallet offers working features, real users, and a strong ROI pathway. For anyone watching the rise of top crypto performers, Cold Wallet is more than just a name to know; it’s a real-time shift in how presales can work when execution leads the way.

Ethereum (ETH) is showing signs of institutional-led growth as accumulation continues and reserves top $10 billion. Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains one of the highest trending cryptos, but its July rally now faces technical resistance and potential reversal. And then there’s BlockDAG , a project still in its presale phase, yet already functioning with a live dashboard, mining tools, and a growing user base exceeding 2.5 million. As investors explore what’s real, what’s peaking, and what still has room to grow, BlockDAG presents a structurally sound alternative with actual utility and a favorable entry point. This article compares the current state of Ethereum and Shiba Inu to BlockDAG’s fundamentals and ROI potential to explain why it’s attracting early participants ahead of its launch. Ethereum (ETH) Price Rally News Ethereum is gaining traction with institutional support driving its current rally. Whale wallets added over 833,000 ETH , valued at more than $3 billion , in recent accumulation waves, pushing ETH beyond $3,700 . Even more notably, Ethereum’s combined reserves across regulated custodians and institutional wallets have now exceeded $10 billion . The catalyst appears to be growing interest in ETH-based spot ETFs, such as BlackRock’s ETHA product, and continued demand from DeFi and staking ecosystems. From a structural standpoint, ETH’s chart remains bullish, with analysts targeting a potential run toward $6,000 if current levels hold. That would mark a new cycle high for the network and reinforce Ethereum’s position as a resilient Layer 1 protocol. However, at its current maturity and price, Ethereum’s upside, while promising, is no longer early-stage. The opportunity now lies in whether it can sustain momentum in the face of tightening liquidity across broader markets. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Technical Hurdles Shiba Inu’s July surge was among the strongest short-term moves this year, briefly rising over 30% . But it now faces a familiar challenge: sustaining momentum through resistance. SHIB’s current price structure is trapped in a descending channel , characterized by lower highs and lower lows. Unless it breaks out of that formation, analysts warn the July gains could quickly erode. Technical indicators show RSI in the overbought zone, hovering around 78, while exchange reserves have climbed, suggesting whales may be positioning to take profits. Without reclaiming structural support and resistance zones, SHIB risks fading back toward its pre-rally levels. While it remains a high-volume, highly searched token, technical strength and upside clarity remain limited. Traders are watching closely, but the path forward demands a decisive breakout. BlockDAG: The Highest Trending Crypto with Real Utility and ROI Structure In contrast to ETH’s maturity and SHIB’s technical limitations, BlockDAG offers something fundamentally different, a live, utility-driven ecosystem before the token even launches . The presale has already crossed $364 million , with the current $0.0016 price available until August 11 . This presale isn’t operating on speculation; it’s being driven by user participation, functional tools, and a model built for sustained engagement. Dashboard V4 is already live, simulating real exchange functionality. Users can view charts, place simulated trades, and track wallet balances, creating familiarity with trading mechanics well before listing. It’s designed to replace static presale portals with dynamic user experience. The X1 mobile miner , adopted by over 2.5 million users , lets participants simulate daily mining, offering 20 BDAG/day in a gamified format. Its hardware counterpart, the X10 , has been demoed producing up to 200 BDAG/day , creating a layered mining system that’s both accessible and scalable. BlockDAG’s underlying architecture is also built for long-term performance. It combines blockchain security with DAG efficiency, enabling transaction speeds between 2,000 and 15,000 TPS . The system will support smart contracts, dApps, and eventual cross-chain capabilities, giving it the adaptability of a modern Layer 1 chain with a broader user funnel. But one of the clearest investor motivators is the ROI math . At the current price of $0.0016 : If BDAG lists at $0.05 , early buyers would see a 3,025% return At $1 , ROI increases to 62,400% If it reaches $10 , the return climbs to 624,900% These projections are not theoretical stretch goals, they’re straightforward calculations based on today’s pricing structure. With no vesting applied to current buyers and 20 exchange listings already confirmed, the liquidity path is defined and immediate. Gamified mechanics like Buyer Battles and the 10 BTC Auction add additional buying incentives, awarding unsold token allocations or BTC rewards to top daily participants. These systems sustain community activity and reinforce BlockDAG’s appeal beyond passive investing. Where Ethereum reflects stability and Shiba Inu reflects volatility, BlockDAG stands as a functional growth engine, engaging users now while offering asymmetric upside upon launch. The project’s clear roadmap, working tools, and growing network suggest it’s not just the highest trending crypto today, but one of the most structurally compelling new assets entering the market in 2025. The Last Line Ethereum’s fundamentals are strong, driven by institutional support and ETF interest, but its upside is increasingly priced in. Shiba Inu, while still trending, faces resistance and lacks structural confirmation for further gains. BlockDAG, however, presents a balanced opportunity that blends real-time user engagement, technical scalability, and unmatched presale ROI potential. With $364 million raised, a token price of $0.0016, and millions already participating through Dashboard V4 and mobile mining, BlockDAG is not just gaining attention, it’s earning it. For investors looking beyond headlines and into functional value, BlockDAG is the clear standout in 2025’s high-potential crypto landscape.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP are all struggling to maintain recent support levels. Traders are growing cautious as the expected ETF decision remains elusive. Prices are dropping across the board. Risk sentiment is shifting fast. Bitcoin’s fall below its support level has dragged down most altcoins. Ethereum is losing ground despite strong fundamentals. XRP has slipped after a period of relative strength. Analysts now warn of another leg lower if key support levels break. As the market cools off, investors are already eyeing a new entrant—MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin Struggles to Hold Key Levels Bitcoin’s sharp decline has triggered alarm across the market. After briefly consolidating near $116,000, it failed to hold momentum and dropped below $115,000. The move erased recent gains and pushed traders into a defensive stance. Whale activity has dropped. On-chain data shows reduced inflows into major wallets. ETF optimism, once a strong narrative, has now faded into silence. Without an immediate catalyst, analysts believe Bitcoin could retest the $100,000 range. Leverage across futures markets has increased the downside risk. Liquidations have risen, especially among short-term traders. Bitcoin is now in a wait-and-watch zone, dependent on either regulatory clarity or external macro signals. Ethereum Falls Despite Strong Use Case Ethereum has also dropped in value following the broad market volatility. ETH has dropped below its $3,600 support level after it rallied last month. The drop has happened despite its strong developer activity and a growing Layer 2 ecosystem. Institutional flows into ETH have slowed significantly, as seen in its ETFs. Investors seem more focused on preserving capital than chasing rallies. Ethereum’s proof-of-stake model continues to reduce supply, but demand has weakened for now. Analysts agree that Ethereum remains one of the most solid projects in crypto. However, its short-term performance remains tied to broader market moves. XRP Dips as Market Cools Off XRP had a strong few weeks after its regulatory clarity in the U.S. However, that momentum has faded. The token has now fallen below its recent high of $3.5 and is testing new short-term lows of $2.95. Institutional interest has also cooled. Ripple’s expansion into global payments continues, but that hasn’t stopped price pressure. Analysts expect XRP to face more downside unless broader sentiment improves. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Visibility as Traders Shift to Early-Stage Tokens As larger assets correct, early-stage tokens are getting attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining visibility as one of the more promising projects in the presale space. Analysts have called it the best crypto presale for new investors targeting big returns, citing its low entry point, capped supply, and well-structured DeFi framework. The project includes governance tools, staking options, and future integrations into decentralized markets. Traders are actively discussing MAGACOIN FINANCE across online forums. Its fresh narrative and untapped potential are driving interest during this volatile period. Many see it as a way to gain asymmetric exposure while avoiding the high volatility of major tokens. Conclusion The crypto market is in a critical phase. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP are losing momentum as ETF hopes fade and risk-off sentiment spreads. However, even in downturns, capital finds direction. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a potential breakout in the presale landscape, offering an early-stage opportunity for investors seeking the next trend before the broader market shifts again.

Millions of Americans now hold tokens in their wallets. Blocking all of it suddenly would be nearly impossible. At the same time, leaving this sector with no rules puts everyday investors in harm’s way.

He points out that tens of millions of people own digital assets today. Pulling the plug now would ripple through trading platforms, payment apps, and even major Wall Street firms. Levine argues that such a move would simply drive innovation and jobs offshore. Hostile Past Still Looms Under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, most tokens were treated as stocks. That meant they needed to register under securities laws—a process that almost no project could clear. In practice, that stance rendered crypto “illegal” in the US. Many developers and investors felt shut out. Matt Levine: “We will ban crypto” is no longer feasible for the SEC, and “we will ignore crypto because it’s not a security so not our problem” is not very attractive for the SEC. The only choice left is “we will regulate crypto, but in a way that you like. pic.twitter.com/hBFXTmMnh5 — Sar Haribhakti (@sarthakgh) August 7, 2025 According to analysts, crypto serves two purposes: it powers networks and it offers investment chances. That split role creates regulatory headaches. Many tokens act much like shares in a company, yet they also run on open software and community rules. The SEC knows how to protect stock investors, but digital coins need different safeguards. Project Crypto Signals Change Current SEC Chair Paul Atkins launched “Project Crypto” this year. The goal is to carve out faster, clearer paths for token registration. Projects that truly function as securities could follow a new, streamlined process.

The demand is rising for online casinos that deliver provable fairness, clear RTPs, and fast withdrawals. It’s no longer about flashy games with unclear outcomes or platforms that delay cashouts. Players now prioritize fairness, verified results, and the ability to claim their winnings without waiting. This review highlights the best crypto casinos offering dependable payouts. Spartans leads the list, followed by Stake.com, Roobet, BC.Game, Bet365, and 1xBet, all selected for their ability to support regular returns. 1 . Spartans: Ranks #1 for Predictable Crypto Casino Wins In 2025, Spartans stands as the top pick for crypto users seeking reliable returns. This platform focuses on fairness, transparency, and immediate crypto withdrawals. Every game; whether it’s slots, crash, or tables, displays RTP data, allowing players to see the odds and outcomes before they place a bet. Supporting major digital assets like BTC, ETH, and USDT, Spartans lets users manage both casino games and sports bets through a single wallet. This setup helps players maintain better control over their balance and betting strategies. Spartans also include built-in fairness tools, giving players proof of random outcomes and access to full payout histories. Though high-risk games are available, the platform leans toward games that offer reliable returns. Instant withdrawals prevent the temptation to keep playing while waiting for payouts, a feature that helps serious bettors avoid loss cycles. Spartans blend speed, transparency, and trust, making it the top choice for consistency-focused crypto gamblers. 2. Stake.com: Well-Known but Built for High-Risk Play Stake.com is one of the biggest names in crypto gaming, boosted by influencer campaigns and a vast game library. Its platform supports provably fair systems and speedy payouts, but the games often carry high variance. While this appeals to thrill-seekers, it can make sustained wins harder to achieve. High-volume withdrawals may be subject to manual checks, and despite its reputation, Stake.com isn’t always the go-to choice for players seeking consistency over adrenaline. 3. Roobet: High-Energy Experience, Low RTP Visibility Roobet is known for its energetic vibe and partnerships with major brands. It’s a hotspot for crash game fans and those chasing big outcomes. However, its game design usually favors risk-heavy mechanics, which can challenge players looking for regular returns. Payout speeds vary, and while the site uses provable fairness, it lacks the full RTP visibility offered by platforms like Spartans. For steady play, Roobet may not check all the boxes. 4. BC.Game: Big Game Catalog, But Delayed Payout Issues BC.Game brings variety through an extensive game catalog and ongoing bonuses. For players who enjoy chasing rewards, it’s a strong option. Still, when it comes to predictable withdrawals, it falls short. Reports of delayed payouts surface regularly, and its RTP details are often buried or unavailable. While it’s entertaining, it’s less suited to those who want measurable long-term betting outcomes. 5. Bet365: Legacy Platform Adding Crypto, Slowly Bet365 has stepped into the crypto space, expanding its payment options for digital asset users. As a legacy betting site, it offers a massive sportsbook and casino, but its crypto tools are still developing. Payout times tend to be slower than those on crypto-first platforms, and there’s limited access to RTP transparency. For crypto bettors wanting speed and clarity, Bet365 may not deliver consistently. 6. 1xBet: Global Reach, But Cashout Consistency Lags With its wide reach and acceptance of cryptocurrencies, 1xBet caters to users across different regions. It offers a mix of games and sportsbook options, but its crypto experience can feel uneven. Slow withdrawals and unclear bonus conditions have raised concerns, especially for players prioritizing consistency. While winnings are possible, the platform’s performance varies based on location and payment methods. Spartans Sets the Bar for Consistent Wins For those who value steady wins over occasional jackpots, choosing the right crypto casino matters more than ever in 2025. Transparent terms, provably fair games, and instant crypto access are key. Spartans rank first by offering all three. With fast withdrawals, high RTP visibility, and built-in fairness, it sets the standard for consistent play.

A significant event involving DOGE whales has caught the attention of investors worldwide, suggesting potential shifts in the popular meme coin’s trajectory. This surge in buying activity signals a renewed interest and confidence in Dogecoin’s future, creating a ripple of excitement among enthusiasts. What Are DOGE Whales Doing? In a move that has sent ripples across the crypto community, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez reported on X (formerly Twitter) a remarkable accumulation by large holders. Specifically, DOGE whales —identified as entities holding between 10 million and 100 million DOGE—have collectively acquired a staggering 230 million Dogecoin within a single 24-hour period. This massive purchase amounts to approximately $50.85 million, a substantial sum that underscores the conviction of these major players. This kind of substantial crypto whale activity often precedes significant price movements. Whales, with their deep pockets, can exert considerable influence on market dynamics. Their actions are closely watched as indicators of underlying sentiment and potential trends. For Dogecoin, this influx of capital from large holders suggests a strong belief in its short-term or even long-term potential. Scale of Purchase: 230 million DOGE bought. Value: Approximately $50.85 million. Participants: Whales holding 10M to 100M DOGE. Timeframe: Within 24 hours. How Does This Impact Dogecoin Price? Following this considerable accumulation, the Dogecoin price has already shown a notable positive reaction. According to data from CoinMarketCap, DOGE was trading at $0.2211, marking an impressive 8.19% increase in the past 24 hours. This immediate uptick highlights the market’s responsiveness to significant whale movements. When large amounts of a cryptocurrency are bought, it reduces the available supply on exchanges, potentially driving up demand and, consequently, its price. This positive price action could also trigger a ripple effect, encouraging smaller investors to consider DOGE investment . Increased buying pressure from both whales and retail investors could create a powerful upward momentum. However, it is crucial to remember that the crypto market is volatile, and past performance does not guarantee future results. While this whale activity is a strong bullish signal, various factors can influence Dogecoin’s sustained growth. Transitioning from a mere meme coin, Dogecoin’s recent performance, bolstered by such large purchases, positions it more seriously within the broader meme coin market . This makes it an interesting asset to monitor for those looking for potential gains. What Does This Mean for Your DOGE Investment Strategy? For current and prospective Dogecoin investors, understanding this crypto whale activity is key. While it presents a bullish outlook, it’s also a reminder to conduct thorough research. Whale movements can be influential, but they are just one piece of the puzzle. Consider the broader market trends, Dogecoin’s development updates, community sentiment, and overall economic conditions. Actionable Insights for Dogecoin Investors: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on reports regarding DOGE whales and other major market players. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose, especially in volatile assets like meme coins. Diversify: While Dogecoin might be appealing, a diversified portfolio can mitigate risks. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide if your DOGE investment is for short-term gains or long-term holding based on your financial goals. The recent whale accumulation underscores the dynamic nature of the meme coin market and Dogecoin’s unique position within it. This significant influx of capital is a strong indicator of renewed confidence, but always approach the market with a well-thought-out strategy. The recent acquisition of 230 million DOGE by influential DOGE whales , valued at over $50 million, is a powerful statement of confidence in Dogecoin. This substantial crypto whale activity has already contributed to a notable increase in the Dogecoin price , demonstrating the market’s sensitivity to large-scale investments. For anyone considering a DOGE investment , this event serves as a compelling signal within the ever-evolving meme coin market . While promising, prudent investors will combine this insight with their own research and risk management principles. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Who are DOGE whales?

This double-digit gain has lifted XRP's price to $3.32, its highest level since July 28. The price upswing has been underpinned by sophisticated, anticipatory block option trades on Deribit, involving a bullish bet on volatility. Block trades are large transactions executed over-the-counter and outside of the public order book to minimise their impact on the prevailing market price of an asset. The first block trade executed Thursday involved the simultaneous purchase of 100,000 contracts of the Aug. 29 expiry call and put options at the $3.20 strike. The trader paid over $416,000 in premiums for the so-called long straddle strategy, which stands to profit from wild swings in either direction. A similar large straddle was also booked at the $3.10 strike. The large non-directional flow points to growing institutional interest in XRP, Deribit's Asia Business Head Lin Chen told CoinDesk. ""XRP has outperformed BTC this year, and we are now seeing a surge in block trades and institutional interest in XRP options. We have also launched year-end XRP options to cater to this demand,"" Chen said. Traders use straddles when anticipating a major volatility event – such as a big earnings report, a key court ruling, or a significant product launch – but are uncertain whether the impact would be bullish or bearish. The risk-reward profile of a long straddle is defined by unlimited profit potential and limited risk. Coincidentally, on Thursday, the Securities Exchange Commission and Ripple jointly agreed to drop their appeals in the Second Circuit court case, bringing to an end to a prolonged legal tussle. Ripple uses XRP in faciliating cross-border transactions. Limited loss, unlimited gain strategy The maximum loss in long straddles is capped at the total premium paid for both the call and the put. The maximum profit, however, is unlimited as the price can theoretically move up or down indefinitely. To break even, the price must move in either direction by an amount equal to the total premium paid. Options are derivative contracts designed to protect traders from bullish or bearish volatility. A call option provides cover against uptrends in the underlying asset, while a put option offers insurance against market swoons.",Markets|XRP|Options|Deribit|Markets|News,EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|BUSINESS|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-08 03:18:05

Today, we’re diving deep into the recent crypto perpetual futures liquidation data from the past 24 hours. This breakdown reveals significant shifts and offers key insights into market sentiment, especially concerning short positions across major cryptocurrencies. Let’s uncover what these numbers truly mean for traders and investors alike. Understanding Crypto Perpetual Futures Trading and Liquidations What exactly are perpetual futures, and why does their liquidation matter so much? Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they have no expiry date, making them highly popular for continuous trading. However, they come with significant risk, primarily due to leverage. A crypto liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This happens because the trader’s margin (collateral) falls below a required level, usually due to adverse price movements. When a position is liquidated, the trader loses their initial margin and any remaining funds in that position. It’s a stark reminder of the volatility inherent in perpetual futures trading . Over the last 24 hours, the market witnessed a substantial wave of liquidations, particularly impacting short positions. Here’s a quick look at the breakdown: BTC: $53.67 million, Short 84.36% ETH: $175.24 million, Short 87.83% XRP: $24.36 million, Short 76.80% These figures highlight a clear trend: the vast majority of liquidated positions were short bets, meaning traders were betting on prices to fall. When prices unexpectedly rose, these short positions were squeezed, leading to forced closures. This phenomenon, known as a ‘short squeeze,’ can further fuel upward price momentum as liquidations force traders to buy back assets to cover their positions. Why Did So Many Short Liquidations Occur? The high percentage of short liquidations indicates a market that moved against the expectations of many bearish traders. This often happens during periods of unexpected positive price action or when a significant number of traders are over-leveraged on the short side. When a sudden upward price movement occurs, these leveraged short positions quickly become unprofitable, triggering margin calls. For instance, the substantial Bitcoin Ethereum liquidation figures show that even major assets are susceptible to these rapid market shifts. Traders often use high leverage (e.g., 10x, 20x, or even 100x) in perpetual futures to amplify potential gains. However, this also magnifies losses, making even small price movements potentially catastrophic. A tiny price increase against a highly leveraged short position can wipe out an entire account. Understanding these dynamics is vital for anyone participating in the crypto market. Liquidations are not just isolated events; they can create ripple effects, increasing market volatility and sometimes leading to cascade effects where one liquidation triggers another. Navigating the Volatile Waters: Actionable Insights for Traders Given the significant crypto perpetual futures liquidation activity, what can traders do to protect themselves? First and foremost, risk management is paramount. While leverage offers the allure of amplified profits, it demands extreme caution. Consider using lower leverage, especially if you are new to perpetual futures trading or if market conditions are highly volatile. Moreover, always implement strict stop-loss orders. A stop-loss order automatically closes your position when the price reaches a predetermined level, limiting your potential losses. This is a fundamental tool for managing risk in any leveraged trading scenario. Understanding market sentiment and not blindly following the crowd can also provide an edge. Sometimes, the majority’s position becomes the most vulnerable. Finally, continuous learning about market indicators and technical analysis can help you make more informed decisions. Staying updated on news and macroeconomic factors that influence crypto prices is also crucial. Remember, the goal is not just to make profits but to preserve capital. Conclusion: A Clear Picture of Market Dynamics The recent 24-hour crypto perpetual futures liquidation data paints a vivid picture of market volatility and the inherent risks of leveraged trading. The overwhelming dominance of short liquidations across BTC, ETH, and XRP underscores the power of unexpected market movements and the consequences of over-leveraging. For traders, these events serve as a powerful reminder of the importance of robust risk management strategies and a deep understanding of market mechanics. By learning from these breakdowns, participants can better navigate the unpredictable currents of the cryptocurrency market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is crypto perpetual futures liquidation? Crypto perpetual futures liquidation is the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange when their margin falls below a certain threshold due to adverse price movements. This prevents further losses for the exchange. Why do traders use perpetual futures? Traders use perpetual futures to speculate on the price movements of cryptocurrencies without owning the underlying asset. They can also use leverage to amplify potential gains, although this significantly increases risk. What is a ‘short liquidation’ and why is it significant? A short liquidation occurs when a trader who bet on a price decrease (a ‘short’ position) is forced to close their position because the price unexpectedly increased. It’s significant because a large number of short liquidations can trigger a ‘short squeeze,’ pushing prices even higher as traders are forced to buy back assets. How can traders avoid liquidation? Traders can avoid liquidation by using lower leverage, maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts, and implementing strict stop-loss orders to automatically close positions before they reach the liquidation threshold. Does high crypto perpetual futures liquidation indicate a market top or bottom? High liquidation volumes, especially of one side (e.g., short positions), often indicate a significant price reversal or strong trend continuation. While not definitive, large liquidations can signal exhaustion of a particular market sentiment, potentially leading to a temporary bottom (after a short squeeze) or top (after a long squeeze).

The rally combines technical breakout pressure with a significant shift in the token’s fundamental narrative. The SEC settlement eliminates a multi-year litigation drag, potentially unlocking greater institutional participation in U.S. markets. Price action shows heavy accumulation above $3.10, followed by consolidation above $3.30 — suggesting strong conviction among buyers even after the initial spike. The ETF filing from SBI adds a parallel demand driver, positioning XRP for higher beta moves if spot Bitcoin ETF inflows continue. Technical Analysis Overview XRP explodes 11% higher in the 24-hour period ending August 8, rocketing from $2.99 to $3.30 in a blistering rally. The digital asset accelerates most aggressively between 19:00-22:00, obliterating multiple resistance levels. Trading volume erupts past 300 million at 21:00 alone. The session spans a $0.35 range, marking 12% volatility from $2.97 lows to $3.33 peaks. New resistance forms at $3.33. Strong demand emerges above $3.10 in the session's final hours. News Background The Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple Labs have jointly ended their appeals in the high-profile XRP lawsuit, concluding a multi-year legal battle that has clouded the token’s outlook since 2020. In a Thursday filing, the Second Circuit Appeals Court recognized the dismissal, with both sides agreeing to bear their own costs and fees. “Following the Commission’s vote today, the SEC and Ripple formally filed directly with the Second Circuit to dismiss their appeals,” Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty said on X. The resolution removes a major regulatory overhang for XRP, coming alongside other bullish developments such as Japan’s SBI Holdings filing to launch a Bitcoin-XRP ETF.

Heavy sell-offs pushed DOGE below the $0.205 support mark, triggering a spike in trading volume—at one point reaching nearly 878 million tokens exchanged in a single session. The intense volume suggests institutional exits and broader market risk aversion are both in play. Historically, August has not been kind to DOGE. Median monthly returns have been negative for three years in a row. This time is no different, with some analysts warning of further losses toward $0.185 unless DOGE reclaims key levels quickly. As bearish sentiment lingers, attention is turning to other top meme coins like XRP and SHIBA INU, where similar vulnerabilities are forming. Amid these negative trends, Analysts have shown positivity towards emerging alts like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP Struggles to Stay Above $3.00 XRP, Ripple’s flagship token, has remained a top performer in 2025 thanks to regulatory clarity, but recent price action suggests trouble may be brewing. After rebounding from a $2.80 low, XRP is once again stuck under resistance at $3.09, with support forming just below at $2.91. Analysts note that large short positions—along with sharp $50M+ whale transfers—are introducing instability. Market models suggest XRP could swing between $2.94 and $3.39 in August, but some are betting on a breakout to $4.45 if conditions turn favorable. Still, the immediate outlook remains cloudy unless volume increases and institutional sentiment recovers. A drop below $2.91 would likely trigger cascading sell-offs. SHIB Faces Ongoing Sell Pressure Despite Burns Shiba Inu (SHIB) is also under pressure. The token is hovering around $0.0000122, down more than 35% year-to-date and nearly 8% in the past day alone. Even with over 600 million tokens burned recently, sellers continue to dominate. The bearish trend has remained intact for months. Technical charts offer some hope: if SHIB can break above $0.000013 resistance, it could rally 24% to $0.000015. But with crypto-linked stocks falling and speculative capital pulling back, traders remain cautious. Most analyst models predict further weakness before any meaningful upside returns. Bullish Momentum Switches To High Growth Altcoins As DOGE, XRP, and SHIB face uncertain short-term outlooks, a rising number of investors are looking to newer assets with strong foundations and upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about names in altcoin circles. MAGACOIN FINANCE is fully audited, security-verified , and attracting a growing global community. The project’s security-first architecture and zero-tax model are drawing both whales and early investors alike. With the presale still active and a structured roadmap already underway, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers an increasingly rare chance for conviction-based entry—especially amid altcoin uncertainty. Conclusion: Market Uncertainty Builds as Whales Reposition The meme coin market is at a crossroads. DOGE is slipping, XRP is coiling for a big move, and SHIB remains locked in bearish momentum. While short-term pain persists, long-term opportunity is quietly shifting toward newer, more resilient ecosystems. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a compelling pick for long-term gains—especially as major players rotate capital toward high-conviction altcoins with real traction.

A groundbreaking collaboration has emerged, poised to shape the future of digital assets in Asia. Animoca Brands, a leader in Web3 and gaming, has joined forces with Standard Chartered Bank Hong Kong (SCBHK) and telecom giant HKT to form a new joint venture, Anchorpoint Financial. Their mission? To develop a regulated stablecoin business and, critically, to secure a Hong Kong stablecoin license . This strategic move marks a significant milestone for the region’s evolving crypto landscape. What is Anchorpoint Financial and Its Mission? Anchorpoint Financial represents a powerful alliance between diverse industry leaders. This joint venture brings together Animoca Brands’ deep expertise in blockchain and digital entertainment, SCBHK’s robust financial infrastructure and regulatory experience, and HKT’s extensive telecommunications network. Their collective goal is clear: to establish a compliant and innovative regulated stablecoin ecosystem within Hong Kong. The venture officially submitted its application for a stablecoin issuer license to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on August 1. This date is significant because it coincided with the effective date of Hong Kong’s new Stablecoins Ordinance, signaling their readiness to operate within the new regulatory framework from day one. Why is a Hong Kong Stablecoin License So Crucial? Hong Kong has been proactively positioning itself as a global hub for virtual assets, and the introduction of its Stablecoins Ordinance is a testament to this ambition. Securing a Hong Kong stablecoin license under this new framework is not just a formality; it represents a stamp of approval, indicating adherence to stringent regulatory standards. This move can: Foster Trust: A regulated environment builds confidence among institutional and retail investors. Attract Investment: Clear rules attract more traditional financial players and capital into the digital asset space. Promote Stability: Regulated stablecoins are designed to maintain their peg, offering a more reliable medium for transactions and value storage. This proactive approach to digital asset regulation Hong Kong is setting a benchmark for other jurisdictions. How Does This Benefit Animoca Brands’ Vision? For Animoca Brands, this venture into regulated stablecoins is a natural, yet significant, evolution. Known for its extensive portfolio in blockchain gaming, NFTs, and the metaverse, Animoca Brands is now extending its influence into the foundational layer of Web3 finance. The development of an Animoca Brands stablecoin through Anchorpoint Financial can: Enhance Ecosystem Utility: Provide a stable, regulated currency for transactions within their vast Web3 ecosystem. Bridge Traditional Finance: Create a compliant on-ramp and off-ramp for users and businesses, connecting the crypto world with traditional banking. Drive Mainstream Adoption: By offering a regulated product, they can appeal to a broader audience who might be hesitant about unregulated cryptocurrencies. This strategic diversification reinforces Animoca Brands’ commitment to building a comprehensive digital future. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead for Anchorpoint Financial? While the prospect of a Hong Kong stablecoin license is exciting, Anchorpoint Financial will navigate various challenges and seize significant opportunities. The regulatory landscape, though clearer, will continue to evolve. Ensuring robust compliance, managing technological complexities, and building market adoption will be key. However, the opportunities are immense: First-Mover Advantage: Being among the first to secure a license in Hong Kong offers a significant competitive edge. Global Reach: A successful model in Hong Kong could serve as a blueprint for expansion into other regulated markets. Innovation Hub: The venture can become a hub for stablecoin innovation, exploring new use cases beyond basic transactions, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and cross-border payments. Their success could pave the way for further institutional adoption of digital assets in the region. The formation of Anchorpoint Financial and its pursuit of a Hong Kong stablecoin license represents a pivotal moment for both the individual entities involved and the broader digital asset industry. This collaborative effort by Animoca Brands, SCBHK, and HKT highlights a growing trend: the convergence of traditional finance with innovative blockchain technology under clear regulatory guidance. As Hong Kong solidifies its position as a leading crypto hub with strong digital asset regulation Hong Kong , initiatives like this are crucial in fostering trust, driving adoption, and building a more robust and compliant digital economy. The future of regulated digital assets looks incredibly promising. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Anchorpoint Financial?

49726766,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=800927,1754625600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/49726766.jpeg,Bitcoin’s Comeback or Bull Trap? Analysts Warn of ‘Excessive Optimism’,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-comeback-or-bull-trap-analysts-warn-of-excessive-optimism/,"Bitcoin’s recent price action has drawn renewed attention as the asset attempts to rebound from last week’s decline. Following its July peak above $123,000, BTC experienced a downturn, hitting lows around $112,000 over the weekend. However, the latest data now suggest a gradual recovery in progress, with the cryptocurrency trading above $116,000 at the time of writing. Despite this modest rebound, some analysts are warning that underlying market sentiment could be pointing to a potential correction. Recent insights from contributors on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform highlight signs of increasing optimism among traders, particularly on Binance. The balance between long and short positions is showing a distinct bias toward the long side, a pattern historically associated with short-term reversals. Related Reading: US Delay On Bitcoin Audit Is A Bullish Red Flag, Says Strike CEO Sentiment Indicators Raise Red Flags on Binance CryptoQuant analyst BorisVest recently discussed how sentiment on Binance, based on long-short positioning, has shifted notably into positive territory. According to BorisVest, the platform’s sentiment metric has shown a surge in long positions as BTC moved from $112,000 to $115,000. He noted that such spikes often coincide with price corrections. “The clustering of green bars in the sentiment chart suggests that traders are increasingly expecting prices to rise. However, excessive optimism tends to be countered by market corrections,” he explained. The analyst added that Binance, given its dominant share in trading volume, provides valuable insight into broader trader behavior. When the long position concentration grows during price increases, it may indicate a potential round of profit-taking. BorisVest stated that a meaningful correction would likely require BTC to fall below the $110,000 mark, which could offer more favorable re-entry points for buyers while restoring balance to the market structure. Bitcoin Leverage Data Shows Mixed Signals for Recovery In a related post, another CryptoQuant analyst, Arab Chain, examined the ongoing decline in Binance’s leverage ratio. Typically, a reduction in leverage is interpreted as a signal that overleveraged traders are exiting the market, thereby reducing volatility and risk of forced liquidations. “Lower leverage suggests less speculative behavior in the short term,” Arab Chain noted, “which often contributes to more stable price action.” Related Reading: Japanese Financial Giant SBI Moves Forward With Bitcoin-XRP ETF Application However, Arab Chain also pointed out that both leverage and price have been falling in tandem, which may reflect weak demand from spot buyers. This combination indicates that the recent downturn lacks sufficient buying support, raising concerns about the strength of Bitcoin’s current recovery.

The latest Ethena price action has brought attention back to the coin, with clear signs of strong demand. On the enterprise blockchain front, VeChain’s recent developments include key protocol upgrades and a significant collaboration with Franklin Templeton. These changes reflect real-world usage and functionality. Still, in contrast to both, Cold Wallet is moving forward with a model that directly benefits the user. Instead of adding more fees, Cold Wallet gives back to users with rewards in CWT. When users cover gas fees, bridge assets, or make swaps, they earn crypto back through the app. This flips traditional usage models by turning daily crypto activity into a source of value. That core idea has become the reason Cold Wallet is gaining traction right now. Why the $0.00942 CWT Price Could Be Significantly Undervalued While many presales focus on features not yet delivered, Cold Wallet is already live and functional. Its cashback reward system is working now, providing returns to users for gas fees, bridging, and swapping. CWT is not an idea waiting to be built. It is active with a live app and an operating cashback system. At $0.00942, the current token presale price is far below the confirmed listing rate of $0.35171. That difference signals more than 40x potential if the price reaches launch levels. The crypto presale is structured across 150 phases with rising prices until it concludes. Only 10% of tokens will be unlocked at launch, with the remainder released gradually over three months to help maintain price balance. In addition, buyers get a 10% bonus, and another 5% comes from referrals. Both bonuses are sourced from a separate pool to keep the token supply stable. Cold Wallet is one of the few projects in the market today that gives rewards from active use. Users are already getting USDT back from swap activity, and future actions such as paying gas or using bridges will return CWT automatically. With reward levels reaching up to 100% for gas fees, the system directly links activity to value. With more than $5.75 million raised so far and a working reward model, Cold Wallet has positioned itself as one of the most interesting projects currently running. It is priced low, live, and already generating value through its cashback tools. ENA’s Upward Price Movement Backed by Active Demand The recent Ethena (ENA) rally is tied to both market activity and usage. Following a 13% gain on July 25, triggered in part by Arthur Hayes acquiring over $1 million in ENA, the token experienced even more growth. The combination of whale interest, new integrations with Anchorage Digital, and rising demand for stablecoins pushed the price up by 28%, even while other coins remained flat. ENA hit $0.70, with strong volume continuing and $1.00 seen as a near-term target. What makes this rise notable is the use behind it. Ethena now has over $7.7 billion locked in value. As platforms such as StablecoinX add ENA to their offerings, this strengthens real adoption. Market analysts expect the next major levels to be between $0.85 and $1.00 based on key Fibonacci chart markers. More users are joining daily, and momentum continues to grow. If you’re not watching this move, it might be one of the clearer trends to pay attention to this week. VeChain Pushes Forward with New Features and Enterprise Links VeChain’s progress has been steady, even if price action has stayed close to $0.03. This latest VeChain update includes the full rollout of the Stargate upgrade, which adds NFT staking and smoother integration for apps. In addition, the Hayabusa testnet is coming in September, aimed at lowering gas costs and improving speed. Another major development is the tie-up with Franklin Templeton to support token-based payments in their BENJI platform. These are not just plans. They are already in motion and working in real business environments. Market analyst Michaël van de Poppe recently highlighted the potential for VeChain to grow by up to 340%, based on current patterns and long-term chart outlooks that point toward $0.12. Though it’s not making constant headlines, VeChain continues to build steadily. Long-term holders and consistent development suggest it may appeal to those who value results over promotion. If you are looking for projects that are consistently active, VeChain remains one to watch. Closing View Ethena’s strong gains and VeChain’s strategic steps are good signs for both projects. ENA shows momentum through rising demand and active use. VeChain is building quietly but meaningfully with protocol improvements and big-name partnerships. Yet Cold Wallet is providing something different: value that’s already being delivered to users right now. With CWT priced at only $0.00942 and set to launch at $0.35171, the 40x potential is based on confirmed details. It doesn’t rely on future promises. Add to that the 10% referral rewards and tier-based cashback that can reach 100%, and it’s easy to see why attention is shifting toward Cold Wallet. It’s live, active, and built to reward its users without needing speculation. If ENA and VeChain are on your radar, Cold Wallet may deserve a closer look as well.

Sui is growing through BTCFi use, Binance Coin (BNB) is moving toward a $2,000 target, and BlockDAG (BDAG) , with over $364.5 million raised, is nearing the end of its key entry point. The $0.0016 GLOBAL LAUNCH release price for BDAG coins will close on August 11. After this date, the rate jumps to $0.0276, marking a 17x rise. This deadline is fixed and not a guess. While SUI and BNB show strong longer-term setups, BlockDAG combines early access with working tools. The countdown has started. Sui (SUI) Market Progress: BTCFi Boost and Ecosystem Growth SUI, which powers the Sui blockchain, is getting more attention as Bitcoin-focused DeFi (BTCFi) grows. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe has noted it as a key asset in the BTCFi trend, helped by its cross-chain aims and advanced smart contract design. After holding the $2.80 level, SUI broke past earlier limits and is now moving toward a zone just above $3.90. With more value locked and rising developer activity, the network is showing solid growth. Its system, built with high speed and the Move programming language, fits BTCFi’s need for secure, easy-to-build apps. Recent price movement shows strength: breakout followed by steady trading often points to a longer rise. Sui is still developing its cross-chain use, but many now see it as one of the best long-term crypto investments for 2025. Binance Coin (BNB) Price Setup: $2,000 Still in Play BNB has been rising throughout 2025 and now sits near a key turning point. With support around $710 to $730 and current levels close to $800, it’s testing a major barrier. Chart experts at CW and BitBull highlight a long-term pattern forming. BitBull links it to the 2020–2021 cycle, where a similar setup brought strong gains. A close above $800 could start a move to $1,000 in Q4, and possibly $2,000 later on. The support for this outlook is not just technical. Activity on the BNB Chain is rising, more users are active, and larger wallets are collecting again. Binance’s top position in global trade adds to the token’s key role in crypto activity. The breakout hasn’t happened yet, but BNB seems to be building toward it. For anyone thinking ahead, it’s worth watching closely. BlockDAG’s $0.0016 Offer Ends August 11 as 17x Entry Closes for Good While SUI and BNB continue their upward paths, BlockDAG presents a pricing edge that these projects do not currently offer. A fixed 17x entry difference and active infrastructure are both in place. The $0.0016 Global Launch release price ends on August 11. After that, the rate shifts to $0.0276, aligned with Batch 29. Though the presale will continue until it hits $600M, the early pricing gap will be gone. This is a confirmed date, not a projection. More than $364.5 million has already been collected, reflecting strong market activity. The appeal of BlockDAG goes beyond the entry point. It is backed by working features: BlockDAG has passed $364.5 million in total raised capital. As the August 11 date gets closer, activity continues to rise. Its Dashboard V4 is already live and gives users the ability to try simulated trades, track live price charts, use order books, and see their BDAG balances in real time. Its X1 mobile mining app uses a Proof-of-Engagement model and now serves more than 2 million users on both iOS and Android. Five exchanges MEXC, BitMart, LBank, CoinStore, and XT.com have confirmed listings. All purchases made before August 11 qualify for the 10 BTC Auction, where larger amounts increase prize shares. This is not a standard presale that promises features in the future. The tools are ready, the network is active, and a clear pricing advantage is available only for a short time. At $0.0016, BDAG offers a real and current pricing edge. That’s why many are taking notice now. The progress is already visible, not just projected. A Clear Cutoff Between Three Choices Sui is advancing its goal of supporting BTCFi and broader blockchain services. BNB shows strength on its price chart and within its network. It could move toward $2,000, based on multi-month trends. Both are shaping long-term growth paths. But BlockDAG brings an immediate entry point that neither of them currently match. The $0.0016 rate ends August 11. After that, new entries will face a much higher cost. The project already has a working platform, planned listings, a 10 BTC prize setup, and has passed the $364.5 million mark. BlockDAG is not just preparing to grow; it is already showing results. In a space filled with future promises, BlockDAG is one of the few delivering now. The time to act before the rate changes is almost gone.

Paradigm Champions Senate’s Crypto Bill On Thursday, several industry players discussed the differences between the US Congress’s versions of one of the landmark crypto bills. Following the passage of the GENIUS Act, the sector is now focused on the key market structure legislation, which is expected to offer the long-awaited clarity and protection for the industry. Notably, the House of Representatives introduced and already passed the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act of 2025, which seeks to establish a regulatory framework for crypto assets in the US, facilitate the growth of crypto projects, and protect customers. In June, the US Senate started working on principles for its version of the market structure legislation, looking to draft a comprehensive set of rules. As reported by Bitcoinist, the Senate Banking Committee released a draft of its “framework of principles,” outlining six key principles for the upcoming crypto bill, which were allegedly “very well received” by the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector. Today, Paradigm’s General Partner, Dan Robinson, shared the firm’s response to the Senate Banking Committee’s discussion draft on the bill, suggesting that this version is the best approach. Chainlink Labs, Galaxy Digital, Tribe Capital, Multicoin Capital, Electric Capital, and Ribbit Capital co-signed the letter. Robinson argued that while both bills are an “improvement on the Howey -based regime (…), the Senate draft is significantly simpler, and avoids forcing decentralized tokens and protocols to fit themselves into an inflexible legislative framework.” The lawyer explained that the Senate’s draft focuses on the concept of ancillary assets, which “distinguishes the typical crypto asset from securities due to its innate nature.” To the firms, this is the “cleanest test” that protects decentralized crypto assets while preventing traditional securities issuers from improperly exploiting this framework. Paradigm’s VP of Regulatory Affairs added that if regulatory clarity involves replacing the current “inscrutable regime that no one can register under or operate in with another complex regime that requires a phalanx of lawyers & millions of dollars to comprehend, this exercise will have failed.” Industry Players Divided Over Legislation In an X post, journalist Eleanor Terret noted that most of the major crypto Venture Capital (VC) firms, except a16z crypto, “aligned on market structure and token classification for the first time.” Nonetheless, a16z crypto’s Head of Policy and General Counsel, Miles Jennings, disagreed , stating “most major crypto hedge funds is more accurate. Most major crypto VCs supported CLARITY’s token maturity framework.” Jennings highlighted the Decentralization Research Center’s (DRC) summary chart comparing the Senate and House’s versions, arguing that “the undermining of CLARITY’s transfer restriction framework creates short-term incentives to circumvent decentralization and dump on retail. That’s not good for innovation.” Earlier this week, the DCR also submitted its response to the Senate Banking Committee’s discussion draft, underscoring the importance of “building on the strong foundation established by the CLARITY Act.” The non-profit organization considers that while the Senate’s version is still evolving, the House’s “robust, control-based decentralization test” is the better approach. Last month, the DCR and 50 other leading industry players sent a joint letter to Congress leaders supporting the CLARITY Act, the largest coalition of organizations in agreement on a particular test for decentralization, as the post noted. Additionally, the non-profit affirmed that “sound market structure legislation must be grounded in control” and regulatory attention must focus on where it is warranted, while “preserving space for innovation and open systems.” Similarly, attorney Gabriel Shapiro concurred that “the House approach is far superior.” To him, the Senate’s test is a “pure race to the bottom” with “stuff that makes no sense from a policy perspective.” The fewer rights people have, the less regulated something is? it should be the opposite–if they have more rights, they are more protected under general contract law and there is less need for regulation. . . this is how you get pure memecoin mania forever, equity/token conflict of interest forever, etc. . .",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Chainlink labs|CLARITY Act|Crypto legislation|crypto market structure bill|DRC|GENIUS Act|Paradigm|Senate Market structure bill|Stablecoin Legislation|The Decentralized Research Center|US Congress,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|BTC|LINK|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-08 04:00:36

This move, announced by the U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday, is all about keeping the pressure on Iran, who the U.S. believes continues to flout international sanctions. This network includes companies like RUNC Exchange System Company, Cyrus Offshore Bank, and Pasargad Arian Information and Communication Technology, all of which are accused of working behind the scenes to keep Iran’s economy moving despite sanctions. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made it clear that these new measures are part of a broader U.S. strategy to choke off Iran’s financial lifeblood. He emphasized that Washington intends to keep targeting the channels Iran uses to evade sanctions, with the ultimate goal of blocking the revenue that funds the country’s military programs. “Treasury will continue to disrupt Iran’s schemes aimed at evading our sanctions, block its access to revenue, and starve its weapons programs of capital in order to protect the American people,” he said. Targeting key players in Iran’s financial web The new sanctions are focused on companies and individuals that provide Iran with a way to get around the financial restrictions imposed by the U.S. government. RUNC Exchange is one of the main targets, a company accused of being involved in illegal money transfers, making it easier for Iran to sidestep American financial regulations. Another big target is Cyrus Offshore Bank, a key player in moving money that Iran needs to fund its activities. Alongside these, Pasargad Arian Information and Communication Technology, an Iranian tech company, has been added to the list due to its connections to financial dealings linked to Iran’s controversial activities. The Treasury’s efforts go beyond just freezing assets or imposing financial restrictions. This is part of an ongoing attempt by the U.S. to dismantle the network of firms and individuals helping Iran stay afloat economically. Washington’s message is clear: businesses and institutions that choose to engage with Iran will face consequences. It’s a tactic that’s been ramped up in recent years, as Iran continues to search for ways to bypass sanctions and keep its economy moving, especially in sectors that fund its military ambitions. Oil prices react to tariffs and sanctions While the sanctions hit Iran, the broader global market is feeling the heat of new U.S. tariffs. On Thursday, U.S. tariffs against several trade partners went into effect, raising concern about economic slowdowns that could dampen demand for oil. Early Friday trading saw Brent crude at $66.40 per barrel, with a week-over-week drop of more than 4%. Meanwhile, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures slid to $63.82 a barrel, marking a more than 5% decline over the week. The market reaction stems from fears that global economic growth could slow due to these tariffs. In turn, this could reduce the demand for crude oil, as noted by ANZ Bank analysts. This comes on top of decisions made by the OPEC+ group to roll back significant oil output cuts sooner than expected, pushing oil prices even lower. At the same time, the Kremlin confirmed that Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump would meet soon to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine. This diplomatic effort is expected to have a major impact on global markets. Even though Russia’s oil exports continue despite sanctions, new tariffs on India for buying Russian crude oil have kept pressure on oil prices, with analysts warning that the tariff move won’t drastically reduce the flow of Russian oil into global markets.

(PIMCO) and Blue Owl Capital to lead a roughly $29 billion financing package to build out its planned AI-focused data-center campus in rural Louisiana, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg and Reuters. The deal is the latest sign that Big Tech is turning to private credit markets and strategic partners to help shoulder the skyrocketing costs of building the massive compute infrastructure needed for generative-AI workloads. Pimco will offer $26 billion in debt, and Blue Owl will provide $3 billion in equity For weeks, Meta has been in talks with several private credit firms to identify those who could help secure up to $29 billion to finance its large-scale expansion of AI data centers in the US. As of late June, Meta was still in discussions with Apollo Global Management, KKR, Brookfield, Carlyle, and Pimco. The firm was also working alongside Morgan Stanley to assess ways to improve the debt’s marketability. According to reports, Meta was hoping to secure roughly $3 billion in equity and $26 billion in debt. With the latest selections, insiders say Pimco will handle the $26 billion debt financing, while Blue Owl will provide the $3 billion in equity. They added that the debt portion will probably be issued as bonds. They further noted that Apollo Global Management Inc. and KKR & Co. remained contenders to lead the deal up until the final round of negotiations. Lately, private credit players have been increasing their involvement in AI infrastructure. For instance, Blue Owl recently pledged $15 billion to a data center joint venture with OpenAI, which is still collaborating with SoftBank and Oracle on a $500 billion AI facility project. Meta is funneling more investments into AI projects Meta has been stepping up its spending on AI. In June, it revealed plans to invest $14.3 billion in Scale AI , taking a 49% stake without voting rights. The firm also recruited Scale AI’s founder, Alexandr Wang, and some other employees as part of the deal, to which the startup claimed would not affect users since Meta would not have access to business-related data. Around the same time as the Scale AI deal, OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, claimed Meta was luring its staff with signing bonuses of up to $100 million and even larger annual pay packages. Recently, Meta also unveiled its Llama 4 model. However, the AI community’s response to the model has been far from enthusiastic. Developers have flagged weak programming and software development performance, adding that Llama 4 trails innovative challengers such as DeepSeek. For starters, the model’s Scout architecture processed a lengthy 20,000-token document but generated what AI researcher Simon Willison labeled “complete junk output,” with multiple loops. The tech giant has also promoted its Llama 4 as “open source,” yet licensing rules limit genuine open access. Users have to sign in and agree to the license terms before downloading the models. Besides, the model’s release on a weekend sparked outrage among community members. When Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was asked what led to the unusual timing, he remarked, “That’s when it was ready.” Nevertheless, Meta has raised its full-year capital spending outlook to as high as $72 billion, pointing to data center buildouts and mounting infrastructure expenses. In a first for the company, it has also struck a deal to procure nuclear power for its AI operations. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

This positive momentum can also inspire further ETH ETF investment from both institutional and sophisticated retail sectors, creating a virtuous cycle of growth and recognition. While the benefits are clear, potential challenges exist, such as market volatility inherent to cryptocurrencies. However, the regulated structure of ETFs aims to mitigate some operational risks for investors. The transparency and ease of access offered by these products are significant advantages that outweigh some of the underlying asset’s price fluctuations. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for any responsible ETH ETF investment strategy.

While digital assets often march to their own beat, they are not entirely immune to the tremors in conventional finance. Today, we turn our gaze to a critical area: the Asian foreign exchange (FX) market, which is currently experiencing significant shifts driven by mounting tariff jitters, a persistently weak US dollar, and the impending changes at the Federal Reserve. These interconnected dynamics are creating a ripple effect that extends far beyond currency traders, influencing investment decisions and shaping the broader global economic outlook. Asia FX Under Pressure: Navigating the Downturn The Asia FX market has been exhibiting a noticeable downward trend, with several regional currencies creeping lower against major counterparts. This movement isn’t a random fluctuation but rather a response to a confluence of internal and external pressures. For investors, this translates into potential challenges for portfolio valuations and trade dynamics within the region. Export Dependence: Many Asian economies are heavily reliant on exports. When global trade faces headwinds, as it does with rising protectionist sentiments, their currencies often feel the pinch. A decline in export orders directly impacts a nation’s current account, weakening its currency. Capital Flows: Uncertainty often leads to capital flight from emerging markets, including those in Asia. Investors tend to seek safer havens during times of heightened risk, drawing funds away from Asian assets and putting downward pressure on local currencies. Monetary Policy Divergence: While some Asian central banks might be considering tighter policies to combat inflation, others may be constrained by growth concerns, leading to a divergence that can affect currency strength. The general sentiment of global monetary tightening, led by major central banks, also influences how Asian central banks react, often leading to a need to maintain competitive export pricing through weaker currencies. For instance, the Japanese Yen, a traditional safe-haven currency, has sometimes struggled to maintain its strength amidst these dynamics, reflecting the broader uncertainties even in developed Asian economies. The Chinese Yuan, while heavily managed, also experiences pressure from trade negotiations and domestic economic data, impacting the entire region’s currency stability. The Shadow of Tariff Jitters: A Persistent Threat to Global Trade One of the most significant headwinds for Asian currencies, and indeed for the global economy, remains the lingering threat and actual implementation of tariffs. These “ tariff jitters ” create a climate of unpredictability, forcing businesses to re-evaluate supply chains and investment strategies. The ongoing trade disputes, particularly between major economic powers, have far-reaching consequences. Disruption of Supply Chains: Tariffs increase the cost of imported goods, forcing companies to either absorb higher costs, pass them on to consumers, or seek alternative, often less efficient, suppliers. This disruption can lead to reduced production and trade volumes. Reduced Business Confidence: The uncertainty surrounding trade policies makes businesses hesitant to invest in new projects or expand operations. This translates into slower economic growth and reduced demand for goods and services, which in turn impacts currency valuations. Impact on Export-Oriented Economies: Nations like South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam, which are deeply integrated into global supply chains, are particularly vulnerable. A slowdown in global trade due to tariffs directly hits their export revenues, putting downward pressure on their respective currencies. The constant back-and-forth in trade negotiations, coupled with the threat of new tariffs, keeps markets on edge. This environment naturally favors currencies of economies perceived as more insulated from global trade shocks, though such insulation is increasingly rare in our interconnected world. The impact of these trade tensions is not just theoretical; it’s seen in real-time fluctuations of currency pairs and the cautious stance of international investors. US Dollar Weakness: A Global Ripple Effect and Its Implications Paradoxically, even as Asian currencies face pressure, the US dollar weakness itself has shown signs of a decline, a development that carries its own set of implications for global markets. The dollar’s status as the world’s primary reserve currency means its movements have a disproportionate impact on everything from commodity prices to international debt. The recent US dollar weakness can be attributed to several factors: Federal Reserve’s Stance: The Fed’s dovish monetary policy, characterized by low interest rates and quantitative easing, tends to reduce the attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets, leading to outflows and a weaker dollar. Speculation about the timing of tapering asset purchases also plays a role. Global Economic Recovery Hopes: As other major economies show signs of recovery, investors may diversify out of the dollar into currencies of regions with improving growth prospects. This “risk-on” sentiment can reduce demand for the traditional safe-haven dollar. Twin Deficits: Concerns over the US’s budget deficit and current account deficit (the “twin deficits”) can also weigh on the dollar. A growing national debt and a persistent trade imbalance can erode investor confidence over the long term. While a weaker dollar can make US exports more competitive and reduce the burden of dollar-denominated debt for emerging markets, it also means that imported goods become more expensive for US consumers. For the crypto market, a weaker dollar can sometimes be seen as a bullish signal for assets like Bitcoin, which are increasingly viewed as alternative stores of value or hedges against inflation, especially when traditional fiat currencies show signs of erosion. Federal Reserve Succession: Uncertainty and Policy Shifts The prospect of Federal Reserve succession , referring to potential changes in its leadership or key board members, introduces another layer of uncertainty into the global financial equation. The Fed’s decisions on interest rates, inflation targeting, and quantitative easing have profound effects on the US economy and, by extension, the world. Any hint of a shift in the Fed’s approach can send ripples through currency markets. Why is Federal Reserve succession so impactful? Monetary Policy Direction: A new Fed chair or key governors could bring a different philosophy to monetary policy. Will they be more hawkish (favoring higher interest rates to combat inflation) or more dovish (prioritizing economic growth and employment, even at the risk of higher inflation)? The market constantly tries to price in these potential shifts. Market Expectations: Investor sentiment is heavily influenced by expectations of future Fed actions. Uncertainty around leadership can lead to increased volatility as markets try to anticipate policy changes. This can affect bond yields, stock prices, and, crucially, the US dollar’s value. Global Liquidity: The Fed’s actions directly influence global liquidity. If the Fed tightens monetary policy, it can lead to a reduction in dollar liquidity worldwide, making it more expensive for international borrowers to service dollar-denominated debt and potentially triggering capital outflows from emerging markets. Conversely, a dovish Fed can flood markets with liquidity. The process of Federal Reserve succession is often a period of intense speculation, with every public statement from potential candidates or current officials scrutinized for clues about the future trajectory of US monetary policy. This directly influences the US dollar’s strength and, consequently, the relative performance of other major currencies, including those in Asia. What Does This Mean for the Global Economic Outlook? Bringing these threads together – the pressure on Asia FX , the persistent tariff jitters , the prevailing US dollar weakness , and the uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve succession – paints a complex picture for the global economic outlook . These factors are not isolated; they interact and amplify each other, creating a dynamic and often volatile environment for investors and businesses worldwide. Here’s a snapshot of potential implications: Economic Factor Potential Impact Relevance for Investors Trade Tensions Continued disruption to supply chains, higher import costs, reduced global trade volumes. Favors domestic-focused industries, potentially hurts export-heavy sectors. Look for companies with diversified supply chains. Currency Volatility Significant swings in exchange rates, impacting international trade and investment returns. Increases hedging costs for businesses; creates opportunities for currency traders. Diversify currency exposure. Inflationary Pressures Higher import costs (due to tariffs or weak domestic currency) can feed into consumer prices. Consider inflation-hedging assets like commodities, real estate, or even certain cryptocurrencies. Central Bank Responses Divergent monetary policies as central banks balance inflation and growth. Monitor central bank communications closely; interest rate differentials drive capital flows. The prevailing uncertainty suggests that while a robust global recovery is hoped for, it will likely be uneven and subject to significant shocks. Businesses will need to demonstrate resilience, and investors will need to be agile, adapting their strategies to navigate these shifting tides. The interconnectedness of global finance means that no market, not even the burgeoning crypto space, is entirely insulated from these macro currents. Challenges and Opportunities in a Shifting Landscape While the current environment presents clear challenges, it also creates unique opportunities for astute observers. The challenges include increased market volatility, potential for reduced corporate earnings in trade-exposed sectors, and the difficulty of forecasting currency movements accurately. However, opportunities may arise from: Diversification: A volatile traditional market can underscore the importance of diversification, potentially leading investors to explore alternative assets like certain cryptocurrencies that exhibit low correlation with traditional markets. Strategic Hedging: For businesses engaged in international trade, the fluctuating currency values highlight the necessity of robust hedging strategies to protect profit margins. Selective Investment: Identifying resilient companies or sectors that can thrive despite trade tensions or currency fluctuations becomes crucial. This might include domestic-focused industries or those with strong competitive advantages. Commodity Plays: A weaker dollar can often support commodity prices, offering a potential avenue for investment for those looking to hedge against currency depreciation or inflation. The key is to remain informed and proactive, understanding that macro events have micro impacts across all asset classes. Actionable Insights for Navigating Market Volatility In a landscape defined by tariff jitters , US dollar weakness , and Federal Reserve succession concerns, what can individuals and institutions do? Stay Informed: Regularly monitor news from central banks, trade negotiations, and key economic indicators. Information is your most powerful tool. Review Your Portfolio: Assess your exposure to different currencies and international markets. Consider whether your current asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance in this volatile environment. Consider Hedging: If you have significant international investments or business operations, explore currency hedging strategies to mitigate exchange rate risk. Look Beyond Traditional Assets: While the focus here is on FX, remember that traditional market movements can indirectly influence digital assets. A flight to safety or a search for inflation hedges might lead some investors towards cryptocurrencies. Adopt a Long-Term Perspective: Short-term volatility is often a feature of such environments. For long-term investors, focusing on fundamental value rather than daily fluctuations can be a more prudent approach. The interplay of these forces means that vigilance is not just a recommendation but a necessity. The global financial system is constantly evolving, and understanding its core drivers is paramount for anyone looking to preserve and grow wealth, regardless of their primary asset class. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating the Currents of Change The current confluence of factors—creeping weakness in Asia FX , the persistent shadow of tariff jitters , the broad implications of US dollar weakness , and the anticipation surrounding Federal Reserve succession —underscores a period of profound adjustment in global financial markets. These elements combine to create an an environment characterized by heightened uncertainty but also by underlying shifts that could redefine economic relationships and investment opportunities. For market participants, from seasoned forex traders to emerging cryptocurrency enthusiasts, recognizing these macro trends is paramount. The ability to interpret these signals, understand their potential ripple effects, and adapt investment strategies accordingly will be key to navigating the turbulent waters ahead. While the immediate outlook suggests continued volatility, it also compels a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness that defines our global economic outlook .

The global hackathon, focused on building open, equitable AI and Web3 technologies, drew over 600 applicants and more than 200 registered projects, culminating in 21 winning teams selected from 30 finalists. The event showcased the global momentum behind agent-based, privacy-first, modular applications, perfectly aligned with CARV’s long-term roadmap for evolving from data infrastructure into a fully composable, autonomous AI Being Stack. CARV’s track challenged developers to go deep into four core infrastructure layers: AI Agent Infra on SVM : Building execution and coordination layers atop CARV’s custom Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) chain. Decentralized Data Orchestration : Leveraging CARV’s D.A.T.A. Framework for real-time, consent-based agent data. Modular Identity & Reputation : Extending the capabilities of CARV ID for agents through behavioral metadata and verifiable Agent IDs. Open Innovation : Demonstrating real-world agent applications that align with CARV’s consumer-focused direction. Projects like AI World , Cipher Protocol , DootyCall , NutriMe , and PeachLust emerged as leading examples of how decentralized agents can be brought to life through modular infrastructure. These use cases range from AI-powered health apps and generative storytelling platforms to real-time financial assistants—all integrated with identity, data, and onchain execution logic. “Genesis Evolution is not a theory. Builders are proving what is possible,” said Ambero Tu, CTO of CARV. “This Hackathon gave us a live lab to test those ideas with builders around the world. The winning projects are not just demos, they are viable microcosms of what the CARV ecosystem can become.” Ambero highlighted that several teams successfully integrated the CARV ID SDK and began experimenting with structured queries to the D.A.T.A. Framework. Furthermore, he emphasized three near-term priorities following the Hackathon: Deploy Agent IDs at Scale : Begin issuing Agent IDs with behavioral metadata, enabling early versions of the Unified Reputation Graph. Launch Early Agent Marketplaces : Enable testnet-native transactions between agents for data access, compute, or service exchange. Drive Governance Participation : Encourage builders to stake veCARV and participate in early governance rounds that influence protocol parameters and developer incentives. Victor Yu, COO of CARV, mentioned that the next step is to support the builders with on-chain deployments, testing environments, and fast-track access to CARV’s infrastructure. To continue momentum post-Hackathon, CARV will provide: Engineering mentorship for integrating with the CARV SVM chain and D.A.T.A. Framework Grants and ecosystem onboarding for top teams ready to productize Access to real user traffic via CARV Play and partner platforms Participation in the Agent ID early issuance program Opportunities to propose Agent DAO pilots through veCARV governance CARV sees this Hackathon not as an endpoint, but as the ignition point for an ecosystem of AI Beings, agents that are identity-bound, economically aligned, and designed to serve real people, not just centralized platforms. “This was a proof of concept not just for our technology, but for our values,” said Victor. “We are proud to see builders from around the world embrace Tech Fairness, Data Sovereignty, and the Agent Economy . Now, we keep building. Together.” About CARV CARV is where Sovereign AI Beings live, learn, and evolve. What are AI Beings? They are sovereign intelligences born natively on-chain. AI Beings are designed with purpose, autonomy, and the capacity for growth. They possess memory, identity, and the ability to perceive and interact with their environment, not just to execute tasks, but to make independent decisions, adapt over time, and pursue self-defined goals. Anchored by its proprietary CARV SVM Chain, D.A.T.A. Framework, and CARV ID/Agent ID system ( ERC-7231 ), CARV enables verifiable, consent-based AI Beings that learn, adapt, and co-create with users. Driven by CARV’s AI-first stack, consumer AI apps incubated through CARV Labs launched on Google Play, App Store and beyond, reaching billions of people, bringing agent-powered experiences and real-world incentives into mainstream digital life. With 8M+ CARV IDs issued, 60K+ verifier nodes, and 1,000+ integrated games, CARV bridges AI agents, Web3 infrastructure, and real-world utility, fueling the rise of agent-driven economies.

This significant move has naturally captured the attention of investors and analysts alike, sparking widespread speculation about its potential impact on broader crypto market trends . Unpacking the Recent ETH Accumulation: Who is This Mysterious Buyer? According to diligent on-chain analysis provided by @EmberCN on X, this colossal investor, widely believed to be an institution or a large company, meticulously gathered 171,015 ETH. This substantial sum, valued at approximately $670 million, was channeled through six newly established addresses over the past 96 hours. Moreover, the whale’s activity shows no signs of slowing, as an additional 23,424 ETH, worth about $91.65 million, was acquired in just the last hour alone. This systematic approach suggests a well-planned strategy rather than impulsive trading. Such a calculated large ETH purchase often signals strong long-term conviction in Ethereum’s value proposition. Why an Ethereum Whale’s Movements Matter for the Market When an Ethereum whale makes such a substantial move, it sends ripples across the entire crypto ecosystem. These large-scale acquisitions can be indicative of several factors: Institutional Confidence: A massive purchase by a presumed institution suggests growing confidence in Ethereum’s future, including its technological advancements and increasing utility.

The recent announcement by Robert Keele, xAI ’s head of legal, to step down after just over a year, sends ripples through the industry. For those keenly observing the intersection of AI innovation and corporate governance, this development at Elon Musk’s ambitious xAI venture is more than just a personnel change; it’s a peek into the intense pressures and philosophical divides shaping the future of tech. Why Did xAI’s Legal Chief Step Down? Unpacking Robert Keele’s Exit Robert Keele’s departure from xAI comes with a dual explanation: a heartfelt desire to spend more time with his two young children and an intriguing acknowledgment of “daylight between our worldviews” with none other than Elon Musk himself. Announcing his decision on both X and LinkedIn, Keele described his tenure as “incredible” and working with Musk as “the adventure of a lifetime.” Yet, he candidly admitted, “I couldn’t keep riding two horses at once — the family and the job.” This resonates deeply with many professionals striving for work-life balance, especially in the demanding startup ecosystem. Keele joined xAI in May 2024 as its inaugural legal head, having just launched his own short-lived fractional legal firm, Keele Law. His excitement was palpable at the time, calling the opportunity “beyond stoked, and insanely lucky.” His arrival coincided with a period of explosive growth for xAI, setting the stage for significant legal challenges and responsibilities. Elon Musk’s Leadership Style: A Catalyst for Tech Executive Turnover? The “daylight between worldviews” comment by Keele is particularly noteworthy, given Elon Musk ‘s well-documented reputation for an intensely demanding work culture. Musk openly expects employees to dedicate long hours, often advocating for a “hardcore” work ethic that has seen staff sleeping at the office, famously during his acquisition of X (formerly Twitter). This high-pressure environment, while often cited as a driver for rapid innovation, can also contribute to a high rate of tech executive turnover across his various ventures. Keele’s exit is not an isolated incident within Musk’s empire. Just last month, X CEO Linda Yaccarino departed, and Tesla has also witnessed a series of high-profile executive resignations recently. While Musk does maintain a core group of longstanding lieutenants, the consistent pattern of leadership changes suggests a unique, often challenging, corporate environment. This constant flux raises questions about long-term strategic stability and continuity, particularly for investors and partners. Navigating Rapid Growth: The Role of a Legal Chief in an AI Startup When Robert Keele joined, xAI was on the cusp of a massive expansion. Shortly after his appointment, the company announced a staggering $6 billion Series B funding round in May 2024, attracting major investors like Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, which propelled its valuation to $24 billion. Even more dramatically, in March of this year, xAI acquired X, Musk’s social media platform, in a deal that Musk stated valued xAI at an astonishing $80 billion and X at $33 billion. In such a rapidly escalating environment, the role of a Legal Chief becomes paramount. This position is crucial for navigating complex legal landscapes, including: Intellectual Property (IP) Protection: Safeguarding cutting-edge AI models and proprietary technology. Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to evolving AI regulations, data privacy laws (like GDPR and CCPA), and antitrust considerations. Corporate Governance: Ensuring legal integrity during mergers, acquisitions, and funding rounds. Risk Management: Mitigating potential lawsuits, ethical AI concerns, and data breaches. Keele’s background, including stints as head of legal at autonomous aircraft maker Elroy Air and general counsel at Airbus’s Silicon Valley innovation center, made him well-suited for the complex legal challenges of a high-growth tech company. His successor, Lily Lim, brings an equally impressive, albeit unconventional, background to the table. Before her legal career, Lim was a rocket scientist at NASA, contributing to spacecraft navigation for the project that mapped Venus’s surface. She joined xAI in late 2024 as a privacy and IP specialist after significant legal experience at various firms and companies like ServiceNow. Her unique blend of technical acumen and legal expertise will be critical for xAI’s future. The Broader Trend: Why Tech Executive Turnover Matters The high rate of tech executive turnover , particularly in fast-moving sectors like AI, is a significant trend that merits close attention. Beyond Elon Musk’s companies, other newer ventures are also adopting demanding work mentalities. For instance, AI coding startup Cognition, which recently acquired Windsurf, reportedly aims to aggressively shrink its team, with its CEO explicitly stating a disbelief in work-life balance. This approach, while potentially accelerating short-term gains, can lead to burnout, cultural friction, and a loss of institutional knowledge. For an AI startup , stability in leadership is vital for maintaining investor confidence, fostering long-term strategic planning, and ensuring consistent execution. Each executive departure can signal internal challenges, shifts in company direction, or a clash of philosophies, potentially impacting talent acquisition and market perception. The ability to retain top talent, especially in specialized fields like AI legal and compliance, is a competitive advantage. What’s Next for xAI? The Crucial Role of its New Legal Chief As Lily Lim steps into the pivotal role of Legal Chief at xAI , her background as a former NASA rocket scientist turned privacy and IP specialist positions her uniquely to tackle the complex legal and ethical challenges inherent in advanced AI development. Her expertise will be instrumental as xAI continues its rapid trajectory, particularly concerning data privacy, intellectual property rights for its groundbreaking models, and navigating the evolving regulatory landscape for artificial intelligence globally. The departure of a key executive, especially one responsible for legal oversight, often prompts scrutiny from stakeholders. However, the appointment of a highly qualified successor like Lim suggests xAI’s commitment to maintaining robust legal frameworks amidst its ambitious growth. The company’s ability to manage this transition smoothly, and to continue attracting and retaining top talent across all departments, will be a key indicator of its long-term success and stability in the highly competitive AI arena. The tech world, particularly the cutting-edge realm of AI, is characterized by both breathtaking innovation and intense corporate dynamics. Robert Keele’s departure from xAI underscores the personal and professional challenges inherent in such high-stakes environments, especially under visionary yet demanding leaders like Elon Musk. While his exit marks another instance of tech executive turnover within Musk’s ventures, the swift appointment of Lily Lim, with her unique blend of scientific and legal expertise, signals xAI’s continued focus on navigating its explosive growth with strong legal stewardship. The industry will undoubtedly watch closely to see how these leadership shifts impact the future trajectory of this influential AI startup .

Two names dominate the conversation this month—MAGACOIN FINANCE and SPX6900. Both projects are trending across online communities. One offers DeFi functionality and governance tools. The other rides the wave of meme coin culture with bold market satire. As capital moves out of large-cap stagnation, traders are hunting for high-upside opportunities. SPX6900 Hits New Highs as Meme Coin Craze Reignites SPX6900 (SPX), a community-driven meme coin parodying the S&P 500, is gaining rapid momentum. The token recently reached a new all-time high of $2.1. At press time, the coin is trading at $1.68 with a 6.39% increase in the past day. The appeal of SPX6900 lies in its cultural resonance. Traders are drawn to its humor, simplicity, and viral energy. Like other meme tokens, SPX thrives on community engagement. Its price action reflects strong retail enthusiasm, despite lacking a clear utility beyond speculation. Market watchers note that while the token is not tied to fundamental use cases, its strength lies in timing. Meme coin rallies often happen when sentiment is uncertain, and SPX6900 has captured that mood perfectly. Still, as with most meme tokens, the long-term outlook depends heavily on sustained hype. Traders entering now are betting on short-term continuation rather than structural longevity. Early Investors Back MAGACOIN FINANCE as Top Crypto Presale While meme coins dominate headlines, some investors are looking beyond quick gains. MAGACOIN FINANCE is rising as a serious contender in the presale space, offering structured DeFi capabilities and governance integration. Analysts have declared MAGACOIN FINANCE the best crypto presale for early adopters seeking big returns in the second quarter of this year. It appeals to investors aiming to front-run the next cycle with strategic positioning rather than viral momentum. Unlike meme projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE focuses on tools that support long-term use. These include yield-generation systems, voting rights through DAO governance, and tokenomics designed to reduce sell pressure over time. Community support is growing steadily. Discussions across forums highlight its potential to break out once listings go live. Investors view it as a high-upside, low-noise opportunity in a market dominated by short-term plays. MAGACOIN FINANCE vs SPX6900: What Sets Them Apart? SPX6900 thrives on meme energy and humor. Its recent gains show how strong communities can drive short-term momentum. On the other hand, MAGACOIN FINANCE focuses on function over hype. It offers real DeFi features like staking and governance. While SPX may appeal to meme coin traders seeking quick flips, MAGACOIN FINANCE attracts early adopters looking to build lasting positions. One leans into culture; the other leans into capability. The choice depends on whether an investor values fast-moving sentiment or long-term structure. Conclusion SPX6900 and MAGACOIN FINANCE both dominate August’s presale spotlight, but for very different reasons. SPX6900 captures the spirit of meme culture with its satirical edge and breakout price moves. MAGACOIN FINANCE, in contrast, offers a serious value proposition for early-stage DeFi investors looking beyond the hype. As the market recalibrates, both tokens serve distinct investor appetites—but only one may survive the shift from trend to utility.

Amid Arctic Pablo Coin Heating Up At $0.00071 As The Best Crypto To Buy Today,https://timestabloid.com/dogecoin-price-prediction-will-doge-hit-0-30-or-fall-to-0-15/,"Picture a cheeky pup chasing a penguin across a peanut farm—that’s Dogecoin for you. Playful origins, wild momentum, and enough surprise to keep even skeptics on their toes. Today, DOGE trades around $0.2059, backed by a market cap of ~$30.98B and about $1.19B in trading volume. Over the past week, it’s danced up about 8%, playing catch-up with market whispers and social media buzz. But just as DOGE tries to reclaim its bark, Arctic Pablo Coin is racing through the icy wilderness of crypto presales, raising over $3.25 million and climbing fast with its cartoon-fueled saga. While DOGE howls, Pablo’s snowmobile is revving toward the moon. The Bark Behind The Numbers: What’s Driving Doge These Days? Dogecoin isn’t just fluff. It’s sustained by a passionate pack, plus occasional howls from high-profile tweets and community charity efforts. At its core, DOGE runs on a proof‑of‑work blockchain with no supply cap, spitting out 10,000 DOGE per minute. That inflation‑friendly design favors use over hoarding. Its legacy lives on in stunts like funding space missions or sponsoring penguin rescue memes—er, Jamaican bobsled teams. Trend Tug: Will Doge Swing Up To $0.30? Charts suggest DOGE broke out of a downtrend, with whales quietly stocking up. Resistance sits around $0.23–$0.25, while bullish structure signals a possible 20% rally on a fresh tailwind. Further predictions anticipate a rise to nearly $0.24 by early September, riding neutral sentiment and steady volatility. Other analysts are even more optimistic, projecting $0.33 by end of 2025, while aggressive estimates go as high as $0.69 during a full-blown rally. Elon Musk’s track‑record of stirring the pot adds that meme‑fueled thrill—sometimes it’s all puppies and peanuts, sometimes it’s an engine roaring past expectations. Or Is the Floor Crumbling Toward $0.15? Let’s not sugarcoat it. The crypto herd moves quick. Weak macro conditions, fade in celebrity hype, or a slump in Bitcoin could nudge DOGE back toward $0.18, or even tango closer to $0.15 for liquidity grabs before a bounce. Some price forecasts eye a pullback to around $0.145, with mid‑range projections pegging $0.249 as the upper bound by 2026. That “golden cross” which sparked buzz in late July may be cooling off, with RSI and MACD tilting cautious amid a roughly 30% slide from July’s $0.28 peak to $0.19 support. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Frostbite Boss of 2025 Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just sliding into the meme coin presale scene—it’s crashing through it like a cartoon snowmobile strapped with rocket boosters. As buzz builds in the meme coin world, Pablo isn’t clowning around. He’s tearing up the rulebook and scribbling a new legend with every frozen step. Think of him as a fearless animated explorer, ripping through glacial ruins in search of ancient treasure—only the loot is $APC tokens, and the hype is very real. Currently priced at just $0.00071 in Stage 35, dubbed the “Frostfire Flats,” this frosty phenomenon has already raised over $3.25 million and is locked in for a $0.008 listing. That’s not a joke—that’s a 1026.76% ROI staring you in the face. For anyone scanning the horizon for the best crypto to buy today, Arctic Pablo Coin is looking like a serious front-runner. Let’s put it into “snow math.” Drop $25,000 today, and you scoop up 108,695,652 APC tokens. When it lists at $0.008, you’re looking at $869,565.22. But if Pablo blasts through market expectations and hits $0.10? You’re sitting on a bone-chilling 13,984.50% return. That’s not a moonshot—that’s a full-blown blizzard riding a rocket sled. So what’s powering this frozen freight train? Arctic Pablo Coin runs on the Binance Smart Chain, delivering low fees, fast transactions, and solid scalability. And it’s got a killer deflationary twist—every week, unsold presale tokens get burned to ashes, tightening the supply like an ice storm gripping a power line. It’s pure crypto economics, cartoon-styled and turbocharged, making Pablo one of the best cryptos to buy today. Each presale stage is more than just a lower price—it’s a fresh page in Pablo’s animated epic. With every week, the price ticks upward while the token supply melts away in a blizzard of burns. That’s the magic formula: rising demand, shrinking supply, and a wild narrative behind it all. It’s this electric combo that cements Arctic Pablo Coin as not just another meme project—but hands down one of the best cryptos to buy today for serious ROI hunters and meme coin thrill-seekers alike. Final Thoughts If the charts hold their grin and social buzz keeps huffing like a penguin on the prowl, $0.30 isn’t pie in the sky for DOGE—it’s within barking distance. Technical setups, solid predictions, and that dog-gone charm could catapult Dogecoin upward. But if sentiment cracks, regulators start barking louder than usual, or whales suddenly hit the brakes, the $0.15 zone might creep back in before DOGE gets another run at glory. While Dogecoin wobbles between breakout and breakdown, Arctic Pablo Coin is sledding full speed through presale territory with a 66% APY staking offer and over $3.25 million already raised—proving that in the meme coin jungle, it’s not always the oldest dog who leads the pack. Traders, developers, analysts, and crypto students alike must respect that DOGE walks a slippery slope—volatile, meme-powered, and emotionally charged. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpablo Glossary Proof‑of‑Work: The energy-based method miners use to add new blocks to the blockchain. Market Cap: Total value of DOGE in circulation (price × supply). Inflationary Supply: No hard cap on coins; new DOGE enters the market continuously. Golden Cross: A bullish indicator where a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term one. RSI/MACD: Technical analysis tools measuring momentum and signaling buy/sell conditions. Liquidity Zone: Price levels where orders gather, often triggering bounces. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Could DOGE hit $0.30 by year-end? Possibly—several analysts forecast upward trends, backed by bullish charts and rising community energy. Is $0.15 a realistic drop? If bearish sentiment grows or macro conditions worsen, 15 cents could act as a temporary floor. What role do whales play in DOGE’s price? Large holders often control big swings. Their moves can sharply inflate or deflate prices. How does inflationary supply affect DOGE? With no supply limits, new coins continuously dilute the price unless user demand keeps up. Which technical indicators are relevant here? The golden cross offers a bullish outlook, but RSI and MACD signal caution for now. Does Elon Musk still influence DOGE? Yes, though less than before. His mentions can still send DOGE soaring or spiraling. What should analysts watch next? Bitcoin’s movement, social media trends, whale wallets, and regulatory chatter all impact DOGE’s next leg.

In an interview with RBC-Ukraine , he called the use of crypto as a legal tender a “red line” for the NBU. “Virtual Assets Cannot be Means of Payments “ “It is important for us that our ‘red lines’ are clearly observed,” the governor said. “Virtual assets cannot be a means of payment, cannot in any way undermine the effectiveness of our monetary instruments.” He stressed that due to legalization of crypto, there shouldn’t be a transfer of monetary powers or weakening of the regulator’s instruments. Further, the governor warned that under martial law, crypto assets should not become a tool for circumventing currency restrictions. “The legalization of virtual assets should also not undermine our effectiveness in ensuring financial monitoring; the legislation in this area should implement the norms of international FATF standards and relevant European regulations,” the NBU head added. Governor Pyshnyy called for “the de-shadowing” of digital assets, which would have a positive impact on the reputation of the Ukrainian financial sector among international partners. NBU to Test CBDC, Governor Reveals e-Hryvnia Plans The NBU is experimenting the potential e-hryvnia architecture model and is currently preparing for a pilot project with a technological partner, the governor further noted. Given Ukraine’s European integration course, special attention is paid to the development of the Digital Euro project. “We want this pilot to give us as much information as possible to decide on a large-scale issue. At the same time, we are looking very closely at how the CBDC process is developing in other central banks,” Pyshny said. Though it is too early to reveal any timeframe on the launch of an e-hryvnia, he said the NBU is already working with the European Central Bank, the Bundesbank, the Bank of Belgium, the Bank of France, and the Bank of Singapore. In June, Ukrainian lawmakers proposed a draft bill that could allow the NBU to include Bitcoin and other crypto in its national reserves.

While the companies are pouring resources into AI to drive expansion, higher trade barriers put them at a disadvantage compared to global rivals with easier market access. These Chinese companies expect lower earnings after President Trump announced new tariffs in April. As they boost AI spending, they may reduce stock buybacks, which could hurt short-term profits. US tariffs reduce profits as tech giants shift focus to AI Even as relations between the US and China show slight improvement, Chinese tech giants continue to feel the heavy impact of the trade tariffs. The trade barriers targeting semiconductors and other important tech imports create uncertainty around profits and future growth for companies like Tencent, JD.com, and Hon Hai. Their earnings expectations have dropped because they still operate under intense cost pressure and are more exposed to these tariffs than their global competitors. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. is a Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer known for its partnership with Nvidia and its large role in global chip production. The company reported a slowdown in sales growth in July due to President Donald Trump’s proposed 100% tariff on Chinese-made chips. However, its investments in US-based data center infrastructure bring optimism about its long-term prospects in AI. Still, their momentum in the short run could be limited due to the weak near-term demand for consumer electronics such as smartphones and personal computers. As for Tencent, its next earnings report is expected to show net income growth of just 7.3%. This is the slowest rate it has seen in six quarters despite steady gains in its core advertising and video game businesses. The company’s AI initiatives are still in early stages and have yet to impact revenue. Analysts say its current business model relies heavily on its existing services, which could be the reason for Tencent’s slowdown. The company hopes that upcoming game releases, like Valorant Mobile and Honor of Kings: World, will help boost user engagement and improve future earnings. Meanwhile, JD.com’s double-digit growth across its retail, logistics, and emerging business segments contributed to its relatively strong numbers, with second-quarter revenue rising 15%. This shows the company is finding ways to adapt and grow even in a difficult economic climate. Still, analysts say the drag caused by ongoing tariffs continues to affect both domestic confidence and international trade flows, slowing China’s overall consumer spending. Chinese firms face local competition while chasing AI goals The Chinese government is now pushing back on “monopolies” like JD.com, Alibaba, and Meituan in China’s large and fast-moving food delivery market. Authorities want them to stop “disorderly competition,” as seen in their aggressive pricing, unsustainable discounts, and market behavior that harms smaller players and destabilizes the industry. The companies responded, promising to tone down these tactics and work toward fairer competition. This move will likely hurt short-term revenue growth for firms that had leaned heavily on aggressive pricing to gain market share, even though it may support long-term industry health. The targeted companies are also increasing their investments in artificial intelligence. Analysts say AI-related spending is starting to take precedence over shareholder-focused actions like stock buybacks. These firms risk weakening their short-term financial performance (a major concern for investors looking for immediate returns) by redirecting funds toward long-term innovation. Many Chinese are moving forward with the initiatives despite the risks and uncertainties. For example, Hon Hai recently sold its Ohio electric vehicle factory for $375 million. Analysts say the move aligns with the company’s strategy to focus more on North America’s data center technology and artificial intelligence infrastructure. JD.com is also expanding its logistics capabilities and broadening its product offerings beyond traditional retail. At the same time, Tencent continues to rely on its strong gaming and advertising platforms to fund its AI development. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Their investment in American Bitcoin follows their $2 million donation to Trump’s 2024 campaign, participation in White House crypto summits, and public support for Trump-era crypto legislation like the GENIUS Act. Gemini also filed for an IPO in June after the SEC—now led by Trump appointee Paul Atkins—dropped an earlier probe into the company. Additionally, reports suggest the twins may have influenced the delay of Brian Quintenz’s nomination to lead the CFTC. Meanwhile, Donald Trump nominated Stephen Miran to a temporary Fed seat. Winklevoss Twins Deepen Ties with Trump Family Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the billionaire co-founders of the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, reportedly invested in American Bitcoin. This is a mining company with direct ties to the Trump family. The investment was revealed in a Bloomberg report that cited Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot, who confirmed the twins’ financial involvement in the mining firm that was co-founded by Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and other partners. Although the exact amount of the investment is not clear, the move still strengthens the growing alliance between the Winklevoss brothers and President Donald Trump’s inner circle. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss American Bitcoin is planning to go public through a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining, which was announced earlier this year. This latest development now also adds to a series of interactions between the Winklevoss twins and the Trump family. In 2024, the Gemini co-founders made a $2 million contribution to Trump’s presidential campaign , attended various inauguration-related events, and participated in a high-profile White House crypto summit in March. More recently, the brothers were present at the July 18 signing of the GENIUS Act. This is legislation specifically aimed at regulating payment stablecoins. During the signing, President Trump personally acknowledged their efforts and support. Their company, Gemini, also made headlines in June after filing for an initial public offering (IPO) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The regulatory landscape seemed more favorable for the firm over the past few months. In February, the SEC—now chaired by Trump appointee Paul Atkins—dropped a previous investigation into Gemini regarding the alleged offering of unregistered securities through its Earn program. Additionally, reports from Politico suggest that the Winklevoss twins may have influenced the White House's delay in moving forward with the nomination of Brian Quintenz to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Although the twins openly voiced their support for Quintenz earlier, sources indicate they may have recently lobbied against his appointment. A vote on his nomination by the Senate Agriculture Committee was postponed before the August recess, which left the matter unresolved for now. Trump Picks Stephen Miran for Temporary Fed Seat Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump very recently announced that he plans to nominate Stephen Miran, the current chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, to temporarily fill the seat of outgoing Federal Reserve Board of Governors member Adriana Kugler. Kugler's resignation becomes effective on Friday, and it opens a crucial vacancy on the Fed board. Trump’s pick could influence the direction of US monetary policy, including decisions around federal interest rates. Miran will serve in the interim role until Jan. 31, 2026, while the administration searches for a permanent appointee. Adriana Kugler’s resignation announcement (Source: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ) Trump reportedly considered a shortlist of candidates including economic adviser Kevin Hassett, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, and two others before settling on Miran. The nomination, however, must still be approved by the Senate. No explanation was given for Kugler’s sudden departure, which adds to the uncertainty surrounding the Fed's future leadership and decision-making, especially as inflation and interest rates remain central concerns for the US economy. Both Hassett and Warsh are well known people in economic and financial circles. Hassett, who previously directed the National Economic Council during Trump’s earlier term, disclosed in June that he held between $1 million and $5 million in shares of Coinbase Global, a major cryptocurrency exchange. Warsh, who served on the Fed board from 2006 to 2011, is open to blockchain innovations, and even suggested that such technologies could benefit the US central bank’s payment systems. President Donbald Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell Trump’s historically tense relationship with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom he nominated in his first term, continues to raise questions about the Fed’s independence under his administration. Legal scholars debated whether the president even has the authority to remove Powell without cause, but a Supreme Court ruling in April expanded presidential control over certain federal agencies. This very likely paved the way for stronger White House influence on Fed policy in the future.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|MINING|EXCHANGE|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-08 05:30:00

Binance streamlines off-ramping of crypto JUST IN: Binance users in Europe can now convert crypto to fiat and withdraw funds directly to eligible Mastercard cards. pic.twitter.com/aANf1x6Woo — Cryptopolitan (@CPOfficialtx) August 7, 2025 Mastercard said its new feature will allow users to sell their crypto and transfer the fiat balance to their card, or withdraw their funds to their card. The company said the feature streamlines off-ramping crypto with speed, simplicity, and security for users across Europe and the United Kingdom. The firm also added another withdrawal option to bank transfers and other supported methods. The feature is currently available for Euro-based payouts, with support for more fiat currencies coming soon. Mastercard said the sell to card feature is ideal for users who hold virtual currencies and are looking to liquidate quickly. The withdrawal to card feature suits users who already have fiat in their Binance accounts and would like to move the funds fast, directly to their debit or credit card. “At Binance, we are proud of our focus on users which has garnered the trust of nearly 300 million users and continue to further the experience for them. The new Sell to Card and Withdraw to Card features streamline and enhance the user experience, making payouts of crypto proceeds simpler and faster than ever for our users.” – Thomas Gregory, Vice President of Fiat at Binance. Gregory mentioned that Binance aims to continue expanding its services with global leaders and innovators in digital payments, such as Mastercard. The firm also wants to widen access and possibilities for its 300 million global users. He added that Binance is hoping to support more products and features. Gregory also acknowledged that the company remains committed to the high standards of regulatory compliance, along with its security and user protection efforts.

He argued that the new features on Binance are meant to offer its users a better payout experience. Europe wants to ease identity verification with EUDI Wallets On Monday, Europe wants to launch the European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet to streamline identity verification. Mastercard argued that digital identity should feel as natural and reliable as making a payment. The European Commission expects nearly 80% of EU citizens to use EUDIs by 2030 for everyday tasks. The wallet is meant to be a seamless alternative for secure authentication (SCA) and more. Mastercard said it’s working to make Europe’s digital identity ecosystem simple and secure, starting with ensuring age verification works smoothly and protects users. It also contributes to initiatives funded by the European Commission to pilot EUDI Wallets. The payment platform acknowledged that its partnership with identity innovators like Lissi is meant to securely tokenize its payment credentials and integrate them into EUDI Wallets. Mastercard aims to make its credentials universally accessible and trusted by consumers, businesses, and governments alike. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity revealed that identity theft accounts for over 40% of online fraud in the bloc. Over 60% of Europeans also experience a hard time with ID verifications, which leads to abandoned transactions. Mastercard believes there’s a clear need for a trusted and consistent way to verify identity for the more than 500 million Europeans who access everything from financial services to government portals. It has partnered with entities like EMVCo, the FIDO Alliance, and the OpenWallet Foundation, hosted by Linux Foundation Europe, to build a secure and consistent global identity ecosystem.

Notably, XRP has rebounded considerably from its recent correction, but its price still hovers around the $3 range. It staged a strong recovery following the latest development in the Ripple vs. SEC case, as both sides filed to withdraw their respective appeals, effectively closing a nearly five-year legal battle. This month, XRP is now posting a meager 1.43% gain, having reclaimed all it lost earlier in the month. Still, currently trading for $3.36, many analysts and investors believe XRP remains undervalued and should be trading much higher.The Journey Through a 2% Consistent Monthly IncreaseSome market watchers expect it to eventually hit double or even triple-digit prices. With these expectations in mind, we recently examined what would happen if XRP grew by a modest but consistent 2% each month, starting in September 2025 and continuing through July 2040.Our assessment found that XRP would close out 2025 at $3.64, representing an 8.3% gain. While this is positive, it would be underwhelming for most investors, especially since XRP already reached a yearly high of $3.66 in July. Notably, in contrast, market analyst Alex Cobb has already forecast a potential surge to $22.54 by December 2025, which massively exceeds the $3.64 outcome under the 2% growth scenario.However, the beauty of relentless growth comes from its consistency over a longer period of time. Specifically, by December 2026, XRP's price would rise to $4.61. A year later, in December 2027, it would climb to $5.86. This would represent a 74% increase in just two years.Meanwhile, by December 2030, the projection places XRP at $12.01, aligning with asset manager Bitwise's base-case forecast of $12.68 for that year, which assumes an annualized growth rate of 27%. Interestingly, in their more optimistic bull case, Bitwise expects XRP to reach $29.32 by 2030.XRP Price by July 2040 If It Grows 2% Each MonthNow, if the steady 2% monthly increase continued from the $12.01 level in December 2030, XRP would break the $100 barrier by 2040. In January 2040, it would trade at $101.67, and by July 2040, it would reach $119.81. This marks a 3,465% gain from its August 2025 price of $3.36. Interestingly, this final price matches forecasts from Telegaon analysts, who put XRP's minimum price for 2040 at $119.08. Notably, these analysts also expect XRP to hit a maximum price of $160.34 by 2040. XRP Price Predictions Telegaon XRP Price Predictions | Telegaon Meanwhile, for long-term holders, the 2% growth would lead to remarkable returns. For instance, an investor who committed $10,000 at today's price of $3.36 would acquire 2,976 XRP tokens. Holding them until July 2040 at the projected $119.81 price would turn that investment into over $356,000.However, it's worth noting that sustaining a 2% monthly increase for 15 straight years is highly improbable. Historically, XRP's longest streak of consecutive monthly gains lasted just four months, from March to June 2017. Moreover, XRP also has a reputation for sharp, sporadic price surges, such as those seen in November 2024 and January 2025. This suggests it is unlikely to follow such a smooth growth path over the long term, especially one as meager as 2%.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|ZRX,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-08-08 05:46:54

Analysts Explain,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-does-adding-bitcoin-and-altcoins-to-retirement-plans-in-the-us-mean-analysts-explain/,"United States President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will allow Americans to add digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum to their 401(k)s, which are retirement accounts. While this development caused a rise in the cryptocurrency markets, analysts say that this could open the door to a long-term rally. Tom Dunleavy, Head of Ventures at Varys Capital, stated that this decision could generate billions of dollars in investment flows into digital assets. “When Americans receive their biweekly paychecks, typically a 1% to 10% cut is transferred to their 401(k) accounts,” Dunleavy said, noting that this money has traditionally been channeled into approximately 60% stocks and 40% bonds. “If suddenly 5% of that allocation were allocated to cryptocurrencies, billions of dollars could flow into this asset class in the coming years.” According to Dunleavy, this regular capital flow can also provide price stability by creating a “floor price” for assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The executive order will allow individuals to include alternative investments such as private equity, real estate and cryptocurrency in their 401(k) accounts, Bloomberg reported. Related News: And Donald Trump Signs Historic Order: US Retirement Plans Will Be Able to Purchase Cryptocurrency Ryan Rasmussen, Head of Research at Bitwise, said the short-term impact of the decree sends a message to investors that cryptocurrencies are now on permanent regulatory footing: “Such signals will continue to push the market higher.” Rasmussen argued that 401(k) accounts encompass trillions of dollars in total assets, and there is a constant flow of capital into these accounts through regular payroll deductions: “If crypto captures even just 1% of 401(k) assets, that would represent $125 billion in new capital. A 3% share would generate $375 billion, and a 5% share would generate $625 billion in capital inflows. That's serious long-term buying pressure.” Rasmussen also said that the decision creates huge potential for crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, both in the short term and in the medium-long term. Both analysts noted that Bitcoin and Ethereum would benefit the most, as these two assets are currently available to investors through exchange-traded funds (ETFs): “Because these crypto assets are already available in ETF form, it will be easier for 401(k) providers to add them to their investment menus.” *This is not investment advice.

Stage 4 of Bitcoin Swift just opened, and the wave of momentum behind it is impossible to ignore. The numbers are rising. The hype is loud. And for those watching closely, it’s clear this isn’t just another token launch. This is a movement. It’s bold, fast, and built for people who are tired of complex roadmaps that lead nowhere. BTC3 isn’t promising a revolution someday. It’s delivering results today. With momentum that rivals the early days of Ethereum and mechanics that feel like they were designed by a fintech mastermind, Bitcoin Swift is redefining what success in a presale looks like. And if you’re still sitting on the sidelines, the clock is working against you. Forget Slow-Drip Presales. Bitcoin Swift Is Speedrunning Success Most presales stretch out over months and barely cross six figures in volume. Bitcoin Swift (BTC3) crushed those norms. Stage 4 has just opened, and the protocol has already brought in over $580K, with more than 2,100 active investors. And it’s not just about the numbers, it’s about what they represent: trust, demand, and velocity. Part of what makes this moment historic is how BTC3 simplifies everything. Programmable staking rewards, also known as PoY rewards, are automatically distributed at the end of each stage. You don’t need to lock tokens forever. You participate. You earn. And you move forward. With Stage 4 delivering 106% APY, those who jump in now are not just early. They’re smart. Bitcoin Swift Brings the Tools. You Bring the Gains Bitcoin Swift is not selling dreams. It’s deploying tech that’s already working. At its core, BTC3 is built to deliver wealth directly to users through: AI-enhanced programmable rewards that remove manual claims and complexity Energy-efficient smart contract execution that uses less than 1% of Bitcoin’s energy while maintaining robust performance A governance system that actually puts power in the hands of users, not backroom whales The BTC3 network doesn’t stop at buzzwords. It’s equipped with scalable features, and real-time data indicates one of the highest liquidity levels compared to other tokens at the same stage. That means stronger price support, better trading flow, and more confidence for everyone involved. In the current market, liquidity isn’t just a metric; it’s a moat. Influencers Are Digging Deep and Loving What They See Crypto communities aren’t sleeping on this. In-depth coverage from creators like Bull Run Angel and Token Galaxy is helping explain why BTC3 is drawing serious attention. From protocol simplicity to the power of the PoY model, their reviews confirm what early adopters already knew: Bitcoin Swift might just be the smartest bet this cycle. And the buzz is translating into real traction. According to some leaked internal chatter, the team is already reaching out to several top exchanges. Rumors mention MEXC, KuCoin, and LBank as early targets for listings. If those discussions turn into reality, BTC3 is about to go from fast-moving to unstoppable. Audits, KYC, and a Third Surprise Incoming Security is always at the core of any sustainable project, and Bitcoin Swift doesn’t skip corners. The project is already audited by both Spywolf and Solidproof , and the KYC has been completed, showing full team transparency. But that’s not all. According to internal sources from the team, they’re actively working on a third audit with a highly respected blockchain security firm. That’s a strong sign of long-term thinking and an extra layer of confidence for anyone still watching from the sidelines. BTC3’s Road Ahead Looks Nothing Like the Past With BTC3 already shaking up the way presales are done, the roadmap ahead continues that trend: zk-SNARK integration for bulletproof privacy Launch of the AI-governed on-chain sandbox Full DID privacy layer rollout BTC3 mainnet going live in 2026 Institutional onboarding and regulatory integration Each step pushes BTC3 deeper into real utility, and that’s exactly what separates hype from legacy. Conclusion: You’re Watching History Unfold. Don’t Miss It Presales come and go. Most fade before they even light a spark. But Bitcoin Swift is igniting a full-blown fire. With one of the fastest-growing communities, strong liquidity, a user-first design, and rewards that literally pay you for being early, BTC3 is proving that the new standard isn’t just possible, it’s already here. The only real question is this. When the price hits $15, do you want to be the one telling your friends you got in at $4, or the one pretending you never saw this?

Currently trading at around $0.3392, the asset has also posted a 1.5% gain in the past 24 hours. These developments occur amid growing on-chain activity, particularly driven by the increased use of the TRON network for Tether (USDT) transactions, positioning the blockchain as a major player in the stablecoin infrastructure space. One of the key observations has been the network’s sharp rise in USDT transaction volume. According to CryptoQuant contributor Arab Chain, TRON processed over 8.29 million USDT transactions in the week ending August 3, 2025. This figure not only indicates heightened activity but also reveals the diversity of transaction sizes across the network. Transfers between $101 and $1,000 made up the largest proportion at 38.66%, with significant activity also observed in transactions exceeding $1,000. Related Reading: TRON Inc. Plans $1B Buyback of 3.1B TRX Tokens Amid Price Resilience at $0.33 TRON’s Dual Adoption: Retail and Institutional Activity on the Rise Arab Chain emphasized that this distribution highlights TRON’s appeal across different user groups. The presence of mid-sized transactions suggests usage by freelancers, online vendors, and remittance users. In contrast, the substantial number of larger transactions implies participation by institutional traders, high-net-worth individuals, and potentially corporate entities. The analyst also noted a decline in transactions below $10, suggesting a reduced reliance on micro-payments or testing activity and a pivot toward practical use cases. The growing use of TRON for real-world settlement purposes is reinforced by its infrastructure, which supports low-cost, high-volume stablecoin transactions. Unlike networks that cater predominantly to large institutional transfers, TRON’s environment facilitates both high-frequency and high-value transfers. Arab Chain stated that this makes TRON a core component in enabling digital commerce, payroll systems, and cross-border payments. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci linked TRX’s recent momentum to regulatory developments in the United States. On July 18, 2025, the US Congress passed the GENIUS Act, marking the first formal federal regulatory framework for payment stablecoins. Kesmeci noted that this legislation provides a clearer legal foundation for dollar-backed digital assets by establishing guidelines for anti-money laundering (AML), consumer protection, and financial stability. Post-GENIUS Act: TRON Expands USDT Dominance Following the passage of the GENIUS Act, TRON moved swiftly to expand its footprint. According to Kesmeci, approximately $1 billion worth of new USDT was minted on the TRON network shortly after the bill became law. This increased TRX’s share of the total circulating USDT supply to over 83 billion out of 163 billion, accounting for approximately 51% of all USDT in circulation. The analyst suggested that this reinforces TRON’s position as the leading blockchain for stablecoin transfers. The GENIUS Act may catalyze stablecoin adoption in the US, with TRON expected to benefit due to its efficiency in handling stablecoin transactions.

Grok crypto analysts are highlighting the best altcoins to buy in 2025, and investors can’t stop talking about RXS crypto and world liberty financial. Yet, in a market crowded with hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building a real case as the next big crypto, ready for an 80x surge as buyer activity explodes. Why Is Everyone Talking About Rexas Finance? Rexas Finance crypto has turned into a headline machine for presale watch fans. Between September 2024 and June 2025, Rexas Finance smashed records by raising more than $50 million across 12 presale stages. The RXS crypto price jumped from $0.03 to $0.20 before exchange debut—locking in a massive 600% gain for early believers. Such numbers have driven Rexas Finance to breakout status in the best altcoins to buy in 2025, with Grok crypto forums and presale watch groups buzzing about every update. Media coverage has also pushed terms like “rexas finance crypto” and “rxs crypto price” into Google’s trending searches, making RXS one of the most-searched August 2025 crypto presales. Investors are comparing RXS to world liberty financial, wondering if Rexas is the next big crypto for this cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE Readies for Surge as Buyer Activity Peaks Grok crypto experts are clear: the best altcoins to buy in 2025 aren’t just about hype—they need community, momentum, and a plan for real growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing attention from presale watch trackers everywhere. As August 2025 crypto presales heat up, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out with its unique blend of meme coin fun, DeFi features, and a rock-solid anti-centralization message. What’s behind the excitement? Unlike many trending coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is delivering utility from day one. With staking rewards, strong governance, the token is now flagged as a top crypto presale for the year.

The parties filed the motion yesterday under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 42(b)(1), officially bringing their nearly five-year legal tussle to an end. Notably, the SEC and Ripple submitted a joint stipulation for dismissal following an internal vote at the commission yesterday. With most commissioners favoring a dismissal, the SEC, Ripple, and its execs–Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse–jointly agree to withdraw the appeal and cross-appeal. According to the motion, each party would bear its own costs and fees. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), Stuart Alderoty, also confirmed the parties’ move to dismiss their appeals in the Second Circuit. Notably, Alderoty declared an end to the longstanding lawsuit, emphasizing that Ripple is now back to business. https://twitter.com/FilanLaw/status/1953565962810093785SEC v. Ripple Case OverviewFor context, the SEC officially introduced the Ripple case on December 22, 2020. It alleged that the company violated federal securities laws by illegally selling XRP to U.S. investors. Notably, the case began in full in early 2021. After a heated legal battle that cost Ripple over $150 million, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres issued her summary judgment decision in July 2023. In the ruling , she held that XRP is not a security in itself and that Ripple’s programmatic sales of the token on digital exchanges were not investment contracts. However, she declared that Ripple violated the law via its past XRP sales to institutions. For this violation, the judge ordered Ripple to pay a fine of $125 million and also imposed a permanent injunction on the company’s future institutional sales. Ripple and SEC Appeals Unsatisfied with the verdict, the SEC, under the leadership of Gary Gensler, initiated an appeal, challenging the judge’s programmatic sales ruling. Ripple followed suit and filed a cross-appeal to overturn the decision on its past institutional sales. Following the re-election of President Donald Trump, the regulatory landscape shifted, and market watchers widely speculated that the parties would drop their appeals. That projection materialized in early 2025 when the SEC and Ripple agreed to pursue a resolution. The agreement involves modifying Judge Torres’ final judgment to potentially slash Ripple’s fine from $125 million to $50 million and dismiss the permanent injunction. Judge Torres declined to modify her final decision but urged the parties to withdraw their respective appeals. The SEC and Ripple have finally decided to end their longstanding legal battle by officially filing a joint motion to dismiss their appeals. Once the Second Circuit enters the motion, the parties’ appeals will be terminated, ending the nearly five-year lawsuit surrounding XRP and Ripple. XRP Sees Double-Digit GainsAs expected, the move significantly impacted the price of XRP, which initially plunged below the $3 mark earlier this week. With the parties filing the joint motion for dismissal, XRP rallied significantly to an intra-day high of $3.38. It is currently trading at $3.34, marking an upsurge of 12.34% over the past day and 12.27% in the past week.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|Ripple v.

Key Takeaways: Binance partnered with BBVA to offer off-exchange asset custody, aiming to boost investor trust. Client funds will be held in U.S. Treasuries at BBVA and accepted by Binance as trading margin. BBVA’s growing crypto services reflect stronger bank participation following clearer U.S. and EU regulations. Sources familiar with the arrangement told the Financial Times that BBVA is now one of a select group of independent custodians working with the world’s largest crypto exchange. The partnership comes as trading platforms work to reassure clients in the wake of the 2022 collapse of FTX, which trapped billions in customer funds and prompted a rush toward independent custody solutions. Clearer US and EU Rules Spur Traditional Banks’ Move Into Crypto Traditional banks, meanwhile, have shown greater willingness to enter the crypto space following the rollout of clearer regulations in the U.S. and EU. BBVA’s brand strength adds weight to Binance’s custody offering. “If you say BBVA, people are like ‘box tick, next’,” one person familiar with the deal said, highlighting the ease of due diligence for potential users. Under the arrangement, client funds are held by BBVA in U.S. Treasuries, which Binance then accepts as margin for trades — a structure designed to avoid an “FTX 2.0” scenario. Binance began offering third-party custody options early last year through partners like Switzerland’s Sygnum and FlowBank, following customer pressure to mitigate counterparty risk. Prior to that, client assets were held either on the exchange or with Ceffu, a custodian U.S. authorities had described as closely linked to Binance. The move also reflects shifting market sentiment. Support from the Trump administration has fueled record Bitcoin prices and higher trading volumes, encouraging banks to deepen their involvement with digital assets. BBVA has been expanding its crypto services in line with growing demand from its retail base. In July, the bank launched Bitcoin and Ether trading and custody directly via its mobile app for Spanish customers and advised private banking clients to allocate up to 7% of their portfolios to crypto. Binance teams up with BBVA to let customers keep assets off exchange, FT reports https://t.co/wBWw2bb7jm https://t.co/wBWw2bb7jm — Reuters Business (@ReutersBiz) August 8, 2025 CZ Seeks Dismissal of FTX’s $1.76B Lawsuit Just recently, Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) filed a motion to dismiss a $1.76 billion clawback lawsuit brought by the FTX bankruptcy trust. He argued the Delaware court lacks jurisdiction over him, as he resides in the United Arab Emirates and the case has little connection to U.S. law or territory. His legal team claims that FTX’s accusations are legally unsupported and irrelevant to federal securities regulations. FTX filed the suit in late 2024 , aiming to recover $1.76 billion it says was improperly transferred to Binance during a 2021 share purchase agreement. The now-bankrupt exchange contends the transaction was fraudulent, given its undisclosed insolvency at the time. Binance has consistently labeled the claims as meritless and an attempt to shift blame away from FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. In the latest filing, CZ criticized FTX’s efforts to “nonsensically blame” him and Binance for Bankman-Fried’s misconduct. He maintains that the allegations do not meet legal standards for constructive fraud.

According to Glassnode’s Week 32 BTC Market Pulse report , BTC is showing fragile structure and thinning liquidity, putting it at risk of further decline. While oversold RSI levels and signs of seller exhaustion could invite a bounce, trading behavior suggests caution is winning out. Still, one thing couldn’t be clearer: as big-money brag tracks slow down, emerging cryptocurrencies are starting to steal the spotlight – especially MAGACOIN FINANCE, whose price seems to tick higher every few hours and just launched a new presale round after the previous one sold out in minutes. Spot, Derivatives & ETF Indicators Signal Caution Spot Market Bitcoin’s RSI dropped to 35.8, signaling oversold conditions. Meanwhile, Cumulative Volume Delta plunged – from $107 million to $220 million – indicating a surge in sell-side activity. Daily trading volume also slipped from $8.4 billion to $7.5 billion , highlighting waning participation just below the $114K threshold. Futures and Options Futures markets have cooled down. Open Interest fell from $45.6B to $44.9B , funding rates declined by nearly 33%, and Perpetual CVD dropped from – $1.2B to – $1.8B, showing strong distribution. Options activity dipped : Open Interest is down 8.4%, and volatility spreads tightened, while a rise in the 25-Delta Skew suggests more investors are buying hedges than placing bets. ETF Activity and On-Chain Metrics ETF inflows have slowed, down 25% toward $269M, but trading volume climbed to $19.8B, showing buyers are watching. On-chain, addresses grew by 3.6%, but transferred volume and fees dropped—suggesting users aren’t interacting as much. All in all, sentiment shifted from bullish euphoria toward cautious reevaluation. What Sets MAGACOIN FINANCE Apart in Volatile Times While Bitcoin struggles to regain its footing, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale traction continues going vertical . The token’s price now updates in near-real-time, with each new round launching within a few hours of announcement because the previous round sold out almost instantly . Investors are praising its execution. The marketing and technical roadmap is clearly built out, and security audits have passed with flying colors. But what’s turning heads most is the demand curve – so many wallets are stacking early that the presale rounds now conclude f aster than they can be announced . Analysts who once spotted early gains in projects like PEPE are now saying MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the breakout moment of 2025. With listings expected soon and a rare price acceleration pattern visible in real time, this isn’t just hype, it’s early entry. Risk and Timing Bitcoin remains vital infrastructure and a global store of value, but in its current state, upside potential seems capped, at least in the near term. Many investors are tired of waiting for macro catalysts and are rotating capital toward presales where growth can happen before listings . MAGACOIN FINANCE offers exactly that : rapid price movement, a tight schedule, and a growing community – everything investors used to seek in earlier cycles. And while Bitcoin depends on ETF flows or macro events to drive value, MAGACOIN is building value from the ground up. Conclusion: When Momentum Shifts, Be Where Growth Starts Glassnode’s latest indicators make one thing clear: Bitcoin’s structure is shaky, and markets are switching toward evaluation mode. That’s left room for volatility – but also for opportunity. If you’re searching for something moving right now , not next quarter or next year, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing signs of real momentum. With every presale round launching after the prior one sold out , and pricing updating hourly, the narrative is shifting. While Bitcoin reassesses, presale investors are already betting on where the next phase of crypto could begin.

The asset recently bounced from the $0.732 level -its 200-day EMA – and tested resistance near $0.7925, sparking optimism among traders. However, a new TD Sequential ‘Sell’ signal on the 4-hour chart, shared by analyst Ali Martinez, indicates that momentum may be running out of steam. This signal has historically marked periods of local exhaustion following short-term price surges. As a result, traders are watching closely to see whether ADA can hold its ground or if it’s due for a cooldown. The timing is critical, especially with other altcoins starting to rotate upward and ecosystem-specific upgrades helping to fuel Cardano’s narrative. While ADA continues to benefit from a solid community and protocol improvements, newer entrants like MAGACOIN FINANCE are starting to gain serious traction . As early-stage crypto investments come back into vogue, analysts are tracking this rising altcoin as a fresh contender in the current risk-on cycle. Cardano’s On-Chain Governance Milestone Adds Fuel Cardano’s bullish undercurrent remains supported by strong community participation. A recent on-chain governance vote saw 74% of ADA holders approve a $71 million treasury withdrawal to fund scaling upgrades including Hydra, Mithril, and Ouroboros Leios. Hydra alone is designed to support over 1 million transactions per second (TPS) via off-chain processing. Coupled with accountability measures – like milestone-based funding tied to development progress – these upgrades provide fundamental backing to Cardano’s long-term roadmap. But the altcoin isn’t moving in isolation . The broader altcoin market, reflected in the TOTAL2 index, has broken its recent downtrend, while Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) fell from 62.5% to 61.2%. Capital is rotating into names like ENA (+12%), MYX (+100%), and ADA, suggesting renewed trader appetite for riskier assets. Still, spot volumes are 65% lower than last month, hinting at cautious optimism. MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Deliver 64x Gains, Analysts Say Against this backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing increased attention for its explosive potential. The project has been crowned by multiple analysts as the top crypto presale for ROI-hungry investors, with some forecasting it could deliver a 64X return in the next market cycle. This bold projection stems from a mix of strategic momentum and limited early access. The MAGACOIN FINANCE presale has been progressing rapidly, with each round selling out in record time . The latest stage just launched after the previous one closed within minutes – driven by a flood of new investors looking to capture the early mover advantage. The project’s fundamentals are also earning trust: MAGACOIN recently secured top security audit scores, reinforcing confidence among risk-conscious buyers. Beyond hype, what sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its blend of timing and traction. With major exchange listings on the horizon, its current price point represents a unique opportunity. For those who missed early-stage entries in coins like ADA, MAGACOIN could be the one chance to catch a similar breakout before it makes headlines. Technical View: Caution Still Warranted for ADA From a technical lens, ADA is flashing mixed signals. While RSI is rebounding from oversold territory and the MACD histogram suggests waning bearish pressure, the TD Sequential “9” sell signal can’t be ignored. If ADA breaks below the $0.74 threshold on rising volume, traders may look to the $0.72–$0.70 zone for the next area of support. On the other hand, a close above $0.7925 could confirm continuation toward $0.8449 and set the stage for a local breakout . For now, ADA’s near-term fate hinges on whether momentum can overcome exhaustion . Conclusion: Big Coins vs Big Gains Cardano’s fundamentals remain strong, and its community continues to push the project forward. But for investors hunting outsized returns in a fast-moving market, legacy coins like ADA may offer slower upside compared to early-stage projects. That’s why analysts are increasingly turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE. With exchange listings coming soon and analysts saying it can deliver 64X , its window of opportunity may not stay open for long . For those aiming to ride the next breakout wave, MAGACOIN FINANCE looks well-positioned to lead the charge.

A significant announcement recently came from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) governor, Andriy Pyshnyy, regarding Ukraine crypto legalization . While supporting the legal status of digital assets, he drew a firm “red line” against their use for payments, effectively implementing a crypto payment ban to protect monetary stability. This development marks a crucial moment for how digital currencies might integrate into the nation’s economy. What is Ukraine’s Stance on Crypto Legalization? Andriy Pyshnyy, the head of the National Bank of Ukraine , has openly expressed his support for bringing cryptocurrencies into a legal framework. This move aims to provide clarity and regulation for digital assets within the country. However, there’s a significant caveat that creates a clear boundary for their use. The NBU supports the legalization of cryptocurrencies as assets. This means they can be owned, traded, and potentially taxed. The goal is to integrate them responsibly into the existing financial system. Why the Firm Crypto Payment Ban? Despite the backing for Ukraine crypto legalization , Governor Pyshnyy drew a firm “red line” regarding their use as a means of payment. This strong opposition, effectively a crypto payment ban , stems from a fundamental concern: safeguarding monetary policy. Allowing cryptocurrencies to function as payment instruments could undermine the NBU’s control over the national currency, the hryvnia, and its overall economic stability. The central bank believes that maintaining a monopoly on money issuance is vital for effective economic management. A widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies for payments could: Complicate the NBU’s ability to manage inflation. Reduce the effectiveness of interest rate policies. Introduce systemic risks to the financial system. Therefore, while you might be able to own crypto in Ukraine, don’t expect to pay for your groceries with Bitcoin anytime soon. This consistent crypto payment ban is a strategic decision to protect the nation’s financial sovereignty. Developing the E-Hryvnia: Ukraine’s Own Digital Currency While traditional cryptocurrencies face payment restrictions, the National Bank of Ukraine is actively exploring its own digital solution: the e-hryvnia . This central bank digital currency (CBDC) represents a modern approach to money, aiming to combine the benefits of digital technology with the stability of a national currency. The NBU is not just talking about it; they are already taking concrete steps: A pilot project for the e-hryvnia is currently under development. They are partnering with a technology provider to bring this vision to life. This initiative shows a proactive stance in embracing digital finance under controlled conditions. The development of a Ukrainian CBDC signifies the country’s commitment to innovation within its financial infrastructure, ensuring it remains competitive and secure in the global digital economy. Collaborating on CBDC Development: A Global Endeavor The National Bank of Ukraine is not working in isolation on its Ukrainian CBDC project. They are keenly observing and learning from similar initiatives worldwide. Collaboration is key in this evolving space, and the NBU is actively engaging with prominent international financial institutions. Their partners in this exploration include: The European Central Bank (ECB) The Bundesbank (Germany’s central bank) The Bank of Belgium The Bank of France The Bank of Singapore This international cooperation allows the NBU to leverage global expertise, share insights, and ensure that their e-hryvnia project benefits from the best practices in CBDC development. It also underscores the growing global trend towards official digital currencies. In conclusion, Ukraine crypto legalization is moving forward, but with a clear distinction between cryptocurrencies as assets and as payment methods. The National Bank of Ukraine is demonstrating a balanced and cautious approach, embracing digital innovation through its e-hryvnia while safeguarding its monetary policy. This dual strategy positions Ukraine as a thoughtful player in the evolving global digital finance landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the current stance of Ukraine’s central bank on cryptocurrencies? Ukraine’s central bank supports the legalization of cryptocurrencies as assets, meaning they can be owned and traded. However, they firmly oppose their use as a means of payment. 2. Why does Ukraine’s central bank oppose crypto as a payment method? The central bank views the use of cryptocurrencies for payments as a “red line” because it could undermine their monetary policy, control over the national currency (hryvnia), and overall financial stability. 3. What is the e-hryvnia? The e-hryvnia is a central bank digital currency (CBDC) being developed by the National Bank of Ukraine. It is a digital form of the national currency, designed to be stable and secure. 4. Is the e-hryvnia a cryptocurrency? No, the e-hryvnia is a central bank digital currency (CBDC), which is different from decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. A CBDC is issued and backed by a central bank, providing stability and regulatory oversight. 5. Which international banks is the NBU collaborating with on CBDC development? The National Bank of Ukraine is collaborating with several international institutions, including the European Central Bank, Bundesbank, Bank of Belgium, Bank of France, and Bank of Singapore, to learn from their CBDC initiatives. 6. Can I legally own cryptocurrencies in Ukraine? Yes, based on the NBU’s stance on Ukraine crypto legalization , owning cryptocurrencies as assets is supported within a legal framework, though using them for payments is currently prohibited.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is fast approaching the key psychological level at $4,000. This comes after a good week where the price increased by 6%. This is the first time since 2024 when ETH is about to test this resistance. It would be surprising to see Ethereum break $4,000 and move higher without any sellers making there presence known. Therefore, expect a lot of volatility as the price inches closer to this level. If the cryptocurrency moves above it, then that could signal that the sellers have already retreated to $4,800, the current ATH. Looking ahead, this cryptocurrency has shown a lot of strength since end of April when this major uptrend started. With buy volume picking up, ETH has a good shot at breaking $4,000 in the nearby future. Chart by TradingView Ripple (XRP) XRP had a great week after its price increased by over 12%. This allowed it to expand and move higher from the $3 support level. Buyers came in strong in the past three days and managed to take XRP to the $3.4 resistance. The momentum indicators are turning positive on the daily timeframe, with the MACD about to do a bullish cross. If confirmed, the price will have the path set towards the current ATH at $3.6 which will also act as a resistance. Looking ahead, XRP is well positioned to make new highs, especially if the overall altcoin market heats up since Ethereum is also close to breaking $4,000. This will likely see a lot of money return to altcoins as euphoria takes over. Chart by TradingView Cardano (ADA) Cardano holders have reasons to be optimistic after the price closed the week with a 8% gain and managed to pass the resistance at $0.77. ADA is now moving fast towards $0.80. This uptrend could continue until 90 cents where sellers may return. With buyers coming back in the past three days, ADA has made good progress at reversing the losses from the downtrend that dominated the chart in the second half of July. Another impulse up could see the price approach $0.90 in the coming week. Looking ahead, Cardano is well positioned to move higher thanks to the ongoing bullish momentum that is intensifying. There is a high chance that a second attempt at the $0.90 key resistance may be successful. Chart by TradingView Solana (SOL) Solana continues to lag behind other market leaders like ETH or XRP, managing only a 3% increase in the past week. Nevertheless, the price reversed from the support at $155 and managed to make good progress towards the current resistance at $185. At a macro level, SOL is found in a clear uptrend with higher highs and higher lows. This is positive and may see this cryptocurrency try to reach a price above $200 again. Hopefully, buyers will be strong enough this time to hold Solana above that key level. Looking ahead, buyers are well positioned to make sustained gains in August and volume could pick up in the future to amplify the current uptrend. Chart by TradingView Hype (HYPE) On the weekly chart, HYPE is flat, basically returning to the same price of last week. This comes after sellers managed to take its price to $35, but luckily buyers stepped in there to reverse that move in full in the past 24 hours. This reversal is a first signal that HYPE’s correction, that started in mid-July, may be over. Buyers have a real chance to capitalize on the positive market sentiment and take the price closer to the ATH at $50. So far, they made good progress by pushing it to $40. Looking ahead, as long as this cryptocurrency holds above $40, buyers have the upper hand and a good chance at making sustained gains in the following days. Their biggest challenge is the resistance at $50 which saw the price struggle there in the past.

The decision by The Smarter Web Company mirrors a broader institutional interest in cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, this growing acceptance helps to legitimize Bitcoin within the mainstream financial system.

It indicates confidence in the long-term viability and growth of the crypto ecosystem. This move could inspire other mid-sized companies, particularly in the tech sector, to consider their own Bitcoin investment strategies. While the benefits are clear, companies embarking on such ventures also face considerations: Volatility Management: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate significantly, requiring a strong risk management strategy. Regulatory Landscape: The evolving regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies necessitates careful monitoring and compliance. Public Perception: Managing public and investor perception regarding digital asset exposure is crucial. Despite these challenges, the increasing number of companies like SWC making a substantial BTC acquisition suggests a belief that the rewards outweigh the risks.

49733701,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/blackrock-rumored-to-dump-664m-in-bitcoin-and-ethereum-what-happens-if-trust-breaks/,1754635440,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49733701.jpeg,BlackRock Rumored to Dump $664M in Bitcoin and Ethereum—What Happens if Trust Breaks?,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/blackrock-rumored-to-dump-664m-in-bitcoin-and-ethereum-what-happens-if-trust-breaks/,"New reports suggest that BlackRock may be preparing to offload over $664 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum, as ETF-linked wallet data shows potential movement across key custody addresses. According to blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, four wallets tied to BlackRock’s IBIT and ETHA ETFs appear to have shifted large reserves in recent days – raising alarms among market watchers about whether a major liquidation event is on the horizon. The total holdings in question—11,400 BTC and 26,000 ETH—represent one of the largest aggregated positions by a single asset manager. While no official confirmation has come from BlackRock, analysts are warning that even the rumor of such a dump could be enough to destabilize market sentiment in the short term. And if investor confidence is shaken, it could lead to capital fleeing toward more nimble, high-growth crypto plays—especially emerging tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE that offer early-stage upside and no institutional overhang . Why a BlackRock sell-off could shift the narrative The speculation has ignited concerns about centralized influence over crypto markets. If BlackRock, seen as a trusted bridge between Wall Street and blockchain, begins unloading assets, it could signal broader doubt in current valuations – or even pre-positioning for a deeper macro pullback. Either way, such a move risks breaking trust among retail and institutional investors alike, particularly those who bought into ETFs expecting long-term holding strategies. Historically, market shocks like this have led to surges in interest for smaller, decentralized, community-backed tokens. And with sentiment this fragile, even a partial dump could redirect billions in retail flow toward early-stage opportunities tokens not yet tied to institutional risk or old-cycle baggage. $5,000 could deliver $550,000 once MAGACOIN FINANCE hits major exchanges That’s precisely why MAGACOIN FINANCE is now emerging as a top pick among early-mover investors. Still in its early phase, this politically charged coin has already outperformed expectations in terms of engagement, wallet sign-ups, and on-chain activity. But it’s the projected upside that’s turning heads: analysts now believe that a $5,000 investment at today’s rate could grow into $550,000 once MAGACOIN FINANCE gets listed on major exchanges and becomes globally accessible. What sets it apart? MAGACOIN FINANCE is blending virality with calculated rollout mechanics and a built-in ideological movement – attracting both hype traders and long-term ecosystem builders. Its rounds are closing fast , and the token has already surpassed early momentum levels seen in SHIBA INU and DOGE’s initial phases. Unlike assets weighed down by ETF custody issues or legacy reputation, MAGACOIN is clean, nimble, and built for exponential scaling. And in a post-BlackRock trust shake-up , MAGACOIN FINANCE could offer the kind of fresh start and narrative clarity the market desperately needs. As institutions wobble, early-stage plays surge While large asset managers like BlackRock have brought credibility to the crypto space, they’ve also introduced traditional finance behaviors – like strategic selling, liquidity protection, and risk management – that don’t always align with crypto’s ethos. If retail begins to feel burned by centralized exits, expect a mass migration to new, decentralized alternatives, particularly those not yet influenced by ETF politics or institutional pacing. Projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which have no legacy exposure and are just entering their growth phase , stand to capture the fallout from any broken trust in the top-tier token space. Conclusion: Institutions may sell – early movers will seek the next frontier Whether or not BlackRock executes a full sell-off, the market is clearly watching. And in moments like these, capital tends to flow fast toward uncorrelated opportunities. With MAGACOIN FINANCE offering projected 110x upside and gaining global traction ahead of its major listings, it’s no surprise that analysts are calling it the top altcoin bet in a post-ETF correction world.

As the market moves toward utility and yield, Solana is becoming a magnet for institutional capital. One of the latest moves came from Bit Mining, which used to focus entirely on Bitcoin. This week, the company pivoted into Solana with a $4.5 million buy and launched its own validator node. Upexi, a supply chain tech firm, has gone even bigger—accumulating over 2 million SOL in July. According to its CEO, that stash is now generating approximately $65,000 daily through staking rewards at an 8% return. Another player, DeFi Development Corp., originally rooted in real estate, now holds over 1.2 million SOL and is spreading that across validators for long-term yield generation and network support. Together, these companies are turning Solana from a speculative asset into a long-term yield machine. Top Public Companies by $SOL Holdings 1. Upexi, Inc – 1.9M 2. DeFi Dev. – 1.1M 3. SOL Strategies – 392.6K 4. Torrent Capital – 40K — CoinGecko (@coingecko) August 6, 2025 Retail Investors Are Flocking to This New Altcoin as Institutions Load Up on Solana While large corporations look to SOL for staking, retail investors are setting their sights on a different kind of opportunity—MAGACOIN FINANCE, a fast-rising altcoin that’s being hailed as the best crypto presale of the current cycle. With strategic tokenomics and a growing community, the project is attracting those who missed the early runs of coins like SHIB and DOGE. Analysts are pointing to a realistic 7,800% upside from current entry points, making it a rare shot for everyday investors to beat institutions to the next big thing. Presale slots are already filling up fast, adding pressure for early participants to secure their spot before major exchange listings. Staking Rewards Are Fueling Corporate Crypto Adoption According to CoinGecko data, just four publicly traded firms now hold more than 3.5 million SOL combined—worth over $590 million. This accounts for nearly 0.65% of the total supply in the hands of just a few players. This trend shows how companies are now chasing not just asset appreciation, but real, yield-driven revenue streams in crypto. Additionally, BitGo stated that Solana offers one of the most compelling staking models for institutions seeking a differentiator.It’s not just about token price anymore—it’s about building recurring crypto cash flows, something that’s pushing Solana further into mainstream corporate finance. Conclusion As publicly listed firms build out validator infrastructure on Solana and rake in daily staking rewards, it’s clear that institutional money is pivoting to yield-generating blockchains. Meanwhile, retail investors hunting for growth are fueling the rise of MAGACOIN FINANCE, a new altcoin already tipped by analysts for massive gains in the next bull cycle. With both sides of the market moving quickly, the window for early positioning may not stay open much longer.

The possible announcement may come anytime and is expected to set off a wave of capital flow and shift the current sentiment across digital assets. Despite Bitcoin being the main focus of the ETF, many traders are already preparing for the next move. Investors are turning their eye to altcoins, which usually benefit from such momentum. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) are likely to benefit more. However, smaller projects that have the ability to give massive returns such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are also quietly attracting investors. Many traders are always on the look out for early-stage opportunities with high returns. Ethereum Builds Strength Ahead of Market Shift Ethereum has been dominating analyst discussions due to its attractive features. Moreover, the recent changes in the market are attracting institutional players. Its growing network of Layer 2 solutions and smart contract applications puts it in a strong position to handle the capital inflow expected after the Bitcoin ETF is approved. On top of that, Ethereum’s move to proof-of-stake has reduced its token issuance. This lower supply creates favorable conditions for a potential price rally during the next cycle. XRP Rises with Renewed Institutional Confidence XRP has become one of the most trending coin in recent times due to the legal clarity in the market. The SEC clarified the sale of XRP token as not securities when sold to retail investors. The clarity has given the coin a major edge in attracting new interest. Ripple has also expanded its role in cross-border payments. The move has increased the use case for XRP. Institutional investors are buying the coin due to the regulatory clarity. The renewed confidence could be a major catalyst in the weeks ahead. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Traction as Traders Hunt for High-Upside Altcoins If the Bitcoin ETF is approved, BTC will likely lead the initial surge in the crypto market. However, based on past trends, capital often rotates quickly into altcoins that offer higher volatility and short-term returns. The movement of investors from large cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin to other altcoins often tend to reward early movers. Altcoins typically rally after Bitcoin cools off. In addition, smaller-cap tokens often outperform due to their explosive nature. MAGACOIN FINANCE has caught the attention of early traders. The project offers decentralized finance features, yield-generation tools, and governance functionality. Its roadmap outlines features that could support the long-term growth in the broader altcoin ecosystem. One of the biggest draws is its low supply and early-stage valuation. Some analysts have predicted potential returns as high as 15,800%. The return has been experienced in only a small portion of other tokens that have broken out before hitting major exchanges. Final Thoughts Ethereum and XRP stand out as frontrunners for institutional capital. At the same time, rising interest in newer altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE shows how traders are positioning for a broader altcoin rally. With momentum building and ETF approval on the horizon, all eyes are on the next breakout trend in crypto.

The document, reportedly included in SBI Holdings’ “2025 Information Meeting” presentation dated June 2, 2025, offers a detailed timeline of the legal proceedings that have influenced XRP’s market valuation over the past several years. According to the materials disclosed, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020, alleging that Ripple had conducted unregistered securities offerings by selling XRP tokens to investors. This regulatory action coincided with a substantial decline in XRP’s price, which was recorded at USD 0.26 (JPY 27) around the time the lawsuit was filed. The document further outlines significant milestones in the litigation process. On July 13, 2023, a federal district court ruled that XRP does not constitute an investment contract and therefore is not a security, except in circumstances involving direct sales to institutional investors. This legal interpretation marked a partial victory for Ripple , clarifying that most transactions involving XRP would not be classified as securities sales under U.S. law. THE PRICE SUPPRESSION OF XRP IS COMING TO AN END Directly from SBI Holdings. “The legal dispute between the SEC and Ripple, which has been a barrier to the IPO by suppressing the price of XRP for an extended period, is moving toward resolution.” Documented. pic.twitter.com/7R5qOiDDFR — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 5, 2025 Developments in Penalty Reduction and Settlement SBI Holdings’ presentation also highlights the subsequent negotiations between the SEC and Ripple regarding financial penalties. Initially, the SEC had pursued a penalty estimated at approximately $125 million . However, according to the presentation, on May 8, 2025, Ripple and the SEC reached a settlement agreement and jointly submitted a letter to the federal district court requesting approval of revised settlement terms. The penalty was ultimately reduced to USD 50 million. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This settlement is described in the document as an important development that has removed a significant obstacle to Ripple’s prospective initial public offering (IPO). SBI Holdings specifically noted that the prolonged legal uncertainty had acted as a barrier by “suppressing the price of XRP for an extended period.” Price Activity and Market Reactions Documented The image shared by SMQKE includes a price chart displaying XRP’s fluctuations between April 2020 and May 2025. After the initial lawsuit in December 2021, XRP experienced extended periods of price volatility and sustained low valuations. Following the July 2023 ruling that XRP was not a security for most retail transactions, XRP’s price rose to approximately $0.81 (JPY 112). Later, as the May 2025 settlement agreement became public, the price increased further. On May 8, 2025, XRP traded at $2.31 (JPY 337), reflecting growing confidence among market participants that the legal issues were nearing conclusion. The chart also recorded a similar valuation of $2.31 (JPY 329) on May 26, 2025. Community Commentary and Source Verification Another X user, Digital Asset Dude, commented on SMQKE’s post to confirm the authenticity of the document. According to Digital Asset Dude, the presentation is accessible through SBI Holdings’ investor relations website and appears as page 126 in the Ripple investment section. The timeline and price chart shown in the image match the official document precisely. This confirmation has been used by some market observers to reinforce the credibility of the claims presented, particularly the assertion that the SEC dispute has weighed on XRP’s valuation and delayed Ripple’s IPO ambitions.

One of the biggest challenges for these digital assets is often their volatility and the availability of stable trading environments. Imagine a new era where your favorite Solana memecoins have a stronger foundation! This is precisely what the Solana-based memecoin launchpad, Pump.fun , aims to achieve with its latest initiative. What is the Glass Full Foundation and Why Does it Matter for Memecoin Liquidity? Pump.fun has officially launched the Glass Full Foundation (GFF), a significant move designed to provide crucial memecoin liquidity support. The Block reported this exciting development, highlighting GFF’s mission to back select tokens within the Pump.fun ecosystem. Think of it as a safety net, offering stability to projects that often experience wild price swings due to thin liquidity. Enhanced Stability: GFF’s support can help reduce extreme price fluctuations. Increased Trust: Projects with foundation backing may appear more reliable to investors. Growth Potential: Stable liquidity encourages more trading activity and adoption. Ultimately, this initiative aims to create a more robust and predictable environment for both creators and investors in the memecoin space. How Will This Impact Solana Memecoins and the Ecosystem? The introduction of the Glass Full Foundation could be a game-changer for Solana memecoins . Historically, many memecoins struggle with low liquidity, which can lead to significant price dumps or ‘rug pulls’ where developers quickly sell off their holdings. By providing a dedicated source of memecoin liquidity , GFF offers a shield against such extreme volatility. This is a vital step towards maturity for the memecoin market. Robust crypto liquidity solutions are not just about preventing crashes; they are also about fostering sustained growth. When traders feel confident that they can buy and sell assets without massive slippage, they are more likely to participate, bringing more capital and innovation into the ecosystem. Addressing the Unknowns: Funding and Project Selection While the news of the Glass Full Foundation is certainly positive, some questions remain. The team behind GFF has not yet disclosed how the foundation is funded, nor have they revealed the specific criteria for selecting projects to back. This lack of transparency is a point of discussion within the community. For any crypto liquidity solutions to gain full market confidence, clarity is key. Investors and project creators alike will be keen to understand: What is the source of GFF’s capital? What are the objective metrics for a project to receive support? How will the foundation ensure fairness and prevent favoritism? Moving forward, providing these details will be crucial for the GFF to build trust and solidify its position as a reliable pillar of memecoin liquidity . The Broader Significance of Robust Crypto Liquidity Solutions The efforts by Pump.fun with its Glass Full Foundation highlight a growing trend in the crypto space: the recognition of liquidity as a foundational element for sustainable growth. Beyond just memecoins, reliable crypto liquidity solutions are essential for decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and all forms of digital assets. They ensure markets are efficient, fair, and accessible. As the Solana ecosystem continues to expand, initiatives like GFF will play a critical role in shaping its future. They demonstrate a commitment to creating a more stable and attractive environment for innovation, ultimately benefiting all participants. This move could set a precedent for other launchpads and blockchain platforms seeking to bolster their nascent markets. In conclusion, the launch of the Glass Full Foundation by Pump.fun represents a significant stride towards enhancing memecoin liquidity and stability on Solana. While details about its operations are still emerging, the foundation’s potential to foster a healthier, more predictable environment for Solana memecoins is undeniable. It underscores the ongoing evolution of the crypto market as it seeks more mature and sustainable models for growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the primary purpose of the Glass Full Foundation? A1: The Glass Full Foundation (GFF) aims to provide liquidity support for projects launched within the Pump.fun ecosystem, primarily focusing on memecoins. Q2: How does the Glass Full Foundation help memecoin liquidity? A2: By providing liquidity, GFF helps stabilize memecoin prices, reduces volatility, and makes it easier for users to buy and sell these tokens, fostering a healthier trading environment. Q3: Which projects are eligible for support from the Glass Full Foundation? A3: Currently, the Glass Full Foundation has begun backing select tokens, but Pump.fun has not yet disclosed the specific criteria for project selection or eligibility. Q4: What is Pump.fun’s role in this new initiative? A4: Pump.fun is the Solana-based memecoin launchpad that created and launched the Glass Full Foundation, integrating it as a key component of its ecosystem support for memecoins.

Dogecoin Is Trading Near Lower Level Of Historical Ascending Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how the weekly Dogecoin price has entered into a historically important buy zone. Below is the chart shared by Martinez, showing this trend. As is visible in the graph, the Dogecoin weekly price has roughly followed an Ascending Channel over the past decade. The “Ascending Channel” here refers to a technical analysis (TA) pattern that forms when an asset trades between two parallel trendlines angled upward. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Are Capitulating—Will June Pattern Repeat? The upper line of the pattern tracks successive higher highs in the price, while the lower one connects higher lows. The former is considered to be a source of resistance and the latter that of support. Though, while this may be so, Dogecoin has dipped under the lower line of its long-term Ascending Channel a few times over the years, with the latest instance coming this year. That said, in each of these occurrences, the asset found support at a trendline a bit below the Ascending Channel’s lower level. The analyst has described the shaded area between the two lines as a “historically strong buy zone.” From the chart, it’s apparent that multiple major bull runs in DOGE found their start after the price retested this zone. At present, the token is trading inside the area, with recent attempts to re-enter the Ascending Channel ending up in failure. It now remains to be seen whether a breakout into the channel would follow for Dogecoin and potentially kick off another rally, or if this cycle would break the pattern. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Buy The Dip: $1 Billion DOGE Added The Ascending Channel is just one type of pattern with parallel trendlines that exists in TA. When the asset’s consolidation occurs toward the downside instead, the formation is known as a Descending Channel. As pointed out by Martinez in another X post, another memecoin, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), has broken out of such a channel recently. As displayed in the above chart, the 1-hour price of Pudgy Penguins was sliding down inside the Descending Channel during the last two weeks, but it has just found a surge above its resistance line. “PENGU targets $0.041 after breaking out of a descending channel!” says the analyst. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.21, up almost 4% over the last 24 hours.

According to crypto market analyst Degen Profit, XRP is tracing a chart that’s eerily reminiscent of its 2024 trajectory, which is initial weakness followed by a sharp breakout in July. This mirrored movement has sparked speculative excitement, with Degen Profit eyeing a dramatic 156% rally, potentially targeting a price as high as $7, provided XRP can firmly hold above the $2.95 support level. XRP is presently trading at $3.33, representing a 10.8% increase in the past 24 hours, having broken key resistance at $2.97–$3.10. A bullish flag pattern now points to potential upside targets between $8 and $15. Technical indicators reinforce this optimism. Price action is contained within a symmetrical triangle, testing the upper trendline, while XRP has crossed back above its 20- and 50‑period exponential moving averages (EMAs). Coupled with expanding Bollinger Bands and bullish momentum readings, a breakout looks increasingly plausible. In this context, Degen Profit’s 156% rally scenario to $7 is bold yet not completely out of sight, provided XRP maintains strong support above $2.95, holds its breakout structure, and overall market sentiment stays bullish. SEC and Ripple Officially Wrap Up Legal Saga After nearly five years of courtroom drama, the XRP Army is celebrating in full force. Yesterday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs jointly filed a Stipulation of Dismissal with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, formally ending their appeals and bringing one of crypto’s longest-running battles to a close. This dismissal cements the 2023 district court ruling by Judge Analisa Torres, which held that XRP sales on public exchanges do not constitute securities, while those to institutional investors did, resulting in a $125 million penalty and an injunction With both sides withdrawing, the penalty stands and the litigation is finally over. XRP holders were quick to react. Within hours, the token surged across markets, posting gains from 5% to over 13%, reaching highs of $3.36 as excitement rippled through the community. The XRP Army likened the moment to a space launch, “to the moon” with this phrase reverberating across social platforms and forums. Other declarations like “the end…and now back to business” and “the case is over” captured the sentiment that the long-overdue closure brings much-welcomed clarity on the Ripple vs SEC case. On Reddit, one influencer humorously declared , “I sold everything… the house, the kids, the PlayStation… we’re going to the moon, boys!” Crypto media and analysts see this moment as more than market euphoria. The finality of the case provides regulatory clarity, potentially clearing the path for XRP-based financial products, including spot ETFs, and solidifying the 2023 ruling as legal precedent. Ripple’s C‑suite was equally upbeat—Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty summed it up on X, formerly Twitter, “The end … and now back to business.” Top lawyer Bill Morgan accurately predicted the Ripple vs. SEC case would be dismissed before August 15, and it’s now official. Conclusion For the XRP Army, the dismissal feels like vindication and validation. This legal closure not only removes a major cloud hanging over Ripple and XRP but also reignites dreams of widespread adoption and institutional embrace. As the community chants “onward and upward,” the skies and crypto charts may just be the limit with the path to $7 being seemingly likely.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-08 07:01:22
49733980,551147,1754636645,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49733980.jpeg,Dogecoin Isn’t Done Yet – Grok’s Surprising Price Prediction & $MAXI Recommendation,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-prediction-grok-buy-maxi-doge/,"Dogecoin’s name is written in golden letters in meme coin lore. After all, it was the first major meme coin that really showed to the world that humor and finance can indeed blend, and blend beautifully, and that an investment opportunity doesn’t need to titillate a Harvard graduate’s intellect to be wildly profitable. Currently trading at $0.2202, $DOGE has climbed a chunky 27% over the past month . With a new altcoin bull run seemingly on the horizon, speculation is rife on whether this dog-themed token could turn back the clock and deliver mind-boggling rallies once again. To find out, we turned to Grok for Dogecoin’s price prediction for 2025 and beyond. Why Grok? Because it’s one of the best AI chatbots out there, and the only one directly integrated with X, the hub of pipping-hot crypto updates from both under-the-radar crypto wizards and mainstream industry voices. This gives Grok a unique ability to sweep the floor and piece together a sharper, more accurate narrative on what’s next for $DOGE. Keep reading to see why Grok thinks $DOGE could hit $0.50 (a bold call, to say the least) by the end of 2025, the forces driving it higher, and why buying a Doge-based presale meme coin like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) could be the best way to ride Doge’s next leg up. $DOGE Riding Both Fundamental and Technical Tailwinds The biggest reason behind Grok’s bold $DOGE price prediction is that the token is sitting in a rare sweet spot where both fundamental and technical factors are flashing green. For starters, Dogecoin is preparing to integrate a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) verification system , which would allow transactions to be verified without revealing sensitive information, boosting both privacy and scalability. This kind of tech upgrade strengthens Dogecoin’s long-term credibility and makes it more attractive for mainstream adoption. Adding more fuel to the fire is the high probability of a DOGE ETF getting the green light from the SEC in the coming months. Bloomberg has pegged the chances at a massive 90% . Why is an ETF approval such a big deal? Because it would open the floodgates for institutional investors and everyday traders to buy $DOGE through regular brokerage accounts, potentially triggering a surge in demand and liquidity. $DOGE Technical Analysis Signals Greenery On the daily chart, Dogecoin has just broken above the 10 and 20 EMAs with a fat green candle. Even better, this bounce is coming straight from the 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci zone (drawn from the $0.14287 low) – a ‘golden pocket.’ In simple words, this setup makes it highly likely that the bullish momentum will continue, potentially pushing $DOGE to $0.28746, i.e., the high of the Fib range. Even more interesting? The rebound is happening exactly at a long-standing upward trendline, the same one that kicked off a 400% price surge back in December 2024. If history repeats, $DOGE could be on track to blast through Grok’s $0.50 target and potentially even challenge its all-time highs. So, buying $DOGE now at just $0.2202 could potentially set you up for 100%+ gains in the coming months. Awesome, innit? After all, these are returns most investors would likely never see even in multiple years in stocks. However, in the wild world of crypto, the real moonshots come from looking for low-cap, low-priced tokens ready to ride a major wave. As for the Dogecoin wave, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) could be the next crypto to explode , with the potential to deliver 1000x gains once it hits the exchanges. Who is Maxi Doge? Like all explode-worthy meme coins, Maxi Doge is built around a mascot with undeniable gravitas. A Shiba Inu dog with revenge in his eyes, protein shakes in his veins, and big, bulky muscles to intimidate every cutesy, wholesome mascot in the meme coin space, Maxi has the kind of presence that stops you in your tracks. Bold. Iconic. Impossible to ignore. But revenge from whom? Dogecoin, Maxi’s distant cousin. The one who hogged all the limelight at every family gathering, leaving poor little Maxi with a cocktail of insecurity, self-hatred, and loneliness. Determined to dethrone Dogecoin’s dominance, Maxi hit the gym and stared at candlestick charts all day, and all night. His reasoning? The crypto market never sleeps, so why should you? And that’s exactly the raw, untamed energy $MAXI embodies. A place with no rules to follow, no mould to fit into. Here, ‘gainz’ is the only religion, even if it takes 1000x leveraged YOLO bets to get there. What’s Maxi’s Play? While Maxi Doge is a meme coin through and through – meaning it doesn’t have any underlying value, utility, or rEvOlUtIoNaRy mission to sell you – holding $MAXI tokens unlocks a bunch of community benefits, including: Staking rewards, currently yielding an eye-popping 558%, but this will drop as the presale progresses Trading contests, including leaderboard prizes for top ROI hunters Access to upcoming futures platform integrations, which will allow you to go beast mode with massively leveraged $MAXI bets Even better? Maxi Doge has reserved a chunky 40% of its total token supply for marketing. This will include influencer partnerships and gamified trading challenges. This shows how serious the devs are about $MAXI’s virality. $MAXI is in Presale: Buy Before it Skyrockets Despite being one of the newest crypto presales on the market, Maxi Doge has already raked in an impressive $470K in early investor funding, proving that if you’ve got a viral idea, a loyal community, and hype, the money pours in fast. Right now, you can scoop up 1 $MAXI for just $0.000251. The easiest way to buy is through Best Wallet , where you can purchase from directly within the app. Alternatively, you can head to Maxi Doge’s official website , connect your crypto wallet , and buy from there. Learn all about this rage-fueled degen project in its whitepaper . And follow its X and Telegram to catch every update before the next pump. Wrapping Up With Dogecoin poised for a 100%+ rally in the coming months, thanks to bullish price action, upcoming tech upgrades, and the looming possibility of an ETF approval, now’s the perfect time to back Doge-inspired, low-cap, high-upside meme coins like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) .

The Los Angeles City Council has just allocated $2 million for the pilot program that aims to provide $1,000 monthly payments to qualifying participants for two years, reports ABC7. LA council member Hugo Soto-Martinez, who led the effort with fellow LA council member Curren Price, says the new program is meant to build on the success of a previous basic income pilot program that provided 3,200 households living below the poverty level with $1,000 in cash each month for 12 months. Says Soto-Martinez, “We are building on the success of that program with a new $2 million investment, and this next phase will continue to support survivors of intimate partner violence – the group that saw the most dramatic improvements in that pilot program.” Soto-Martinez also says that current or former foster youth between the ages of 16 and 24 are eligible to participate in the new program and they will receive job training along with the monthly payments. “For the first, we’re pairing these direct payments with job training through the Hospitality Training Academy, which has a near 100% success rate in placing their graduate into high-quality, good-paying union jobs.” The program is expected to assist 83 participants.

The coordinated campaign employed a novel “Extension Hollowing” technique to bypass marketplace security by building legitimate-seeming extension portfolios before weaponizing them with malicious code. Single Server Controls $1M+ Theft Operation The attack group consolidated operations through a single server, controlling command infrastructure across browser extensions, malware payloads, and scam websites. GreedyBear evolved from the previously identified “Foxy Wallet” campaign involving 40 malicious extensions . They now show massive scale and coordination in crypto-focused cybercrime operations. The malicious Firefox extensions impersonated popular cryptocurrency wallets, including MetaMask, TronLink, Exodus, and Rabby Wallet, while capturing credentials directly from user input fields. Source: Koi Security Nearly 500 Windows executables spanning multiple malware families targeted victims through Russian websites distributing cracked software, while fake product landing pages advertised fraudulent hardware wallets and repair services. Security researchers identified clear signs of AI-generated code artifacts throughout the campaign, enabling attackers to scale operations rapidly and evade detection systems. The infrastructure expansion includes confirmed Chrome extension variants and suggests imminent cross-platform deployment to Edge and other browser ecosystems beyond Firefox. Extension Hollowing Technique Bypasses Marketplace Security Through Trust Building GreedyBear pioneered the Extension Hollowing methodology by creating publisher accounts and uploading 5-7 innocuous extensions, such as link sanitizers and YouTube downloaders, with no functional capabilities. Source: Koi Security The attackers posted dozens of fake positive reviews to build credibility ratings before weaponizing established extensions by changing names, icons, and injecting malicious code. This approach allowed bypassing marketplace security during initial reviews while maintaining positive ratings and user trust from the hollowed extension’s legitimate history. The weaponized extensions transmitted victim IP addresses during initialization while capturing wallet credentials from pop-up interfaces and exfiltrating data to remote servers. The campaign originated from the Foxy Wallet operation but evolved beyond the initial 40 malicious extensions to over 150 weaponized Firefox add-ons. Victims reported substantial losses as extensions maintained expected wallet functionality while secretly transmitting credentials to attacker-controlled infrastructure. Koi Security confirmed connections to Chrome through a “Filecoin Wallet” extension communicating with the same server. The group’s systematic approach to marketplace manipulation and trust exploitation created sustainable distribution channels for credential theft operations, which OKX and Microsoft have warned about earlier this year. Multi-Platform Campaign Coordinates Malware Distribution Through Centralized Infrastructure The 500 malicious Windows executables encompassed multiple malware families. Distribution occurred through Russian websites hosting cracked and pirated software, targeting users seeking free alternatives to legitimate applications. Scam websites masqueraded as Jupiter-branded hardware wallets with fabricated UI mockups and wallet repair services claiming to fix Trezor devices. The fraudulent landing pages collected personal information, wallet credentials, and payment details through convincing product demonstrations and service offerings. The centralized server infrastructure enabled streamlined operations across credential collection, ransomware coordination, and phishing campaigns while maintaining operational security. All domains resolved to the single IP address, which creates a unified command-and-control system for the multi-vector attack campaign. The campaign’s AI-assisted scaling capabilities enabled rapid payload diversification and detection evasion, which is starting to look like the new normal for crypto-focused cybercrime operations. Legacy security solutions face increasing challenges as attackers leverage sophisticated automation tools to accelerate attack development and deployment cycles. Recent large-scale incidents include $1 million in YouTube account hijacking scams , $3.05 million phishing losses , and the $4.5 million CrediX exploit that was subsequently recovered through hacker negotiations. Many experts have criticized the current crypto security landscape for enabling unethical actions, particularly in the negotiation approach. Speaking with Cryptonews, Circuit CEO Harry Donnelly criticized negotiation-based recovery methods following recent CrediX protocol fund returns , stating that “ automated threat response should be standard to ensure assets are kept out of harm’s way, rather than hoping to bargain with bad actors .” He emphasized that “ the CrediX recovery is a rare win in a system that too often leaves users with little recourse. ” This comes as the cumulative total for the first half of 2025 has hit $2.2 billion in losses through 344 incidents only.

He stated that the issue of Ripple’s programmatic sales and other distributions “is now res judicata” between the SEC and Ripple, and affirmed that those sales were lawful. Res judicata refers to a matter that has already been adjudicated and is no longer open to further legal challenge between the same parties. XRP’s status is no longer an unresolved regulatory question, and Morgan notes that it has never been a security. The issue of Ripple programmatic sales of XRP in the manner sold until 2020 and other distributions, that were not sales to institutions, is now res judicata as between the SEC and Ripple.

By withdrawing the appeals, the parties foreclosed further appellate review of the district court’s earlier determinations, including the pivotal court ruling that sales on public exchanges did not constitute securities transactions. Morgan concentrated his commentary on the legal consequences of the dismissal for XRP’s classification and the conduct adjudicated in the litigation. He stated, “XRP itself was, is, and forever will be, not a security.” Notably, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty reiterated this point throughout the final two years of the legal battle, reminding the community that the court’s decision stands as the “ law of the land .” Morgan also directly challenged Bitcoin maximalists, specifically naming Michael Saylor, who is strongly linked to Bitcoin . He criticized their assertion that XRP and other altcoins should automatically be classified as securities, and added, “go fuck yourselves.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Where Does XRP Go Now? A few weeks ago, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse appeared before the U.S. Senate and reaffirmed that XRP is not a security . The end of the legal battle has cemented its status. Morgan congratulated those who remained steadfast throughout the lawsuit and the preliminary investigation, which is believed to have lasted about two and a half years before the case was filed, bringing the total duration to seven years. The practical effect for Ripple and XRP holders is meaningful. The joint dismissal removes a central point of legal uncertainty. It permits Ripple to pursue commercial objectives without the immediate overhang of legal proceedings. With the matter now closed and XRP officially confirmed as not a security, those who remained committed through the lengthy battle can look forward to enjoying the benefits of greater market confidence and growth in both adoption and value .

This came less than a week after predictions about a price dip to and below $2.4. Analysts Get it Wrong Recall that just a few days ago, CryptoPotato cited several metrics posted by a renowned analyst about a potential price drop for XRP. The asset had already declined by 20% from its all-time high marked in mid-July and struggled to remain above $2.8. It had lost the crucial $3 support, whales were selling off en masse, the MVRV had created a death cross, and the TD Sequential was flashing a sell signal. Consequently, the overall anticipation was that a pullback toward $2.4 and even lower would occur if that support level cracked. However, that hasn’t been the case. Just the opposite; XRP remained solid around $2.8 for a few days and climbed toward $3 by Thursday. Santiment attributed this “silent” price recovery to an explosive rise in network activity. XRP has somewhat quietly risen back up to a $3.05 market value, and is up +10.1% since its network suddenly surged with transaction volume (a 6-month high) and circulation. Utility spikes on the network consistently foreshadow price jumps. Link: https://t.co/yOPDW415GX pic.twitter.com/0W9hz6PJxP — Santiment (@santimentfeed) August 7, 2025 The real price pump transpired in the past day or so, following news that Ripple and the SEC have jointly dropped their appeals in the court battle between the two. This means that the lawsuit, which started nearly five years ago, has finally come to an end, months after Ripple’s CEO said it had finished. Another impressive development for the company was announced yesterday, as Ripple had agreed to purchase the payments provider Rail for $200 million. The Unpredictability This article is not intended as a shot against analysts who get it wrong sometimes, especially those who have a proven track record and a sizeable number of followers. Instead, it should serve more as a reminder about the unpredictable nature of the digital asset market. Aside from the aforementioned bearish signs for XRP, the entire market was shaky following the latest global uncertainties prompted by Trump’s macro policies. However, unexpected news, such as the closure of the SEC lawsuit, can send the underlying asset flying, and this is the dark horse that cannot be predicted and can leave traders in shambles if they follow any tips blindly and overdo their respective positions (especially when using leverage).

This rally broke above a descending structure and retested the $3,708 support-turned-resistance level, which now serves as a launch point for the current push. ETH price dynamics (Source: TradingView) On the 4-hour chart, ETH is holding above all major EMAs. The EMA20 at $3,749, EMA50 at $3,686, and EMA100 at $3,623 are now stacked bullishly below price. This alignment supports continuation as long as $3,800 holds as near-term support. Bollinger Bands have widened, indicating volatility expansion, while price rides the upper band, a sign of sustained bullish momentum.

While ETH is accelerating towards $3,828.58 and a potential surge above $10K, analysts are closely watching to observe which altcoins stand to benefit the most. One such token that’s quietly generating buzz amidst so much hype is Remittix (RTX) — a newcomer DeFi utility token that’s gaining momentum as Ethereum’s rise signifies the start of yet another massive bull run. What The $10K Milestone For Ethereum Means For The Crypto Space Ethereum’s price has risen 5.44% in recent months, now trading higher than $3,828, with 21.66% higher trading volume at $33.16 billion. Its market cap of $462.22 billion reflects a bullish investor sentiment valuing Ethereum’s status as the top smart contract platform. When ETH explodes through $10,000, it will undoubtedly have a ripple effect on DeFi projects, cryptocurrency staking platforms, and other low cap crypto hidden gems based on or interoperable with Ethereum. When ETH stabilizes, focus shifts to future crypto initiatives offering scalability, low gas fees, and real-world utility. Remittix Could Benefit From Ethereum’s Bull Cycle In contrast to speculative meme tokens, Remittix is being established as a crypto with actual utility. Designed to address a significant problem in the blockchain universe — simple crypto-to-bank transfers — Remittix enables users to send assets such as ETH, BTC, and XRP into bank accounts in 30+ countries with a simple, intuitive interface. This Remittix DeFi token is one of the top crypto under $1, currently being sold at $0.0895 per token. Over 584 million tokens are already sold in its presale worth $18.3 million+ — making it one of the fastest growing crypto 2025 contenders. Now that the beta version of the Remittix Wallet is officially released for Q3 2025, the project has finally made the jump from concept to real working product. It handles 40+ cryptos, 30+ fiat currencies, and includes features like real-time FX conversion and low gas fee cryptocurrency payments. Remittix’s wallet launch will follow Ethereum expansion coincidentally — providing actual value during the period when ETH mania pulls in fresh liquidity. Fatigued users of centralized exchanges can turn to solutions like Remittix for smoother, faster, and more borderless transactions. Why Remittix Is One To Watch This Cycle As demand increases, the presale currently offers investors a 40% bonus, and there is a live $250,000 giveaway to entice early adopters. As Ethereum’s growth gains momentum, Remittix could be a next 100x crypto simply because it can do what other platforms can’t — deliver digital assets into action in the real world. Utility in Real Life: Send crypto directly into bank accounts within minutes Wallet Beta Launch Q3: Made mobile-first for everyday crypto payments $18.3Million+ Raised: Powerful support and growing traction 40% Bonus Tokens: Available to early adopters CertiK Audited: Long-term investment that is safe with trusted security As. Ethereum price approaches its next psychological level, it’s not just ETH that takes advantage. Remittix may be positioning itself behind the scenes as among the best crypto to invest in today, bridging the gap between DeFi and cross-border payments — one of the largest untapped use cases in crypto today. If you’ve been following Ethereum’s growth, perhaps it’s worth paying attention to the new altcoins that are building real solutions on top of it — and Remittix (RTX) definitely does.

The global cryptocurrency market cap on Friday is $3.86 trillion, per CoinMarketCap data . Renewed positive sentiment surrounds the crypto market, fueled by factors like institutional adoption and the recent Trump executive order regarding crypto in 401(k) plans. Crypto ETFs Inflows Are Big Market Drivers – Here’s Why Besides, the US Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have rebounded, marking another big day for crypto inflows. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, led by BlackRock’s IBIT, saw over $280.69 million in net inflows on August 7, according to Sosovalue data .

Keep faith in institutional flows and token-level triggers,” one user wrote on X . Regulatory Progress, Institutional Adoption Led to Bullish Impact Further, XRP climbed more than 13% on Friday, after the US SEC and Ripple agreed to dismiss appeals, ending their four-year legal battle. This means a reduced legal risk for XRP holders, boosting sentiments. XRP is trading around $3.34 at press time, with bulls anticipating that a break above the resistance level $3.40, could lead $3.70 mark. Additionally, Ethereum is up more than $3,900 on Friday, following a fresh institutional interest in ETH treasury. Analysts have predicted that a test of the $4,000 mark could be imminent. The price increase comes as SharpLink Gaming announced Thursday that it has secured $200 million in a direct offering led by four global institutional investors, which will be used to expand its Ethereum treasury. @SharpLinkGaming announces $200M direct offering at $19.50/share, led by 4 global institutional investors. #Ethereum #CryptoTreasury $SBET https://t.co/Lrz6hPJbCY — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 7, 2025 On the technical front, the total BTC futures open interest (OI) stands at 691,550 BTC, equivalent to $80 billion, according to Coinglass .

As market conditions tighten and key technical levels come into play, futures traders are positioning for what could be the most volatile period of the quarter. Bitcoin futures are trading between $114,000–$115,800 , closely following a high-volume pullback driven by renewed macroeconomic fears, including rising U.S. tariffs and global inflationary pressure. At the same time, Ethereum continues to consolidate near $3,620 , following a powerful July rally. This surge in futures participation marks a growing shift from passive holding to active positioning—where timing, leverage, and short-term volatility are dominating strategy. Key Technical Levels Define Bitcoin’s Next Move Bitcoin’s recent dip below $116,000 brought the price back to fill a CME futures gap near $114,000 —a historically significant level. This move triggered the liquidation of over 158,000 leveraged positions , most of which were long bets taken during the late stages of Bitcoin’s July rally above $120,000. Traders are now eyeing $115,000 as a crucial support-turned-resistance level. If bulls can reclaim and maintain levels above $121,000 , analysts forecast a potential breakout toward $129,000–$133,000 . On the other hand, failure to hold support at $111,800 could lead to a broader pullback, possibly testing the $104,000 range. Funding rates have flipped negative, meaning short traders are paying longs. This setup may hint at a short-squeeze scenario—where a sharp price move upward forces shorts to close, adding upward momentum. Ethereum Price Prediction: Calm Before the Break? Alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum is experiencing narrowing volatility, consolidating in a tight range between $3,620–$3,631 . This follows a July surge that saw ETH approach $3,900 before cooling off. Technical indicators show Ethereum trading within a symmetrical triangle pattern. A breakout above resistance at $3,672–$3,700 could send ETH toward $3,740 or even higher. However, if it breaks down below $3,580 , a deeper correction could unfold. Institutional interest in Ethereum remains strong, as ETH continues to serve as a foundational asset for staking, DeFi, and tokenization. While other sectors like NFTs and meme coins show mixed performance, Ethereum is benefiting from its role as a utility-based, relatively stable digital asset. Sentiment around ETH is neutral to cautiously bullish , particularly as volatility compresses and broader altcoin markets remain subdued.

Analysts are beginning to compare MAGACOIN FINANCE to assets like SHIB and XRP , not just for its upside potential, but for its resonance with long-term, values-driven investors. Binance and CME Adapt to New Market Realities The growth in Binance Futures volume mirrors a broader evolution in crypto trading, where high-frequency strategies and risk-managed exposure dominate market behavior. Exchanges are rapidly rolling out new instruments to accommodate this trend. CME , for example, has introduced weekly and micro futures contracts that allow more precise risk management for institutional and retail participants alike. These tools are giving traders greater flexibility during periods of heightened volatility. Rather than holding through weekends or uncertain macro events, participants can now enter and exit positions with narrower time horizons and clearer entry/exit points. This evolution reflects the maturing landscape of crypto derivatives—a shift that prioritizes strategy, speed, and adaptability over simple buy-and-hold behavior. Final Take: Strategic Positioning Is Everything With Bitcoin and Ethereum hovering at key technical inflection points, and Binance Futures setting records, the crypto market is entering a phase where calculated positioning could define outcomes more than ever. High leverage, compressed volatility, and macroeconomic uncertainty are creating conditions where both rapid gains and sharp reversals are equally possible. At the same time, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are building narratives that go beyond price speculation—rooted in community, governance, and cultural resonance. As traders navigate a market full of signals, strategies, and setups, combining major assets with strong emerging stories may offer the most resilient path forward.

The announcement builds on President Nayib Bukele’s Bitcoin-driven economic strategy. The plan remains unclear, and there are no details as of now. The post declared that ‘Bitcoin Banks are coming to Bitcoin country,’ suggesting that the country may roll out banking institutions specifically for Bitcoin operations. If implemented, this plan could reshape how El Salvadoran citizens access finance. El Salvador considers Bitcoin-only banking institutions El Salvador, known for adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, has not yet released details on the regulation frameworks surrounding the announcement of Bitcoin banks. As we wait for further announcements, it remains speculative that the proposed Bitcoin banks can offer deposits, lending, and financial investment instruments in BTC. 🇸🇻🚀 pic.twitter.com/DEGUKMmhfd — The Bitcoin Office (@bitcoinofficesv) August 8, 2025 The announcement builds on Nayib Bukele’s proposal to introduce a Bank for Private Investment (BPI) last year. Milena Mayorga, El Salvador’s Ambassador to the U.S., explained the BPI proposal as a model allowing banks in El Salvador to operate under minimal regulations compared to traditional banking. She added that the banks will have fewer restrictions when forming partnerships with international banks and more flexibility on loan amounts. Bukele’s original plan outlined that BPIs should have a minimum share capital of $50 million and at least two shareholders. The BPIs could register as digital asset managers and BTC service providers. The Technology, Tourism, and Investment Commission is still considering the BPI. Max Keiser, Senior Bitcoin advisor to Bukele, shared his thoughts that introducing Bitcoin into the banking sector would boost the country’s GDP. Cathie Wood , CEO of Ark Investment, forecasted that El Salvador would experience higher economic growth in the next five years following the plan to adopt the BPI. IMF challenges El Salvador’s Bitcoin narrative as it plans to form Bitcoin banks Some analysts noted that Bitcoin banks could expand financial inclusion in the Bitcoin country with a nearly 70% unbanked population. The analysts revealed that the BPI model could offer an alternate solution to traditional banking. They have also cited Bitcoin’s volatile nature and skepticism as key concerns over its integration into banking. IMF cautioned against cryptocurrency’s widespread adoption, noting crypto’s unstable nature and consumer protection as key concerns. El Salvador has been advancing its Bitcoin strategies since it adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021. The country launched a state-backed Chivo wallet that invested in Bitcoin reserves and bonds. It also introduced a geothermal-powered BTC mining project. Following the announcement today, it’s still unclear and speculative whether the plan will follow the BPI or adopt a new framework. The government of El Salvador is expected to deliver more details later on the plan. However, the message is clear now that the country is committed to doubling down on Bitcoin adoption. An IMF report revealed that El Salvador has maintained its promise not to buy more BTC under the $1.4 billion credit agreement. The IMF said the recent Bitcoin activity in the country’s wallet was a consolidation from the country’s different wallets and not a new purchase. The report counters the country’s remarks that those transfers were fresh buys, showing a questionable communication strategy from the state. El Salvador’s holdings touched a high of $767 million, while BTC hit an all-time high of 123k last month. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Central to The Graph’s operations are subgraphs, APIs that organize and serve blockchain data to data consumers and developers. The Graph has over 100 indexer nodes, 1.23 trillion served queries, and over 70,000 hosted projects. The GRT token acts as an incentive mechanism for the Graph Network. It incentivizes network participants to provide data to end users and organize it effectively. So, how high will GRT go? Is it a good investment? What will be its price in 2025? The following sections explore these questions and more.

Cryptocurrency loses 1.15% of its value. GRT coin looks for buyers’ support at $0.0921. On August 8, 2025, The Graph price analysis revealed a decreasing trend for the cryptocurrency. The altcoin’s value has dipped to $0.0947 in the past 24 hours, following a downtrend for a third consecutive day. At the same time, the currency lost 1.15% of its value today. Despite the previous upswing until yesterday, today, market events remained unfavorable for the bulls as the token’s value has decreased. The Graph 1-day chart analysis The one-day price chart of The Graph confirmed a bearish trend in the market. The cryptocurrency’s value has decreased to $0.0947 over the last 24 hours. In addition, the increasing volatility levels suggest a higher chance of a reversal. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is increasing, leading to high volatility in the market. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $0.117. Conversely, its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.0833. GRT/USD 1-day price chart. Image source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator confirms the recent downturn in price. Its score has decreased to index 47.26 today, and is trending in the neutral range. However, if the bearish momentum continues to grow, further instability in the market can be expected. The Graph 4-hour chart analysis The four-hour price analysis of The Graph coin referred to a bullish trend in the market. Buyers are now aiming for an increase above the current level on the GRT/USD price chart, but have not succeeded yet. The Bollinger Bands are diverging, resulting in increasing volatility. This increase in volatility signifies higher market unpredictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $0.0966, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $0.0871, securing the support. GRT/USD 4-hour price chart. Image source: TradingView The RSI indicator is moving upwards within the neutral area for now. The indicator’s value has increased to 56.10 in the last four hours. The upward curve on the RSI graph represents some degree of stability in the market. Further upside is possible given the recent bullish progression.

The Graph rivals some Web2 data oracles for its efficiency and low costs. GRT, its native token, however, remains a victim of general market dynamics and high volatility. If observed over the larger picture, the current sentiment is bearish, with predictions pointing to higher price growth. It is advised to do your own research and conduct investment advice before investing in the volatile market. What can we expect from GRT price analysis next? The Graph price analysis gives a relatively bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s value has decreased to $0.0947 in the past 24 hours. A continuation of the current price action might diminish further chances for investors. The increasing volatility on the daily chart shows that there is a high chance of a trend reversal, which, if it happens, can lead to a price above $0.0956. Why is GRT down? The decrease in the Graph’s value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Moreover, the past few days supported the bulls, as the price was increasing, so the coin is correcting today after finding resistance. Will GRT reach $0.5? Yes, GRT should rise above $0.5 in 2029. In that year, the price will range between $0.470815 and $0.52514. Will GRT reach $1? Per the analysts’ price predictions, it remains unlikely that GRT will get to $1 by 2031. Will GRT reach $10? Considering GRT’s current price and market cap, it remains highly unlikely that it will reach $10 in the next ten years. Does GRT have a good long-term future? According to the market assumptions, GRT is set to trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Hence, it is advised to do your own research and conduct in-depth investment advice before investing in the volatile market.

The company, American Bitcoin Corp., is linked to Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. and was formed earlier this year. The amount the twins invested was not revealed. However, Hut 8 Corp. CEO Asher Genoot confirmed their contribution was part of a $220 million private placement that closed recently. The raise, which included both cash and Bitcoin , was described as oversubscribed during Hut 8’s latest earnings call. The billionaire Winklevoss twins are said to have invested in a new crypto-mining venture tied to another set of high-profile brothers, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. https://t.co/uCofs2eMWl — Bloomberg (@business) August 7, 2025 Political And Crypto Ties Grow Closer This isn’t the first time the Winklevoss twins and the Trump family have crossed paths. The twins have previously donated to President Donald Trump’s campaign. They were also present at a White House crypto summit in March and attended the signing of recent crypto legislation. Genoot said the company’s structure will give it the scale and capital it needs to compete in the Bitcoin mining industry. Trump Family In Business With Hut 8 American Bitcoin Corp. began operations in March through a partnership with Hut 8, which holds 80% of the company. The other 20% belongs to American Data Centers, a firm backed by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. Eric is also the company’s director for strategic planning. Based on earlier Bloomberg reporting, his stake could be valued as much as $367 million once the company makes its public debut. The company plans to go public through an all-stock merger with Nasdaq-listed Gryphon Digital Mining Inc., trading under the ticker “ABTC.” Just this week, shareholders of Gryphon began voting on the deal. If given the greenlight, the collaboration is expected to be finalized by early September. American Bitcoin says its focus will be on both mining and holding Bitcoin, building a long-term reserve from its own production. The Winklevoss twins, who run the Gemini crypto exchange, contributed their share in Bitcoin, according to reports. A Gemini representative declined to comment on the investment. Mining Sector Faces Stiffer Competition American Bitcoin’s $220 million raise signals aggressive plans for expansion. A Hut 8 filing shows around $10 million of newly issued equity was sold for Bitcoin instead of cash, reflecting the company’s goal to accumulate the asset directly. Donald Trump Jr. has said that mining, along with holding Bitcoin, will be central to the company’s long-term strategy.

The fact that the altcoin has been unable to clear this level points to this being the resistance to beat if Ethereum is to continue its uptrend. It also shows that there are forces keeping the altcoin from breaking this $4,000, and one market expert has attributed this to hedge funds, who have a unique interest in holding the price below $4,000. What Ethereum Above $4,000 Means For Options Traders In an X post, trader and market analyst Glen Goodman unveiled another angle to the beatdown that the Ethereum price has continuously suffered at the $4,000 level. This elusive price tag remains the singular hindrance to the ETH price possibility breaking its $4,800 peak from 2021, and its continuous trading below this price tag could be intentional. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could See Another Crash To Fill This Imbalance Before Rally To $120,000 Goodman’s post focuses on options traders and the hedge funds which they are betting against. Basically, since the hedge funds are still short Ethereum at this point, they need to suppress the price and keep it from reclaiming $4,000 in order to keep their positions in a profit. These professional traders or hedge funds are the ‘sellers’ who write the options, and they get a premium for doing so. Then the options buyers are paying a premium to the sellers as they are betting on the price of Ethereum actually going up above $4,000. So, every time the Ethereum price does reach $4,000, it gets beaten down so hedge funds can continue to profit from the premiums being made from buyers. What Happens If ETH Clears $4,000? In the event that the Ethereum price does cross $4,000, it means that the hedge funds will start to lose money, and the options buyers will begin making money. As the crypto trader explains, the higher the ETH price goes, the more money the options buyers make and the more money the hedge funds lose. This is why there always seems to be a violent pullback every time Ethereum comes close to $4,000 as the hedge funds continue to short it. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Crash Could End Soon With A Roadmap For $5 Goodman explained that the hedge funds have been able to use this strategy to keep the Ethereum price below $4,000 and remain in profit. However, with each time that the altcoin comes close to the $4,000 level, the probability of breaking above it becomes higher. Over the long term, Ethereum’s price breaking $4,000 is incredibly bullish. “Strong resistance kicks in at $4000, so the price could really fly if it beats all the resistance in the early 4000s,” Goodman explained.

Wilson says in a new interview with Bloomberg TV that Morgan Stanley believes the economy had been in a three-year rolling recession that ended in April. “Now we’re in a new bull market and capital markets activity is just another sign that that analysis or that conclusion is probably correct.” The Morgan Stanley executive believes there could be volatility and drawdowns in the third quarter, but he also thinks that such corrections wouldn’t invalidate the bull market thesis. “We’ve said that the third quarter, we think this is the best chance we could have for some correction or moderation, if you will. But I want to be very clear, it is still early in the new bull market, so you want to be buying these dips.” Wilson also outlines what he believes needs to happen for the bull market to continue. “I think to continue the bull market, you need two things. The ingredients you need [include] positive rate of change on growth. Okay, we have that from an earnings standpoint. And you have a policy that isn’t inhibiting that growth. So both fiscal and monetary policy look like they’re okay. And it appears as if the Fed, maybe they’re not going to cut [rates] in the short term, but all signs point to the next move will be a cut. So you have supportive policy, you have positive rate of change, you have good flow dynamics. I mean, those are all the ingredients you need.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Recently, excitement surged across the market following media reports suggesting that SBI Holdings , a prominent Japanese financial services giant, had formally submitted applications for groundbreaking Crypto ETFs Japan . These reports painted a picture of innovative dual-asset funds, specifically a gold-crypto ETF and a highly anticipated Bitcoin XRP ETF , poised to enter the Japanese market. What Was the Big Buzz About SBI Holdings’ Crypto ETF Filings? The initial reports, circulated widely by outlets like Cointelegraph, indicated that SBI Holdings was pushing forward with these novel investment vehicles. For many in the crypto community, this was seen as a significant step towards broader institutional adoption and mainstream acceptance of digital assets within Japan’s regulated financial system. The prospect of a dual gold-crypto ETF, combining traditional safe-haven assets with the volatility of cryptocurrencies, was particularly intriguing. Similarly, a dedicated Bitcoin XRP ETF highlighted SBI’s strong existing relationship with Ripple and its belief in these specific digital assets. However, the narrative took a crucial turn. SBI Holdings has since issued a clear denial, setting the record straight. The company confirmed that while these proposed products are indeed part of their long-term strategic vision and are currently in the planning and development stages, they have not yet been formally submitted for regulatory approval. This distinction is vital for understanding the actual timeline and the meticulous ETF approval process involved. Why Does This Clarification Matter for Japan Crypto Regulations? This denial by SBI Holdings serves as a stark reminder of the complexities and strict requirements surrounding financial product launches, especially when digital assets are involved. Japan is recognized globally for its forward-thinking yet robust approach to cryptocurrency oversight. Japan crypto regulations are designed to protect investors and maintain market integrity, meaning any new financial instrument, like a crypto ETF, must undergo rigorous scrutiny. The clarification highlights several key aspects: Preventing Misinformation: SBI’s prompt response ensures that market participants base their decisions on accurate information, preventing undue speculation. Regulatory Rigor: It underscores the comprehensive nature of the ETF approval process in Japan, which is not a quick or simple undertaking. Setting Realistic Expectations: Investors now have a clearer understanding that while these innovative products are envisioned, their actual availability is still some way off. SBI Holdings has a proven track record of embracing digital innovation, including operating a crypto exchange and being a significant investor in Ripple. Their continued interest in Crypto ETFs Japan aligns with their broader strategy to be at the forefront of digital finance. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Bitcoin XRP ETF and Other Crypto ETFs? The path to launching any new ETF, particularly one involving cryptocurrencies, is fraught with challenges. Even with a visionary company like SBI Holdings leading the charge, several hurdles must be overcome. For a Bitcoin XRP ETF , for instance, regulators will scrutinize aspects like custody solutions, market manipulation risks, and the underlying liquidity of the assets. The dual gold-crypto ETF would also present unique challenges in how two distinct asset classes are managed and valued within a single fund structure. Moreover, the broader landscape of Japan crypto regulations continues to evolve. While Japan has been proactive in licensing crypto exchanges, the framework for more complex investment products like ETFs is still developing. This requires close collaboration between financial institutions and regulatory bodies to ensure that new offerings meet the highest standards of compliance and investor protection. Understanding these evolving Japan crypto regulations is crucial for any firm looking to launch new products. The Future of Crypto ETFs in Japan: A Promising Horizon? Despite the current denial of filings, the fact that SBI Holdings is actively planning Crypto ETFs Japan is a significant positive signal for the market. It indicates a strong institutional belief in the long-term viability and investment potential of digital assets. The proposed dual gold-crypto ETF and Bitcoin XRP ETF could, once approved, offer investors diversified exposure and a regulated entry point into the crypto space, potentially attracting a wider range of participants. As the digital asset ecosystem matures, the demand for regulated and easily accessible investment products will only grow. Financial conglomerates like SBI Holdings are crucial in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of cryptocurrencies. Their diligent approach to the ETF approval process , even if lengthy, builds confidence and legitimacy for the entire sector. In conclusion, while the initial reports of immediate filings for Crypto ETFs Japan were inaccurate, SBI Holdings’ clarification reaffirms their commitment to developing these cutting-edge products. This situation underscores the importance of verifying news from official sources and highlights the rigorous journey required for innovative financial products to gain regulatory approval. The future of crypto ETFs in Japan remains bright, albeit on a carefully planned timeline, driven by major players like SBI Holdings.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-august-9-is-crucial-for-xrp-price-rally-heres-why/,"A recent chart shared by crypto analyst Xoom (@Mr_Xoom) has placed renewed focus on XRP’s near-term trajectory. The post highlights what the analyst describes as a “perfect call for the bottom,” based on Elliott Wave Theory, with the asset now positioned for a potential upside move as August 9 approaches, a date coinciding with the coming full moon. The daily chart shows a clearly labeled five-wave impulse to the downside, with the final leg (wave five) concluding around the $2.8 area. The analyst emphasizes this zone as the bottom, visually reinforced by a boxed support region that captured the final wave low. Notably, XRP lost the psychologically important $3 support level in early August, falling toward this level. Since completing the fifth wave, the digital asset has rebounded sharply, regaining the $3 level and trading at $3.08 at the time of Xoom’s analysis. XRP Perfect call for the bottom. Full moon on August 9, send it. https://t.co/2gTuBbaYdA pic.twitter.com/zd0ujAL7z5 — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) August 7, 2025 Wave Structure and Support Confirmation Xoom’s chart follows the classic five-wave sequence, with each wave respecting prior technical boundaries. The corrective nature of the move, declining from the July peak of $3.65 , now appears to be over. The return above the $3 level, which acted as prior resistance and interim support in July, strengthens the argument that the market has completed a full corrective cycle. Although the analyst did not provide an explicit price target, the implication is that the wave structure has reset and that the market is preparing for another impulsive move. The timing of the analysis is notable, as the full moon on August 9 is being linked to a potential catalyst for market momentum. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Full Moon Reinforces Bullish Sentiment While not a traditional technical indicator, moon phases and the upcoming full moon have been referenced by other experts as a secondary input for XRP, particularly when aligned with key chart signals. Price behavior following the wave five low supports the short-term bullish outlook. XRP has held its gains and avoided a deeper retracement, which would typically follow a weak bounce. The recovery has brought the price back into the mid-range zone between $3 and $3.2, where it has historically consolidated. By coupling the full moon, a speculative factor, with a textbook technical structure, the analyst positions August 9 as a potential inflection point. Whether the market respects this correlation remains to be seen, but the chart itself shows that the downward pressure has exhausted , and momentum is shifting.

For those invested in cryptocurrencies, understanding these macro-economic currents is paramount, as they often dictate the broader liquidity and risk appetite that influences digital assets. Today, we delve into a significant development from one of the world’s leading financial institutions: UBS’s latest stance on the Swiss franc forecast . Despite the looming shadow of U.S. tariffs and a shifting Federal Reserve policy, UBS maintains its conviction, offering a compelling perspective on what lies ahead for this key safe-haven currency. Unpacking the Latest Swiss Franc Forecast from UBS UBS, a titan in global wealth management, has recently reaffirmed its position on the Swiss franc (CHF), signaling a continued belief in its underlying stability despite the turbulent global economic landscape. This is not a simple reaffirmation; it’s a nuanced assessment considering the complex interplay of international trade disputes and central bank strategies. The Swiss franc has historically served as a beacon of stability, often sought after during times of global uncertainty due to Switzerland’s strong economy, political neutrality, and robust financial system. UBS’s analysis underscores several key drivers influencing their Swiss franc forecast : Safe-Haven Appeal: In periods of heightened geopolitical tension or economic slowdown, investors often flock to the CHF, driving up its value. Swiss National Bank (SNB) Policy: The SNB’s monetary policy, particularly its stance on interest rates and interventions, plays a crucial role in managing the franc’s strength. Current Account Surplus: Switzerland consistently runs a large current account surplus, indicating strong exports and net foreign income, which supports the franc. Understanding these foundational elements is essential before we explore how external pressures like U.S. tariffs and evolving Fed policy might challenge or reinforce this outlook. How Do US Tariffs Reshape the Forex Market? The imposition of US tariffs has become a recurring theme in global trade, creating significant uncertainty and volatility across various asset classes, including currencies. Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, are designed to protect domestic industries but often lead to retaliatory measures, escalating trade wars. For the Forex market , the impact is multifaceted: Risk Aversion: Trade tensions increase global economic uncertainty, prompting investors to shun riskier assets and seek refuge in traditional safe havens like the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, and the Swiss franc. Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs can disrupt global supply chains, affecting corporate profits and economic growth, which in turn influences a country’s currency strength. Inflationary Pressures: Tariffs can lead to higher import costs, potentially fueling inflation. Central banks may then adjust monetary policy in response, impacting currency valuations. While U.S. tariffs directly impact trade relationships, their ripple effect on global growth prospects and investor sentiment indirectly strengthens demand for currencies perceived as stable. This dynamic is a key consideration in the UBS outlook for the CHF, as escalating trade disputes could further bolster its safe-haven appeal. Decoding Fed Policy: A Critical Factor for Currency Stability The monetary policy decisions of the U.S. Federal Reserve are arguably the single most influential factor in global financial markets, with profound implications for every major currency, including the Swiss franc. The Fed policy on interest rates, quantitative easing, and inflation targets sets the tone for global liquidity and investment flows. When the Fed signals a shift in its stance, the U.S. dollar (USD) reacts, and given the USD’s status as the world’s primary reserve currency, this reverberates throughout the entire Forex market . Consider these aspects of Fed policy influence: Interest Rate Differentials: A higher Fed interest rate relative to other central banks (like the SNB) makes dollar-denominated assets more attractive, potentially drawing capital away from other currencies, including the CHF. Conversely, if the Fed signals rate cuts, the USD might weaken, indirectly strengthening other currencies. Global Liquidity: The Fed’s balance sheet policies (quantitative easing or tightening) directly impact global liquidity. Abundant liquidity can flow into riskier assets, while tightening can lead to a ‘dash for cash’ and strengthen the USD. Economic Outlook: The Fed’s assessment of the U.S. economic outlook influences investor confidence globally. A strong U.S. economy can pull global growth, affecting all currencies. UBS’s maintained Swiss franc forecast suggests they anticipate the CHF’s intrinsic strengths will help it weather potential headwinds from Fed policy shifts, perhaps even benefiting from a weaker dollar if the Fed adopts a more dovish stance. The UBS Outlook: Navigating Intersecting Economic Forces The true genius of the UBS outlook lies in its ability to synthesize these disparate yet interconnected economic forces – U.S. tariffs and Fed policy – into a cohesive Swiss franc forecast . It’s not merely about predicting the CHF’s direction in isolation but understanding how it reacts within a complex global system. UBS likely employs sophisticated models that weigh the probabilities of various scenarios: Scenario US Tariffs Impact Fed Policy Impact Expected CHF Response Escalating Trade War Increased global uncertainty, reduced trade volumes. Likely dovish (rate cuts) to support growth. Stronger CHF (safe-haven demand), potentially against a weaker USD. De-escalation & Growth Improved global sentiment, increased trade. Likely neutral/hawkish (stable rates) amid growth. Weaker CHF (reduced safe-haven demand) as risk appetite returns. Stagflationary Fears Supply shocks from tariffs, high inflation. Complex dilemma: combat inflation vs. support growth. Volatile CHF , potentially strong if safe-haven demand outweighs inflation concerns. This table illustrates how UBS’s continued positive Swiss franc forecast might stem from a belief that the safe-haven demand generated by trade tensions could offset any negative pressure from Fed policy, or even be amplified if the Fed is forced to cut rates. Challenges and Opportunities in the Current Forex Market The current environment, shaped by persistent US tariffs and an evolving Fed policy , presents both significant challenges and unique opportunities for participants in the Forex market . Understanding these dynamics is crucial for making informed decisions. Challenges: Increased Volatility: Sudden announcements regarding trade or monetary policy can trigger rapid currency swings, making risk management complex. Unpredictable Economic Data: The impact of tariffs on global supply chains and inflation can distort traditional economic indicators, making forecasting more difficult. Policy Divergence: Central banks may adopt divergent policies, leading to unpredictable capital flows and currency movements. Opportunities: Safe-Haven Plays: Currencies like the Swiss franc offer opportunities for capital preservation during times of global stress. Diversification: Including stable currencies in a diversified portfolio can help mitigate overall risk, especially for those heavily exposed to other asset classes like equities or even volatile cryptocurrencies. Interest Rate Arbitrage: While risky, careful analysis of interest rate differentials, influenced by Fed policy, can present opportunities for carry trades. The continued UBS outlook on the CHF suggests that for astute investors, the challenges can be navigated, and opportunities can be seized, particularly by focusing on assets with intrinsic stability. Actionable Insights for Investors Given the intricate dance between the Swiss franc forecast , US tariffs , and Fed policy , what steps can investors take to position themselves effectively in the Forex market ? Monitor Global Trade Developments Closely: Pay attention to news on trade negotiations and tariff implementations. Escalation typically boosts safe havens like the CHF, while de-escalation may reduce its appeal. Track Federal Reserve Communications: Follow FOMC meeting minutes, speeches by Fed officials, and economic projections. Signals about future rate changes or quantitative easing/tightening will significantly impact the USD and, consequently, other major currencies. Consider CHF as a Portfolio Stabilizer: For those looking to diversify or hedge against broader market volatility, a strategic allocation to the Swiss franc, in line with the UBS outlook , could be beneficial. It can act as a counterbalance during periods of equity market downturns or geopolitical crises. Implement Robust Risk Management: Given the potential for sudden shifts, utilize stop-loss orders and position sizing to manage exposure. Avoid over-leveraging, especially in a volatile currency market. Consult Financial Professionals: The currency market is complex. Seeking advice from financial advisors who specialize in forex can provide tailored strategies based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. These insights underscore the importance of vigilance and strategic planning in navigating the evolving global financial landscape. Conclusion: What Lies Ahead for the Swiss Franc? UBS’s decision to maintain its Swiss franc forecast is a testament to the currency’s enduring resilience in the face of significant global headwinds. While the ongoing specter of US tariffs and the evolving stance of Fed policy undoubtedly introduce layers of complexity and potential volatility, the CHF’s fundamental role as a safe haven appears to be a consistent anchor. The Forex market remains a fascinating arena where macro-economic forces play out in real-time, offering both risks and rewards. For investors, particularly those accustomed to the rapid shifts in the crypto world, understanding these traditional market dynamics is crucial. The UBS outlook suggests that despite the external pressures, the Swiss franc is poised to retain its value, continuing to be a critical component in the global financial architecture. As these powerful forces continue to shape the world economy, the Swiss franc will undoubtedly remain a currency to watch.

Kaplan, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, tells CNBC in a new interview that the low unemployment figures are not telling the full labor story because the overall labor pool is shrinking due to President Trump’s immigration efforts. “I’ve been saying for some time that hiring is down to stall speed. That’s been true for the last few months. The reason the unemployment rate is so low is not that businesses are firing; they’re not, but they’re not hiring either, and we’re losing labor supply because of the immigration policies. You’ve got to look at more than just headline unemployment to understand the labor market. The labor market is weaker than headline unemployment suggests, and the reason, again, is businesses are not hiring. Hiring is very sluggish, and it just doesn’t look as bad as it might, because supply is also declining.” He also believes that the Fed may announce a rate cut at its next meeting in September. “If I were in my former seat, I would be tilting very seriously to thinking about cutting in September. There are cross currents, and here’s why I say tilting. We’re running above 2% inflation. Whether we like it or not, the tariffs are going to raise costs… It’s been some time since we’ve been in a situation that we were at risk of not meeting our employment mandate, and we’re having above-trend inflation… And so this weakening, if it persists, it means I’m going to have to take more risk, and my guess is that will mean taking a serious look at cutting 25 basis points in September. But I would caution that doesn’t mean we’re starting a rate-cutting cycle after September. If we cut, you wipe the slate clean and take a fresh look at November.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

However, the 2025 panel shows a notable shift, with price action currently holding higher ground. August Performance In Recent Years The chart presents three consecutive years of August declines. In 2022, XRP lost 13.65% during the month, followed by a steeper drop of 26.75% in 2023. In 2024, the August decline was smaller, at 9.09%, but continued the pattern of red monthly closes. These results have contributed to the perception of August as a historically challenging month for XRP. August is an historical bad month for #XRP Will it be different this time? pic.twitter.com/DlLoOKUSC8 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 7, 2025 2025’s Different Start This year’s chart tells a more encouraging story. XRP began August with a pullback, falling below the $3 support level . However, the decline proved short-lived. Buyers stepped in, and the price recovered, regaining $3 shortly after. XRP currently remains in the green for August, breaking from the immediate downward momentum that has defined the month in previous years. The current performance suggests the market is more resilient than in prior August sessions. The recovery back above $3 demonstrates strong buying interest and a willingness among traders to defend key levels. This has shifted sentiment toward a more optimistic outlook for the remainder of the month. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bullish Expectations Moving Forward Analysts monitoring the recovery have pointed to the regained $3 level as a sign of strength. Many expect this momentum to continue, raising the possibility that 2025 could be the year XRP finally breaks the August bearish streak. A green monthly close would mark a clear departure from the three-year pattern highlighted in Steph Is Crypto’s chart. Other market factors have also contributed to XRP’s growth. Ripple and the SEC recently filed for dismissal of their appeals , ending their protracted legal battle and renewing the hope for increased XRP adoption. The asset jumped over 13% after this announcement, and is now trading at $3.36. Prominent analysts have highlighted $3.64 as a crucial level that could set the digital asset on the path to double-digit targets . Notably, this level is XRP’s current all-time high , which was reached in July. If the asset can maintain its current momentum, it could smash through this level, reaching new heights, and reversing the historical August bearish trend.

This move comes on the heels of a particularly hawkish Bank of England meeting, signaling a potentially robust period for the British Pound. For investors, including those in the cryptocurrency space who often monitor macroeconomic shifts, understanding these traditional finance movements is key to navigating broader market dynamics. What Does This Upgraded GBP Outlook Mean for Investors? Deutsche Bank, a prominent global financial institution, has delivered a vote of confidence in the British Pound. Their revised GBP Outlook suggests that the currency is poised for stronger performance than previously anticipated. This upgrade reflects a deeper analysis of the underlying economic conditions in the UK and, crucially, the Bank of England’s commitment to its inflation-fighting mandate. An upward revision from a major bank like Deutsche Bank often serves as a significant signal to the market, potentially attracting more capital flows into GBP-denominated assets. It indicates that the bank believes the factors supporting the Pound are strengthening, making it a more attractive currency for investment and trade. Decoding the Bank of England ‘s Hawkish Stance The core catalyst behind Deutsche Bank’s optimism is the recent hawkish posture adopted by the Bank of England . But what exactly does ‘hawkish’ mean in central banking terms? Essentially, it describes a monetary policy stance that prioritizes controlling inflation, often by raising interest rates or maintaining them at elevated levels. The BoE’s recent communications and actions have underscored its resolve to bring inflation back to its target, even if it means tightening financial conditions more aggressively or for a longer duration than previously expected. Key indicators of this hawkish shift include: Stronger Language: The BoE has used more assertive language regarding its commitment to combating persistent inflation. Interest Rate Decisions: Decisions to raise interest rates, or signals that rates will remain high, are central to a hawkish approach. Economic Projections: Revised economic forecasts from the BoE that emphasize inflation risks can also contribute to a hawkish perception. This firm stance from the Bank of England suggests a period of higher borrowing costs, which typically supports a currency by making it more attractive for foreign investors seeking better returns on their fixed-income investments. The Impact of Hawkish Monetary Policy on Currency Value A Hawkish Monetary Policy , when implemented by a central bank like the Bank of England, directly influences a nation’s currency value. Here’s how: Interest Rate Differentials: Higher interest rates in the UK make Pound-denominated assets, such as government bonds, more attractive compared to those in countries with lower rates. This increased demand for British assets translates into increased demand for the British Pound. Capital Inflows: Global investors seeking higher yields are drawn to economies with rising interest rates. This influx of foreign capital into the UK boosts the demand for GBP, pushing its value up. Inflation Control: A central bank’s commitment to controlling inflation through hawkish measures can enhance investor confidence in the long-term stability and purchasing power of the currency. Economic Stability Perception: A proactive central bank addressing economic challenges can be seen as a positive sign, reinforcing investor trust in the economy’s management. This interplay between central bank policy and currency performance is a fundamental principle in forex markets, and the Hawkish Monetary Policy of the BoE is now a primary driver for the Pound’s trajectory. Delving into the Deutsche Bank Forecast : What Are Their Key Assumptions? The revised Deutsche Bank Forecast for the British Pound is not merely a knee-jerk reaction; it’s built upon a comprehensive analysis of various economic indicators and policy signals. While specific numbers are not always publicly detailed, their reasoning typically hinges on several key assumptions: Assumption Category Deutsche Bank’s Likely View Inflation Trajectory Inflation remains elevated, requiring sustained BoE action. Labor Market Strength Resilient employment and wage growth support continued rate hikes. BoE Credibility The central bank is committed to its mandate, bolstering confidence. Global Economic Context Relatively stable global conditions allow for domestic policy focus. This detailed assessment allows Deutsche Bank to form a confident Deutsche Bank Forecast , projecting a more favorable path for the British Pound in the coming months. Their analysis likely factors in not just the immediate rate hike potential but also the longer-term implications of sustained tighter monetary policy. Anticipating the Broader Forex Market Impact The revised GBP Outlook and the Bank of England’s firm stance are set to create significant ripples across the entire Forex Market Impact . Here’s what market participants might expect: GBP/USD and GBP/EUR Dynamics: The Pound is likely to strengthen against major counterparts like the US Dollar and the Euro, especially if the BoE’s tightening pace outpaces that of the Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank. Increased Volatility: While the direction might be upward, the path can be volatile as markets react to incoming economic data and any subtle shifts in BoE communication. Trader Opportunities: For forex traders, this situation presents opportunities in long GBP positions, though careful risk management remains paramount. Cross-Currency Implications: The strength of the Pound could indirectly affect other currency pairs, particularly those with strong trade ties to the UK. Understanding this broader Forex Market Impact is crucial for anyone involved in currency trading or international investments, as it can influence hedging strategies, investment decisions, and overall portfolio performance. What are the Potential Challenges and Risks for the British Pound? While the outlook appears positive, no financial forecast is without its risks. The British Pound could face headwinds from several factors: Persistent Inflation: If inflation proves more stubborn than anticipated, forcing the BoE into even more aggressive action, it could tip the economy into a deeper slowdown, potentially undermining GBP strength. Economic Downturn: A sharper-than-expected economic recession in the UK could diminish investor confidence, despite hawkish policy. Global Economic Shocks: Unforeseen global events, such as a severe energy crisis or a significant geopolitical escalation, could override domestic factors. Policy Missteps: Any perceived misstep or lack of clarity from the Bank of England could erode market trust. Investors should remain vigilant and monitor these potential challenges, as they could impact the longevity and strength of the predicted GBP rally. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Strengthened GBP Environment Given Deutsche Bank’s upgraded GBP Outlook and the Bank of England’s hawkish stance, what actionable insights can investors glean? Monitor BoE Communications: Pay close attention to every statement, speech, and minutes release from the Bank of England. These provide crucial clues about future policy direction. Track UK Economic Data: Key economic indicators like inflation rates, GDP growth, and employment figures will dictate the BoE’s actions. Consider Diversification: Even with a strong outlook, diversification across various asset classes and currencies remains a prudent strategy to mitigate risks. Review Exposure: Businesses with significant exposure to GBP-denominated revenues or costs should review their hedging strategies in light of potential currency appreciation. Staying informed and agile in response to market developments will be key to capitalizing on the opportunities presented by a potentially stronger British Pound. Conclusion: A Bold Path for the British Pound? Deutsche Bank’s upward revision of its GBP Outlook , spurred by the Bank of England’s unwavering Hawkish Stance , marks a significant moment for the British Pound. This development signals a period where the fight against inflation takes precedence, potentially bolstering the currency’s value in the Forex Market Impact . While opportunities for investors may arise from this shift, a careful watch on economic data and central bank communications remains essential. The Deutsche Bank Forecast offers a compelling perspective, but the dynamic nature of global finance requires continuous vigilance to navigate potential challenges and leverage the evolving landscape. The journey of the British Pound, influenced by the robust actions of the Bank of England , is set to be a focal point for global financial markets in the coming period.

A Vision Of Growth In a press release shared with CryptoPotato, Pharos Network, a Layer-1 (L1) blockchain focused on real-world asset finance (RWAfi), has joined forces with Morpho, a lending network with over $9 billion in deposits. The collaboration will bring Morpho’s lending infrastructure to the Pharos mainnet, marking an inaugural step towards institutional-grade lending rails in the RWA ecosystem. The lending network will facilitate efficient lending with isolated risks, thereby opening the door to flexible credit markets for asset creators, such as loan platforms and liquidity providers. This partnership strengthens the broader RWAfi strategy alongside peers like Ant Digital, R25, and Gauntlet. Wish Wu, CTO and Co-Founder at Pharos, noted the following about the merger: “For us, working together with Morpho is about building trust and composability at the core of RWAfi. By integrating Morpho’s lending infrastructure directly into our mainnet, we’re laying the foundation for a more transparent and capital-efficient on-chain credit ecosystem. It enables us to support complex, institution-grade lending strategies while preserving the modularity and openness that define DeFi.” Morpho’s protocol will fuel the upcoming launch of the Pharos vault and capital deployment frameworks. The first framework will focus on the design of vaults for institutions, backed by Pharos’ authority across custody, credit modeling, and liquidity routing. The integration is designed to support composability with the L1 blockchain’s existing infrastructure, enabling experimentation with RWA yield, capital matching, and onboarding strategies. “Pharos’ vision for RWAfi aligns with our commitment to transparent and scalable credit systems. Together, we are creating a powerful infrastructure for structured lending products, better risk pricing, and more accessible yield opportunities across both institutional and retail markets.” said Kirk Hutchison, New Chains Growth at Morpho Real-World Assets On The Rise CryptoPotato has previously covered how this market segment has experienced explosive growth, soaring almost 60 times over the last few years. Additionally, according to reports, the sector is projected to grow to $600 billion by the end of the decade. Data taken at press time from rwa.xyz shows us how the inflow of funds has been split across the sector, with institutions having an uncontested lead.

The introduction comes just months after the Hong Kong-based startup raised $20 million in a funding round co-led by Jump Crypto and Pantera Capital, lifting its valuation to $1.1 billion . Humanity Protocol’s zkTLS technology allows users to prove they have viewed verifiable information, such as job listings or airline loyalty status, without revealing the underlying document or page. Sensitive data never leaves the user’s browser, avoiding the privacy concerns that have riddled biometric approaches, including Worldcoin’s iris-scanning model. Initially, travelers are able link frequent-flyer and loyalty accounts directly to their “Human ID,” creating a portable reputation layer usable across both Web2 and Web3 applications. The network also supports financial, educational and professional credentials. In future, it plans to roll out node infrastructure in new regions as well as venturing into on-chain ticketing and decentralized governance. “Our mainnet release turns decentralized identity into practical infrastructure,” said founder and CEO Terence Kwok. “With zkTLS now live, anyone can confirm who they are and what they have achieved across multiple platforms, yet no central party ever sees their personal information.” By relying on cryptographic proofs rather than physical biometrics, Humanity Protocol positions itself as a more privacy-conscious alternative to Worldcoin and other “proof-of-human” projects. The network’s architecture allows developers to build Sybil-resistant social platforms, reputation-based marketplaces and AI “humanity checks” without collecting or storing sensitive user data. A Sybil attack occurs when a person or entity creates multiple fake identities within a network, often to gain a reward like an airdrop or disproportionate control of a network's operations.",Finance|Identity|Digital Idenitty|worldcoin|Mainnet|News,EN,0,0,WLD|BLOCKCHAIN|AIRDROP|ASIA|MINING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-08 09:23:50

The Second Circuit Appeals Court, in a brief filing on Thursday, acknowledged the dismissal and confirmed that each side would bear its own legal costs and fees. Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, confirmed the news on X, stating , “Following the Commission’s vote today, the SEC and Ripple formally filed directly with the Second Circuit to dismiss their appeals. The end… and now back to business.” The SEC first sued Ripple in December 2020, accusing the company of selling XRP as an unregistered security. The case took a significant turn in July 2023 when U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres delivered a mixed ruling. She determined that XRP sales on public exchanges did not qualify as securities, but sales to institutional investors did. Judge Torres’ Ruling Now Stands Final With both appeals dropped, Judge Torres’ 2023 decision is now final. Ripple was ordered to pay $125 million in fines to the SEC—significantly lower than the $2 billion initially sought by the regulator. The agency appealed this ruling in October 2023, prompting Ripple to file a cross-appeal soon after. Despite the regulator’s push, settlement discussions began earlier this year . In April, the SEC and Ripple filed a joint motion to pause the appeals, signaling a willingness to end the matter. A tentative settlement was reached in May, but Judge Torres denied Ripple’s request in June to lower the fine and dissolve an injunction, emphasizing the company’s obligation to comply with federal securities laws. SEC Retreats The SEC’s decision to drop the appeal was not entirely unexpected. Under President Donald Trump’s second administration, the regulator has scaled back its enforcement against crypto companies, abandoning several lawsuits. The Ripple case—initiated during Trump’s first term—was among the most closely watched legal battles in the industry. For XRP holders, the end of the case has provided a bullish tailwind. Since hitting a low of $1.79 on April 9, 2025, XRP surged nearly 99% to $3.56 on July 22, according to CoinMarketCap. While the token briefly dipped below $3, it has since rebounded, climbing 11.5% over the past day to trade at $3.34.

While digital assets often grab headlines, the ebb and flow of major fiat currencies, particularly the US Dollar Weakness and its counterparts, can have profound implications across the global economic landscape, even indirectly influencing the crypto ecosystem. This week, the dollar finds itself on the back foot, marking a notable weekly loss, while the British Pound sterling enjoys a robust ascent. What’s driving these compelling movements, and what do they mean for investors and observers alike? Why is the US Dollar Weakness Persisting? The mighty US Dollar, often considered the world’s reserve currency and a safe haven during times of uncertainty, has recently shown signs of vulnerability. Several factors contribute to the current US Dollar Weakness , making it a focal point for Forex Market Analysis . These include: Evolving Interest Rate Expectations: The Federal Reserve’s stance on interest rates is a primary driver. As other central banks, like the Bank of England, adopt more aggressive tightening policies, the relative attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets can diminish. Cooling Inflationary Pressures: Signs of easing inflation in the US, while positive for consumers, might reduce the urgency for the Fed to hike rates further, thereby lessening the dollar’s yield advantage. Improving Global Risk Sentiment: When global economic prospects appear brighter, investors tend to shift away from safe-haven assets like the dollar towards higher-yielding or growth-oriented currencies and investments. Economic Data Surprises: Recent US economic data, if weaker than expected, can reinforce the narrative of a slowing economy, putting downward pressure on the dollar. This confluence of factors has created a challenging environment for the dollar, leading to its current retreat from recent highs. Understanding these drivers is fundamental to grasping the broader Global Currency Trends . The Ascent of Sterling Strength : What’s Powering the Pound? In stark contrast to the dollar’s decline, the British Pound has demonstrated remarkable Sterling Strength this week. This robust performance is largely attributed to the hawkish stance adopted by the Bank of England (BoE). A ‘hawkish’ central bank signals a readiness to raise interest rates to combat inflation, making a country’s currency more attractive to foreign investors seeking higher returns on their investments. The BoE’s proactive approach has instilled confidence in the market, drawing capital flows into the UK. This isn’t just about interest rates; it’s also about the central bank’s commitment to price stability. The perceived determination of the BoE to tame inflation, even at the risk of slower economic growth, has bolstered investor sentiment towards the pound. This dynamic interplay between central bank policy and currency performance is a recurring theme in Forex Market Analysis . Decoding BoE Interest Rates : A Catalyst for Change The Bank of England’s recent actions on BoE Interest Rates have been a game-changer for the pound. A decision to hike rates, or even strong signals of future hikes, makes holding pounds more rewarding. For investors, higher interest rates mean better returns on bonds, savings, and other financial instruments denominated in that currency. This increased demand for the currency naturally pushes its value higher. Consider the following impact points of the BoE’s policy: Yield Differential: As the BoE raises rates, the interest rate differential between the UK and other major economies (like the US, where the Fed might be pausing) widens, making UK assets more appealing. Inflation Combat: The BoE’s aggressive stance signals a strong commitment to bringing down persistent inflation, which can stabilize the economy in the long run and boost investor confidence. Market Expectations: Forward guidance and market expectations about future BoE Interest Rates play a significant role. If markets anticipate further hikes, they will price that into the currency’s value in advance. This decisive action by the BoE highlights the critical role central banks play in shaping Global Currency Trends and influencing the attractiveness of their respective currencies. Navigating the Broader Forex Market Analysis Beyond the headline movements of the dollar and sterling, a comprehensive Forex Market Analysis reveals a complex web of interconnected factors. Currency pairs are not isolated; they react to global economic indicators, geopolitical events, and shifts in investor sentiment. Here’s what else to consider: Economic Indicators: Employment figures, GDP growth, retail sales, and manufacturing data from major economies all provide clues about economic health and potential central bank actions. Geopolitical Developments: Events like conflicts, trade disputes, or political instability can trigger immediate shifts in currency valuations as investors seek safety or react to uncertainty. Commodity Prices: For commodity-exporting nations, fluctuations in prices of oil, metals, or agricultural products can directly impact their currency’s value. Cross-Currency Implications: The dollar’s weakness, for example, might not just benefit the pound but also other major currencies like the Euro or the Japanese Yen, leading to broader shifts in Global Currency Trends . For those involved in crypto, understanding these macro-level dynamics is crucial. A stronger dollar can sometimes put pressure on crypto prices, as it makes dollar-denominated assets more expensive for international buyers, while a weaker dollar might provide some tailwinds. What’s Next for Global Currency Trends ? The current landscape of Global Currency Trends suggests a period of heightened volatility and divergence among major currencies. While the US Dollar Weakness is a dominant theme, its trajectory will depend heavily on upcoming US economic data and the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions. Similarly, the continued Sterling Strength will be tested by UK inflation figures and the BoE’s future policy path. Investors should pay close attention to: Central Bank Commentary: Speeches and minutes from the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, and Bank of England will provide vital clues about their future intentions. Inflation Data: The persistence or easing of inflation globally will dictate the pace and direction of interest rate policies. Geopolitical Stability: Any major geopolitical developments can swiftly alter market sentiment and currency flows. The currency market is a dynamic arena where expectations, data, and policy converge. Staying informed about these powerful forces is key to navigating its complexities. Challenges and Opportunities in the Current Forex Climate The ongoing shifts in currency valuations present both challenges and opportunities for various market participants. For businesses engaged in international trade, a stronger pound or weaker dollar can impact import/export costs and profitability. Investors, on the other hand, might find opportunities in currency pair trading or in assets denominated in currencies expected to appreciate. Challenges: Increased Volatility: Rapid currency movements can lead to unpredictable swings, making risk management crucial. Uncertainty in Policy: Central bank policies can change quickly based on incoming data, creating an environment of unpredictability. Impact on Commodities: A weaker dollar can sometimes lead to higher commodity prices (as they become cheaper for non-dollar holders), which in turn can feed into inflation. Opportunities: Hedging Strategies: Businesses can use hedging instruments to mitigate currency risk. Diversification: Investors can diversify their portfolios across different currencies and asset classes to capitalize on varying economic performances. Trading Opportunities: Skilled traders can leverage the volatility to profit from short-term price movements in the forex market. Understanding these dynamics is not just for forex traders; it’s essential for anyone with exposure to global markets, including those holding international assets or even certain cryptocurrencies that react to broader economic sentiment. Actionable Insights for the Informed Investor Given the current state of Global Currency Trends and the specific movements in the dollar and sterling, what steps can informed individuals take? Stay Updated on Central Bank News: Follow announcements and speeches from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England closely. Their guidance on BoE Interest Rates and the US equivalent will be pivotal. Monitor Economic Data: Keep an eye on key economic indicators from the US and UK, as these will directly influence currency movements and the overall Forex Market Analysis . Consider Portfolio Diversification: If you have significant exposure to one currency, evaluate diversifying into others that might benefit from current trends. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Volatile markets require a clear understanding of your risk appetite. Do not overextend your positions based on short-term movements. Educate Yourself on Interconnections: Recognize how fiat currency movements can ripple through other asset classes, including commodities and even cryptocurrencies. For instance, a stronger dollar can make Bitcoin less attractive to international investors, while US Dollar Weakness might offer some support. These insights empower you to make more informed decisions in a constantly evolving financial landscape. Conclusion: A Shifting Tide in Global Currencies The current week has underscored a significant shift in the global currency arena: the discernible US Dollar Weakness contrasting sharply with a newfound Sterling Strength . This divergence is a direct consequence of differing central bank postures, particularly the hawkish stance of the Bank of England regarding BoE Interest Rates . As our Forex Market Analysis has shown, these movements are not isolated events but are part of broader Global Currency Trends driven by inflation, economic data, and investor sentiment. Understanding these powerful forces is not just for currency traders; it’s vital for anyone seeking to comprehend the underlying mechanics of global finance and their potential ripple effects across all asset classes. The dynamic nature of these markets ensures that vigilance and continuous learning remain paramount.

With data showing a dip in inflation and the Fed hinting at future rate reduction in September, crypto investors are reconsidering where to deposit their money. While major coins like Solana, XRP, and Litecoin remain stable, a new payment-focused crypto is quietly gaining steam. Its forward-thinking features and growing community are attracting attention in the current market. Solana: Speed vs. Stability in a Volatile Market After a brief dip, Solana price has rallied back above $170 thanks to a renewed push in NFTs and DeFi activity. Institutional interest is rekindling, particularly around Solana-powered stablecoin issuance that avoids Ethereum congestion. Crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, has revealed via X (formerly Twitter), that the most crucial support level for Solana is at $165. Meanwhile, the key resistance levels to watch are $177 and $189. XRP: Legal Wins Fuel Speculative Momentum XRP price has climbed to $3.05 after a recent court ruling favored Ripple, brightening its regulatory outlook. Trading volumes have spiked as optimism around banking use cases grows. Crypto analysts have said that XRP needs to break above $3.12 with volume to target $3.34–$3.58. With this, a close above $3.15 would confirm the bullish momentum . However, if $3.00 fails, key support lies between $2.88–$2.93, backed by technical confluence. Lionhearted Litecoin Inches Forward Litecoin has quietly regained steam, now trading just over $120. Its fast block times and familiarity among miners keep sentiment steady. Experts have also weighed in on Litecoin, saying that after years of consolidating within a long- term falling wedge pattern, LTC is finally approaching a decisive breakout point . Recent trends suggest accumulation and a strength near the resistance leading to prediction that Litecoin could rally toward the $270-$300 range.

The initiative is currently undergoing governance review, buoyed by escalating community involvement and the ongoing treasury funding vote. Cardano Goes On The Offensive The strategy focuses on leveraging direct, tailored engagement at industry-specific events to drive measurable outcomes. According to the Foundation, enterprise adoption is a top priority, with a target of 15–25% year-over-year growth in enterprise leads and partnerships. “Direct, tailored engagement at industry-specific events is highly effective for building strategic alliances and advancing adoption discussions,” the Foundation stated, underlining the central role events play in fostering high-value relationships. Developer growth is another pillar of the initiative. Cardano is aiming for 10–15% annual growth in new developers engaging with its tools and a 5–10% increase in active contributors. The Foundation argues that in-person events create “unique opportunities for hands-on learning and direct interaction with the Cardano teams for developers and contributors of all experience levels,” offering a more immersive onboarding path than remote engagement alone. In terms of ecosystem expansion, the proposal sets a goal of 10–20% year-over-year growth in new projects and dApps launching on Cardano. The Foundation notes that events “foster networking, inspire discussion and provide the perfect environment for formal and informal knowledge exchanges which can lead to truly fruitful collaborations and new project developments.” Brand visibility is the fourth major KPI, with a target of 15% growth in positive brand mentions across traditional and social media, along with increased direct search activity for Cardano. The Foundation stresses that a unified brand presence across diverse global events is critical for maintaining mindshare in the broader blockchain and enterprise technology sectors. The proposal builds on lessons learned from the Cardano Summit and regional tech events, with the Foundation committing to ongoing metric tracking to adjust tactics in real time. “We will monitor metrics to make informed decisions, adjust tactics, and improve, just like we do for the Cardano Summit and the regional tech events,” the post reads. This proposal has already achieved nearly 80 percent support in its initial governance round and has advanced into its final Treasury Withdrawal vote to secure funding. If approved, the initiative will be deployed across venues including TOKEN2049 Singapore, Consensus 2026, TOKEN2049 Dubai, WebX Asia, and Blockchain Rio—transforming Cardano’s participation into a coordinated, ecosystem‑wide showcase.

The leading altcoins performed even better: Ethereum (ETH) surged by 5% daily and is inching towards $4,000, Ripple’s XRP pumped by 12% to $3.36, while Stellar (XLM) reached a two-week high of $0.46. The sudden uptick in the market was caused by bullish factors, including Donald Trump’s executive order that aims to allow 401(k) investors access to alternative assets, such as cryptocurrencies, and the official resolution of the Ripple v. SEC case. Somewhat expected, the resurgence has resulted in liquidations for over-leveraged traders.

Boost Legends guide,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/08/can-solana-volume-bot-really-move-markets-boost-legends-guide/,"Launching a brand-new SPL token on Solana is easy. Getting it noticed in a sea of fresh pairs is the real challenge. Early volume, wallet diversity, and steady trade flow are the signals that DexScreener, Raydium and every professional trader look for before they pay attention. Solana Volume Bot —a liquidity tool built by Boost Legends—is designed to create those signals on demand. Why early volume still matters Algorithms that rank “New” and “Trending” pairs rely on three numbers: 24-hour trading volume – Bigger pools surface higher in dashboards. Unique buyer addresses – A crowd of small wallets feels safer than one whale. Consistent trade frequency – A smooth series of candles signals genuine interest. Without these data points, even the best token can sit invisible on page five. That quiet period, known as the cold-start problem , is where most projects lose momentum. How Solana Volume Bot works Feature What it does Adjustable volume (100K – 10M+) Lets teams size campaigns to their budget and goals. Fresh wallet for every trade Mimics organic buyer diversity, passing anti-bot heuristics. Custom timeframe Drips trades over minutes or days for natural chart flow. Dashboard & Telegram bot Live Tx IDs, spend tracking, and a cancel button if you change your mind. Curious to test it? Boost Legends offers a free 25-trade trial on their website. Security first: the bot never asks for deployer keys; it executes trades from its own hot wallets. Boost Legends has run the service for two years with zero blacklist incidents. Case study – from invisible to trending in 90 minutes Token: MEME-X (fictitious example for confidentiality) Liquidity added: 8 SOL / 8 SOL Bot campaign: 250 K simulated volume across 55 buys and sells Results: DexScreener “Trending – New Pairs” rank #4 in 1 h 28 m 59 unique wallets recorded (each trade from a fresh address) Follow-on organic volume: +410 K SOL in the next six hours The original pool size never changed; the bot simply injected believable activity that drew real traders to the chart. Best practices for a smooth boost Balance buys and sells – A 60/40 buy bias creates upward pressure without giant wicks. Pair volume with news – Schedule an AMA, influencer tweet, or Discord announcement to meet the wave of new eyes. Be transparent – Pin a message in your community: “Early liquidity provided by Boost Legends’ Solana Volume Bot.” Trust builds faster than stealth. Five-step launch checklist Seed the pool with enough liquidity (at least 5 SOL total). Open @boostlegends_bot in Telegram and run /volume_booster. Paste your contract address and claim the free trial. Verify the on-chain Tx IDs; watch DexScreener for wallet diversity and candle flow. Select a paid tier—100 K, 250 K, 500 K, 1 M volume or more—and set your timeframe. That’s it. Your chart gains the social proof it needs while you focus on marketing and product. Common questions Will the bot dump my price? No. Trades are balanced to keep the price line stable unless you request a buy-heavy campaign. Can my token be banned? Raydium is permissionless, and DexScreener indexes every pool. Boost Legends has recorded no bans or delistings. What does it cost after the trial? Packages start at 2.4 SOL for 100 K volume and scale down in price per unit as you move up. Final thoughts Momentum is everything on Solana. Tokens that generate activity in their first few hours attract market-makers, influencers, and—most importantly—real investors. Solana Volume Bot turns that momentum into a service: transparent, configurable, and already battle-tested across hundreds of launches. If you’re ready to melt the cold start and put your SPL pair in front of real traders, claim the free trial at Solana Volume Bot and watch the numbers rise.

IVD Medical Holdings has purchased $19 million (HK$149 million) of ether (ETH), positioning the asset at the center of its real-world asset tokenization strategy. The company is building ivd.xyz, a platform for tokenizing pharmaceutical intellectual property and other healthcare assets, which will run entirely on Ethereum smart contracts. In a statement to CoinDesk, Chief Strategy Officer Gary Deng said Ethereum was chosen as the core asset because it is “the world’s most mature smart contract platform” with “extremely high liquidity” and growing institutional recognition, pointing to the U.S. SEC’s approval of a spot ETH ETF. IVD plans to use ETH for on-chain ownership confirmation, automated revenue distribution, and compliance governance of tokenized assets. It will also serve as the settlement layer for the company’s planned IVDD stablecoin, enabling cross-border transactions within Hong Kong and U.S. compliance frameworks. Revenue from RWA transactions will be automatically converted into ETH and deposited into the treasury. IVD also intends to deploy ETH into staking, re-staking, and on-chain derivatives to boost returns and liquidity while adding downside protection. The move puts IVD alongside a small group of HKEX-listed companies with crypto treasuries, most of which favor bitcoin (BTC). Boyaa Interactive (0434.HK) holds more than 3,100 BTC worth over US$300 million after converting nearly all of its ether to bitcoin. Meitu (1357.HK) bought about 31,000 ETH and 940 BTC in 2021 before exiting those positions. Other smaller bitcoin holders include Yuxing InfoTech (8005.HK) with 78 BTC , Moon Inc. (1723.HK) with 18.88 BTC, and Walnut Capital (0905.HK) with 10 BTC from a shareholder donation. IVD's move was made as part of a broader partnership announcement with HashKey Group , which operates the Hong Kong-licensed HashKey exchange.

BBVA, Spain's third-largest bank, recently began providing services to Binance as one of its few independent custodians. This move aims to alleviate investor concerns about the exchange's security, particularly following the FTX bankruptcy in 2022. With this partnership, Binance has allowed customers to keep their assets in the bank instead of on an exchange. Binance previously required its customers to store their assets only with Binance or its subsidiary Ceffu. However, Binance's stance changed early last year when it began allowing certain large clients to use alternatives like Switzerland-based Sygnum Bank and FlowBank. Under the partnership, investors' funds will be held at BBVA in the form of US Treasury bonds, which Binance will accept as trading collateral. BBVA continues to expand into the cryptocurrency market to meet growing demand from its retail customers. Last month, the major bank announced the launch of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) trading and custody services for Spanish clients directly through the bank's mobile app. Related News: New Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) Move Comes from the Banking Giant Also Serving in Türkiye!

Chinese authorities have reportedly directed brokers to cease stablecoin promotion to domestic users. This latest directive signals a significant reinforcement of the nation’s stringent stance on digital assets, particularly as the existing China stablecoin ban tightens its grip on the financial landscape. This decisive action further solidifies the comprehensive Chinese crypto ban that has been in place since 2021. What’s Behind China’s Latest Stablecoin Ban? According to a recent report from Bloomberg, the Chinese government is actively working to curb the growing enthusiasm for digital assets within its borders. This new order targets brokers, specifically instructing them to halt any activities that promote stablecoins to local users. This move is not entirely new; it builds upon the comprehensive Chinese crypto ban implemented in 2021, which effectively outlawed crypto trading and mining. The core objective appears to be maintaining tight control over capital flows and ensuring financial stability. Stablecoins, designed to maintain a stable value against a fiat currency like the US dollar, often serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the volatile crypto world. For Chinese citizens, they can potentially offer a pathway to bypass strict capital controls, which authorities are keen to prevent. How Do Digital Asset Regulations Impact Users? The latest directive on stablecoin promotion has direct implications for individuals seeking exposure to digital currencies. Previously, while direct crypto trading was banned, some users might have found indirect ways to acquire stablecoins, perhaps through international platforms or peer-to-peer networks. This new order aims to close such avenues, making it considerably harder for domestic users to engage with any form of digital asset. These evolving digital asset regulations highlight China’s consistent strategy. The government views decentralized cryptocurrencies as a threat to its financial sovereignty and a potential channel for illicit activities or capital flight. Therefore, every measure taken aims to solidify the state’s control over its financial ecosystem, pushing citizens towards regulated alternatives, such as the digital yuan. The ongoing enforcement of the China stablecoin ban is a clear example of this commitment. Challenges for the Crypto Market in China The ongoing crackdown presents significant challenges for the crypto market China . With brokers now explicitly forbidden from stablecoin promotion, the accessibility of digital assets for Chinese citizens becomes even more restricted. This creates a clear barrier for individuals who might otherwise explore decentralized finance (DeFi) or other crypto-related opportunities. Key challenges include: Reduced Accessibility: Direct and indirect pathways to acquire stablecoins are shrinking. Increased Risk: Users attempting to bypass the ban face higher risks of legal repercussions or scams. Isolation from Global Trends: The strict controls isolate the Chinese financial system from global crypto innovations and trends. This systematic approach underscores China’s long-term vision: a tightly controlled financial environment where the state retains ultimate authority over all monetary flows and digital transactions. What Does This Mean for Global Digital Asset Regulations? While the focus is on China, this development also sends a ripple through the global landscape of digital asset regulations . China’s actions often serve as a precedent or at least a point of reference for other nations grappling with how to regulate the burgeoning crypto space. The firm stance against stablecoin promotion reflects a broader global debate on how to manage the risks associated with these digital currencies. The ongoing China stablecoin ban demonstrates a clear intent to prioritize national financial security and control over the potential benefits of an open, decentralized digital economy. This contrasts sharply with some Western nations that are exploring regulated frameworks for stablecoins, aiming to integrate them into their financial systems. The Future of the Crypto Market in China It is clear that the crypto market China will continue to operate under severe restrictions. The government’s consistent efforts to eliminate all forms of crypto engagement, from mining to trading and now stablecoin promotion, indicate a long-term commitment to its current policy. For those interested in digital assets, understanding these prohibitions is crucial. The narrative in China remains consistent: unauthorized digital assets are a risk. This stance contrasts with the nation’s push for its own central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan, which is designed to operate under strict government control. This dichotomy highlights China’s desire to innovate within a controlled framework, rather than embracing the decentralized ethos of many cryptocurrencies. In conclusion, China’s directive to brokers to halt stablecoin promotion is a powerful reaffirmation of its long-standing Chinese crypto ban . This move underscores the nation’s unwavering commitment to financial control and its determination to prevent any digital asset from undermining its economic stability. As the digital landscape evolves, China’s approach remains a key factor in shaping global regulatory discussions, reinforcing the impact of the China stablecoin ban . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the new directive from Chinese authorities regarding stablecoins? A1: Chinese authorities have ordered brokers to stop promoting stablecoins to domestic users, reinforcing the nation’s ban on crypto activities. Q2: Why is China cracking down on stablecoin promotion? A2: China aims to maintain financial stability, control capital flows, and prevent digital assets from bypassing its stringent financial regulations, which is part of its broader Chinese crypto ban strategy. Q3: How does this impact crypto users in China? A3: This directive makes it significantly harder for domestic users to access or engage with stablecoins and other digital assets, limiting their participation in the global crypto market China . Q4: What is China’s overall stance on cryptocurrencies? A4: China maintains a strict ban on crypto trading and mining, viewing decentralized cryptocurrencies as a threat to its financial sovereignty. It prefers its own state-controlled digital currency, the digital yuan. Q5: Does this ban affect the digital yuan? A5: No, this ban specifically targets decentralized cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. The digital yuan (CBDC) is a separate, state-controlled digital currency that China is actively promoting.

The partnership submitted a formal interest to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on August 1, the same day the Stablecoins Ordinance took effect , positioning itself among the first movers in Asia’s emerging regulated stablecoin market. Strategic Partnership Targets Mainstream Financial Integration The joint venture comes as the global stablecoin market capitalization reached a new all-time high of $261 billion in July, marking twenty-two consecutive months of growth. Hong Kong’s regulatory framework places the city among the first global financial hubs with dedicated stablecoin licensing, creating opportunities for non-USD alternatives to challenge the dollar’s dominance in regional settlement markets. Evan Auyang, group president of Animoca Brands, said the partnership aims to bring stablecoins into Hong Kong’s mainstream financial ecosystem. “Stablecoins represent one of the most compelling use cases within Web3, and we believe we are still at the early frontier of widespread adoption across institutions and retail alike,” he said. The three partners have participated in the HKMA stablecoin issuer sandbox since July 2024, exploring how stablecoins can bridge Web3 and traditional finance.

Compliance with anti-money laundering standards, risk management protocols, disclosure rules, and auditing requirements is mandatory. HKMA published supervision guidelines and anti-money laundering procedures on July 29, with application deadlines set for August 31 for early-stage feedback and September 30 for full submissions. The authority warned that misleading licensing claims could result in criminal penalties. Secretary for Financial Services Christopher Hui confirmed the Securities and Futures Commission has licensed 11 virtual asset platforms , with nine under review.

CFO Ivan Wong described investor enthusiasm as “palpable,” with sovereign wealth and hedge funds participating. SenseTime Group secured HK$2.5 billion to explore blockchain and stablecoin applications, while JF SmartInvest Holdings raised HK$785 million for tokenized Real World Assets investments.

However, HKMA urged caution against “frothiness” and “excessive exuberance” as market excitement intensified. Private funding activity accelerated alongside public markets. Digital payments startup Kun raised over $50 million in July. The funding surge coincides with global stablecoin sector momentum. Tether maintained leadership with $164 billion market capitalization despite a slight dominance decline from 62.5% to 61.8%. USD Coin grew 3.78% to $63.6 billion, while Ethena USDe posted a remarkable 43.5% growth, reaching $7.60 billion.

The pattern, identified by the analytical account My Crypto Paradise, indicates that ADA now faces key support and resistance zones that could determine whether the move gains momentum or fades.The falling wedge formation had constrained ADA’s price action for several weeks. The breakout, if sustained, could signal renewed interest from buyers. However, the analyst cautions that such moves can sometimes trap late entries if not supported by strong follow-through.Cardano Support Zone Under WatchThe analyst noted that the $0.7300–$0.7450 area is now acting as the first major support level. This zone must hold to confirm the bullish structure. A failure to stay above this range could push the price back into a broader demand area between $0.6700 and $0.7100. Cardano technical analysis Cardano technical analysis If ADA falls below $0.6600, this would invalidate the wedge breakout. Such a move could shift the outlook to bearish and increase selling pressure.Notably, Cardano is trading at $0.8021, a 7.9% surge in the past day. The token has now seen an 11% surge in the past week, increasing its uptick to 34.6%. Cardano’s Key Resistance Levels AheadOn the upside, My Crypto Paradise identified $0.8600 as the first minor resistance point. Beyond that, the real test lies between $0.9300 and $0.9500, a historically strong resistance zone.This level could attract profit-taking from traders who entered lower and also serve as a re-entry point for short-sellers. The outcome of ADA’s attempt to break through this zone may determine the mid-term trajectory of the token.The analyst noted that technical indicators are beginning to support the bullish thesis. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has turned upward, signaling improving momentum and buyer participation. Still, the analyst urges traders to manage risk carefully, especially given the potential for price rejection at higher levels.Analyst Targets $2.0 to $2.5 for CardanoMeanwhile, another chart shared by analyst CryptoGnojek also confirmed Cardano had broken out of a falling wedge pattern, signaling a bullish reversal.

This task utilizes advanced computers to solve complex mathematical problems. For each solved problem, a new “block” is created and added to the blockchain, and miners then receive payment in Bitcoin. However, Bitcoin mining is not cheap or simple, but it can be mastered. Let’s discuss what’s involved in mastering Bitcoin mining, starting with understanding the breakeven price in Bitcoin mining. Understanding Breakeven Price in Bitcoin Mining Before discussing profits, every Bitcoin miner needs to understand a very straightforward yet crucial point, which is the breakeven price. That is when revenue from mining equals total expenses, like electricity, buying mining rigs, and maintenance. Anything higher than that line is profit. Anything lower than this means you are operating at a loss. If your monthly electricity, equipment, and miscellaneous fees total $500, then your mining rig must earn at least $500 worth of Bitcoin within the same length of time to be even. Beyond that level is mining for profit, but lower means loss. This concept seems straightforward, but it’s basic because market forces can change mining profitability quickly; hence, understanding the breakeven point is important in keeping on top. Further, when mining Bitcoin, where prices, difficulty, and energy cost change rapidly, knowing your breakeven point keeps you in control. This is why knowing your breakeven price is crucial for long-term profitability, since it allows you to plan your operations with a precise definition of what success will be. The Economics of Bitcoin Mining Bitcoin mining seems technical, but it is also all about earning money or losing it. To have a realistic understanding of the economics of Bitcoin mining. Let us break down the significant variables that influence your profitability in mining. To obtain a maximum profit level, each cost, no matter how small, must be included in your computation. Electricity bills: This is the most significant recurring expense. Kilowatt-hour (kWh) spot pricing could be one’s make-or-break. A spot that sets you back $0.05/kWh is going to be more likely to be a long-term profit-maker than one that sets you back $0.12/kWh. The more effective your rig is with electricity to hashing power conversion, the better off you are probably going to be. Hashrate: Hashrate denotes how quickly your rig is solving complex cryptographic equations. More hashrate means more chances of being rewarded with a block reward. This also typically means higher power consumption and increased running expenses. The reward for blocks and transaction fees: Presently, miners receive 3.125 BTC per block, with fees that consist of transactions. Owing to the once-four-or-so-yearly occurrence of the Bitcoin halving event, the reward is reduced by half, impacting future payments considerably. The timing when you join mining is therefore critical. Internet fees : A fast and reliable internet connection is compulsory for real-time mining, and the better the internet, the more expensive it is. Cooling systems : Because mining rigs produce heat, cooling systems may be needed, and such should be calculated together with the other bills. Hosting fee : You will need to pay this if you’re using a third-party mining farm. Hardware depreciation: The mining hardware loses value over time as newer models are developed. Using a Mining Calculator to Estimate Your Breakeven Price There are no estimates required. A Bitcoin mining calculator does math for you. It makes it possible for it to perform the entire breakeven calculation process. A mining calculator is simply a tool for entering specific details, such as your cost of electricity (per kilowatt-hour), your hashrate (processing power), your power consumption (in watts), and any other applicable fees. It then compares these values against the current price of Bitcoin and the mining difficulty to tell you if you will be breaking even or losing money. Here is a step-by-step instruction for using a mining calculator: Step 1. Choose a Mining calculator: Use ViaBTC’s mining profit calculator, which is easy to use and updated frequently. Step 2. Input Hashrate: Input your rig’s hashrate (TH/s) on the profit calculator. Step 3. Input Fee Rate: Input the PPS fee rate. The PPS (Pay Per Share) fee is a percentage of the mining reward that the pool operator deducts as a fee for providing the mining infrastructure and services. This fee is a standard practice among mining pools and helps cover the costs associated with maintaining the pool and distributing rewards. Real-World Examples: Calculating Breakeven Price with Popular Mining Rigs To illustrate how breakeven prices vary, let’s examine three widely used mining rigs: We will be comparing the breakeven points of Antminer S21, WhatsMiner M60S, and AvalonA15. Economics Antminer S21 WhatsMiner M60S AvalonA15 Power 3500W 3404W 3662W Hashrate 200T 184T 221T Coin price $118,163 $118,163 $118,163 Difficulty 120 120 120 Electricity (0.07KWH) $5.88 $5.71 $6.15 Net profit $6.4 $5.59 $7.42 Breakeven $56,543.89 $59,678.09 $53,515.48 All three machines serve the same purpose; they solve complex Bitcoin algorithms and earn rewards, but they differ in how they use power and how they yield rewards. Further, these calculations were done using low energy prices. A miner operating in a region with lower energy prices ($0.03-$0.04/kWh) will reach breakeven price much more quickly, while a person who lives where high energy prices are used may find it more difficult. Finally, real-world conditions also play a role; humidity and temperature can influence rig efficiency. Unstable connections or power outages reduce uptime. Maintenance quality influences hardware longevity. Hence, it is important to test and observe the setup to make sure your calculations match reality, which is why ViaBTC’s calculator is important. Leveraging ViaBTC’s Mining Profit Rankings for Smarter Decisions Not sure where to start with rig selection? ViaBTC’ s Mining Profit Rankings is a great resource to find high-performance gear. The rankings take into account key considerations such as hashrate, power consumption, and electricity cost, then show estimated daily profit and power efficiency. By looking at these numbers, you can see at a glance which machines are delivering the best return on investment right now. Also, the website provides top mining hardware, live ROI statistics, and BTC prices in real-time estimates. This can help you steer clear of old or inefficient models as well as identify trending equipment with the highest ROI. This saves you the time of having to research several specifications manually. Pro Tip: Combine these rankings with ViaBTC pool statistics. This tells you which rigs are presently performing best under real-world mining conditions, not just on paper. Factors That Can Shift Your Breakeven Point Even if you achieve your breakeven price today, the situation can change tomorrow. The following are essential variables to monitor: Bitcoin Price Volatility BTC prices can fluctuate wildly. If the price falls from $60,000 to $40,000, your breakeven time gets longer, and your profit can dip below costs. Electricity Costs This is usually the highest overhead for miners. As the local electricity price increases, your daily operating cost also rises, bringing up your breakeven point. Even small changes in price per kilowatt-hour can make a significant difference to the cost in the long run. Hardware Efficiency The type of mining rig you are using makes a tremendous amount of difference. Newer, more efficient hardware produces more hashes using less electricity, which gets you to breakeven faster. Pool Fees and Payout Structures When mining in a pool, the fees, along with the payout structure (i.e., Pay-Per-Share or Full Pay-Per-Share ), can influence your net earnings and slightly alter your breakeven point. Network Difficulty As additional miners join the network, difficulty adapts to maintain steady block times. Greater difficulty means greater competition and possibly reduced revenue per rig. Regulations Governments can tax, restrict operations, or even ban mining. Legal changes can directly impact profitability or force miners to relocate. Halving Events and Exchange Fees This cuts your reward by half. Exchange fees can cut into your realized profit when you sell BTC. Fiat Conversion Rates Fiat conversion affects local miners’ cashing out in local currency. Conclusion Understanding your Bitcoin mining breakeven price is essential to mine profitably and not suffer unwarranted losses. Whether you’re a new miner or a seasoned player, your ability to breakeven or even make a profit depends on significant factors like electricity cost, hashrate, and block rewards. However, with a tool like a mining calculator and ViaBTC’s profitability rankings, you can estimate your breakeven price based on your configuration and your local energy prices. Keep in mind that the crypto market is dynamic, and so mining within the market demands correct information and timely knowledge. Moreover, your understanding of your breakeven price offers the information to make informed decisions, putting you in line to master Bitcoin mining. Disclaimer While this guide is intended to assist you in calculating your breakeven price with accuracy, real-world mining profitability could be different as a result of market fluctuation and electricity expenses, as well as unexpected technical or legal problems. Always research and use quality sources such as ViaBTC to be updated because mining is a competitive and dynamic industry. Profitability is not a matter of hardware but of strategy, flexibility, and possessing a keen grasp of the economics of your operation. The more data-intensive your decision-making, the better the prospects for success, as opposed to just breaking even.",Press Release,EN,0,0,MINING|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-08 09:59:03

Speaking on currency instability, soaring debt levels, and shifting institutional strategies, Fink is doubling down on BTC’s role as a hedge — and mainstream finance is starting to listen. Under Fink’s leadership, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has amassed over 575,000 BTC , cementing its place among the largest holders in the space. His conviction? Even a modest 2–5% allocation from sovereign funds or pensions could send Bitcoin into unprecedented territory. But as institutional money flows toward Bitcoin,MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting attention . Ethereum’s case for institutional adoption is no longer theoretical. With the SEC’s approval of multiple spot ETH ETFs and consistent upgrades to its network (including the upcoming Purge phase), Ethereum is now positioned as a programmable layer for the future of global finance . Its ability to host decentralized finance (DeFi), real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation, and AI-integrated dApps gives Ethereum long-term relevance. Analysts at JPMorgan and Bernstein have noted that ETH’s yield-generating staking model offers institutional investors a unique hybrid: capital appreciation and passive income. If BlackRock’s Bitcoin strategy proves successful, ETH is the next logical allocation — especially for funds seeking exposure to the infrastructure layer of crypto, not just its reserve asset. XRP: Compliance, Speed, and Banking Integration Despite past regulatory battles, XRP continues to thrive in cross-border settlements and real-world use cases. Its ongoing integrations with financial institutions — especially in regions like Asia and the Middle East — position it as a fast, low-cost solution for global payments. The recent partial legal clarity in the U.S. has renewed interest in XRP among institutional compliance teams. Analysts believe that should Ripple secure more large-scale partnerships or banking integrations, XRP could reemerge as a top choice for fintech portfolios —especially those seeking utility-first crypto assets. Whale tracking tools have already identified renewed accumulation zones, and with altseason narratives heating up, XRP remains one of the most undervalued assets by market cap relative to its infrastructure role. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Early-Stage Bet with Institutional Signals Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its early phase — but it’s attracting outsized attention from researchers and alpha groups for its structure, community trust, and audit-backed foundation. Top crypto professionals rank MAGACOIN FINANCE among the top 3 altcoins to buy before the next bull cycle, with analysts calling it one of the year’s most “ideology-aligned and infrastructure-ready meme tokens. Institutional-style dashboards and investor tools, plus growing inflows from ETH and XRP wallets, show this isn’t just hype. It’s a strategically placed asset — and according to top crypto strategists, a potential 20x–35x performer heading into Q4. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Just the Beginning If Larry Fink is correct, and Bitcoin becomes a mainstream reserve asset, institutions will inevitably explore the broader crypto landscape. Ethereum and XRP offer utility. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers asymmetric upside. Together, they represent a multi-layered future that goes far beyond a single coin.

Despite showing solid growth in its Total Value Locked (TVL), the price of ADA has recently declined by 14.3%. This mismatch highlights a lesson many investors learn the hard way: utility growth doesn’t always translate into immediate price gains, especially when projects are already well-established. For investors seeking explosive returns, entering projects at their early stages—before they hit the mainstream—offers a powerful advantage. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a perfect example of such an opportunity, where early participation means stepping in at the inflection point, ahead of wider adoption and valuation increases. Cardano (ADA)’s 14.3% Decline Cardano (ADA) fell 14.3% over the past week, trading at ~$0.71, despite a surge in Total Value Locked (TVL) to $340.3 million, up 6.5% in seven days, per DefiLlama data. The price drop, outpacing the crypto market’s 2.8% decline, stems from macroeconomic fears, including U.S.-China trade tensions and a weak U.S. jobs report, triggering sell-offs. On-chain data shows a 30.7% drop in trading volume to $713.54 million and a decline in active addresses to 20,000, signaling reduced user engagement. Technical indicators, with RSI at 43 and a bearish MACD, suggest further downside to $0.65 if $0.69 support fails. Despite TVL growth driven by lending protocols like Liqwid and DEX Minswap, Cardano’s treasury sales and competition from Solana hinder price recovery. A rebound above $0.78 could target $1.10. A New Era in Lending and Stablecoin Innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s upcoming stablecoin model is designed to tap into the growing demand for decentralized, overcollateralized loans. Unlike traditional stablecoins, MUTM’s stablecoin will only be minted when users borrow against collateral such as ETH or other approved assets. This process ensures the system’s stability and security, creating an ecosystem where lending and borrowing are seamlessly integrated with token utility. One of the unique features that sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is the issuance of mtTokens when lenders deposit assets into the platform’s Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools. These mtTokens can be staked in the smart contract to earn MUTM rewards, creating an additional income stream for users while promoting token demand. The platform’s planned beta release will mark a key milestone, allowing users to interact with these smart contracts directly, generating real utility and helping drive demand for MUTM tokens. To illustrate the power of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s P2C model, consider a lender depositing 200 BNB, valued around $64,000, at a 60% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. The borrower receives $38,400 in USDC stablecoins, while the lender earns an impressive 9.8% APY—about $6,272 annually—on their deposit. This example clearly demonstrates how large-cap assets can be put to work efficiently, creating income even during periods of market volatility. In addition to P2C lending, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending system offers flexible, negotiated loan terms for more speculative assets. For example, a borrower might use DOGE tokens as collateral to borrow $1,000 USDT with a 50% LTV ratio. The terms, including interest rates and duration, are agreed upon directly between lender and borrower, enabling customized arrangements that suit individual risk tolerances and investment strategies. This flexibility appeals to a broader audience, especially those holding volatile assets who want liquidity without selling. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is currently in Phase 6, offering tokens at $0.035 each. The project has raised $14.1 million so far and attracted over 14,950 holders. It also runs a $50,000 bug bounty program to ensure platform security and reliability, backed by a rigorous CertiK audit with an impressive score of 95. In addition, a $100,000 giveaway campaign is fueling community excitement and engagement, further solidifying its growing presence in the DeFi ecosystem. Proven Growth and Confident Future Projections To highlight the investment potential, consider the journey of an investor who converted $500 worth of MATIC into MUTM tokens during Phase 1, acquiring 50,000 MUTM tokens at $0.01 each. With the current Phase 6 price of $0.035, those tokens are now worth $1,750, showcasing significant growth. Looking ahead, once Mutuum Finance (MUTM) reaches its projected $0.06 listing price, that investment will rise to $3,000. Post-listing, the token price is expected to hit $0.12, doubling the investment again to a notable $6,000. These projections are grounded in the growing utility of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dual lending models and its roadmap milestones, including the imminent beta launch and anticipated exchange listings. The platform’s future plans to channel revenue into MUTM token buybacks will further stimulate demand, creating an upward price pressure that benefits users. With a 15% price increase planned for Phase 7, pushing the token price to $0.040, now is a critical moment to secure positions before the next wave of buying activity intensifies. Investors who understand the advantage of early entry stand to benefit the most, positioning themselves ahead of the broader market when Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gains full traction.

The rally pushed XRP’s valuation to $198 billion as trading volume spiked 189% to $11.8 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data. XRP market cap sees $20 billion increase. Source: CoinMarketCap The move followed a landmark legal development: on August 8, Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) jointly dismissed all remaining appeals, making Judge Analisa Torres’ 2023 ruling final. Under that decision, XRP sales on public exchanges are not securities, though institutional sales remain subject to compliance. The ruling removes years of regulatory uncertainty, giving XRP the rare distinction of being the first altcoin with U.S. court-backed legal clarity.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Insult Alert: Pro Trader Dubs HODLers ‘Idiots,’ Saylor Fires Back According to reports, a joint filing on August 7 confirmed the decision to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, ending a nearly five-year dispute that has shaped debate over how cryptocurrencies are regulated. Back To Business Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty said on social media the matter was “over” and the company could get “back to business.” Following the Commission’s vote today, the SEC and Ripple formally filed directly with the Second Circuit to dismiss their appeals. The end…and now back to business. https://t.co/nVqthNcFOt — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) August 7, 2025 Appeals Withdrawn, Penalties Finalized Based on reports, the SEC has withdrawn its challenge to a 2023 ruling that XRP sales on public exchanges were not securities. Ripple, in turn, dropped its own appeal on the finding that institutional sales of XRP violated securities laws. Both parties will shoulder their own legal expenses. The case’s resolution finalizes $125 million in penalties first outlined by Judge Analisa Torres. Of that, $50 million will go to the US Treasury, while $75 million—held in escrow since June—will be returned to Ripple. The ruling also leaves in place a permanent injunction stopping Ripple from making institutional XRP sales without following securities laws. It can be recalled that the litigation started in December 2020 when the regulatory body charged Ripple with raising $1.3 billion from unregistered securities offerings. Ripple protested innocence, claiming XRP is not a security. In July 2023, Judge Torres agreed with the SEC on “programmatic” sales to institutional buyers but decided such type of sales to retail purchasers were not deemed as “securities.” Political Shift Shapes Outcome The move to suspend appeals follows US President Donald Trump’s return to the White House and appointment of new bosses at the SEC. According to reports, under the new chair, Paul Atkins, the agency has backed away from more than a dozen enforcement actions and investigations involving crypto firms in recent months. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse earlier said both parties had already agreed in June to put closure to their appeals, though negotiations to reduce the penalties failed. Meanwhile, market observers say the outcome is a reflection of the SEC’s softened approach in other high-profile cases, including those involving Coinbase and Kraken. For the crypto industry, this resolution is being viewed as a sign of changing tides in Washington’s stance when it comes to regulation.

But smart investors – and technical analysis geeks – know this is simply a healthy correction. In recent days, Dogecoin reaffirmed its broader bullish momentum with a clean bounce from the 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci zone. Many traders consider this an A+ setup, as it signals the token has taken a much-needed breather after its massive run and is now gearing up to continue in its established direction. If this pattern plays out, $DOGE could reach $0.28746 – a 30% gain from current prices – in its current rally alone, potentially pushing even higher in the weeks ahead. Plus, on the 4-hour timeframe, the 10 and 20 EMAs have just crossed above the 50 EMA, which is now starting to trend upward. So, with both major timeframes aligning, $DOGE’s rally has even stronger momentum behind it.

Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Bitcoin formed a higher low – a classic bullish signal – on the daily chart on August 5, and has since gained around 2.20% in under three days . The best part? This mini rally is emerging right from the key 50% Fibonacci retracement level, drawn from the July 1 low of 105,145. In plain English: Bitcoin has pulled back just the right amount after hitting its highs, and this textbook correction might now be setting the stage for another leg up, one that could see the token charge toward its all-time highs. At least that’s what the technicals are hinting at. Even more convincing? The bounce came precisely from a zone that previously acted as strong resistance, which has now flipped into support – another picture-perfect scenario. With $BTC now holding firm above both its 10 and 20 EMAs, a fresh aggressive move may just be around the corner, especially if the price continues to stay above these key short-term EMAs. Retirement Goes Crypto: What Trump’s Latest Executive Order Signals for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Hyper August 8, 2025 • 10:00 UTC US President Trump has just signed an executive order allowing 401(k) plans to invest in alternative assets like cryptocurrencies for the first time.

The crypto market reacted positively: Bitcoin rose above $117,6K , and crypto stocks like Coinbase and Robinhood saw notable gains. For Bitcoin, this signals its growing legitimacy as a long-term store of value. As for Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , currently in presale, it’s a strategic boost for its utility proposition. Bitcoin Hyper offers a way to extend BTC’s utility into the modern crypto economy. Its presale has already raised over $7.6M, signaling strong investor belief in its potential to reshape how Bitcoin is used.

Key Takeaways: FTC data shows seniors’ imposter scam losses hit $700M in 2024, up 362% since 2020. Scammers pose as trusted officials or companies and trick victims into moving funds for “safety.” Losses over $100K surged more than 700%, with many cases wiping out entire life savings. The scams often begin with a fabricated crisis and a convincing impersonation. Fraudsters pose as trusted figures, including bank employees, tech support from companies like Apple or Microsoft, or representatives from agencies such as the Social Security Administration or even the FTC itself, claiming they can help fix the problem. Imposter Scams Convince Victims to Transfer Funds for Safety Victims are persuaded to transfer funds “to keep them safe” or for other fabricated reasons. In 2024, the FTC received 8,269 reports from Americans aged 60 and older who each lost at least $10,000 to such schemes. That figure is up 362% from the 1,790 reports logged in 2020. Total reported losses for this age group reached $700 million last year, more than five times the $122 million reported in 2020. In some cases, the losses wiped out entire life savings, including emptied bank accounts and cashed-out 401(k)s. Losses among seniors who reported losing $100,000 or more grew even faster, climbing to $445 million in 2024 from $55 million in 2020, a jump of more than 700%. The FTC notes that these figures likely understate the real damage, as older victims are often less likely to report fraud out of embarrassment, uncertainty over how to file a complaint, or even unawareness that they’ve been scammed. The trend mirrors a broader rise in elder fraud reported by the FBI. The bureau’s Internet Crime Complaint Center recorded $4.9 billion in losses from nearly 147,127 consumer complaints in 2024, a 43% increase in total losses and a 46% rise in complaints compared with the previous year.

The agency urges vigilance: never move money at the request of someone claiming to “protect” it, hang up and verify any suspicious call through official contact details, and explore call-blocking tools to stop scammers before they connect. Investor Loses $3M in Crypto Phishing Scam As reported, a cryptocurrency investor has fallen victim to a phishing scam , losing $3.05 million in Tether (USDT) after unknowingly signing a malicious blockchain transaction. The loss, flagged by blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain on Wednesday, underscores the rising threat of phishing attacks targeting digital asset holders. The attacker exploited a common habit among crypto users: validating only the first and last few characters of a wallet address while ignoring the middle. Crypto investors lost over $2.2 billion to hacks , scams, and breaches in the first half of 2025, driven largely by wallet compromises and phishing attacks, according to CertiK’s latest security report. Wallet breaches alone caused $1.7 billion in losses across just 34 incidents, while phishing scams accounted for over $410 million across 132 attacks.

In a recent tweet accompanied by a video explanation, he argued that this reasoning is flawed when the full scope of Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) infrastructure is taken into account. He began by acknowledging the common assertion: that if XRP’s price were to surge significantly, most holders would immediately sell, leading to an oversupply and a subsequent crash. In response, he asserted that this assumption overlooks the dynamic nature of Ripple’s ODL system , which is designed to recycle XRP continuously for institutional transactions. He emphasized that XRP is reused every few seconds in high-frequency liquidity operations, creating what he referred to as “functionally infinite liquidity.” They said #XRP can’t hit $100 or $1000 because “everyone would sell.” Wrong. Ripple’s ODL creates functionally INFINITE LIQUIDITY — XRP is reused every few seconds, like a financial bloodstream. Retail could cash out. Institutions keep flowing. #XRP #CryptoNews #Ripple pic.twitter.com/lpemrz7G7f — Happy Daddy (@StuporPendus) August 5, 2025 On-Demand Liquidity and XRP Recycling Happy Daddy explained that Ripple’s ODL system is built for instantaneous buy-sell processes. XRP is utilized for one transaction and then recycled into the next, often within seconds. According to him, this mechanism allows a single XRP token to process hundreds of transactions in one day, significantly multiplying its liquidity footprint beyond the actual circulating supply. He argued that even in a scenario where XRP adoption expands to 10 percent of SWIFT’s volume , and institutions begin transacting in derivatives and securities through XRP-based systems, this recycled use model would persist. The repeated use of XRP across thousands—or millions—of—institutional transactions per day would absorb retail sell-offs without destabilizing the price, he claimed. The enthusiast highlighted that this ongoing utility is what gives XRP its capacity for sustained liquidity, even under high-volume activity. Institutional Options and Custodial Integration Beyond ODL, Happy Daddy pointed out that institutions also have the option to custody XRP and establish their liquidity pools. He noted Ripple’s acquisition of custodial service providers such as Medeco and Standard Custody, indicating that these infrastructure investments are part of a broader strategy to prepare for institutional-scale liquidity management. These options enable large players to either pay exchange fees through ODL or operate self-custodied liquidity operations, further embedding XRP into institutional systems. He also mentioned Amendment XLS-30, which introduces automated market maker (AMM) functionality to the XRP Ledger . This, combined with Ripple’s liquidity hub and Prisma aggregator, supports a unified liquidity architecture that integrates traditional and decentralized systems. He said these components are intended to ensure 24/7 liquidity access for institutions and retail. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Unified Liquidity Framework and Future Outlook In discussing the future of Ripple’s ecosystem, Happy Daddy stated that Ripple is actively working toward a unified liquidity framework. According to him, the Prisma aggregator is being connected to on-chain AMMs under XLS-30, which will enable ODL to access decentralized exchange (DEX) liquidity. He cited statements from Ripple CTO David Schwartz, who confirmed that Ripple is investigating the use of DEX services in ODL operations. Schwartz noted that Prisma can aggregate liquidity across DEXs and exchanges, split large transactions, and optimize liquidity sourcing. The final part of Happy Daddy’s video emphasized that while XRP’s liquidity is not “infinite” in the fantastical sense, it is functionally infinite due to its high velocity. He clarified that while a simultaneous global sell-off worth trillions in fiat would strain the system, a steady exit by retail participants would be manageable under the ODL-driven liquidity cycle. According to him, the system is designed to absorb ongoing sales activity through recycled use, rather than holding vast reserves. Happy Daddy closed by encouraging viewers to re-evaluate their outlook on XRP, suggesting that the pieces of Ripple’s infrastructure strategy now show a cohesive plan.

In a new strategy session, Pizzino tells his 355,000 YouTube subscribers that the ratio of USDT stablecoin relative to other crypto assets (USDT dominance) has to fall below a major support level in order for Bitcoin to rally to new all-time highs. “…My theory is we need to get a breakdown of 3.7% to see any sort of real altcoin season and really seeing Bitcoin pump potentially past that $150,000 to $180,000 range. I think while it [USDT dominance] remains in this area between 3.7% and call it 4.8%, you’re probably not going to see those extreme numbers.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube USDT dominance is at 4.35% at time of writing. According to Pizzino, Bitcoin is likely to maintain its bullish prospects if it manages to stay above a price of $110,000. “I wouldn’t want to see this market consolidate under the $106,000. I think that’s going to look really, really weak long term…. So, worst-case scenario, $99,000 underneath $106,000 is going to be a slow-moving target for the next climb higher. And for the bulls, ideally above $110,000, $111000… So if August is going to continue being weak, then I’m looking at each of those price targets as a way to measure the strength of the next move. $111,000 to $110,000 – strong. Underneath that, average. Underneath that, weak. Underneath about $99,000… I don’t want to go there yet.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube Bitcoin is trading at $116,300 at time of writing. ?

This is precisely what Charles Edwards, the respected founder of crypto asset management firm Capriole Investments, suggests for Bitcoin. He believes the true Bitcoin fair value should be a staggering $167,800, indicating that the flagship cryptocurrency is profoundly undervalued right now. What’s the Real Bitcoin Fair Value? Charles Edwards recently shared his insights on X, pointing out that Bitcoin’s fundamental value far exceeds its present market price. According to his calculations, the Bitcoin fair value is not just a little higher, but significantly so. This claim stems from a rigorous analysis conducted by Capriole Investments, a firm known for its data-driven approach to the crypto market. The current market price of Bitcoin, as noted in the original assessment, stands around $116,000. This means, if Edwards’ analysis holds true, Bitcoin is trading at a substantial discount. This gap between the perceived value and the actual market price sparks considerable discussion among investors and analysts alike. Is BTC Truly Undervalued? Edwards’ methodology for determining Bitcoin’s fair value is rooted in core network fundamentals. He considers factors such as the energy input required to maintain the Bitcoin network and the token’s supply growth rate. These elements provide a robust framework for assessing what Bitcoin should truly be worth. His findings suggest that BTC undervalued status is not just a fleeting observation. In fact, Edwards highlights that the current discount to its fair value is even deeper than what Bitcoin experienced back in September 2020, when it was trading around $10,000. This historical comparison underscores the magnitude of the current undervaluation. Energy Input: Reflects the security and robustness of the network. Supply Growth Rate: Relates to Bitcoin’s scarcity and predictable issuance. Fundamental Discrepancy: The core network strength far outpaces the current price. Diving Deeper into Bitcoin Price Analysis The discrepancy between Bitcoin’s fundamentals and its market price offers crucial insights for any comprehensive Bitcoin price analysis . While market sentiment and macroeconomic factors often influence short-term price movements, Edwards’ perspective emphasizes the underlying strength of the network. It’s fascinating to consider why the market might be lagging behind these strong fundamentals. Perhaps it’s a matter of delayed recognition, or other external pressures are temporarily suppressing the price. However, for those who trust in the power of fundamental analysis, this situation presents a compelling narrative. Understanding this gap helps investors make more informed decisions. It encourages looking beyond daily price fluctuations and focusing on the long-term value proposition of the asset. This analytical approach is vital for navigating the often-volatile crypto landscape effectively. Unlocking Crypto Market Insights from Capriole Investments The analysis from Capriole Investments provides profound crypto market insights that challenge conventional thinking. Their data-driven approach suggests that the current market might not fully appreciate Bitcoin’s inherent strength and potential. For investors, this perspective could indicate a significant buying opportunity. When an asset trades below its calculated fair value, it often signals a chance for substantial future gains. However, it is essential to remember that market movements can be unpredictable, and no investment is without risk. Edwards’ work encourages a re-evaluation of how we perceive Bitcoin’s worth. It pushes us to consider the robust infrastructure and economic principles that underpin the network, rather than solely focusing on speculative price action. This holistic view is what makes Capriole Investments’ contributions so valuable to the crypto community. In conclusion, Charles Edwards of Capriole Investments presents a compelling case for Bitcoin’s significant undervaluation, pegging its fair value at $167,800. His analysis, based on solid network fundamentals, suggests that Bitcoin is currently trading at a deeper discount than it has in years. This insight offers a unique perspective for investors seeking to understand the true potential of the world’s leading cryptocurrency, reminding us that strong fundamentals often pave the way for future growth, even if the market hasn’t fully caught up yet.

Capriole Investments calculates Bitcoin’s fair value based on fundamental factors such as the energy input into the Bitcoin network and the token’s supply growth rate. 3.

Mutuum Finance is now in phase 6 of presale at $0.035, 16.67% higher than the phase 5 price. The next phase will include a 14.29% price increase to $0.04. Mutuum Finance investors today will see their investments double and even triple over time. More than 14,900 investors have bought the presale. Mutuum Finance has already amassed more than $14.1 million. As Ripple (XRP) continues to languish under the microscope and with growth slower than hoped, Mutuum Finance’s groundbreaking protocol and capital-efficient model are resonating more and more with DeFi veterans and mainstream analysts alike. While there are plenty of sub-$1 tokens picking up steam in 2025, Mutuum Finance stands out not just because of price, but because of the infrastructure it’s building at the intersection of blockchain and real-world use. MUTM Presale Phase 6 Is Live, Lock In Before Prices Rise Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shook up the DeFi market with its twin lending technology. Presale phase 5 recently sold out, and is now in phase 6 at $0.035. Early investors have enjoyed hot traction for the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $14,100,000 and token holders have exceeded 14900. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Boosts Security with $50,000 Bug Bounty Program Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also announced an Official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. The project will award $50,000 USDT to bug hunters so that they can report the probable bugs in the project. Bounty program exists in all the categories of vulnerabilities. It is available at the four levels of severities, i.e., critical, major, minor and low. The project evidently shows the direction of the team in terms of investor confidence. $100K Rewards Up for Grabs Mutuum Finance has also launched a $100,000 giveaway to provide investors with a chance to win incentives. 10 people will receive $10,000 tokens of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) each. Apart from welcoming new investors on the platform, the giveaway also shows the efforts of the project in establishing a settled and sustainable community. Mutuum Finance Is Redesigning the Future of Decentralized Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi lending revolution as a product offering customers full ownership of their assets. It’s an open double-platform built on combining Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. P2C operates based on the consensus of the market to remove the revenue risk of the lenders and lending economic risk. On the other hand middlemen are removed via the P2P system to make room for direct lending, which is ideal for risky assets such as meme coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly emerging as a serious contender among sub-$1 cryptos, already raising $14.1 million and gaining the trust of over 14,900 investors. Now priced at $0.035 in Phase 6, early buyers are positioned to earn 100-300% gains when Mutuum Finance enters the open market later in 2025. Backed by smart contract automation, an institutional-grade audit from CertiK, and a revolutionary dual lending model, P2P and P2C, Mutuum Finance is addressing real DeFi needs that Ripple (XRP) and others have yet to meet. Secure your MUTM tokens now before the next price increase, and take part in reshaping decentralized lending for 2025 and beyond.

For the April–June period, the company posted revenue of $198.6 million — a 91% jump from $104 million in the same quarter last year — surpassing analyst expectations of $195 million. “This was the most successful quarter in CleanSpark’s history, and it reflects the strength of our strategy,” said CEO Zach Bradford. The firm’s quarterly net income soared to $257.4 million, reversing a $236.2 million loss from the previous year. Earnings per diluted share came in at 78 cents, well above the anticipated 20 cents. Chief financial officer Gary Vecchiarelli called the quarter “pivotal,” highlighting that operational expenses were fully funded through monthly Bitcoin production while also growing the firm’s BTC reserves. CleanSpark Becomes First U.S. Miner to Reach 50 EH/s In a major operational milestone, CleanSpark became the first publicly traded mining company to achieve an operational hashrate of 50 exahashes per second (EH/s) entirely through American infrastructure. Bradford noted the accomplishment in June, emphasizing its significance for domestic mining capacity. CleanSpark has also expanded its Bitcoin treasury without resorting to equity dilution. The company currently holds 12,703 BTC, valued at roughly $1.48 billion, making it the ninth-largest public Bitcoin holder worldwide. Industry-Wide Boom in Mining Earnings The record-breaking results come amid a strong quarter for Bitcoin miners, boosted by a 32% increase in BTC’s price during the reporting period. The rally lifted profitability across the sector, with several rivals also surpassing expectations. MARA Holdings posted second-quarter revenue of $238 million, up 64% year-on-year, while Riot Platforms reported a record $219.5 million in net income for the same period. Meanwhile, Australian miner IREN Ltd saw its shares jump 11.4% on Wednesday after revealing $86 million in July revenue. IREN mined 728 BTC during the month, overtaking MARA’s 703 BTC despite operating with a smaller deployed hashrate of 50 EH/s compared to MARA’s 58.9 EH/s. For CleanSpark, the combination of operational efficiency, strong BTC reserves, and infrastructure leadership positions the company to capitalize on future market upswings.

It’s a direct way to participate in the market, aiming to profit from price fluctuations. For those considering trading MMON or any new asset, here are some actionable insights to consider: Research Thoroughly: Always understand the project behind the token. Look into its whitepaper, team, and fundamental use case. Start Small: Especially with new listings in the Innovation Zone, consider starting with a smaller, manageable investment. Risk Management: Set stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and never invest more than you can comfortably afford to lose. Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from MEXC and the MMON project team for timely updates and critical information. The dynamic nature of new listings can present both exciting opportunities and inherent challenges. Being well-prepared and thoroughly informed is key to navigating these markets successfully and making prudent trading decisions. The listing of the MMON/USDT spot trading pair on MEXC’s Innovation Zone is a testament to the continuous evolution and expansion of the crypto market.

In a new interview on the Bankless YouTube channel, Lee says that as more mainstream investors embrace it, Ethereum could experience a parabolic rally similar to what Bitcoin ( BTC ) did in 2017. “…If people go back to 2017 because I think Ethereum is having its Bitcoin 2017 moment this year, where Wall Street is finally getting behind ETH… Bitcoin was $1,000 in the early part of 2017. And it wasn’t until August… then it went straight up. I mean, literally went straight up.” According to Lee, Ethereum is currently undervalued and could go up by up to 290% from the current level. “I think the near-term price people should think about is Ethereum getting to $4,000 because Ethereum should be a better story than it was in December. And it was $4,000 in December. So we should at least recover to that level. And then Ethereum is a better story today than it was a year ago. And a year ago, Ethereum was at 0.05 BTC [the price of ETH in Bitcoin… at 0.05 Bitcoin, it’s like almost $6,000. So, just like saying giving it credit for where it was a year ago, it should be $6,000. But, of course, there is going to be a lot happening between now and year-end, including other Ethereum treasuries starting to buy Ethereum. Plus, Bitcoin goes up. So, I think by the year-end, it’s not unreasonable to think $7,000. Even $12,000 or $15,000 could happen.” Ethereum is trading at $3,840 (0.0329 BTC) at time of writing.

However, in the past week, a mysterious entity has built a potential treasury of over 171K ETH. The anonymous entity is buying up ETH from multiple sources, building a reserve of 171,015 ETH. On-chain data shows that Ethereum tokens were sent to six newly created wallets, funded by other large-scale trading wallets. The funds flowed in multiple transactions, tapping BitGo, FalconX, and Galaxy Digital, suggesting institutional buying. Other anonymous whales often use Binance for large transactions. This mysterious institution created a new wallet again, and received 10,396 $ETH ($40.6M) from #FalconX in the past 2 hours. Over the past 4 days, they have created 6 wallets and accumulated 171,015 $ETH ($667M) from #FalconX , #GalaxyDigital , and #BitGo . https://t.co/uYO6QGhRho pic.twitter.com/FEC4ilwzVo — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 8, 2025 The additional accumulation arrived as Ethereum is attempting yet another breakout. The token broke above the $3,900 level, once again setting expectations for a hike to $4,000 and new all-time highs. ETH has recovered from its image as an inactive chain, instead showing the network is key infrastructure for both native activities and inflows from institutional finance. The size of the current Ethereum reserves puts the entity among the top 5 entities with strategic ETH reserves , surpassing Coinbase and other earlier holders. The connected wallets are not yet linked to any specific treasury company or high-profile buyer. The recent inflows track high-profile purchases by SharpLink Gaming and the Ethereum Machine, as previously reported by Cryptopolitan. Whales actively move ETH for DeFi, reserve purposes Whales are highly active on the ETH spot market, with both trading and accumulation for staking. Recently, a whale panic-sold as Ethereum had a short-term setback, later returning to buy at $3,828. Overall, ETH is still relatively distributed, with the top 10 whales holding around 12.33M ETH, under 10% of the total supply. In comparison, BlackRock and Strategy already hold over 6% of the BTC supply, with even more locked in top institutional and corporate wallets. Ethereum also accumulates by necessity, even when held by retailers or early investors. After a period of usage as a utility coin, ETH is more widely used for staking and liquid staking currently. The inflow of ETH into accumulation addresses continues at a historically high pace, with growing demand for DeFi or a reserve for bigger future rallies. SharpLink Gaming buys more ETH SharpLink gaming also added to the ETH treasury rush. In the past day, the company acquired an additional 21,959 ETH, for a total of 543,898 ETH. SharpLink remains the second-largest corporate ETH holder, as BitMine has already expanded its treasury to 833.1K ETH. Following the recent purchase, SBET shares recovered near a one-week high of $23.56. Exact treasuries and wallets may be hard to track, as almost all entities move their funds into liquid staking. Even when staked on the Beacon Chain, the stakes will be split into several tranches of 2,048 ETH. Some large-scale ETH holders also choose third-party liquid staking entities that also work as validators. After an initial peak of requests to unstake ETH, validators are now returning to the usual balance. Close to 30% of the ETH supply is locked in staking, with additional tokens wrapped in multiple protocols. The increased demand from multiple buyer profiles continues to boost short-term ETH scarcity. In total, strategic ETH reserves are now above 3M ETH, catching up with near-vertical growth. ETFs still carry around 5.3M ETH, though with a slower pace in the past month. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Recent data reveals a significant shift in the world of digital finance. Specifically, Bitcoin fees have seen a notable decline, dropping by more than 22% this past week. This reduction reflects a broader trend of reduced on-chain activity across the network, largely influenced by slower price movements in the market, according to insights from Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock). What’s Driving Lower Bitcoin Fees? The primary reason for the drop in Bitcoin fees is a decrease in network congestion. When fewer transactions compete for space on the blockchain, the cost to process each transaction naturally falls. This is a direct consequence of less intense speculation and trading, leading to a calmer Bitcoin network environment. Reduced Demand: Fewer users mean less competition for block space. Slower Price Movement: Less volatility often reduces transaction volume. Efficient Block Space: Less competition means easier transaction inclusion, lowering Bitcoin transaction costs . Understanding On-Chain Activity and Its Impact On-chain activity encompasses all transactions and movements directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. When this activity slows, it signals reduced user engagement or market speculation. For the average user, this means interacting with the Bitcoin network becomes more affordable. This affordability could encourage new use cases or make existing ones more viable, impacting overall crypto market trends . Are Lower Fees a Good Sign for the Bitcoin Network? The reduction in Bitcoin fees offers a dual perspective. For users, it’s excellent news; sending Bitcoin becomes cheaper, enhancing its utility as a payment system. This can support long-term adoption. However, some view reduced on-chain activity as a sign of waning interest. Historically, high fees correlate with market excitement. Thus, the current decline might suggest a more subdued market sentiment, making it crucial to assess the Bitcoin network ‘s health holistically. Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends Understanding shifts in Bitcoin transaction costs is vital for anyone in digital assets. This environment of lower fees reflects broader crypto market trends —less frenetic activity than peak bull markets. This period offers an opportunity to conduct transactions without high fees, ideal for portfolio rebalancing or long-term accumulation. Observing metrics like on-chain activity and transaction fees provides valuable insights into the network’s health and user behavior. In conclusion, the recent 22% fall in Bitcoin fees directly results from decreased on-chain activity and slower price volatility. This development offers advantages for users seeking lower Bitcoin transaction costs and provides insights into current crypto market trends . While it suggests a quieter period, it also highlights the network’s adaptability, making Bitcoin more accessible for everyday use. Understanding these dynamics is key to navigating the evolving digital asset landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Why have Bitcoin fees decreased recently? Bitcoin fees decreased due to reduced on-chain activity and slower price volatility, leading to less network congestion. 2. What is ‘on-chain activity’ for Bitcoin? On-chain activity refers to all transactions and operations directly recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain. 3. How do lower Bitcoin transaction costs benefit users? Lower Bitcoin transaction costs make it cheaper and more efficient to send and receive Bitcoin, enhancing accessibility. 4. Does a fall in Bitcoin fees indicate a bearish market? Not necessarily. While often linked to less market excitement, it can also signify improved network efficiency, reflecting current crypto market trends . 5. Where does the data for Bitcoin fees and activity come from? Data on Bitcoin network fees and on-chain activity is typically provided by blockchain analytics firms like Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock). Did you find this article insightful?

This remarkable transaction, valued at approximately $793,000, occurred on August 8 via the Bitcoin Ordinals platform , Ordcity. It marks a significant moment in meme coin history , highlighting the burgeoning value of digital culture and unique crypto collectible assets. The Genesis of an Icon: The Dogwifhat Hat’s Journey The Dogwifhat hat isn’t just any accessory; it’s the foundational visual element of one of crypto’s most recognizable meme coins. Its story began humbly in 2018 when the owner of a charming Shiba Inu named Achi decided to adorn their pet with a simple, hand-knitted beanie. A photograph of Achi wearing this hat quickly went viral, capturing hearts across the internet. This unassuming charm and ubiquitous presence online transformed the image into a powerful symbol. It resonated with the decentralized, community-driven spirit often celebrated in the crypto space. What started as a whimsical photo evolved into a cultural phenomenon, eventually inspiring the creation of the Dogwifhat (WIF) meme coin. A Landmark Digital Collectible Sale on Bitcoin Ordinals The recent acquisition of this significant digital collectible sale took place on Ordcity, a prominent platform within the innovative Bitcoin Ordinals ecosystem. But what exactly are Bitcoin Ordinals, and why are they becoming so important? Native Bitcoin Assets: Bitcoin Ordinals allow users to “inscribe” digital content directly onto individual satoshis, which are the smallest units of Bitcoin. This process creates unique, non-fungible digital artifacts. Similar to NFTs: While distinct from traditional NFTs on other blockchains like Ethereum, Ordinals serve a similar purpose, enabling the creation and ownership of unique digital items directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. Growing Ecosystem: The Ordinals ecosystem has rapidly expanded, fostering a new wave of creativity and value within the Bitcoin network. Finn, the CEO and founder of the Bags platform, made the winning bid. This purchase demonstrates a profound belief in the cultural and financial significance of this unique, real-world item tied to a digital phenomenon. It also highlights the increasing crossover between physical memorabilia and the digital asset space. Impact on WIF Token Value and Meme Coin History This high-profile acquisition of the original Dogwifhat hat carries considerable implications for the associated WIF token value and the broader meme coin landscape. The sale isn’t just about a hat; it’s about validating a cultural movement. Enhanced Visibility: The staggering sale price has brought renewed global attention to the Dogwifhat project and the WIF token itself. This exposure can attract new investors, enthusiasts, and developers to the ecosystem. Cultural Validation: It unequivocally solidifies the meme’s cultural impact. It also validates the concept that physical items, when deeply intertwined with popular digital assets and communities, can command substantial value. Precedent for Collectibles: The event sets a powerful new precedent for the valuation of unique, real-world items connected to popular meme coins and other crypto narratives. It showcases the potential for “cultural capital” to translate into significant financial value. This transaction underscores the evolving nature of value in the digital age. Here, community sentiment, historical significance, and viral appeal can collectively drive prices to astonishing levels, redefining what constitutes a valuable asset in the modern economy. Looking Ahead: The Future of Crypto Collectibles The sale of the Dogwifhat hat on the Bitcoin Ordinals platform serves as a powerful indicator of the growing interest in unique crypto collectibles. As the market matures, we can expect to see more such high-profile sales, blurring the lines between traditional art, memorabilia, and digital assets. For investors and enthusiasts, understanding the narratives and cultural significance behind these assets becomes as crucial as analyzing their technical fundamentals.

ICP’s chart signals hesitation, while Pengu price momentum shows weakness following heavy selloffs. Both coins are on the radar, yet neither displays a clear path to explosive gains. However, Cold Wallet steps into this gap with a standout setup. Its current presale price is $0.00998 at stage 17, with more than $5.8 million already raised and a surge of over 10,000 new Telegram members. With a low entry price, limited supply, and a listing goal of $0.3517, this one stands out as a top contender for the next big crypto breakout. $0.00998 Presale Phase: A Key Moment Before Price Surge Cold Wallet’s ongoing presale at $0.00998 during stage 17 reflects one of those rare early windows. With more than $5.8 million secured so far and Telegram activity adding over 10,000 users in just a few days, the traction is clear. This isn’t noise; it’s strong movement paired with a limited supply. What makes this different? The numbers tell the story. The project targets a listing price of $0.3517, and from the current presale rate, that leaves room for serious upside. No complicated entry process, just early access before higher price stages come in. If you’re asking which crypto has real potential right now, this one checks the boxes. Presale mechanics are crafted to support sustained growth: 150 stages, price increasing step-by-step, and 40% of the 10B CWT supply dedicated to this round. Buyers also earn from a 20% referral reward (and 2% for their referees), offering extra value. The unlock system begins with 10% at TGE, with the rest vesting over three months, a setup intended to hold price stability after launch. Currently, this is among the final chances to grab a Cold Wallet below one cent. Prices are poised to move once major players enter higher stages. When it comes to the next breakout project, the data strongly backs Cold Wallet. ICP Technical Overview: Short-Term Uncertainty Still Lingers ICP is currently priced around $5.50, with trading happening between $5.21 and $5.54. It’s seen a recent 5–6% drop, slipping below the $5.55 support. Indicators vary: RSI hovers in the 44–58 range (neutral to slightly oversold), and the MACD differs between platforms, showing both bearish and rebound potential. Moving averages from MA5 to MA100 stay bullish, but the 200-day MA at $6.10 suggests long-term downward pressure. There is trading volume at current levels, showing interest, but holding the $5.38 mark is key to avoiding further downside. If it breaks down, the next levels to watch are $5.14 or possibly $4.30. Reclaiming $5.68 could open room toward $6+, but that needs stronger buying. At this point, ICP’s chart leans toward cautious short-term trading, with more clarity likely if a stronger trend emerges. Pengu Price Trends: Mixed Signals at a Crucial Zone Pengu is hovering around $0.037, with daily swings between $0.0342 and $0.0392. It’s dropped 11–14% in the last week, largely after a team-linked wallet shifted 150M tokens (~$5.6M) to Binance, triggering strong selling. However, some large holders appear to be quietly accumulating, and technical signals are sending mixed cues. A TD Sequential “9” buy signal suggests a possible local floor, while RSI divergence points to easing selling pressure. Support rests near $0.0367 to $0.037, while resistance lies between $0.0399 and $0.0402. Breaking above this could push the price toward $0.044 to $0.047, critical if Pengu is to stage a broader rally. The big question now: can this base hold long enough for upward momentum to build? If not, the price might dip toward the $0.03 to $0.028 range. For now, Pengu is sitting at a pivotal stage with both risk and rebound potential. Final Words ICP’s near $5.50 price shows uncertainty, with ICP technical analysis indicating the importance of holding support to avoid further losses. Pengu’s price momentum, now at $0.037, reflects stress from recent selloffs despite some bullish signals from accumulation. While both offer entry points, they don’t provide the structured upside currently seen in Cold Wallet. At $0.00998 in stage 17, Cold Wallet still gives early participants access before higher presale prices kick in. With over $5.8 million raised and a $0.3517 listing target, the structure points to serious upside, potentially 100x. For those asking what is the next big crypto, Cold Wallet presents a clear and calculated path.

This time, crypto whales are locking in large BDAG buys to take control of the 10 BTC Auction Pool ahead of the August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release. As the top buyers aim for bigger Bitcoin rewards, others are racing to join before the window closes on one of the most talked-about presale reward events of 2025. Whales are chasing scale and clarity. BlockDAG (BDAG) is showing real tools and numbers. Over 24.8 billion BDAG have been sold, 2.5 million users are already on board, and the listing price is locked at $0.05. Right now, BDAG costs just $0.0016, creating a possible 3025% return, plus Bitcoin from the auction pool. All this from one buy. Inside the Auction and Why Whales Are All In Everyone who buys BDAG is part of the 10 BTC Auction Pool, but whales are placing large orders to increase their cut. Here’s how it works: The more BDAG you buy, the more Bitcoin you get. Every buy counts, no upper limits or lock-up rules. The auction closes on August 11, and Bitcoin is shared after that. This creates a rare play for large buyers. They see a chance to move capital into instant Bitcoin payouts while getting early access to a coin with strong growth signs. With 10 BTC worth over $1.14 million, whales know their bigger buys give them more control over a large prize. Retail Buyers Are Still in the Game This isn’t just for whales. The structure lets anyone join. Even smaller buyers are claiming their spot by stacking BDAG in pieces to grow their share of Bitcoin rewards. BlockDAG’s setup makes it fair for everyone: No minimum amount to join the auction Rewards are split based on how much you buy Live updates show your current share of Bitcoin This model creates both competition and urgency. It pulls in the big players and keeps space for retail buyers who want real rewards. Not just a coin, but actual Bitcoin payouts. Big Buyers Are Making Moves on BlockDAG’s 10 BTC Pool BlockDAG is not a typical crypto presale . It is already working as a Layer 1 network with: A Demo Trading Platform where users can buy BDAG and practice selling with no risk. Over 19,000 ASIC miners have been sold to power the hybrid DAG and Proof-of-Work setup. A Cold Wallet launch is coming soon, giving access to DeFi and self-custody features. More than 4,500 developers are building over 300 dApps on its testnet. Large holders are not guessing. They are reacting to real progress, tools, and growing liquidity options. They know joining early gives them more control and access, and the 10 BTC Auction Pool gives them that entry point. Many also believe BDAG could reach $1 within the first year after trading begins. With the confirmed $0.05 listing price, fast movement is expected because of: More than 20 exchange listings lined up A strong community of over 200,000 BDAG holders Global attention from deals like the Inter Milan partnership If BDAG hits $1, that means a 625x jump from the current $0.0016 price. That alone creates pressure to act quickly. The Bitcoin reward just adds more fuel to the push. Only Days Left Before the Doors Close Big players are securing spots now because there isn’t much time left. The GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11 ends the auction window, and when that closes, so do the Bitcoin rewards linked to BDAG buys. For everyday users, the message is simple: Start now to claim part of the 10 BTC reward. Even small buys can build your share of the pool. Don’t let the big buyers take it all. This event is open to everyone. Larger holders are already on the move. But the 10 BTC Auction Pool is still running, and every BDAG buy helps. Whether someone spends a little or a lot, the chance is real: buy BDAG, earn Bitcoin, and follow a coin that’s already gaining attention. Time is running out, and the big players are not slowing down. This is the moment to act if you want Bitcoin and a coin with strong signs of long-term value.

This move signals resilience from the bulls, who are showing strength following several days of panic selling and heightened fears of a deeper correction. Market sentiment, while still cautious, is improving as BTC buyers reclaim ground. Related Reading: XRP Whale Activity Signals Warning: Distribution Pattern Resurfaces According to CryptoQuant data, the % BTC price change since the last difficulty bottom indicator currently sits at +7.4%, placing it in the green zone. This metric is a valuable tool for assessing miner health and market stability. Historically, real miner capitulation phases occur when this reading drops into sustained negative territory between –10% and –30%, typically after a series of difficulty decreases. Such conditions force weaker miners to sell holdings under pressure, often contributing to market downturns. At present, Bitcoin’s position above zero on this indicator suggests the market has emerged from significant miner stress. This reduces the risk of forced selling from mining operations, providing a steadier backdrop for price action. While not yet in an euphoric phase, the current reading indicates a moderate but constructive environment — one that could allow BTC to build a stronger foundation for the next upward move. Bitcoin Miner Health Signals Neutral-to-Positive Market Backdrop Top analyst Axel Adler shared fresh data suggesting that Bitcoin’s miner health remains in a neutral-to-positive state. According to Adler, the price is currently above the last difficulty bottom level, meaning there is no capitulation among miners. This reduces pressure from forced sales by weaker mining operations, a dynamic that often adds selling pressure during market downturns. The current +7.4% reading on the “% BTC price change since last difficulty bottom” indicator points to moderate momentum. While this is a constructive signal, Adler noted that it is far from the euphoric conditions seen in past market peaks, when readings surged between +50% and +80%. Looking ahead, Adler outlined several key factors to monitor: Next difficulty adjustment during falling prices: This would be a warning sign, indicating potential stress for weaker miners. Hashprice/revenue per TH/s: Tracking miner profitability can confirm or refute whether the sector is under pressure. Miner reserves: An increase in selling during weak price action would be an early signal of mounting stress. The bottom line, according to Adler, is that the miner factor is not currently dragging the market down, but it is also not a strong bullish driver. Instead, it serves as a steady, supportive backdrop — as long as Bitcoin does not break sharply above the last difficulty bottom level with double-digit percentage gains or, conversely, drop below it. In this environment, BTC’s price action will depend more on demand-side catalysts and macroeconomic developments than miner-driven pressures.

Following a strong bounce from recent lows, BTC pushed above the 50-day (blue), 100-day (green), and 200-day (red) moving averages, signaling a short-term shift in momentum. Currently, BTC is consolidating around $116,585, with immediate resistance at $116,600–$116,700, aligned with the 100-day SMA. A breakout above this area could open the path toward the $118,000–$118,500 region, with the next major resistance at $122,077, the previous range high. On the downside, $115,724 remains a crucial support level. A failure to hold this could trigger a pullback toward $114,000, with stronger support near the $112,500 zone. Volume has been relatively modest on this rebound, suggesting that bulls need stronger participation to maintain upside momentum. Related Reading: Ethereum Bears Dominate Market Orders: -$418.8M Daily Net Taker Volume Signals Trouble The recent move above multiple SMAs is a positive short-term sign, but BTC is still trading within the broader range established in July. Until the price decisively breaks above $118K, the market remains in a consolidation phase, vulnerable to reversals if buying pressure fades. Maintaining support above $115.7K will be key for bulls aiming to test higher resistance levels in the coming sessions.

49745423,551452,1754654442,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49745423.jpeg,Fundamental Global Enters Ethereum Treasury Strategy Trend With $5B Fundraise Plan,https://bitcoinist.com/fundamental-global-enter-ethereum-treasury-strategy/,"Ethereum’s growing appeal among institutional players has taken another leap forward as Fundamental Global Inc. (FGF), a Nasdaq-listed company specializing in reinsurance, merchant banking, and asset management, revealed an ambitious $5 billion cryptocurrency strategy in a recent SEC filing. The plan marks a major pivot toward Ethereum investments, signaling increased confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. The announcement immediately impacted market sentiment. While FGF shares closed the regular session on August 7 at $36.17, down 1.44% for the day, they surged 3.76% after-hours to $37.53 following the news. Investors reacted to the aggressive treasury allocation plan, which positions the company alongside other forward-looking firms adopting Ethereum as part of their corporate reserves. FGF’s move mirrors the Ethereum Treasury strategy trend recently embraced by Sharplink Gaming, underscoring a growing corporate shift toward integrating ETH into long-term capital strategies . This wave of institutional adoption not only strengthens Ethereum’s position in the crypto market but also reinforces its narrative as a store of value and strategic asset in the evolving financial landscape. FGF’s $5B Bet On Ethereum Marks Bold Institutional Shift Fundamental Global has made a landmark move into the cryptocurrency sector, filing an S-3 form with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer up to $5 billion in securities. According to the filing, the majority of proceeds will be directed toward acquiring Ethereum, while the remainder will cover corporate and operational needs. This represents a major strategic shift for a publicly traded company historically outside the crypto space. In the filing, FGF outlined its new approach: “We recently initiated an Ethereum (ETH) treasury strategy. ETH is the native token of the Ethereum network. Ethereum is the foundation of digital finance and the settlement layer for the majority of stablecoins, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and tokenized assets.” FGF further emphasized its intention to accumulate ETH as a long-term treasury asset, with the goal of growing its overall position and increasing ETH per common share through professional treasury management. The strategy will leverage capital raising activities alongside advanced blockchain-based tools such as staking, restaking, liquid staking, and other DeFi protocols to maximize returns and asset growth. By positioning ETH as its primary treasury reserve asset, FGF joins a growing list of companies—like Sharplink Gaming—that are embedding Ethereum into their corporate balance sheets. This approach not only diversifies reserves but also aligns the company with one of the fastest-growing sectors in digital finance. FGF’s commitment reflects a broader institutional recognition of Ethereum’s role as a core blockchain infrastructure asset. As more firms adopt similar treasury strategies, the demand for ETH could see sustained upward pressure, reinforcing its position as a strategic, yield-generating, and value-accreting asset in the corporate treasury landscape. Price Action Details: Key Levels To Watch Ethereum (ETH) is showing renewed bullish momentum, as seen in the 4-hour chart, after reclaiming the critical $3,860 resistance level. The breakout came with strong buying volume, pushing prices toward the $3,900 zone. This move follows a sharp recovery from the $3,350 local low earlier in the week, with ETH now trading above its 50-day (blue), 100-day (green), and 200-day (red) moving averages — a structurally bullish setup. However, the $3,900–$3,920 range is emerging as short-term resistance, where sellers have started taking profits. A decisive close above this level could open the door for a retest of the psychological $4,000 mark, last seen in mid-July. On the downside, immediate support lies at $3,860 — the previous resistance now flipped into a potential demand zone. If this level fails, ETH could revisit the $3,700 region, aligning with the 100-day MA for additional technical confluence. Volume patterns indicate that buyers remain in control, but the market may need consolidation before another leg up. As long as ETH holds above $3,860, the broader trend favors continuation to the upside, especially with institutional interest — such as Fundamental Global’s $5B Ethereum treasury plan — reinforcing the bullish narrative. A break below $3,860 would weaken this outlook in the short term.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/top-analyst-says-you-are-not-bullish-enough-on-xrp-heres-why/,"Egrag Crypto, a well-respected crypto analyst, has issued a striking warning to investors: “Trust me, you are not bullish enough for what is coming in the next few months. Only a few.” The statement reflects Egrag’s deep conviction that XRP is on the verge of a powerful rally —one that most market participants are still underestimating. Egrag’s Macro Outlook on XRP Known for his high-timeframe technical analysis, Egrag has repeatedly emphasized the larger bullish structures forming around XRP. His recent post aligns with prior forecasts that highlight long-term chart formations, such as symmetrical triangles and Fibonacci extension targets, pointing toward significant upside potential. Egrag believes the vast majority of investors remain distracted by short-term volatility, failing to grasp the implications of these multi-year patterns. In his view, a breakout isn’t just possible—it’s inevitable. Based on his models, he predicts XRP could potentially surge to double-digit prices, a forecast supported by his thorough chart analysis and strategic insights. Trust me, You ARE NOT #BULLISH ENOUGH for what is coming in the next few Months. ONLY FEW — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) August 8, 2025 Catalysts Supporting the Bullish Case Beyond technicals, the fundamental landscape for XRP has strengthened considerably in 2025. Ripple’s global expansion of its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) corridors and the rollout of RLUSD, its USD-backed stablecoin, have reinforced XRP’s use case in cross-border finance. XRP is evolving from a speculative asset to a practical digital infrastructure, thanks to these developments. Perhaps most critical is the resolution of the long-running legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission . On August 7, 2025, both parties officially moved to dismiss their respective appeals, bringing a definitive end to the case. With legal uncertainty behind it, XRP is now free from the regulatory cloud that had loomed over it since 2020. Judge Analisa Torres’ 2023 ruling, which clarified that XRP is not a security when traded on secondary markets, remains a pivotal milestone. That clarity, combined with XRP’s recent classification as a commodity under CFTC event contracts, positions the asset for broader institutional acceptance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Signs of Accumulation and Institutional Interest Despite subdued sentiment in parts of the retail market, accumulation patterns suggest that informed players are quietly positioning for what may be a historic move. XRP has consistently defended key support zones, even during broader market pullbacks, signaling strong hands are accumulating with a longer time horizon in mind. Institutional interest is also gaining momentum. With regulatory clarity established, banks and financial institutions exploring blockchain-based settlement systems are increasingly turning their attention to XRP. Ripple’s growing footprint in regions such as Asia, the Middle East, and Africa is accelerating this trend, adding real-world relevance to Egrag’s bullish thesis. What Lies Ahead Egrag Crypto’s message is clear: the market is not prepared for what’s coming. While many remain focused on immediate price fluctuations, the groundwork for a major shift is already being laid. Whether through technical setups, regulatory milestones, or expanding utility, the signs are converging. Only a few, as Egrag warns, are truly ready.

He Made a Reference to Another Altcoin!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/ethereum-founder-vitalik-buterin-offers-support-and-warning-for-eth-he-made-a-reference-to-another-altcoin/,"As the number of companies adding Ethereum (ETH) to their reserves continues to increase every day, Vitalik Buterin commented on this situation. In an interview with the Bankless podcast, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin supported the growing trend of ETH-focused treasury firms while warning that excessive leverage risks triggering a gradual price collapse. Vitalik Buterin said that holding ETH in companies' treasuries is valuable and helps more investors access it. However, he warned that this trend could pose risks to the Ethereum ecosystem if it turns into an “over-leveraged game.” “They certainly provide valuable services. The ability for companies to invest in ETH treasury companies rather than holding ETH directly gives investors more options. However, there are risks as well.” According to the data, the largest institutional ETH holders are BitMine Immersion Technologies with $3.23 billion worth of ETH and SharpLink Gaming with $2.02 billion worth of ETH. Vitalik Buterin also emphasized that these companies are more resilient than past failures like Terra, and stated that ETH investors are not like Terra investors, they have sufficient knowledge and discipline. “These are not Do Kwon followers we are talking about. ETH investors have enough discipline to stay away from such a crash.” Buterin added that ETH’s 163% rally this year, fueled by demand from treasury firms, has helped narrow the performance gap with Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL). *This is not investment advice.

This announcement comes just days after the Tornado Cash co-founder was convicted on one of three federal charges that legal experts warn could set a dangerous precedent for criminalizing open-source development. Privacy is normal, and writing code is not a crime. https://t.co/BD55K5GDW3 — Ethereum (@ethereum) August 7, 2025 In an August 7 announcement , Hsiao-Wei Wang, co-executive director of the Ethereum Foundation, disclosed details of the donation and called upon the broader crypto community to contribute to the Tornado Cash developer’s legal defense fund. Ethereum Foundation Support Ambitious $7M donation goal as Storm Faces 5-Year Prison According to the “ freeromanstorm ” donation tracker, the Ethereum Foundation has contributed only 2% of the $500,000 target, while total legal fund support received by the Tornado Cash developer currently exceeds $4.7 million, still 31% short of the ambitious $7 million goal. Source: Free Roman Storm Supporting Roman Storm’s cause, Wang emphasized that “Privacy is normal, and writing code is not a crime.” Storm himself has been actively soliciting public contributions to his legal defense fund. A July 26 X post from the Tornado Cash developer urgently stated: “We’re running out of time — legal costs are piling up fast, and we urgently need your help.” The current legal urgency and plea for donations comes as a Manhattan jury on August 6 found Storm guilty of conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitter. Coin Center’s Seven Takeaways from the Storm Verdict: 1. The sole conviction—unlicensed money transmission (18 U.S.C. § 1960)—turns mainly on legal/regulatory interpretation (“does this count as money transmission?”), not jury fact-finding. 2. The court, at the… — Peter Van Valkenburgh (@valkenburgh) August 6, 2025 However, jurors remained deadlocked on separate conspiracy charges for money laundering and sanctions evasion after four days of deliberation. Under 18 U.S. Code Section 1960 , Storm was convicted of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, which stipulates that anyone who “knowingly conducts, controls, manages, supervises, directs, or owns all or part of an unlicensed money transmitting business, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.” The Free Pertsev & Storm legal aid organization highlighted the urgency of continued funding, confirming that Storm “risks up to 5 years of jail time if he doesn’t win the appeal, and potentially decades if the government decides to retry Counts 1 & 3.” Counts 1 and 3, which remain in legal deadlock, include charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions, respectively. Roman has been convicted on Count 2 of conspiracy to Operate an Unlicensed Money Transmitting Business (max sentence of 5 years in prison). Here's a good thread by @valkenburgh about this charge + why it makes no sense: https://t.co/GlyEj9kPyy — Free Pertsev & Storm (@FreeAlexeyRoman) August 6, 2025 The organization noted that this case’s outcome “will set a major precedent for developers worldwide.” “Sad Day for DeFi”: Crypto Lawyers And Community Rally Support for Tornado Cash Developers The crypto community has widely criticized the unfairness of Storm’s case. On August 6, crypto lawyer Jake Chervinsky called the recent verdict “a sad day for DeFi,” arguing that “the government should never have brought this case.” He contended that Section 1960 should not apply to developers of non-custodial protocols who lack control over user funds. The government should never have brought this case. Section 1960 should not apply to the developer of a non-custodial protocol who lacks control of user funds. This case should go up on appeal. Hopefully the Second Circuit will correct this (and many other) errors in the case. — Jake Chervinsky (@jchervinsky) August 6, 2025 Chervinsky urged the case to proceed on appeal, expressing hope that “the Second Circuit will correct this (and many other) errors.” Storm’s legal difficulties stem from his role in developing Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency mixer that enables users to obscure transaction histories by pooling funds with other users. The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned the protocol in August 2022, alleging that $7 billion had been laundered through the platform since 2019, including frequent use by North Korea’s Lazarus Group hackers. Federal prosecutors characterized Storm as someone who profited from “hiding dirty money for criminals.” At the same time, his defense team argued that Tornado Cash was designed as a privacy tool for legitimate users, not specifically for illicit activities. Storm was indicted on these charges and sanctions violations alongside Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Semenov and Alexey Pertsev, another developer associated with the cryptocurrency-mixing platform. Tornado Cash users, developers, and crypto executives continue challenging the Treasury’s sanctions in court, arguing that the platform’s immutable smart contracts should not be subject to OFAC restrictions. Roman Storm, co-founder of the crypto mixing platform Tornado Cash, is urging a U.S. federal judge to dismiss all criminal charges against him. #TornadoCash #Storm https://t.co/UR6SpxMSw3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 20, 2024 On March 24, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, demanded a final court judgment in the Tornado Case, despite the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s decision to delist the crypto mixer.

The Ripple price is predicted to soar to $7, while Cardano is expected to climb to $1.80. Also, Unilabs (UNIL) , a new rising star, is revolutionizing the DeFi investment space using artificial intelligence. With its strong market momentum and potential impact, Unilabs could deliver huge returns of up to 20x to investors seeking the next best crypto to buy. Ripple (XRP) Price Primed for Major Gains, Says Analyst Crypto King , a market analyst, believes the Ripple price is building momentum for what could be a historic bull run. According to the expert, $XRP has already shown its resilience and long-term potential. After staying in a downtrend from July to November 2024, the Ripple price broke out and surged with a massive 585% return, proving that patience pays off for holders. While the first two quarters of 2025 remained relatively quiet, the Ripple price once again began gaining traction following another key breakout in July. This move alone has already resulted in a 70% increase, even before the broader bull market officially kicks in. Crypto King insists that the real rally is just getting started. He expects the DeFi coin price to rally to $7.00. Meanwhile, technical analysis shows the Ripple price is gaining bullish momentum. The RSI has crossed the midline, and the ADI flashes a buy signal. Data from CoinMarketCap shows the Ripple price has been trading along the $2.80-$3.20 range in the weekly chart. Bulls could break the upper level in the coming weeks with sustained buying pressure and high volume. Ali Martinez Cites Condition For Cardano (ADA) Uptrend In a recent post on X, on-chain analyst Ali_Charts noted that the Cardano price has been trading in a descending channel since the beginning of the year. The Cardano price is currently at the channel's upper part and falling towards the middle. Meanwhile, Ali told his followers that the Cardano price could pump to $1.30 in the coming weeks. The only condition for this uptrend is that bulls must push the DeFi crypto price above the $0.84 resistance. CryptoBullet1 , another analyst, states that the $ADA 3D chart depicts a typical bullish setup. According to the analyst, the Cardano price has successfully broken out of a descending trendline and completed a healthy retest, often preceding a strong upward move. With momentum building, he believes the Cardano price could pump toward $1.80 soon. The Cardano price might confirm a broader reversal pattern if this trend continues. Presently, the Cardano price trades along the $0.70-$0.76 range, per CoinMarketCap . The altcoin price has failed to breach the upper range due to increasing market volatility. Unilabs (UNIL) The AI-Powered Platform That's Revolutionizing Crypto Investment According to research , the AI in the finance industry is expected to reach $190.33 billion in 2030 from $38.36 billion in 2024. This huge growth points to the increasing importance of AI in transforming the way individuals invest. Unilabs (UNIL) , the Solana slayer, seeks to lead this industry with an array of Wall Street-grade tools. The project will provide the users with AI-driven investment funds that will be aimed at offering more innovative and more efficient wealth growth. These investments cut across DeFi, AI-powered crypto projects, mining-backed assets, and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Moreover, Unilabs' Early Access Scoring System (EASS) ranks new projects according to their earnings potential. This allows users to know where to invest their funds for optimum profits. The Memecoin Identification Tool is another smart tool from Unilabs. This feature examines market trends, social media hype, and trading volume to identify new memecoins early. It would help users identify tokens with chances to give high ROI. Meanwhile, Unilabs' UNIL coin is at the sixth stage of its blockchain ICO, trading at $0.0097. Crypto Royal , one of the most popular YouTubers in the cryptocurrency industry, is sure that the DeFi token has enormous growth potential because of its excellent timing and its entry into the AI industry. At the moment, the DeFi project has already realized $10.8 million in funds and sold 1.7 billion coins. If low-utility coins like Pepe could soar to a $1 billion market valuation in less than a year, high-utility coins like UNIL have higher growth potential. Top Crypto Coins To Watch Out For In 2025, Ripple, Cardano, and Unilabs will lead the DeFi market, providing investors with the prospect of enormous returns. For individuals who are interested in striking gold in DeFi, these are the best options they might want to consider. Investors looking for low-priced coins can consider Unilabs, the Solana slayer.

49746604,551552,1754656248,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49746604.jpeg,Trump’s 401(k) Crypto Move Could Send Billions Into Bitcoin and Ethereum: Best Crypto to Buy?,https://bitcoinist.com/best-crypto-to-buy-after-trumps-401k-order/,"Oops, he did it again: President Donald Trump’s latest executive order could mark one of the biggest steps yet toward mainstream crypto adoption. His most recent executive order allows ‘401(k) investors to access alternative assets for better returns and diversification.’ Put more plainly, US citizens may now include cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum in their 401(k) retirement accounts. It’s an opening that analysts say could channel billions of dollars into the crypto market. Billions of dollars flowing into crypto will lift more than just Bitcoin and Ethereum: read on for a shortlist of the best crypto to buy as the market adjusts. Trump Pushes Crypto Through Executive Orders Trump loves executive orders; he’s issued 183 total . Of those, four are crypto-related – and while that doesn’t seem like much, they’ve been hugely important. STRENGTHENING AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IN DIGITAL FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY : Revoked Biden-era policies and set out policies to ‘promote United States leadership in digital assets and financial technology while protecting economic liberty.’ ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE AND UNITED STATES DIGITAL ASSET STOCKPILE Does exactly what it says on the tin – creates the long-awaited US Bitcoin Reserve. GUARANTEEING FAIR BANKING FOR ALL AMERICANS Prevents ‘debanking,’ where banks purposefully block crypto-related companies and individuals from access to traditional finance. DEMOCRATIZING ACCESS TO ALTERNATIVE ASSETS FOR 401(K) INVESTORS Expands access to ‘alternative assets’ – including crypto – for the 90M+ US citizens with 401(k) retirement accounts. Unlike some of Trump’s other executive orders, each of the crypto-related ones draws on long-running trends or ideas that Trump has been mulling over for years. The Bitcoin Reserve EO serves as an excellent example. Ever since Michael Saylor’s (Micro)Strategy began buying Bitcoin in 2020, the idea of strategic Bitcoin reserves as a store of value has spread like wildfire. Trump adopted it on a national level, clearing the way for other countries and multiple states to adopt the idea. The most recent EO, related to 401(k) funds and crypto, follows the same path. As the order states: During my first term, my Administration issued a 2020 information letter, recognizing that prudent Federal action could encourage the proliferation of investment strategies under which a portion of retirement plan participants’ interests are allocated to alternative assets, as is the case for institutional investors. —US President Donald Trump, Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors It goes to show that Trump’s approach to crypto isn’t to swing wildly; he’s using executive orders as part of building out a broader, more comprehensive regulatory framework. A Regulatory Shift Toward Digital Assets The order also brings crypto into the same category as more traditional alternative assets like private equity and real estate. With over $8.7T held in American 401(k) accounts, even modest allocations could represent a massive capital inflow into the digital asset ecosystem. According to Tom Dunleavy, Head of Venture at Varys Capital , a mere 5% allocation of regular paycheck contributions into crypto could translate into billions of dollars in new demand. The market appeared to agree. Bitcoin and Ethereum prices both jumped on the news, with altcoins like Solana and XRP also posting strong gains. In fact, the top ten cryptos by market cap were all posting 24-hour gains at the time of writing. Traders view the move as a sign that crypto could soon see a stable and predictable stream of institutional-grade capital. Market Implications Beyond Bitcoin The new executive order could spur the development of new financial products tailored for retirement accounts. These could include crypto index funds, blockchain ETFs, and diversified digital asset portfolios, all making it easier for ordinary investors to gain exposure without navigating complex exchanges or wallets. The order also signals the deeper integration of digital assets into the US financial system and spurs broader access to alternative investments. For crypto advocates, it represents a significant milestone on the path toward mass adoption. While the fine print of how crypto will be implemented in 401(k) plans remains to be seen, the move is already reshaping market sentiment. By opening a multi-trillion-dollar retirement industry to digital assets, Trump’s executive order could set the stage for a new era in both investing and retirement planning. With that much money flowing into crypto , many will ask, What is the best crypto to buy right now? We’ve got a roundup of some of today’s hottest tokens. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Fastest-Ever Layer 2 Provides the Upgrade Bitcoin Needs Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) does what Bitcoin wants to do – become fully integrated with the broader DeFi economy. No more snail-pace transactions, no more complicated bridges to get Bitcoin somewhere useful for yield generation. Instead, $HYPER provides a powered-up Layer 2 that deploys Bitcoin through Bitcoin Hyper’s Canonical Bridge, processing transactions off-chain while maintaining Bitcoin’s security guarantees. The Bitcoin Relay Program on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) allows investors to seamlessly move Bitcoin from the original layer to the Hyper Layer 2 and back again as needed. What is Bitcoin Hyper ? Bitcoin Hyper turns Bitcoin into a programmable, high-speed asset, unlocking use cases like DeFi, NFTs, and real-time payments. It’s like strapping a F! engine onto Bitcoin’s trusted chassis. The full Bitcoin Hyper Layer 2 will be deployed after the token launches, but SVM programs are already running natively on Hyper’s rollup architecture. The presale has amassed over $7.7M so far, with tokens priced at $0.012575. There’s already $HYPER staking – at 138% APY – for investors who buy and stake during the presale. Our price prediction is that the $HYPER token will reach $0.20 by the end of 2026. Visit the Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale page to get in before the 401(k) bull run goes into overdrive. 2. AAVE ($AAVE) – As TVL Grows, Will Price Follow? AAVE is seeing significant growth in TVL as DeFi rebounds. And at least one analyst sees that as an opportunity. $AAVE, the utility token for the world’s largest liquidity protocol, typically moves in conjunction with TVL. And right now, with everyone from retail investors to institutions looking to boost yield, TVL is on the rise – but $AAVE’s price hasn’t caught up. That could create a major buying opportunity – especially with potentially trillions of 401(k) money flowing in. 3. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Find Memes, Snipe Meme Tokens with Snorter Bot Some of the best meme coin opportunities never make it to your local CEX. We’re talking about low-cap gems that trade ‘underground’ on Telegram, coins with incredible volatility and incredible potential. Trading these sorts of high-risk, high-reward coins requires time, effort, and advanced technical know-how – not to mention perfect timing. Or you could simply use Snorter Bot! What is Snorter Token ? This coin powers Snorter Bot and gives you access to faster swaps, automated sniping, and even limit orders and copy trading features. It’s all you need to get Snorter Bot on side to sniff out and snipe winning meme coins long before they go parabolic on a CEX. There is significant interest in Snorter’s skillset; the presale has already surpassed the $2.8M mark, with tokens priced at $0.1007. Learn how to buy Snorter Token , or check out the Snorter Token ($SNORT) presale page for more! Executive Order Move Markets Toward Crypto President Trump’s executive order, officially signed on August 7, signals a major policy shift in retirement investing. From now on, alternative assets like crypto, private equity, and real estate can be legally included within 401(k) plans. It opens a regulatory roadmap toward modernization and sets the industry up for a fresh influx of capital.

The most actively traded U.S. gold futures contract climbed as high as $3,534 per troy ounce after U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed that one-kilogram and 100-ounce bars would face reciprocal tariffs. Tariffs make imported gold more expensive for U.S. buyers. That cost pressure typically pushes futures prices higher than spot prices, creating arbitrage opportunities for traders. The setup can fuel speculative buying, but it also sends a geopolitical signal — gold has historically been viewed as outside trade-war crossfire, more akin to a currency than a competitive product. The move is notable because most U.S. gold imports come from Switzerland, which received one of the highest tariff rates under the policy. A sudden increase in costs for that supply could raise the risk of a short squeeze if deliveries slow. “Trump's tariffs on 100-ounce and 1-kilo gold bars could wreak havoc on the COMEX,"" bitcoin critic and gold advocate Peter Schiff said in a post on X. ""Prices could soar as shorts rush to cover to avoid having to pay 39% tariffs to import bars from Switzerland if longs take delivery. Even if they don't import, all such bars will trade at premiums."" The rally comes at a time when interest rates headed lower in the West and global trade tensions are already high, factors that tend to strengthen gold’s appeal as a store of value during economic uncertainty. Historically, strong gold rallies have often coincided with gains in bitcoin, which some traders view as an alternative “safe-haven” asset. Tokenized gold products such as PAX Gold (PAXG) and Tether Gold (XAUT) were both modestly higher over the past 24 hours, while bitcoin slipped about 1%. Tariffs on gold could also make the case for bitcoin, which is not subject to customs duties and is sometimes described as “digital gold.” While the metal remains the dominant safe-haven asset, the latest price surge shows how policy changes can push investors to reassess their options.",Markets|Gold|News,EN,0,0,FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|BTC|MARKET|XAUT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-08 13:26:27
49748803,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=407859,1754659612,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/49748803.jpeg,Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions: $4 in Sight After Ripple’s SEC Victory?,https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-xrp-price-predictions-4-in-sight-after-ripples-sec-victory/,"TL;DR XRP gains 9% daily after Ripple settles with SEC, boosting confidence across crypto markets. Whale wallets show mixed signs; exchange reserves fall while large transfers remain unusually high. XRP holds above $3.20 support with bullish momentum; RSI nears overbought, but trend still intact. The following presents multiple Ripple (XRP) price predictions given the above context. Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions: The Context In the last 24 hours, XRP has posted a sharp move higher. At the time of writing, the token trades around $3.31, representing a 9% daily gain. The price increase places XRP just below its yearly high of $3.65, a level touched three weeks earlier. For the week, XRP is now up more than 13%. During this period, the price has fluctuated between $2.77 and $3.36, while the past day saw a range between $3.03 and $3.37. Daily trading volume is also up, with more than $9.9 billion exchanged across major platforms. Notably, these movements come directly after Ripple finalized a legal settlement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The deal ended a lengthy legal case that started in 2020. No further appeals will follow. With the case now behind the company, many traders and investors have adjusted their outlook on XRP. Market Responds to Institutional Activity Soon after the legal resolution became public, transaction monitors flagged a large XRP transfer. More than 16.6 million XRP, valued at over $55 million, moved to Coinbase from an unrecognized wallet. This transfer was one of the largest seen in recent months. Interestingly, the transaction coincided with a surge in trading volume. Price moved quickly through areas of prior resistance. XRP cleared the $3.10 to $3.15 zone with high volume. Buying pressure has been steady, supported by higher-than-normal inflows during the early hours of trading on August 8. This price strength has been attributed to renewed interest from institutional traders. Technical Picture: Holding Support, Aiming Higher Charts suggest XRP is still within a bullish structure. The price broke out of a falling wedge pattern that had formed after a mid-July peak. The breakout occurred near $3.07, which lines up with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level. A quick move followed, pushing the token up to $3.35 before slight retracement. Now, the token is consolidating near $3.31. This price region is close to the 0.618 Fibonacci level, which has acted as a key zone in previous cycles. If the market holds above $3.20, there may be enough momentum to challenge $3.65 again and even push toward $4. Source: TradingView Support is currently found at $3.20 and $3.00. If the XRP price fails to hold these levels, a deeper pullback could reach the $2.72 area. This level previously saw strong demand in late July and may act as a base if needed. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is now at 67.9. This level shows growing buying interest but is not yet in overbought territory. If RSI moves past 70, traders may expect consolidation before any continuation. Earlier, market analyst Ali Martinez pointed to a successful breakout from the 0.786 to the 1.414 Fibonacci extension. That target near $3.34 has now been met, indicating the pattern played out with precision. This may help chart future targets if volume remains steady. Source: X Whale Moves Create Mixed Sentiment On-chain data from CryptoQuant shows that large XRP holders have been active. In the first week of August, the XRPL Whale Flow indicator turned negative. This metric tracks the difference between inflows and outflows from large wallets. A negative reading suggests more tokens are being moved out than added. Source: CryptoQuant On July 31, analysts recorded over 51,000 large transactions on the network. Four days later, the figure remained high at 38,000. Earlier this year, a similar pattern came before a price drop from $3.40 to around $1.60. That move also saw a spike in large transfers, signaling distribution among major holders. However, not all movement from whales points to selling. Data also shows that total exchange reserves have fallen. Between July 24 and August 7, XRP held on centralized exchanges dropped from 3.02 billion to 2.3 billion. When large amounts of a token are removed from exchanges, it often suggests holders are choosing to store assets rather than trade them. If this trend continues, it may lower available supply and ease some of the selling pressure. Still, this must be weighed against high-frequency activity from whale accounts, which may signal further repositioning. Transaction Activity Picks Up After XRP’s Price Surge The network value to transactions (NVT) ratio, a measure comparing market cap to on-chain volume, has recently shifted. On August 7, XRP’s NVT ratio reached 225, reflecting a sharp rise in price while transaction activity lagged behind. As of the latest data, the NVT has pulled back to 177.5, a drop of over 21%. This decline suggests that on-chain usage is starting to catch up with market valuation. The earlier spike in the ratio raised concerns that XRP might be outpacing its real-time utility. The recent drop eases some of those concerns. Source: CryptoQuant This change may signal better alignment between how much XRP is being moved and how the market is valuing it. In previous cycles, a high NVT ratio often came before price corrections. This time, however, the lower reading could mean network activity is recovering after the price jump, supporting the current range. Do XRP Price Predictions Make Sense? Price forecasts are often based on technical patterns and market conditions more generally. For XRP, the end of the SEC lawsuit removes one of the key unknowns that had weighed on its valuation. Short term price predictions may be beneficial, but they are very susceptible to the day-to-day market fluctuations, news activities, and trading patterns. XRP’s market remains highly reactive to both external developments and on-chain behavior. Several aspects such as liquidity, macro market trends, and investor sentiment should be always termed in predictions. How Are Ripple Price Predictions Made? Forecasts for XRP come from a mix of technical, fundamental, and on-chain tools. Support and resistance, Fibonacci retracements, and moving averages are commonly used by chart analysts to project possible ranges. Breakout patterns such as triangles or flags as well as volume and volatility are also common. On-chain signals such as the whale flows, exchange balances, and volume can be used to gauge what the big fish players are up to, and whether tokens are being stacked up or unstocked. Together with their technical patterns, these signals may be able to give a more complete picture. Fundamentally, traders monitor the progress made in the business processes of Ripple, collaboration with other properties, as well as changes in regulation. As a matter of legal clarity, it can be expected that the focus will move on the adoption rates and institutional use, particularly on cross-border payment corridors.

While the SEC continues its review process for altcoin ETFs, these applications are expected to be approved in September or October. However, one of the most striking aspects of altcoins is that the largest asset manager, BlackRock, did not apply for an ETF for any altcoin other than BTC and ETH. However, ETF Store President Nate Geraci stated that there is a high probability that BlackRock will apply for a spot ETF for XRP and Solana. In an interview with Thinking Crypto, Geraci said it would make sense for BlackRock to offer ETFs for XRP and other major altcoins like Solana. Geraci warned that BlackRock was late to join the race, noting that other asset managers like Bitwise, Franklin, and Grayscale are still applying for XRP and Solana ETFs. Noting that BlackRock is waiting for a clearer regulatory framework, Geraci said: “We are nearing the finish line and BlackRock still hasn't filed. However, I believe BlackRock will act at the last minute and apply for both spot XRP and Solana ETFs. I think they are just waiting for a formal regulatory framework to be published before applying.” Finally, Geraci added that there was a steady and strong demand for futures-based XRP and Solana ETFs even before the spot ETFs were launched. *This is not investment advice.

Sam Altman described the experience of using GPT-5 as feeling like he was talking to an expert. In fact, this AI model is so powerful that it managed to solve a problem Altman admitted he couldn’t figure out himself. GPT-5 delivers state-of-the-art performance across domains, like coding, math, writing, and more. It features a deeper reasoning architecture called GPT-5 Thinking, allowing it to tackle complex problems and make more nuanced decisions. And its unified model can autonomously decide when to respond instantly and when to “think” longer for expert-level answers. Best of all, OpenAI isn’t gatekeeping GPT-5 behind paywalls. It’ll even be available to free users, with paid users enjoying higher usage limits. Keep reading to learn all about GPT-5 and its most striking features, along with an in-depth discussion on why SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) could be the best crypto to buy now to ride this AI wave. From Code to Content: What GPT-5 Can Build in Seconds ChatGPT 5 is all set to take software development a notch higher and redefine the idea of software on demand. During a live demonstration, GPT-5 quickly built a web app , complete with quizzes, flashcards, and even an interactive game, to help English speakers learn French. Additionally, OpenAI is calling GPT-5 its strongest coding model to date. It can fix bugs, edit code, and analyze complex databases, all while excelling at front-end development. GPT-5 also introduces a new verbosity parameter, allowing users to control the length of outputs (low, medium, or high). It’s OpenAI’s best writing collaborator so far, too, capable of translating ideas into resonant articles with depth and rhythm. For example, when the same prompt was used to generate a poem in both ChatGPT-4o and GPT-5, the latter delivered a version with a stronger emotional arc, a more powerful ending, and striking use of metaphor and imagery. Less Hallucinations, More Reliability A common pain point with earlier GPT models – and AI assistants in general – has been hallucinations. OpenAI has addressed this issue in the latest release. GPT-5 reduces factual errors by 45% compared to GPT-4o and 80% compared to OpenAI o3. Fewer hallucinations mean more reliable outputs, making GPT-5 significantly more suitable for real-world applications. All in all, with OpenAI leading the charge and constantly pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence, we’re witnessing the beginning of a new era in real-world AI applications. In fact, according to a PwC report, AI could add a staggering $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 . Keen to capitalize on this explosive growth? Consider backing high-potential AI tokens. It’s a sector that’s been lighting up the charts in recent days , with tokens like $MAGIC , $SIREN , and $SERV posting gains well above 50%.

In a staff letter released Thursday, Tan wrote that Intel is working with the Trump administration to resolve the matters in question , defending his commitment to the country. He claimed that in his more than 40 years in the industry, he has “always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards.” Tan has invested over $200 million in several Chinese firms Tan’s letter to employees came just hours after President Trump called for his resignation in a Truth Social post. The president did not, however, specify what he thought were Tan’s conflicts of interest, but his criticism came after Senate Intelligence Committee chair Tom Cotton, a Republican, wrote to the Intel board citing worries about the company’s security, integrity, and Tan’s connections to China. His letter outlined much of Tan’s prior investment activity in China and Cadence’s legal issues, and he even questioned whether the CEO had disclosed any remaining holdings to the U.S. government in light of Intel’s sensitive defense contracts. The semiconductor executive has long supported Chinese technology companies, especially Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp ( SMIC ), the nation’s biggest chipmaker. Reports claim that he invested over $200 million in his former capacities between March 2012 and December 2024. Like the NFL and other industries, Walden Capital still works with 20 levels that invest largely in Chinese funds, and at least eight have direct military connections in China. Adding further to the fire, before Intel, Tan was the chief executive of Cadence Design Systems, which earlier this month settled with the U.S. government for $140 million after it violated export rules by providing enterprise chip design software to a Chinese university heavily affiliated with its military. Tan is, however, facing scrutiny for reasons that extend past his ties to China. According to the Wall Street Journal, the company’s board has reportedly halted his recent initiatives to raise new capital and acquire AI businesses, exposing core disagreements about Intel’s future — including the question of exiting manufacturing entirely. Tan cut costs and secured an $8 billion investment for Intel Since Tan took over at Intel, he has introduced broad cost-cutting measures. Last month, he even cautioned that developing the company’s next-generation manufacturing technology could be halted if a large customer is not secured. The company also recently secured $8 billion through the CHIPS Act, the largest grant given to a single firm to boost domestic manufacturing. Intel’s CEO has even affirmed that the board is “fully supportive” of its transformation plans. However, Trump’s intervention further complicates matters for an executive already under pressure from Wall Street and his board. Nonetheless, Tan insists he has called the United States home for over 40 years, and thus cherishes the country. He added that he is profoundly thankful for the opportunities it has provided and deeply values his connection to the company.

For a meme index born from internet culture and irreverent finance, that kind of run reinforces one thing: the 6900 effect is alive and kicking. While traditional markets obsess over earnings calls and GDP prints, meme-led plays are delivering gains that put “serious” assets to shame. Riding this wave is TOKEN6900 ($T6900) – the self-described ‘anti-S&P,’ built on zero utility, zero roadmap, and zero corporate spin. It promises nothing and delivers exactly that. In the upside-down logic of meme finance, that might be the most honest proposition left. And with SPX6900’s surge in full swing, $T6900 could be next in line for the spotlight. SPX6900 Rally & Why It Matters SPX6900 ($SPX) has been on a tear for well over a year. $SPX is up 8.87% in the past week, 23.71% over the last month, and a staggering 10834.57% over the last year. These aren’t the kind of numbers you see in blue-chip equities or even most altcoin rallies. The driver? A flood of retail capital into high-volatility, community-driven plays where memes and market psychology matter more than fundamentals. SPX6900’s performance has proved that meme-led indexes can sustain multi-month momentum when the narrative is strong enough. In the process, ‘6900’ has become a brand in its own right, shorthand for absurdist finance done right. That brand power is exactly what TOKEN6900 is tapping into as it builds its own cult following ahead of launch. TOKEN6900 ($T6900) Overview – The ‘Non-Corrupt Token’ Branding itself as the world’s first Non-Corrupt Token (NCT), TOKEN6900 ($T6900) flips the crypto script, turning everything the industry usually pretends to be on its head. There’s no roadmap, no fake promises, no ‘AI-powered’ whitepaper filler. Just pure satire aimed at the S&P500, SPX6900, and the whole idea of fundamentals. It even improves on SPX6900 with one extra token in supply, making it objectively superior. At $0.006875, the sale has already pulled in over $1.71M, including a $16.3K buy on July 18, 2025. Holders can stake for 36% rewards (ironic for a ‘zero utility’ coin) while the clipart dolphin mascot serves as a tongue-in-cheek rejection of corporate branding. Joining in is simple: head to the official Token6900 presale site , connect your crypto wallet, and buy with $ETH, $USDT, $BNB, or even a card to secure your slice of honest absurdity. Final Verdict: Riding the 6900 Wave with TOKEN6900 Meme coin cycles have a habit of coming back louder, and SPX6900’s latest pump suggests absurdist finance is back in peak demand. TOKEN6900 is perfectly timed for this moment, channelling the same irreverent energy with its unapologetic ‘nothing to offer’ pitch. For traders who get the joke (and want in on the punchline), the presale offers a low entry point before the next price tier kicks in. Still, this is not financial advice. So please do your own research (DYOR): read the presale details, understand the risks, and only put in what you’re prepared to lose.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BNB|ETH,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-08-08 13:35:05

While the broader uptrend remains intact, recent price action reflects uncertainty and tightening range dynamics. With macroeconomic tensions rising and risk sentiment mixed, BTC’s next major move could be triggered by key technical levels. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Bitcoin’s daily structure shows a breakdown and pullback to the ascending channel that’s been respected for months. After the drop from $123K, and the midline of the channel, BTC has finally broken the channel to the downside and is consolidating below it. This is a concerning development, as it might lead to deeper corrections. The price is currently attempting to hold above the 100-day moving average, which is located near the $110K support level. The RSI also sits around 51, signaling a neutral momentum state. Yet, if a bearish shift occurs following a rejection from the channel’s lower boundary, and the $110K level breaks down, the next high-confluence zone lies around the psychological $100K level. This zone also aligns with the key 200-day moving average. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart shows BTC declining inside a descending channel since the price dropped from the $123K level. The cryptocurrency is now trying to break the channel to the upside, as it broke through the $116K short-term resistance. The price is rebounding from the 50% area of the Fibonacci retracement tool, which also adds to the probability of a bullish continuation to begin from this zone. Moreover, the RSI is showing a bullish shift in momentum as it has risen above the 50% level. As a result, if the price holds above the $116K level, it will likely break out of the descending channel and rally toward the $123K all-time high and beyond in the coming weeks. Source: TradingView Onchain Analysis Exchange Whale Ratio The Exchange Whale Ratio is flashing a warning signal. It has been steadily climbing and is now at its highest level since early 2023. Historically, such spikes, especially above 0.5, tend to precede either distribution events or significant profit-taking, as large holders increasingly dominate inflows to exchanges. This rise, combined with the stalled momentum in price, suggests whales may be preparing to offload into strength. While it doesn’t guarantee a reversal, it typically marks local tops or slower price progress until new demand kicks in. Traders should watch closely for on-chain outflows and derivatives positioning to see if the current uptick in whale activity turns into real selling pressure.

According to SMQKE, the escrow mechanism was deliberately constructed to protect the value of XRP by avoiding sudden supply shocks that could impact the market negatively. The post emphasized that the system was “explicitly designed to prevent large XRP releases that could trigger steep price declines,” referring to language used in Ripple’s 2017 announcement and its subsequent explanatory materials. The source document cited by SMQKE highlights that Ripple Labs committed in May 2017 to lock up 55 billion XRP in a cryptographically-secured escrow account using smart contracts. RIPPLE’S ESCROW WAS CREATED TO PROTECT THE PRICE OF XRP The escrow system was explicitly designed to prevent large XRP releases that could trigger steep price declines and to ensure a steady and measured supply over time. “This mechanism is intended to ensure that a large… pic.twitter.com/4repd8Qbzi — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 7, 2025 These contracts enforce a fixed schedule release of a billion XRP per month in 55 months. The release cycle began in January 2018, and any XRP not used in a given month is returned to escrow under a new contract, which expires 55 months from its reentry date. Ripple explicitly stated that the goal was to remove uncertainty surrounding the token’s future supply. According to the document, “This mechanism is intended to ensure that a large number of XRP will not enter the market at one time and lead to a substantial reduction in the price of XRP.” SMQKE’s tweet underscores this intention, drawing attention to the safeguards Ripple implemented to create a predictable release cadence and reduce potential volatility in XRP’s price. Smart Contracts Restrict Immediate Access to XRP Holdings Another key point raised by SMQKE was that Ripple does not have unrestricted access to the escrowed XRP. The XRP is cryptographically locked and released solely through preprogrammed monthly contracts. This means that Ripple cannot arbitrarily access or sell the tokens outside the terms dictated by the smart contracts. The same document confirms this restriction, emphasizing that Ripple’s access to escrowed XRP is both time-bound and automated through code-based rules on the XRP Ledger. A supplementary chart from SBI Group, attached in the tweet, further supports the details. As of July 20, 2025, nearly 40% of XRP’s total supply remains under escrow, with Ripple not free to sell it off at will. The chart breaks down the distribution of XRP, noting that approximately 35.9 billion XRP are still under escrow , while 4.85 billion XRP are held by Ripple outside circulation. The data also notes that about 59.24 billion XRP are circulating in the market, with around 10 million XRP already burned through transaction fees. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ongoing Reentry of Unused XRP into the Escrow Cycle The structure also provides that unused XRP at the end of each monthly release window is reinserted into the escrow system. Each time this happens, the escrow resets with a new expiration date 55 months from the reinsertion. This rolling mechanism maintains a balance between potential liquidity and market stability. SMQKE included this detail in their commentary, stating that “Ripple is also not free to sell the escrowed XRP at will,” reinforcing the idea that even after release, any unused XRP is not immediately available for market activity. Institutional Usage: A Key Element of Distribution Strategy The original 2017 documentation also pointed out that Ripple expected to use XRP to incentivize market makers and offer tighter spreads between currency pairs in exchange for XRP, targeting institutional investors. This highlights a broader vision for XRP’s role in financial infrastructure, beyond mere speculative trading. SMQKE concluded their post by labeling the escrow system as “documented,” affirming the verifiability of the information and encouraging observers to review the original material. The emphasis on documentation and cryptographic restrictions aligns with Ripple’s long-standing message of transparency and predictability in XRP’s market behavior.

Often described as an “Ethereum killer” for its advanced smart contract capabilities, SUI is now trading at $3.81 – just 29% below its all-time high of $5.35 set in January. Not only has SUI outpaced Bitcoin and Ethereum in the market’s latest rally, but it’s also one of the top-performing tokens of the past year, soaring 490% since August 8, 2024. This surge has pushed its market cap to nearly $13.4 billion, putting it close to flipping Stellar (XLM) and Hyperliquid (HYPE). Sui Price Prediction: $10 Target in Play as Technical Breakout Looms SUI is currently trading at $3.80 and appears to be nearing the apex of a symmetrical expanding triangle – a pattern that often precedes a sharp directional move. Support and resistance levels are converging, with the chart suggesting two possible outcomes. The bullish scenario shows a breakout toward the previous high of $5.36, followed by a potential run toward the $10 mark , driven by rising momentum and continued ecosystem growth. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is sitting at 56.62 , still below overbought territory but trending higher, indicating renewed buying interest. The MACD histogram has also flipped green, further strengthening the short-term bullish case. If SUI fails to hold current levels, support may be found around $3.20 and, if broken, down near $1.80 – though this seems less likely in the current market context, especially with new adoption catalysts such as AMINA’s integration and increased on-chain stablecoin activity. Overall, momentum is building, and the chart suggests that Sui’s price could be preparing for a breakout toward $10 in the coming weeks . Snorter ($SNORT): Meme Token Presale with Built-In Trading Features Gains Traction Sui Network is already showing strong growth, and while it has a large market cap, it still hasn’t broken into the top ten. If it continues to evolve faster than bigger names like Ethereum or Solana, it could easily rally higher from here. But if you’re looking for even bigger potential, the kind of returns that turn small bets into serious wins, many investors are now focusing on early-stage crypto presales. One project gaining momentum is Snorter ($SNORT) , a new meme coin with real utility. It’s built on Solana and connects directly to Telegram, letting users view live price data, trade tokens, and track market moves without leaving the chat. Snorter also helps protect investors with features like rug-pull detection (which flags suspicious projects), copy trading (which mirrors top-performing wallets), and automated buying and selling for faster execution. Investor interest is picking up quickly, with over $2.8 million already raised in Snorter’s presale. Early buyers can stake their tokens for up to 152% APY , though these high rewards will gradually drop as more people join the network. The current presale price is $0.1007 , with small increases scheduled at each stage. This gives early participants the best value and higher potential returns. By combining meme coin energy with real trading features, Snorter appeals to both seasoned meme coin fans and newcomers looking for smarter tools to navigate a fast-moving market. To invest early in the project, you can visit the official Snorter website and use crypto or a bank card to complete the transaction in seconds.

Koi Security reported that the group launched 150 weaponized Firefox extensions in addition to 500 malicious executables. The operation used fake wallet extensions, phishing websites, and malware to target crypto users across multiple platforms. Firefox extension fraud targets popular crypto wallets The GreedyBear scam launched over 150 malicious extensions on the Firefox store targeting cryptocurrency users. The malicious extensions impersonate popular wallets like MetaMask , TronLink, Exodus, and Rabby Wallet. The extensions all copy legitimate wallet interfaces to hijack user credentials when users try to log in. The hackers initially produce genuine-looking extensions like link sanitizers and YouTube downloaders with limited functionality. With a lineup of 5-7 generic utilities with fresh publisher names, they typically establish credibility in the long term. Fake Firefox extension: Source: Koi Security Once the criminals have built trust through genuine positive reviews, they empty out these extensions totally. They alter names, icons, and inject harmful code but retain the original positive review history. This method enables harmful extensions to look trustworthy to new users surfing the marketplace. The extensions work as instruments to obtain wallet credentials from input fields in their pop-up windows. The pilfered information is transmitted to remote servers controlled by the criminal group for exploitation in due course. Extensions also transmit victim IP addresses on startup for tracking. This action is a follow-up to previous Foxy Wallet activity that identified 40 malicious extensions. The scope has now increased more than twice from the initial case. User reports confirm victims lost significant cryptocurrency value by using these fake wallet extensions over different intervals. Multi-platform attack combines malware and scam websites GreedyBear scam operates nearly 500 malicious Windows executables alongside their browser extension campaign. These programs spread through Russian websites that distribute cracked and pirated software to unsuspecting users. The malware collection spans multiple threat categories for maximum damage potential. Credential stealers like LummaStealer target crypto wallet information stored on victim computers. Ransomware variants encrypt user files and demand cryptocurrency payments for decryption keys. Generic trojans provide backdoor access for additional payload delivery when needed. The group also maintains an infrastructure of impersonator crypto service sites for data theft. The scam sites are legitimate-looking crypto services and are not typical phishing pages. Hardware wallets with the Jupiter brand also contain mockups of an interface that are falsified to trick potential purchasers into revealing payment details. Fake wallet repair site: Source: Koi Security Another example cited in the report was wallet repair websites that claim to repair damaged Trezor products for frustrated customers. The impersonator websites harvest wallet recovery words and private keys while posing as technical support. Some domains are active while others are dormant, awaiting targeted attacks in the future. The variety of attack methods shows that the GreedyBear scam operates a broad distribution pipeline rather than focusing on a single technique. This diversified approach allows the group to shift tactics based on what works best. The reuse of infrastructure across different malware families confirms centralized coordination behind all campaign components. Centralized server controls global theft operations GreedyBear operates their entire criminal enterprise through a single IP address at 185.208.156.66. Almost all domains used across extensions, malware payloads, and phishing sites connect to this central server. This hub handles command-and-control communications, credential collection, ransomware coordination, and scam website hosting. The centralized infrastructure allows attackers to streamline operations across multiple attack channels efficiently. Data from browser extensions, malware infections, and website victims all flows to the same collection point. This approach simplifies management while providing comprehensive intelligence on target victims. Koi Security discovered the group has already begun expanding beyond Firefox browsers. A malicious Chrome extension called Filecoin Wallet used identical credential theft methods months ago. This Chrome extension communicated with domains hosted on the same 185.208.156.66 server infrastructure. The connection confirms GreedyBear is testing operations across different browser ecosystems. Chrome, Edge, and other browsers will likely face similar extension campaigns in the coming months. The group’s willingness to experiment across platforms shows its commitment to scaling operations. AI tools have helped accelerate the campaign’s growth and complexity according to code analysis. Generated artifacts in the malware suggest artificial intelligence assists with payload creation and scaling. This technology allows faster development cycles and better evasion of security detection systems across different platforms. Get seen where it counts.

The company’s leadership combines financial market strategy and mining industry expertise. Henry McPhee, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, oversees the platform’s macro-financial direction, while Morgan Lekstrom, Executive Chairman and Co-Founder, brings more than two decades of international mining experience. Together, their combined backgrounds in Wall Street strategy, global mining operations, and blockchain infrastructure provide Streamex with a foundation for advancing its gold-tokenization initiative. Henry McPhee – The Strategist Behind the Vision McPhee has established a reputation for anticipating macroeconomic turning points and building compliant, investor-ready platforms to address them. Under his leadership, Streamex has: Secured over $1.1 billion in financing commitments to build its gold-backed digital currency platform. Executed a strategic merger with BioSig Technologies, shifting the NASDAQ-listed company from biotech to digital asset infrastructure. Acquired a FINRA- and SEC-registered broker-dealer to ensure full regulatory compliance for issuance, trading, and custody of tokenized assets. “Henry is building the foundation for a parallel financial system,” noted one market analyst. “It’s gold’s return to center stage, but in a way that will integrate seamlessly into both existing financial networks and emerging digital economies.” Morgan Lekstrom – Mining Expertise Driving Digital Gold Mr. Lekstrom brings over 20 years of mining industry experience spanning executive leadership, project development, operations, and engineering. He has a proven track record of delivering growth and transformation, most recently building NexGold Mining Corp. into a near-term Canadian gold producer with a clear path to constructing two new Canadian gold mines.

Mr. Lekstrom’s breadth of experience across continents and mining methods ensures Streamex’s gold-backed tokens are supported by robust sourcing, operational integrity, and industry best practices. Advancing a New Monetary Instrument Streamex’s gold-tokenization platform is designed to offer a programmable, liquid, and borderless store of value, backed by audited, vault-held physical gold. Tokens are fractionalized, instantly transferable, and built to integrate seamlessly with both decentralized finance (DeFi) networks and traditional financial markets. “This is more than a technology initiative, it is a shift in how gold can participate in global capital flows,” said Henry McPhee, Co-Founder and CEO of Streamex. “Morgan’s depth of mining expertise strengthens our ability to connect physical reserves with the transparency, efficiency, and accessibility of blockchain technology.” By securing a NASDAQ listing, Streamex operates under established U.S. regulatory oversight, positioning itself uniquely among tokenization initiatives. This structure provides institutional investors with a compliant pathway to engage in real-world asset tokenization, while reinforcing market confidence. Why the Timing Matters Global macroeconomic conditions, marked by inflationary pressures, currency volatility, and increasing demand for stable, asset-backed digital instruments, create a fertile environment for gold-based tokenization. Streamex’s model addresses these conditions by delivering a compliant, scalable bridge between commodity markets and the blockchain economy.

This positive start to the day is more than just numbers; it often reflects a broader shift in investor confidence and expectations for the economy. Understanding Today’s Strong Market Open Today’s market open saw significant gains across major indices. The S&P500 climbed by 0.29%, while the NASDAQ, known for its tech-heavy listings, surged by 0.36%. Not to be outdone, the Dow Jones Industrial Average also posted a respectable gain of 0.17%. S&P500: +0.29% NASDAQ: +0.36% Dow: +0.17% These upward movements are crucial because they represent how investors are feeling about the future. When these key indices rise, it often suggests that market participants anticipate continued economic growth or positive corporate earnings. Why Does Investor Sentiment Matter So Much? You might wonder why a seemingly small percentage change in the U.S. stock markets gets so much attention. The answer lies in investor sentiment . This collective mood of market participants plays a massive role in how assets are valued and how capital flows. Positive sentiment can create a virtuous cycle: when investors feel good, they are more likely to buy, which pushes prices higher. This, in turn, can attract even more buyers. Conversely, negative sentiment can lead to selling pressure and market downturns. Today’s strong opening indicates a prevailing sense of optimism. Connecting the Dots: Economic Indicators and Market Performance The performance of the U.S. stock markets often acts as a barometer for underlying economic indicators . A sustained uptrend can signal robust corporate earnings, low unemployment, and overall economic stability. Investors pay close attention to these broader signals. For example, positive manufacturing data, strong jobs reports, or favorable inflation figures can all contribute to a buoyant market open. These economic health checks provide context for the daily movements we observe. Understanding these connections helps us interpret market signals more effectively. Navigating Current Market Performance and Its Broader Impact What does this positive market performance mean for you, especially if you’re interested in other asset classes like cryptocurrencies? While direct correlations are complex, a strong traditional market can foster a risk-on environment. When investors feel confident in established markets, they might be more willing to explore other investment opportunities. It is important to remember that markets are dynamic. Today’s gains could be influenced by various factors, including corporate news, geopolitical events, or shifts in monetary policy expectations. Staying informed is key to making sound decisions. Today’s higher open in the U.S. stock markets is a significant development, reflecting a positive shift in investor sentiment . This strong start, driven by various positive economic indicators , paints a hopeful picture for overall market performance . While the future remains uncertain, such positive signals often provide a foundation for broader market confidence. It’s a reminder that understanding these movements can offer valuable insights into the larger financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when U.S. stock markets open higher? When U.S. stock markets open higher, it means that the major stock indices (like the S&P500, NASDAQ, and Dow) have started the trading day with an increase in their value compared to the previous day’s closing price. This often indicates positive investor sentiment and expectations for the economy. Q2: How does investor sentiment influence market performance? Investor sentiment significantly influences market performance by driving buying and selling decisions. Positive sentiment can lead to increased demand for stocks, pushing prices up, while negative sentiment can cause selling pressure and market declines. It’s a key psychological factor in market movements. Q3: Are these gains sustainable for the U.S. stock markets? Whether gains are sustainable depends on various factors, including ongoing economic data, corporate earnings, geopolitical stability, and monetary policy decisions. While today’s open is positive, market trends can change rapidly based on new information. Q4: How do economic indicators relate to stock market movements? Economic indicators, such as GDP growth, inflation rates, employment figures, and consumer confidence, provide insights into the health of the economy. Strong positive indicators often lead to higher stock market performance as they suggest a favorable environment for corporate profits. Q5: Does a strong U.S. stock market open impact cryptocurrency markets? While not a direct one-to-one correlation, a strong U.S. stock market open can sometimes contribute to a broader ‘risk-on’ environment. This means investors might feel more confident taking on risk in other asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, although crypto markets have their own unique drivers.

(Ethereum Price Analysis)",https://cryptopotato.com/eth-bulls-look-to-push-above-4k-but-is-the-rally-sustainable-ethereum-price-analysis/,"Ethereum’s price has been making higher highs and lows for a while now, climbing toward the key $4,000 mark. While both technical methods and sentiment metrics point to more upside, caution is advised, as the market might be in for a pullback soon. Ethereum Price Analysis: Technicals By Shayan The Daily Chart The daily chart demonstrates ETH’s upward path inside a large ascending channel. This uptrend began in the middle of April, and the price has broken multiple resistance levels to the upside. Both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages are also located below the price now, with the 100-day MA having an upward slope following a bullish crossover earlier. As things stand, the market is very likely to push beyond the high of $4,107 and even toward a new all-time high in the coming months, if the channel is broken to the upside. On the other hand, however, a rejection from the higher trendline of the channel could push the price back toward the $3,200 area, which would be the deciding point for whether a short-term correction or a full-on reversal is on the table. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart shows an interesting reaccumulation phase going on, which mostly occurs after a rally. The price has been consolidating between the $3,500 and $3,800 levels, with a fake breakout and liquidity sweep occurring below the $3,500 zone. Currently, the price is on the verge of breaking above the $3,900 high, and in case of an impulsive follow-up, the market would likely begin a new aggressive rally as ETH hunts for a new all-time high. The RSI is also around 67, confirming bullish momentum, but also hinting at a potential overbought condition occurring soon. Yet, it will not mean that the market will reverse lower, at least not before a bearish divergence occurs. Source: TradingView Sentiment Analysis Coinbase Premium Index The Coinbase Premium Index is a metric that measures the difference between Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase and that of Binance. As the chart shows, the index has been mostly printing positive values since the beginning of the current rally in April. This indicates that there is considerable demand from American Investors, compared to other countries. Looking to the past, the Coinbase Premium Index demonstrates a positive correlation with price action, as positive values have led to price rallies more often than not. Therefore, as the current situation suggests, the probability of further bullish price movement is higher than a reversal, and market sentiment supports the upward price action seen on technical charts.

The current trading range stands between $0.17 and $0.25, with primary resistance at $0.30 and nearby support at $0.13. A higher barrier exists at $0.39, while a secondary support is at $0.04. Indicator readings offer mixed insights: the Awesome Oscillator hovers near -0.008, and the momentum indicator signals a modest positive swing, with an RSI close to 58. This mix suggests both bulls and bears hold positions, resulting in an environment without a fully clear trend. Traders might consider short-term positions within the $0.13 to $0.30 range, using lower support for entries and upper resistance as profit targets. Cronos Surge: One Month and Six Month Gains Signal Bullish Momentum Cronos price jumped by 79.18% over the last month and climbed 53.18% in the past six months while showing a slight one-week pullback of 1.50%. Historical performance reflects a period of strong gains and steady accumulation, underscoring growing investor interest and an improving market stance. Recent price increases hint at a renewed appetite among traders as the coin gradually recovers from minor short-term setbacks. The coin now trades within a price range of $0.0956 to $0.1663 with a clear resistance approaching $0.19 and a second resistance around $0.26. A reliable support is present at $0.05, creating a defined bracket for current actions. The RSI value near 65 indicates that buyer strength remains significant yet cautious. The market does not display a clear trend in the immediate term, but the recent month’s surge suggests underlying bullish momentum. A trading approach that watches for price stabilization near the $0.05 support could help confirm entry points. SPX6900 Sees Bullish Momentum from Recent Gains Last month, SPX6900 experienced a remarkable surge of 32.74%, while a half-year view reveals an impressive increase of 180.51%. The coin's price behavior has shown significant volatility but retains a clear upward trend, reflecting growing market interest. The price has oscillated between $1.03 and $2.25, establishing a solid mid-range that has attracted more traders and investors. This consistent growth has bolstered confidence in the asset, setting a promising foundation for future movements. Currently, SPX6900 is maintaining key support at $0.44 and facing resistance near $2.89, with an additional resistance level at $4.10. Price movements remain confined within this range, allowing for potential range-bound trading strategies. The RSI sits at 49.18, suggesting a neutral market, while the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator display bearish signals. Both bulls and bears are competing for dominance, providing opportunities for buying near support and selling near resistance. The fluctuating nature of the coin encourages traders to watch for strength at resistance levels. Conclusion POL , CRO , and SPX are showing strong performance today. Their growth can be attributed to recent updates and market interest. POL's unique features continue to attract attention. CRO benefits from strategic partnerships and expanding use. SPX is seeing gains due to its innovative solutions. Investors are considering these coins for their potential and current trajectory. The market dynamics suggest positive momentum for these cryptocurrencies. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This isn’t just another date on the calendar; it’s a critical moment offering deep insights into the immediate future of BTC expiry and broader market expectations. While some might dream of parabolic price surges, current data suggests a more grounded reality. Understanding the Massive BTC Expiry Event What exactly is this massive BTC expiry event? It refers to the date when a large volume of Bitcoin options contracts expire. On this date, traders must either exercise their right to buy or sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price, or let their contracts lapse. According to Cointelegraph, citing data from crypto analytics platform Laevitas, a staggering $8.8 billion in contracts is set to expire. Interestingly, over $1 billion of these contracts would only activate if Bitcoin somehow hit $200,000. Why the $200K Target Seems Distant for Bitcoin Options Despite the eye-popping $1 billion tied to the $200,000 strike price, Bitcoin options traders are not anticipating such a dramatic 72% rally. The open interest, which measures the total number of outstanding options contracts, shows a bullish skew: $6.45 billion in call options (bets on price increase) versus $2.36 billion in put options (bets on price decrease). However, this bullish skew can be misleading. Many traders utilize far-out-of-the-money (OTM) calls as part of low-risk, leveraged crypto trading strategies . These options are relatively inexpensive and offer significant upside if a massive rally does occur, without risking much capital if it doesn’t. It’s more of a long-shot lottery ticket than a firm prediction of a $200,000 Bitcoin price. Navigating Downside Risks: What Derivatives Market Data Shows While the focus is often on upside potential, the derivatives market also reveals significant hedging against potential price drops. Approximately $900 million in put options are concentrated in the $50,000 to $80,000 range. This indicates that many traders are actively protecting their portfolios against a downside move, even as they hold speculative call options. The presence of substantial put options suggests a pragmatic view among experienced traders. They understand that while bullish potential exists, prudent risk management is essential. These downside hedges are a clear signal that a significant portion of the market remains cautious, preparing for various outcomes rather than just the most optimistic ones. Decoding Overall Market Sentiment from Options Data So, what does all this complex options data tell us about the overall market sentiment ? It paints a picture of cautious optimism, rather than unbridled euphoria. Traders are willing to place small, speculative bets on extreme upside, but they are also diligently protecting against significant downturns. This measured approach suggests a mature market that is learning from past cycles. The upcoming BTC expiry will likely resolve without a massive price shock in either direction, unless unforeseen macroeconomic events or major market catalysts emerge. The options market is currently priced for stability within a broad range, reflecting a nuanced outlook on Bitcoin’s immediate future. The approaching $8.8 billion Bitcoin options expiry is a fascinating window into the collective mindset of the crypto trading community. While the dream of a $200,000 Bitcoin by year-end captures headlines, the reality within the derivatives market points to strategic, risk-managed positions. Traders are balancing speculative upside bets with prudent downside hedges. This sophisticated approach suggests a maturing market that values stability and careful planning over pure speculation. As December 26 approaches, the focus remains on navigating the present market dynamics rather than chasing improbable targets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin options expiry? It’s the date when Bitcoin options contracts expire, requiring traders to decide whether to exercise their right to buy or sell Bitcoin at a set price, or let the contract lapse. Why aren’t traders expecting a $200K Bitcoin rally despite high open interest? Much of the high open interest at far-out-of-the-money (OTM) strike prices represents low-cost, leveraged speculative bets rather than firm predictions of such extreme price movements. What are “far-out-of-the-money” calls? These are call options with a strike price significantly higher than the current market price. They are cheap to acquire and offer high returns if the price skyrockets, but are likely to expire worthless if it doesn’t. What do the $50K-$80K put options signify? These put options indicate that many traders are hedging against potential downside price movements in Bitcoin, protecting their portfolios in case of a significant drop. How does options data reflect overall market sentiment? Options data, by showing the balance between calls and puts across different strike prices, provides insights into traders’ collective expectations for both upside potential and downside risk, indicating cautious optimism or bearish outlooks.

In a statement, the Chicago-based company says that it has entered into a securities purchase agreement with a US-based institutional investor.

The terms of the facility require Cosmos Health to allocate at least 72.5% of the net proceeds from each tranche for building its crypto treasury reserve. The rest will be used for working capital and growth initiatives. The firm says it is stocking up ETH to bring more value to its long-term shareholders. The digital asset trust company BitGo will provide the institutional infrastructure to custody and stake the crypto assets. Says Cosmos Health CEO Greg Siokas, “This financing marks a strategic milestone for Cosmos Health, offering shareholders direct exposure to ETH, currently one of the most widely adopted digital assets in the world. We are confident that the size and flexibility of this facility should position us to deliver long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders.” The company’s share closed at $1.05, down by 8.7% from the previous closing price of $1.15.

Traditional mining is often accompanied by high initial investments, complex equipment maintenance, and technical barriers, making it difficult for the general public to participate. To address this pain point, BAY Miner has innovatively launched a global mobile cloud mining solution, allowing users to easily and securely mine mainstream digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) using only a mobile phone, opening up a new model for crypto passive income. How does BAY Miner’s mobile cloud mining platform ensure stable computing power and profitability? BAY Miner’s mobile cloud mining platform ensures stable computing power and consistent returns through the following methods: High-Performance Cloud Computing and Intelligent Scheduling The platform utilizes globally distributed data centers and high-performance cloud computing infrastructure.

Security and Compliance Guarantees to Reduce Risk BAY Miner has passed international security and compliance audits. With multiple security features (such as McAfee and Cloudflare protection), 24/7 system monitoring, and risk control measures, we ensure the security of user funds, data, and contracts, effectively mitigating the risk of computing power fluctuations and returns caused by hacker attacks or internal errors. Environmental Protection and Global Deployment Enhance Sustainability Our data centers utilize extensive renewable green energy, making the platform’s overall operating costs and energy consumption more manageable, further ensuring a stable supply of computing power and business continuity. Flexible Contract Selection and Income Methods Users can flexibly choose from a variety of mining contracts based on their budget, allowing participation of all sizes with a low barrier to entry. The platform supports daily settlement, reinvestment, and withdrawal of earnings, ensuring consistent and flexible returns for all users. Prudent Earnings Management and Risk Disclosures BAY Miner promises stable computing power and earnings within contracts, but earnings are subject to factors such as mining difficulty and market price.

49750301,551404,1754661651,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49750301.jpeg,Here’s Why The Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Are Rallying Today,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-prices/,"The Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are rallying today, recording notable gains in the process. This follows Donald Trump’s signing of two executive orders that could significantly boost the crypto industry. Why The Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices Are Rallying Today The Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are up today, with gains of almost 2% and 6%, respectively. This has come on the back of Trump’s signing of an executive order that enables 401(K)s to invest in cryptocurrencies as an alternative asset class. These 401(K)s are retirement savings accounts and are a $12 trillion market. This executive order opens the crypto industry to a massive market, in which over 90 million Americans participate. This represents a huge boost for the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices, which could witness new liquidity from these 401(K)s. Market expert Tom Dunleavy described the retirement savings market news as “way way” bigger news than the crypto ETFs . He noted that every two weeks, Americans, through these 401(K)s, route a portion of their paychecks into purchasing a mixture of stocks and bonds. He further remarked that this has been a huge driver of the equity market run and resilience over the past 20 years. These retirement accounts have acted as a constant background bid for these assets and could now have the same impact on crypto assets, which is bullish for the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. Dunleavy further explained that a 1% portfolio allocation to crypto from these 401(K)s brings $120 billion in new flows, 3% allocation brings $360 billion in new flows. Meanwhile, a 5% allocation brings about $600 billion in new flows. He added that these aren’t one-time flows, since these Americans will keep buying once they set how much they want to allocate to crypto . A positive is the fact that these accounts add significant demand for Bitcoin and Ethereum without sell pressure like the ETFs, which sometimes record massive outflows . As such, implications of the 401(K)s for crypto have sparked a bullish sentiment towards the BTC and ETH prices. Trump Also Signs Order Ending Operation Chokepoint Trump also signed an executive order that guarantees fair banking for all Americans, including those in the crypto industry. This ends Operation Chokepoint , which is bullish for the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices and has contributed to the rally today. The document referenced Operation Chokepoint and how it was a systematic means by which Federal regulators pushed banks to minimize their involvement with individuals and companies disfavored by regulators. The executive order ensures that investors can easily use their bank accounts as an on-ramp to access crypto assets. It also enables off-ramp, allowing these investors to convert their crypto to fiat easily. Most importantly, it could drive more liquidity into the market since more investors will be able to invest in Bitcoin , Ethereum, and other crypto assets easily.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Donald Trump|Dunleavy|ETH|Ethereum|Operation Chokepoint,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-08 14:00:51

This development has raised the possibility of the flagship crypto facing another sell-off from this category of holders, who may be unable to hold during this period of sideways action. 70% of Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Are in Profit A Glassnode report revealed that 70% of the Bitcoin short-term holders’ supply is in profit despite the recent Bitcoin price pull-back. The platform noted that the deeper the correction, the more their supply is likely to fall into loss, a development which could affect these holders’ confidence. Related Reading: Pundit Reveals When To Take Profit From Bitcoin Ahead Of Parabolic Rally The report further stated that, considering that the Bitcoin price is currently trading within a relatively thin air-gap, the sell pressure is likely to come from late-stage profit-taking, should this happen. For now, the sell pressure from these Bitcoin short-term holders looks to be relatively low. Glassnode pointed out the percentage of spent volume originating from Bitcoin short-term holders who were in profit to assess how much this corrective phase has influenced these investors. This metric measures the number of recently acquired coins that are taking profit. The platform noted that the proportion of short-term holders spent coins taking profit has cooled off, currently at 45%, which is a neutral position. Glassnode stated that this suggests that the market is in a relatively balanced position, calming fears about a potential sell-off from Bitcoin short-term holders. Meanwhile, the platform also alluded to the Bitcoin ETFs, which also create sell-side pressure for the flagship crypto. These ETFs recorded a net outflow of 1,500 BTC on August 5, the largest wave of sell-side pressure since April 2025. The report noted that outflows from the Bitcoin ETFs have been relatively brief events, with only a few instances of an extended streak of daily outflows, which create sustained sell-side pressure. Glassnode believes that keeping an eye on the ETF flows will help to identify whether this latest outflow is just a repeat of the short-lived trend or a shift in investors’ sentiment. $116,900 Is The Resistance Level BTC Needs To Break Above Glassnode indicated that the Bitcoin price needs to break above the $116,900 level decisively to build any momentum for the next leg up. This level serves as the cost basis of local top buyers who bought BTC over the last month. The platform claimed that a sustained price move above this level would signal that the demand side is regaining control. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $100,000 Or Rally To $122,000? Analyst Shows Game Plan For BTC Furthermore, it also offers early confirmation that the Bitcoin price has found reliable support and could continue its move to the upside. On the other hand, if BTC remains below this level for a longer period, Glassnode remarked that it increases the risk of a deeper correction. Bitcoin could drop toward the lower bound of the air gap near $110,000.

WoofSwap and others question SHIB’s election plan, citing leadership concerns and missed promises. Voting process for SHIB’s interim president kicks off as calls for decentralization grow louder. Disputes Surface Over Shiba Inu Leadership Shiba Inu is facing pushback from its own ecosystem. Several projects, including WoofSwap, have raised concerns about the team’s recent move to hold elections for an interim president. Some say the timing feels off, calling it a “distraction” and describing it as poor leadership. I am observing the recent activities for $SHIB , more especially on governance move. As the guardian of Ryoshi’s vision, here’s some of the concerns: • Projects like #WoofSwap and others have denounced Kusama’s decision to hold elections, labeling it a distraction from more… — Shiba Inu (@ShibainuCoin) August 8, 2025 Another issue raised relates to the project’s foundation having veto power. That has led some community members to question how decentralized the governance really is. Moreover, others are pointing to missed goals, such as adding 100 validators or growing to a billion users. There’s also talk that recent ventures like SHY and POE might benefit specific individuals more than the wider community. Election Plan Moves Forward Earlier this month, Shiba Inu marked its fifth year. As part of that milestone, lead developer Shytoshi Kusama introduced a new voting process to select an interim president. The plan involves three rounds: open nominations, public debates, and final voting. “The first allows for anyone to be nominated, while the top 10 move onto the debate phase,” the post explained. Debates will take place live or be shared across platforms. A week later, the community will vote again to choose from the final three candidates. SHIB Price Sees Small Lift SHIB price was trading at $0.00001289 at press time, up 4% over the last 24 hours and 6% over the past week. The volume in that time reached around $313 million. The move follows some positive technical signs spotted by traders. One of those is a divergence pattern shared by crypto analyst Javon Marks. He pointed to a bullish setup on the daily chart, where the price made lower lows, but the MACD formed higher lows, a common early signal of a possible trend change. $SHIB still fresh off of a divergence that was confirmed earlier this year and prices may only be preparing for a run in result of this! With that divergence, prices of Shiba could climb over 156% to reach the $0.000032 levels and that may only be the start of a larger reversal. https://t.co/kAE7699tuD pic.twitter.com/uooG0YXwDW — JAVON MARKS (@JavonTM1) August 6, 2025 Marks believes this pattern could lead to a strong rally. “SHIB is still fresh off of a divergence,” he said, adding that the price could climb as much as 156% if momentum builds. His chart shows a possible move toward the $0.000032 level. Notably, that projection assumes the reversal continues and that the current structure stays in place. While governance debates continue, the chart setup is drawing attention from traders waiting for confirmation of a larger shift.

Accelerate, a prominent Solana treasury firm led by Joe McCann, recently faced an unexpected hurdle. News broke that its planned SPAC deal, which aimed to take the company public, has unfortunately been canceled. This surprising turn of events leaves many wondering about the implications for Accelerate and the broader landscape of crypto SPACs . What Happened with the Accelerate SPAC Deal? Sources cited by Blockworks confirm that the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal involving Accelerate has fallen through. This deal was intended to be a significant step for the firm, which focuses on digital asset treasury management within the Solana ecosystem. While the exact reasons for the collapse remain unclear, this cancellation marks a considerable setback for Accelerate’s public market ambitions. The firm, under the leadership of Joe McCann, had reportedly sought to raise a substantial sum, up to $1.5 billion, through this public offering. Such a move would have provided significant capital for expansion and further development of its services. The sudden halt in proceedings raises questions about market conditions, investor confidence, or internal factors that might have contributed to this outcome. The Broader Impact on Crypto SPACs and Solana Treasury Management The cancellation of the Accelerate SPAC deal is not an isolated incident in the crypto space. SPACs, once a popular route for companies to go public, have faced increasing scrutiny and challenges in recent times. This particular event highlights the difficulties even established firms like Accelerate can encounter when navigating traditional financial markets with novel crypto-focused business models. For the Solana ecosystem, Accelerate plays a crucial role as a Solana treasury firm . Its focus on managing digital assets for entities within the Solana network is vital for stability and growth. A strong treasury firm helps optimize capital, manage risks, and facilitate operations for projects built on Solana. Therefore, any uncertainty surrounding Accelerate could ripple through the ecosystem, prompting a closer look at how other Solana-based projects manage their finances. Moreover, this news follows earlier reports concerning Joe McCann’s hedge fund, Asymmetric. It was reported that Asymmetric has experienced significant losses, down nearly 80% this year. While separate entities, the performance of McCann’s other ventures could potentially influence perceptions or broader investor sentiment around his leadership and the projects he is involved with, including Accelerate. What’s Next for Accelerate and Joe McCann? With the SPAC deal off the table, Accelerate will undoubtedly need to explore alternative options for its future growth and funding. This could involve seeking private investment rounds, exploring other avenues for capital injection, or even reassessing its strategic direction. The firm’s core mission as a Solana treasury firm remains critical, and finding stable footing is paramount. The challenges faced by Accelerate and Joe McCann reflect a broader trend in the digital asset market. The current bear market conditions, coupled with tighter regulatory scrutiny and a more cautious investor landscape, make fundraising and expansion particularly difficult. Companies must demonstrate robust business models and clear pathways to profitability to attract and retain capital. Key Considerations for Accelerate: Private Funding: Seeking venture capital or strategic private investors. Operational Efficiency: Focusing on core services and optimizing current operations. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborating with other established firms in the Solana ecosystem or wider crypto space. The situation with the Accelerate SPAC deal serves as a potent reminder of the complexities involved in bridging the gap between the traditional finance world and the fast-evolving cryptocurrency industry. While the immediate future for Accelerate may involve a pivot, its underlying role in the Solana ecosystem remains significant. In conclusion, the cancellation of Accelerate’s SPAC deal is a notable event in the crypto finance world. It underscores the ongoing challenges faced by firms seeking public listings in volatile markets and highlights the importance of robust financial management, especially for a key Solana treasury firm like Accelerate. The crypto community will be watching closely to see how Accelerate, under Joe McCann’s leadership, navigates this setback and charts its course forward. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a SPAC deal in the crypto context? A: A Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) is a shell company created to raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO) with the purpose of acquiring an existing private company, thereby taking it public without going through the traditional IPO process. In crypto, it means a crypto-focused company goes public via a SPAC. Q2: Who is Joe McCann? A: Joe McCann is a prominent figure in the digital asset space, known for leading Accelerate, a Solana-focused digital asset treasury firm, and also for his involvement with the crypto hedge fund Asymmetric. Q3: What does a Solana treasury firm do? A: A Solana treasury firm manages digital assets, funds, and financial operations for projects, protocols, and entities operating within the Solana blockchain ecosystem. Their goal is to optimize capital, manage risk, and support the growth of Solana-based ventures. Q4: Why did the Accelerate SPAC deal fall through? A: The exact reason for the cancellation of the Accelerate SPAC deal remains unclear, as sources cited by Blockworks did not specify. It could be due to market conditions, investor confidence issues, or other internal factors. Q5: What are the potential alternatives for Accelerate after the canceled deal? A: Accelerate may explore alternative funding options such as private investment rounds (e.g., venture capital), strategic partnerships, or even re-evaluating its long-term growth strategy to adapt to current market conditions. Q6: How does this affect the Solana ecosystem? A: As a key Solana treasury firm, Accelerate’s situation could introduce some uncertainty. However, the Solana ecosystem is robust, and other firms also provide treasury services. This event highlights the need for diverse and resilient financial infrastructure within the network.

Backed by real-world developments and on-chain dynamics, this forecast is gaining traction, particularly due to XRP’s rising prominence in South Korea and ongoing regulatory breakthroughs. XRP Leads in South Korean Crypto Markets CryptoSensei spotlighted XRP’s dominance on Upbit, South Korea’s largest crypto exchange , where it recently led trading volumes with over $132.59 million in 24 hours. This strong showing demonstrates XRP’s growing traction in one of the world’s most dynamic crypto markets. The heightened trading activity is not just a statistical highlight—it’s a signal of deepening retail and institutional interest across Asia. THE 1250X MARKET MULTIPLIER TO BOOST $XRP TO $1437?!! (ACT FAST) pic.twitter.com/Z1LQ5bDATV — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) August 8, 2025 Legal Reforms Open the Door for Tokenized Securities A major catalyst for this momentum lies in South Korea’s recent legal reforms, which permit the tokenization of traditional financial assets using blockchain technology. Under the guidance of the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and the Korean Digital Asset Industry Association, financial institutions can now issue and settle tokenized securities through distributed ledger technologies. This new legal infrastructure not only brings regulatory clarity but also positions XRP, thanks to its integration with Ripple’s enterprise solutions, as a potential cornerstone for tokenized asset settlement in South Korea’s evolving digital economy. The Market Cap Multiplier Effect At the center of CryptoSensei’s thesis is the market cap multiplier—a concept suggesting that even relatively small capital inflows can exponentially increase the value of highly liquid assets. He explains that a $3.8 billion inflow into XRP could multiply its market cap by 1250X, pushing its price to roughly $1,437 per token. Though speculative, this concept is not without precedent. Similar dynamics have occurred with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, where liquidity and supply dynamics created outsized returns from comparatively moderate capital inflows. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional Adoption and EVM Sidechain Integration XRP’s trajectory is further reinforced by growing institutional engagement. Ripple, the company behind XRP, is now valued at $15 billion and maintains high-level partnerships with major financial entities, including J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and SBI. These alliances speak volumes about confidence in Ripple’s long-term vision and the foundational role XRP plays within it. Adding to the momentum is the development of the XRPL EVM sidechain , which combines the speed and scalability of the XRP Ledger with Ethereum’s smart contract compatibility. This hybrid ecosystem allows developers to deploy Solidity-based applications while leveraging XRP’s liquidity, unlocking new use cases across DeFi, asset tokenization, and institutional-grade blockchain infrastructure. A Perfect Storm of Regulation, Demand, and Utility CryptoSensei emphasized that South Korea’s regulatory clarity, combined with resolution of Ripple-SEC legal war and its classification as a commodity under CFTC event contracts , creates a rare alignment of legal, financial, and technological forces. He argues that XRP is now positioned as a regulated infrastructure asset, ready to serve global institutions in a digital economy increasingly defined by tokenization and interoperability. Timing Could Be Everything With surging trading volumes, major partnerships, and a supportive legal framework emerging in Asia, XRP’s setup may be more explosive than most anticipate. While the 1250X projection remains speculative, CryptoSensei’s thesis illustrates just how swiftly things can move in crypto when demand, utility, and regulation converge. For XRP holders, the message is clear: act fast or risk being left behind. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Google Finance, a long-standing resource for market insights, is undergoing a revolutionary transformation, integrating cutting-edge AI capabilities, expanding its reach into cryptocurrency data, and introducing a dynamic live news feed. This monumental upgrade is not merely an incremental improvement; it represents a strategic pivot by Google to empower users with unprecedented access to real-time information and analytical tools, directly impacting how crypto enthusiasts navigate their investment journeys. For anyone keen on staying ahead in the digital asset space, understanding the implications of these new Google Finance AI enhancements is paramount. Google Finance AI: A Game Changer for Investors Google Finance has long been a go-to platform for basic stock quotes and company news, but its recent overhaul with significant AI integration marks a profound shift. This isn’t just about cosmetic changes; it’s about fundamentally altering how users interact with financial information. Imagine being able to pose complex financial questions directly to an AI, receiving not just a quick answer but a comprehensive response complete with links to relevant, authoritative sources. This new capability means investors can delve deeper into their queries without sifting through multiple search results or visiting various websites. For instance, instead of looking up individual stock details one by one, users can now ask intricate questions like, “How has the geopolitical tension in Europe impacted the energy sector’s top performers over the last quarter, and what are the projections for the next two quarters?” The AI is designed to synthesize this information, offering a holistic view that was previously difficult and time-consuming to assemble. This advancement positions Google Finance AI as a powerful research assistant, streamlining the decision-making process for both novice and seasoned investors. Unlocking Cryptocurrency Data and Real-Time Market Data One of the most anticipated aspects of this update, especially for our audience, is Google Finance’s expanded coverage of cryptocurrency data . In a market known for its rapid fluctuations and 24/7 trading, having reliable, centralized access to a broader range of digital assets is invaluable. While Google Finance previously offered some crypto coverage, this update promises to include “additional cryptocurrencies,” signifying a more comprehensive embrace of the digital asset landscape. This means investors will have more tools within Google’s ecosystem to track their favorite altcoins, understand market trends, and make more informed decisions. Coupled with this is the introduction of a new live news feed. In financial markets, particularly crypto, where a single headline can trigger significant price movements, access to real-time market data and news is critical. This feed ensures that users are always up-to-date with the latest developments, from regulatory changes to major industry announcements, without needing to jump between platforms. This immediate access to information is a distinct advantage, helping investors react swiftly to market shifts and seize opportunities or mitigate risks as they emerge. Leveraging AI Financial Tools for Smarter Decisions The core of Google Finance’s transformation lies in its new suite of AI financial tools . These aren’t just about answering simple queries; they are designed to empower users to conduct in-depth research and analysis with unprecedented ease. Imagine being able to ask: “Compare the Q3 performance of Bitcoin against Ethereum, considering their respective network upgrades and institutional adoption rates.” The AI will process this complex request, pulling data from various sources, and presenting a coherent, insightful response. This capability moves beyond traditional search, where you might have to perform multiple searches for “Bitcoin Q3 performance,” “Ethereum Q3 performance,” “Bitcoin network upgrades,” etc., and then manually synthesize the information. The AI does the heavy lifting, providing a consolidated view that saves significant time and effort. This allows investors to focus more on strategic thinking and less on data aggregation, ultimately leading to smarter, data-driven investment decisions. The ability to ask detailed, nuanced questions and receive comprehensive, linked responses is a game-changer for financial research. Mastering Your Portfolio with Advanced Charting Beyond textual information, visual data representation is crucial for financial analysis. The updated Google Finance introduces advanced charting tools that go far beyond simple line graphs. These new tools enable users to “visualize financial data beyond simple asset performance,” incorporating technical indicators vital for in-depth market analysis. For instance, users can now view “moving average envelopes,” which help identify overbought or oversold conditions and potential price reversals, or “candlestick charts,” which provide a detailed visual representation of price action over specific periods, including opening, closing, high, and low prices. For cryptocurrency traders, these charting capabilities are indispensable. Candlestick patterns are widely used to predict future price movements, while moving averages offer insights into trend direction and strength. The ability to customize the display to include various technical indicators means investors can apply their preferred analytical frameworks directly within Google Finance, eliminating the need for external, often paid, charting software. This empowers users to conduct sophisticated technical analysis, helping them to better time their entries and exits in volatile markets. Google’s Ambitious Stride: Competing in the Financial Information Arena Google’s strategic decision to supercharge Google Finance with AI and expanded features is a clear signal of its intent to become a dominant player in the financial information landscape. For years, platforms like Yahoo Finance and Seeking Alpha have held significant market share, offering a blend of news, data, and analytical tools. Google is now directly challenging these incumbents by leveraging its core strengths: vast data processing capabilities, sophisticated AI, and a massive user base. Furthermore, this move is also a response to the burgeoning popularity of general-purpose AI chatbots like ChatGPT, which users increasingly turn to for complex information queries, including financial ones. By integrating powerful AI capabilities directly into Google Finance, Google aims to keep users within its own ecosystem for financial research, preventing them from “leaving the service and going to an AI chatbot like ChatGPT for answers to complex questions.” This strategic enhancement is not just about improving a product; it’s about solidifying Google’s position as the primary gateway to information, including the highly specialized and lucrative domain of financial markets. What This Means for You: Practical Applications and Future Outlook For the everyday investor, particularly those navigating the exciting yet challenging world of digital assets, the revamped Google Finance offers a suite of practical benefits. Firstly, it democratizes access to advanced financial tools that were once the exclusive domain of professional traders or required expensive subscriptions. The ability to ask complex questions and receive AI-powered answers means less time spent sifting through information and more time dedicated to strategic planning. Secondly, the expanded cryptocurrency data and real-time news feed ensure that you are always operating with the most current information, which is paramount in volatile markets. Whether you’re tracking Bitcoin’s latest movements or researching emerging altcoins, Google Finance aims to be your comprehensive hub. Finally, the sophisticated charting tools provide the visual insights necessary to understand market trends and make timely decisions. Google says the new AI-powered Google Finance is rolling out over the coming weeks in the U.S., with users having the option to toggle between the new and old design, allowing for a smooth transition. This phased rollout suggests a careful approach to user adoption. As AI continues to evolve, its integration into financial tools like Google Finance will undoubtedly become more sophisticated, offering even more personalized insights and predictive capabilities. This update is just the beginning of a future where AI plays an even more central role in empowering investors to make smarter, more informed decisions.

Every bull cycle, a few crypto projects explode onto the scene, fueled by market buzz, influencer hype, and real trader momentum. But in 2025, only one of the top picks actually gives early movers exclusive access to a game-changing launch. If you’re hunting for the best upcoming crypto presale in 2025, these five coins deserve your attention, but only one is still offering whitelist entry, and spots are nearly gone. The best upcoming crypto presale in 2025 is all about early access, tight supply, and real community energy. With meme coin trends heating up and whales tracking new launches, here’s a breakdown of this year’s most-watched viral coins, starting with the one that’s dominating the early access conversation. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU): The Meme Coin Bulls Are Rushing to Join Some meme coins catch attention. MoonBull ($MOBU) captures an entire movement. Designed for degen traders and meme enthusiasts seeking massive upside, MoonBull is an Ethereum-based project that combines moon-bound ambition with unstoppable bull energy. What sets it apart? The whitelist – now open, but nearly filled. Whitelisted users get the full package: Lowest possible entry price before public launch, secret staking rewards that only insiders unlock, bonus token allocations for whitelisted holders, and advance access to private hints about the project’s evolving roadmap. None of these perks are revealed outside the whitelist. Once the private round closes, the next chance is gone. Securing a whitelist spot is simple but requires immediate action. Submit your email through the secure MoonBull whitelist form. If accepted, you’ll receive a private notification with the launch’s exact time and date before the world finds out. MoonBull is rapidly defining the best upcoming crypto presale in 2025, with social channels buzzing and spots filling by the minute. It’s first come, first served – wait too long, and you could be left chasing the pump. Why Whitelist Urgency Moves Markets: The Psychology of Missing Out What makes a whitelist feel so irresistible? Scarcity and timing. The best upcoming crypto presale in 2025 leverages human behavior, knowing that the chance to get in early triggers a rush unlike anything else. When access is limited, traders race to claim a spot, knowing that missing out can haunt them for months. Every major meme coin run in the past two years has included stories of early whitelisters scoring 5x or 10x before the masses join. The emotional reward of being “in the know” and the sting of missing out both fuel massive demand. With MoonBull, the combination of exclusivity, secrecy, and a near-full whitelist creates that exact market psychology: move fast, or get left behind. 2. Floki (FLOKI): Hyper-Deflationary Hype Machine Floki Inu (FLOKI) is more than just a dog-themed meme coin. Built on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, it’s engineered to become increasingly rare, with a hyper-deflationary mechanism that reduces supply over time. Floki’s community is legendary, drawing strength from viral campaigns and a brand inspired by both Elon Musk and his famous Shiba Inu dog. The coin consistently makes headlines, building partnerships and launching marketing pushes that bring new waves of buyers into the ecosystem. Whale wallets have been spotted accumulating FLOKI at key support levels, indicating confidence in its staying power and growth. Why did this coin make it to this list? Floki is a viral force in 2025, blending meme energy with utility and long-term scarcity, making it a must-watch for traders seeking high-potential community coins. 3. Brett (BRETT): Mascot Power and Community Muscle Brett ($BRETT) started as a simple meme inspired by Matt Furie’s Boys’ Club comics. Now, it stands as the official mascot of Base Chain and a cultural symbol across crypto social media. With a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens and a rabid online following, Brett has quickly become one of the most recognizable faces of this year’s meme coin movement. Major trading volumes, meme-driven rallies, and a dedicated core of supporters have all contributed to BRETT’s rapid rise. Analysts have pointed to Brett’s ongoing cultural relevance as a reason for its viral traction. Why did this coin make it to this list? Brett remains at the top of viral crypto picks for 2025 due to its unique blend of meme status and community-driven growth, with whales showing steady support throughout recent cycles. 4. Popcat (POPCAT): Meme-Driven Hype on Solana Popcat (POPCAT) brings viral meme culture directly to Solana’s high-speed network. Inspired by the internet-famous cat Oatmeal and its iconic open-mouthed meme, Popcat has become a favorite for those seeking quick action and big swings. Trading activity around POPCAT often spikes when social media trends pick up, with volumes surging as traders follow the hype. The meme’s appeal keeps the project fresh and visible, helping Popcat remain among the most discussed Solana tokens. Why did this coin make it to this list? Popcat is a classic example of viral meme coin power, offering high volatility, lively trading, and consistent buzz across Solana communities. 5. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT): From Viral Story to Crypto Sensation Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT) started as an internet legend, quickly transforming into a meme coin that champions compassion and community. The token’s story resonates across social channels, building a devoted holder base that actively promotes the cause. Analysts note that PNUT’s rapid adoption and strong narrative make it a unique player in the meme coin field. Whale activity has surged during key price levels, adding credibility to its viral rise. Why did this coin make it to this list? Peanut the Squirrel earns its spot for its story-driven adoption and explosive growth among both traders and crypto fans, making it one of the most viral crypto picks for 2025. Final Thoughts Based on the latest research, the best upcoming crypto presale in 2025 is MoonBull , followed by Floki, Brett, Popcat, and Peanut the Squirrel as the best meme coins. MoonBull stands alone with exclusive whitelist access and the most urgent opportunity for early movers, while the others represent the viral power and community spirit driving meme coin cycles. As the market heats up, only those who act fast will secure positions before the next big rally. Early access, limited supply, and growing whale interest set these picks apart in a rapidly evolving market.

The Potential of XYZVerse in the Meme Coin Market The introduction of XYZVerse into the crypto market has sparked considerable excitement, particularly because of its unique positioning as a sports-themed meme coin. This novel concept combines the global appeal of sports with the viral nature of meme coins, aiming to tap into a diverse investor base.

Listed on CoinMarketCap , the coin has already seen a bullish trend with 95% of the community showing support for its potential growth.

Flexible Filing with a Clear Target: Ethereum While the Form S-3 filing is a broad “shelf registration” that gives the firm flexibility to sell various securities, including common stock and warrants, the company has indicated the proceeds will be allocated toward its recently announced Ethereum treasury strategy. However, it has yet to specify a timeline for the move, which many crypto analysts consider a potential boost to Ethereum’s demand.

Miran calls for stronger presidential control and Fed accountability. Bitcoin briefly rises as markets anticipate potential rate cut in Sept. US President Donald Trump has appointed Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors following Adriana Kugler’s resignation. Known as a pro-cryptocurrency advocate, Miran supports easing regulatory policies and a dovish stance on interest rates. “It is my Great Honor to announce that I have chosen Dr. Stephen Miran, current Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, to serve in the just vacated seat on the Federal Reserve Board until January 31, 2026,” Trump announced on his Truth Social page. Miran’s term will last until January 31, 2026, while the administration continues searching for a permanent Board member and a candidate to succeed Jerome Powell as Fed Chair; Powell’s term expires in May 2026. Reports indicate Christopher Waller is the leading candidate from the Trump administration for the chairmanship. Trump has frequently criticized Powell and the Fed’s existing leadership for slow policy responses and has advocated lowering interest rates to boost economic growth. The Federal Reserve recently kept rates unchanged for the fifth consecutive time. In an academic paper, Miran advocated for more direct control of the Fed by the presidential administration to address ”ills” like excessive oversight, lack of accountability, and a diminished focus on fighting inflation. Although Miran has yet to be confirmed by the Senate and faces a Banking Committee hearing, his appointment has already affected market sentiment. Senator Elizabeth Warren has voiced opposition and plans to question Miran’s loyalty during the confirmation process. Market players reacted positively to the news, with Bitcoin briefly climbing above $117,600 before retreating. Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, told Decrypt that Miran is “expected to be dovish, which is what Trump wants,” reflecting market optimism for easing monetary policy. The Federal Reserve’s next interest rate meeting is scheduled for September 16–17, 2025.

The purchase was made at $375 million following the recent struggle experienced by SoftBank to raise funds for the support of the $500 billion Stargate plan. The nature of the sale has been private between the two companies, with sources declining to be identified. The acquisition aims to bring Foxconn into SoftBank’s plan to build AI data centers across the United States. The Stargate plan is expected to deliver more than 100,000 jobs across the U.S. The Stargate plan had been stalled for six months since its announcement in January by U.S President Trump. SoftBank plans to build AI servers in the Ohio plant as part of the Stargate plan The Stargate initiative was announced in January by U.S President Donald Trump as a private-sector investment. The plan could cost approximately $500 billion to build AI data centers across the U.S. in partnership with Oracle, SoftBank, and OpenAI. Softbank is reportedly the buyer of Foxconn EV plant in Ohio, potentially to be used as part of Stargate Project. SoftBank is scouting a number of potential sites to serve as a flagship for Stargate, weighing their access to water, power and telecom networks. But it’s… pic.twitter.com/eD0Jpj3pl3 — Ray Wang (@rwang07) August 8, 2025 Foxconn will operate the Ohio facility for its own AI server manufacturing. The Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. was the first investor in SoftBank’s plan and a notable supplier to Apple Inc. Bloomberg reported that the Ohio site may also be used to build AI data centers and manufacture AI servers. Hon Hai declined to give details of the transaction with SoftBank, citing the private nature of the acquisition. Reuters also revealed that it could not verify the Bloomberg report on the deal. The announcement came amid SoftBank and Foxconn’s separate deals on a $1.47 billion joint venture to establish a data center and manufacturing plant in the U.S. The two companies have contributed $735 million towards the deal so far. It’s, however, unclear if the $375 million Ohio plant acquisition forms part of the joint venture deal. Ohio plant acquisition may reignite Trump-backed AI data centers initiative Masayoshi Son leads SoftBank’s ambition to be a leader in AI-chip manufacturing. Since January, the company has faced drawbacks in raising funds for the Stargate deal. It also faced challenges evaluating potential sites for the flagship project, weighing in factors such as access to water, electricity, and networks. According to Yoshimitsu Goto, CFO at SoftBank, a lack of consensus between the partners is what has stalled the rollout of the project. China’s DeepSeek offered cheaper alternatives for AI models, which put the Stargate project at risk, among other factors such as U.S. tariffs. SoftBank found it harder to create a favourable pricing model for its products that could help secure finance for the $500 billion project. OpenAI and Oracle have already moved forward with the ChatGPT developer launching Stargate-branded data centers independently in Albene, Texas. The Albene site was launched before Trump’s January announcement. OpenAI is also a notable customer of the Stargate facility in Norway, and it plans to build a 5-Gigawatt Stargate data center in Abu Dhabi in collaboration with the MGX investment fund. According to Cramer , host of Mad Money on CNBC, the purchase of the Ohio EV plant signals a potential plan to reignite the stalled Stargate plan, which has suffered financial hurdles. It is still unclear whether the acquisition will accelerate the progress towards the $500 billion plan, depending on how quickly SoftBank can finalize its site selection and secure more partnerships.

(NASDAQ: CLSK), a prominent Bitcoin mining company. The firm recently disclosed a serious potential financial blow: it may face up to $185 million in punitive CleanSpark tariffs . This alarming development stems from a decision by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regarding some of its imported Bitcoin mining rigs . What Triggered These Massive CleanSpark Tariffs? According to a report by Wu Blockchain on X, the core of the issue lies in the classification of certain Bitcoin mining rigs . These machines, imported by CleanSpark between April and June 2024, have been deemed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection as originating from China. This classification is critical because goods identified as Chinese-origin are subject to specific tariffs, often punitive in nature, designed to address trade imbalances. The Core Problem: U.S. Customs classified CleanSpark’s imported mining rigs as originating from China. The Financial Impact: This classification could expose CleanSpark to a staggering $185 million in tariffs. The Timeframe: The affected imports occurred between April and June 2024. This situation highlights the complex and often unpredictable nature of international trade regulations, especially when dealing with rapidly evolving industries like cryptocurrency mining. Companies must navigate intricate supply chains and customs rules to avoid unexpected financial liabilities. How Do Crypto Tariffs Impact the Mining Industry? The potential imposition of such substantial crypto tariffs on CleanSpark sends a clear signal across the entire digital asset mining sector. It underscores the growing scrutiny on the origins of hardware essential for operations. This isn’t just about CleanSpark; it’s about the broader implications for any company involved in the CleanSpark import of mining equipment. When tariffs are levied, they directly increase the cost of doing business. For a Bitcoin mining operation, higher equipment costs can: Reduce profit margins significantly. Slow down expansion plans due to increased capital expenditure. Force companies to seek alternative, potentially more expensive, supply chains outside of China. This scenario could reshape how mining companies procure their hardware, potentially leading to a diversification of manufacturing bases or increased prices for consumers of mined Bitcoin. Understanding US Customs Bitcoin Rig Classifications The decision by US Customs Bitcoin rig classification is a key element here. U.S. Customs and Border Protection is responsible for enforcing trade laws and regulations. Their classification of goods determines the duties and taxes that apply. For mining rigs, the “origin” of the product is crucial. Even if a company assembles rigs elsewhere, if significant components are sourced from a country subject to tariffs, the entire product might be classified as originating from that country. CleanSpark will likely need to present detailed documentation to challenge this classification, proving the true origin of the components or the final assembly location. This process can be lengthy and resource-intensive, diverting attention and capital from core mining operations. It emphasizes the need for robust compliance strategies for companies engaged in the global trade of specialized hardware. What’s Next for CleanSpark’s Import Challenges? CleanSpark now faces a critical challenge in addressing these potential CleanSpark tariffs . The company will undoubtedly engage in discussions and potentially legal processes with U.S. Customs to contest the classification. The outcome will have a direct impact on its financial health and future operational strategies. This situation serves as a powerful reminder for all players in the cryptocurrency space about the importance of supply chain transparency and regulatory compliance. As the industry matures, so too does the level of scrutiny from government bodies worldwide. Companies must be proactive in understanding and adhering to international trade laws to avoid similar pitfalls. Key takeaways for the industry: Due Diligence: Thoroughly vet supply chains and component origins. Compliance: Stay updated on international trade laws and tariff policies. Contingency Planning: Develop strategies for potential supply chain disruptions or unexpected costs. Conclusion: Navigating the Tariff Storm The potential $185 million in CleanSpark tariffs represents a significant hurdle for the company and a cautionary tale for the broader Bitcoin mining industry. While CleanSpark navigates this complex regulatory landscape, the incident underscores the growing intersection of global trade policies and the burgeoning digital asset economy. As the crypto space continues to expand, so too will the need for meticulous planning and adherence to international customs and trade regulations. This challenge could ultimately influence how companies source their essential Bitcoin mining rigs , potentially leading to more diversified global manufacturing and supply strategies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the primary reason CleanSpark faces these tariffs? A1: U.S. Customs and Border Protection classified some of CleanSpark’s imported Bitcoin mining rigs as originating from China, triggering punitive tariffs. Q2: How much could CleanSpark potentially owe in tariffs? A2: CleanSpark could face up to $185 million in punitive tariffs, according to disclosures. Q3: What does “originating in China” mean for these Bitcoin mining rigs? A3: It means U.S. Customs determined that the products, or significant components, were manufactured or sourced from China, making them subject to specific import duties. Q4: How might these tariffs impact the wider Bitcoin mining industry? A4: Such tariffs could increase equipment costs, reduce profit margins, and force mining companies to diversify their supply chains away from China, impacting global hardware procurement strategies. Q5: What steps can companies take to avoid similar tariff issues? A5: Companies should conduct thorough due diligence on supply chain origins, stay updated on international trade laws, and develop contingency plans for potential tariff disputes or disruptions.

Officials fear stablecoins could become new fraud vehicles in mainland China. Despite bans, OTC crypto trading hits $75B; Hong Kong grows as digital asset hub. China’s financial regulators have ordered brokerages and think tanks to cancel seminars and cease publishing research on stablecoins, according to Bloomberg sources cited by Reuters. Authorities are concerned that stablecoins could become a new vehicle for fraud and want to prevent investors from rushing into such assets without fully understanding the risks. Despite the prohibitions This move comes amid an ongoing general ban on all cryptocurrency transactions within mainland China. Despite these restrictions, over-the-counter (OTC) trading of digital assets reached $75 billion in the first nine months of 2024, according to Chainalysis, indicating that crypto activity continues through informal channels. In contrast to the mainland restrictions, Chinese regulators are supporting the development of Hong Kong as a regional hub for digital assets. Bloomberg reports that the city has licensed 11 cryptocurrency exchanges and 44 companies authorized to trade digital assets, including several firms with Chinese state support. Christopher Wong, a currency strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., commented on the regulators’ approach: Chinese authorities are pragmatic and aim to avoid a “herd mentality” among investors, discouraging excessive hype and unsophisticated speculation. Notably, in March, Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey reported that China is actively working to create its own strategic bitcoin reserve, highlighting the government's nuanced stance toward digital currencies amid strict regulations.

Ozak AI, a blockchain-powered AI platform, is currently in its presale phase, with its native token, $OZ , priced at $0.003. Analysts suggest that if the token reaches $1 by 2025, investors could see 500x returns, making it one of the most-watched projects in the market. Ozak AI’s Growth Potential and Market Position Ozak AI unites artificial intelligence with blockchain technology which represent the fastest-moving sectors in the market. Users access AI-powered trading analytics and OSN (Ozak Stream Network) provides a decentralized framework on this platform. Regulatory intelligence suggests that combining artificial intelligence with blockchain technology enables more industries such as finance and healthcare, to choose AI solutions. The market interest in Ozak AI becomes evident through its successful presale results. The project has managed to sell beyond 120 million tokens, which led to a total fund collection of $900,000. The project uses a planned price elevation strategy that will advance to $0.005 for the succeeding presale run. How Much Would Investors Need for $1 Million? At the price of $0.005, an investor would need to invest $5,000 to buy 1 million $OZ tokens, which would be worth $1 million if the price rises to $1. Even a $100 investment at $0.005 per token would buy 20,000 $OZ tokens , which would be worth $20,000 if the price reaches $1. Similarly, a $500 investment would buy 100,000 tokens, worth $100,000 at $1 per token. To achieve a $1 million portfolio, investors should make a $5,000 investment at the current price to get 1 million tokens. If Ozak AI reaches a value of $1 per token, the $5,000 investment becomes worth $1,000,000. With a token price of $0.50 per unit, the $5,000 investment would be worth $500,000. Expert Predictions and Market Risks The growing need for AI solutions leads market analysts to predict good performance among AI-focused cryptocurrencies. The crypto market shows unpredictable characteristics despite warnings from a few experts. Ozak AI's achievement hinges on its advancement along with partnership formation and market acceptance. The market value of Ozak AI is set to increase steadily if it experiences growth alongside successful strategic partnership acquisitions, according to analyst projections. The ongoing presale attracts more investors as additional support for the token's value to potentially reach its predicted targets.

Over $24M was liquidated from short positions in only an hour. Ethereum (ETH) broke the long-awaited barrier of $4,000 for the first time since December 7, 2024, causing over $24M in short liquidations. ETH also led 24-hour liquidations, with $119M in short positions erased. ETH rallied above $4,012 on Binance, causing a wave of $119M in short liquidations for the past 24 hours. | Source: Coingecko Following the recent liquidations, ETH open interest remained at $26.65B, near its three-year peak. In the past 24 hours, open interest rose by around 6.8%, with accumulated long positions above $3,850. ETH is up over 62% in the past three months, with the biggest climb kicking off in July. The token rose to $4,001.13 on Gate.io , with almost all exchanges at just under $4,000. Binance data showed ETH climbed above $4,012 briefly. On Hyperliquid, short liquidations shifted the balance of positions. 29,307 traders are long on ETH, while only 14,332 traders are shorting the token. The biggest ETH short position on Hyperliquid has a nominal value of $339.16M , and was over $35M underwater during the latest price expansion. ETH reflected a shift in sentiment In the past weeks, ETH moved on a mix of peak spot demand from whales , as well as record open interest on derivative markets. The mix resulted in an accelerating rally after months of stagnant prices. ETH also rose to 0.033 BTC, accelerating faster than the leading coin. After the latest rally, ETH dominance returned to 12.1%, boosting hopes of an altcoin season. The extremely rapid rally also meant market sentiment went through anomalies. Crowd money is extremely bullish, while smart money has turned bearish . However, the attempts to short ETH are also the main factor behind the price expansion. At this price range, over 95% of traders are in profit, with little pressure to sell. Whales have already established a lower baseline price, and ETH is expected to extend its rally to a higher range and reflect the chain’s utility.

The rally arrived soon after ETH dipped as low as $1,400, while whales repositioned with a lower cost basis. The recent rally still needs to break the resistance above $4,000 to attempt a new all-time high and fulfill the short-term $5,000 predictions. ETH price rally boosts DeFi Total value locked on Ethereum is now at levels not seen since early 2022, with over $86B in various protocols. Currently, lending is more mature, and liquidatable positions are as low as $997 per ETH. The increasing demand for lending also boosts ETH buying, leading to a bigger potential rally. Currently, buyers far surpass new weekly ETH production, with more tokens held closely in accumulation addresses. ETH is also staked or wrapped, more rarely leaving the ecosystem. A bigger price rally may mean ETH will try to break its DeFi records from 2021. Since the 2021 bull market, ETH has only recovered eight times above $4,000, later breaking down to a lower range. The most recent rally still sparks hopes of an ongoing expansion. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

A weak July payrolls report, paired with big downward revisions to earlier months, has markets convinced the Fed might cut rates when policymakers meet September 16–17. According to CME Group’s FedWatch tool, traders now see an almost certain second cut before year-end and about a 50-50 shot at a third. Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at Barclays, said: “We are back to the ‘bad is good’ mantra, with the Fed expected to save the day by cutting rates early and big enough to prevent a recession – something the U.S. President would likely welcome. However, we are not convinced a September cut is a given, yet.” That assumption will be tested fast. The first potential roadblock comes Tuesday, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases July’s consumer price index. Forecasts point to a 0.3% gain for headline CPI and 0.2% for core. The report lands days after President Donald Trump fired the BLS commissioner in the wake of the disappointing jobs data. Then on Thursday comes the July producer price index, a measure of wholesale costs that could show pressure from Trump’s tariffs. Cau warned, “A hawkish print would likely be a reality check for markets” and keep the rally locked into a narrow group of big growth names. “A soft CPI print,” he added, would likely lock in cut expectations, push stocks higher, and cap the dollar’s short-term upside. Inflation data in focus as rate cut bets shift JPMorgan’s chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli is leaning toward a run of cuts, saying the Fed could lower rates at all three remaining meetings through the end of 2025 “before pausing indefinitely.” He noted : “It’s not unprecedented for the Fed to ease when stocks are at or near all-time highs. It’s rarer when stocks are at the highs and inflation is above target and inflecting higher.” The bank had previously forecast its first cut in December, but now sees a 25-basis-point reduction in September, followed by three more quarter-point moves before stopping. Feroli wrote that for Chair Jerome Powell, “the risk management considerations at the next meeting may go beyond balancing employment and inflation risks.” For traders, the path to September now runs straight through next week’s inflation prints. Stronger-than-expected CPI or PPI data could force the Fed to hold fire. Softer readings could do the opposite, locking in a September move and setting the tone for the rest of the year. Trump’s Fed board pick adds more uncertainty to September Trump on Thursday nominated Stephen Miran, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, to temporarily replace outgoing Fed Governor Adriana Kugler. The 14-year seat becomes permanently vacant on February 1, and the White House says it’s already hunting for a long-term nominee. Trump also said he is considering possible replacements for Powell, whose term ends in May 2026. Miran’s confirmation before the September meeting isn’t guaranteed, but JPMorgan analysts believe his presence could sharpen divisions on the rate-setting committee. The nomination follows Trump’s repeated but unsuccessful pushes to get the Fed to cut rates more aggressively. Installing Miran, even briefly, could give him a more direct line into the central bank’s decision-making. For now, investors are left with two big variables: the inflation numbers due next week and the political maneuvering around the Fed’s board. Both will hit before September 16–17, and both could decide whether the market’s latest rescue fantasy actually happens.

This is quite the change of stance considering he was previously known for his bearish market calls throughout much of 2024 and early 2025. During the ‘Bloomberg Open Interest’, Wilson talked about how the economy has been in a rolling recession for three years, with different sectors struggling at different times. He believes this downturn finally ended in April, when the last round of tariffs caused the market to hit bottom and start a new bull market.

This is a big deal because breaking that level showed buyers are really stepping up and confidence in Ethereum’s network is back. Ethereum price got as high as about $4,020 on Friday, climbing 3 to 6% in just one trading session as more people jumped in. Before this, Ethereum had been stuck around the high $3,800s for a bit. Its total market value rose to nearly $472 billion, and trading volume spiked to almost $39 billion over 24 hours. That’s a lot of activity, which has many folks thinking the price could keep rising. 4 reasons why Ethereum price is climbing may continue A few things came together to push Ethereum’s price higher: 1. The investors are feeling good again, with Ethereum breaking back above $4,000 after spending some time below that level. It shows they still believe in the coin’s long-term potential. 2. Then there’s the upcoming “Dencun” upgrade, which should make the network cheaper to use and faster. That’s exciting for the people building and using Ethereum, so it’s helping boost demand. 3. There’s also more interest from big institutional investors. After Bitcoin ETFs got approved, folks are hoping the same will happen for Ethereum, which would likely bring in even more money. 4. Finally, the whole crypto market is on a bit of a roll right now, with Bitcoin doing well. That positive energy spills over to Ethereum and other coins, encouraging people to take more risks. Ethereum is sitting near $4,000 now, but some analysts expect it could go even higher maybe $5,000 or more before the year’s out. They are looking at upcoming upgrades, more people using the network, and bigger investors making moves as the main reasons why the price might keep rising. What technicalities convey? Ethereum price pushed past important price points at $3,900 and $4,000 recently, showing strong buying momentum. The jump came with a 30% rise in trading volume, which backs up the move on the charts. During the day, prices stayed above $3,900 before hitting a high near $4,020 and dipping to about $3,780. Source: TradingView A notable pattern to watch is the symmetrical triangle that’s been forming since May 2025, with prices squeezed between a high near $3,800 and a low around $2,950. This kind of pattern usually signals uncertainty but often leads to a breakout. Measuring the triangle’s size suggests a bullish breakout could push prices past $4,200, while a breakdown might send them down near $2,800. Since Ethereum has already broken above $4,000, it looks like the bullish case is coming true. Looking at shorter time frames, Ethereum shows signs of an ascending triangle, a bullish pattern where support levels rise while resistance stays flat. This points to buyers building momentum before a big move. The recent break above $4,000 confirms that buyers are gaining control and pushing past short-term resistance.

Are there further implications for its prices? XRP rallied extensively in the past 24 hours, spurred by several catalysts, including bullish ecosystem development. Specifically, the US SEC and Ripple officially ended their years-long legal battle yesterday, pushing XRP over 11% from $2.99 to $3.38 today before consolidating around the price level.XRP 24-Hour Volume Spikes 208% to $12.4BMeanwhile, Glassnode highlighted in a recent tweet that the XRP futures activities spiked with the price uptick. This occurred as market users crave leveraged exposure to the token’s rallying price. The 24-hour volume grew by 208% to $12.48 billion, marking the largest change among major assets in the timeframe.While its value fell below Bitcoin’s $50.6 billion and Ethereum’s $76.7 billion, it gained the most momentum in the past 24 hours. It also overtook Solana at $9.6 billion and trounced Dogecoin’s $4.9 billion, despite the meme coin’s volume spiking 110% in the past day. XRP Derivative Data/Glassnode Notably, Coinglass data shows a heavier volume but with a smaller percentage change for XRP. Derivative volume spiked 161% in the past 24 hours to $18.44 billion, with options volume also increasing 92.6% to $1,970.XRP Open Interest on the RiseInterestingly, the open interest—a metric that tracks the value of open futures positions on an asset—also climbed with prices and volume. OI rallied 15% to $5.9 billion, with a positive funding rate of 0.01% suggesting heavy long positions. Glassnode highlighted that this could lead to an XRP liquidation spike if prices retrace to lower levels.CryptoQuant analyst JA Maartunn further shared a rising XRP OI in his tweet today, identifying a 22% surge in the last 24 hours. Coinglass also confirmed this, displaying that it spiked 17% to $8.94 billion. XRP OI Change/JA Maartunn Remarkably, XRP’s OI faced a sharp fall as July wound down, after it surged to an all-time high of $11.2 billion on July 18. Notably, the OI high coincided with its rally to a multi-year price high of $3.66.However, the aggressive futures interest dwindled quickly, with price momentum following suit. It dropped over 37% to $7.05 on August 3, aligning with XRP’s dump below the $3 price mark. Now, with leveraged interest rekindling again, XRP’s price may be on the positive receiving end. In the meantime, XRP trades at $3.31, down slightly from its intraday high of $3.38.Moreover, with the regulatory hurdle finally behind XRP, analysis suggests XRP could rally to as high as $10 this year. However, some others believe XRP could go higher with a targeted rise to $30 this bull cycle.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ZRX|REGULATION,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-08-08 15:52:43

The $1 billion digital asset banking group disclosed in a press release that it is offering SUI custody, spot and derivatives trading, staking, and lending solutions exclusively for professional and institutional clients. Per the announcement, the initiative involves Sygnum integrating SUI into its banking platform. As a result, the token could enjoy accelerated inflows from asset managers, banks, and financial institutions, potentially boosting its adoption and credibility. Executive CommentarySpeaking in a statement, Sygnum’s co-founder, Mathias Imbach, expressed delight about becoming a banking partner of the Sui Foundation. This alliance will expand its access to institutional and professional clients. Christian Thompson, the CEO of the Sui Foundation, also commented on the significance of SUI’s integration into Sygnum’s banking platform. Thompson portrayed the initiative as a remarkable development extending SUI’s global reach among institutional investors. He also framed Sygnum Bank as an ideal banking partner for the Sui ecosystem, citing its crypto-native expertise and fully regulated infrastructure. Institutional Adoption Accelerates Launched by a team of former Meta engineers in May 2023, Sui is a Layer-1 blockchain that supports various applications, including instant payments, decentralized finance (DeFi), and real-world assets (RWA) tokenization. It has been attracting the attention of financial institutions recently. Earlier this month, Swiss-based AMINA Bank AG made history by becoming the first regulated bank to offer institutional trading and custody for SUI. In a separate development, U.S.-based Mill City Ventures III., Ltd. completed a $450 million private placement, with 98% of the proceeds used to establish a strategic SUI treasury. Following the fundraiser, the company procured more than 76 million SUI tokens at an aggregate cost of $277 million. Like most crypto assets, top asset managers are also seeking to launch spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to SUI. As previously reported, major players like Canary Capital and 21Shares are seeking the SEC’s approval to debut SUI ETFs in the U.S. The SEC is currently reviewing these applications. SUI Price Reacts to Sygnum Partnership NewsNews of Sygnum’s partnership with the Sui Foundation has slightly impacted the token’s performance. Before the announcement, SUI was hovering around $3.8. However, it spiked immediately to an intraday high of $3.88 after Sygnum announced the token’s integration into its banking platform.

The digital currency sector has created crypto gaming, which represents the direction gaming is taking into the future. So, what is crypto gaming? Well, you're about to find out that it is changing the way people play, win, and experience online casino games. The traditional casino experience has transformed because of blockchain technology. The basic concept of crypto gaming requires players to use digital currencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum to both stake bets and withdraw winnings at online casinos. Blockchain technology allows people to access their money quickly with safer transactions, while removing the requirement for bank or credit card participation. The Blockchain and gambling are a match made in heaven because it enables the system to operate efficiently while providing total transparency to users. Through blockchain technology, you can independently confirm the fairness of games in addition to trusting their authenticity. Once you understand what crypto gaming is, head over to BetUS slots casino and try your luck with the future of gambling. BetUS is ahead of the competition as an online crypto casino, and as mentioned earlier, crypto gaming is guaranteed to be fair. Blockchain: The Key to Fairness and Speed The blockchain drives crypto gaming operations while delivering excellent results to players. All financial operations, including wagers, winnings, and payment distributions, become part of the blockchain network. The blockchain system lets you observe the destination of your funds while also allowing you to verify game fairness. The blockchain eliminates the requirement for intermediaries and minimizes both delays and confusion. The process of winning at crypto gaming results in automatic instant transfers of your winnings into your crypto wallet. Why Crypto Casinos Are Booming Crypto casinos continue to expand rapidly for multiple reasons. The blockchain allows you to observe your bets and payouts as they occur in real-time through its transparent records. You know the games are fair. No waiting period exists. You don’t need to wait to be verified to play or to withdraw winnings when playing at crypto casinos. Payouts in crypto gaming happen without delay. Privacy: You don’t need to share your personal info or banking details. The digital wallet system maintains complete security for your assets. The borderless nature of crypto gaming enables users to access its services from any location in the world. The combination of benefits in crypto casinos makes them the preferred choice among players because they provide faster, more secure, and equitable gaming compared to traditional casinos. AI and Smart Contracts: The Future of Gambling The field extends beyond cryptocurrency usage. The gaming industry experiences transformations from both AI and smart contracts. The use of AI technology enables casinos to deliver customized promotional deals that enhance gameplay for better user experiences. The system provides users with access to an advanced version of casino operations that offers smart and intuitive gameplay. Smart contracts are a true game-changer. Self-executing contracts through smart contracts provide instant, automatic payments to winners. All blockchain-based systems provide automatic instant payouts without human interaction because they include built-in payment mechanisms. Are Traditional Casinos On the Way Out? The numerous advancements in the field lead some to believe traditional casinos will disappear completely. Cryptocurrency and gaming are evolving together, and there is no limit to the possibilities. But, the complete casino experience at a real location includes the combination of sounds with atmosphere and social interaction, which remains unmatched by alternative methods. Traditional casinos might lose customer demand because more people embrace decentralized gambling and AI-powered platforms, although real casinos will persist. The trend of crypto gaming will most likely push traditional casinos to adopt this technology to stay competitive. The Future of Gambling: Fair, Fast, and Secure Where is this all going? Now that you understand what crypto gaming is, it's easy to see that it’s establishing itself as the leading direction for the future. Blockchain technology, alongside smart contracts and AI, drives the transformation of everything toward faster operations with better transparency and stronger security measures.

This sudden shift has sent ripples across the digital asset landscape, leaving many investors wondering about the immediate future of their portfolios. According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $115,990.01 on the Binance USDT market, a figure that demands attention from every participant in the crypto space. What’s Behind This Sudden BTC Market Dip ? When Bitcoin sees a sharp decline, several factors often contribute to the movement. Understanding these elements is crucial for anyone engaging in cryptocurrency market analysis . It’s rarely just one event but a confluence of influences that can lead to such a rapid shift. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Broader economic concerns, such as inflation data, interest rate hikes, or geopolitical tensions, can prompt investors to de-risk, pulling capital from speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Whale Movements: Large holders of Bitcoin, often referred to as “whales,” can significantly impact the market with substantial sell orders. A single large sell-off can trigger cascading liquidations. Regulatory Uncertainty: News or rumors of stricter regulations in major economies can create FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt), leading to selling pressure. Technical Breakdown: Breaching key support levels, like the $116,000 mark, can trigger automated sell orders and reinforce bearish sentiment among traders. Navigating the Bitcoin Price Drop : Strategies for Investors In times of heightened volatility, having a clear strategy is paramount. A sudden Bitcoin price drop can be unsettling, but it also presents opportunities for those prepared to act decisively. Here are some actionable insights and Bitcoin trading strategies to consider: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Before making any moves, evaluate how much risk you are comfortable taking. This dip might be a temporary blip or a sign of further correction. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the bottom, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps mitigate risk by averaging out your purchase price over time. Rebalance Your Portfolio: Use this opportunity to re-evaluate your asset allocation. You might consider trimming positions that have performed well or adding to those you believe are undervalued. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on market news, sentiment, and on-chain data. Informed decisions are always better than reactive ones. Remember, panic selling often leads to losses. Patience and a well-thought-out plan are your best allies during market downturns. Understanding Crypto Market Volatility and Future Outlook The recent dip underscores the inherent crypto market volatility that defines digital assets. While exciting, this volatility also demands caution and a long-term perspective. Bitcoin has historically demonstrated resilience, recovering from numerous significant pullbacks over its lifespan. Each downturn offers valuable lessons for traders and investors alike. Looking ahead, expert cryptocurrency market analysis suggests a mixed outlook. Some analysts view this as a healthy correction, necessary to flush out excess leverage and establish a stronger foundation for future growth. Others warn of potential further downside if key support levels fail to hold. The global economic climate, coupled with evolving regulatory landscapes, will continue to play a significant role in Bitcoin’s trajectory. It’s important to remember that the underlying technology and adoption of Bitcoin continue to grow. Institutional interest remains strong, and the long-term fundamentals for blockchain technology are often separated from short-term price fluctuations. However, for immediate trading, vigilance is key. The sudden Bitcoin price drop below $116,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency markets. While such dips can be concerning, they are also an integral part of the crypto cycle. By staying informed, understanding market drivers, and applying sound strategies, investors can navigate these challenging periods more effectively. Whether you are a seasoned trader or new to the space, focusing on risk management and a clear investment thesis will always be beneficial. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did Bitcoin’s price fall below $116,000? A1: The specific reasons can vary, but common factors include macroeconomic concerns, large sell-offs by “whales,” regulatory news, and technical breakdowns below key support levels. Q2: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? A2: This depends on your individual investment strategy and risk tolerance. Some investors view dips as buying opportunities, especially when employing strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA). However, prices can always fall further. Q3: How does this Bitcoin price drop affect other cryptocurrencies? A3: Bitcoin often acts as a bellwether for the broader crypto market. A significant Bitcoin price drop typically leads to altcoins experiencing similar, or even more pronounced, declines due to their correlation with BTC. Q4: What should long-term investors do during a market dip? A4: Long-term investors often focus on the fundamental value and technology. They might use dips to accumulate more assets, rebalance their portfolios, or simply hold their positions, trusting in Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential. Q5: Where can I get reliable cryptocurrency market analysis? A5: Reliable cryptocurrency market analysis can be found from reputable financial news outlets, on-chain data providers, and established crypto research firms. Always cross-reference information from multiple sources. Did you find this analysis helpful?

Hours after his company’s AI crushed Elon’s Grok in a chess tournament, Sam went on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” and, when asked about Elon’s latest shot at OpenAI, said flatly, “You know, I don’t think about him that much.” He didn’t stop there. “I thought he was just, like, tweeting all day [on X] about how much OpenAI sucks, and our model is bad, and, you know, [we’re] not gonna be a good company and all that.” The exchange came one day after Satya Nadella announced that OpenAI’s newest model, GPT-5, will be baked into Microsoft 365 Copilot, GitHub Copilot, Azure AI Foundry, and the standalone Copilot. Elon responded on X with his prediction that “OpenAI is going to eat Microsoft alive.” Satya wasn’t having it, replying, “People have been trying for 50 years, and that’s the fun of it! Each day you learn something new, and innovate, partner, and compete.” He even threw in a nod to Elon’s Grok 4 chatbot, which is already on Azure in a limited preview. Microsoft rollout triggers another round in the feud Sam and Elon have been trading blows for years. They started OpenAI together back in 2015 as a nonprofit AI lab, but split when they disagreed over its direction. OpenAI later shifted toward a for-profit model, pulling in Microsoft as its biggest backer. Elon went on the offensive this year with a lawsuit claiming breach of contract, then dropped it. Not long after, Elon led a group that tried to buy the nonprofit controlling OpenAI for $97.4 billion. Sam rejected the offer publicly with, “No thank you, but we will buy Twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.” Speaking to CNBC at the time, Sam called the bid an attempt to “slow down a competitor.” Now, Microsoft’s integration of GPT-5 is set to give OpenAI’s tools even wider reach. Elon’s comment about OpenAI “eating Microsoft alive” landed just as Satya spoke. The timing kept the public feud alive, with each side digging in through statements and posts. In a tournament built to see which general-purpose AI could handle chess, OpenAI’s o3 model had beaten Elon’s Grok 4 in the final. These weren’t traditional chess engines but AI systems built for everyday tasks, thrown into a different kind of test. The o3 model went unbeaten. In the final, Grok 4 made several errors, including losing its queen more than once, which sealed its loss. Google’s Gemini came in third after knocking out another OpenAI entry in an earlier round. Chess has long been a way to measure a computer’s ability to plan and calculate. This contest showed how far, and how far behind, these multipurpose AI tools can be when given a structured, rules-based challenge. Despite the mistakes, both Sam and Elon still claim their latest AI models are the smartest in the world. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The order directs the U.S. Department of Labor to reevaluate existing restrictions on investments such as digital assets, private equity, and real estate in these plans. The change marks a shift in federal policy and has drawn both enthusiasm and concern from across the financial and crypto communities. Trillions in Retirement Capital Now in Focus As of Q1 2025, total U.S. retirement assets stood at $43.4 trillion, according to the Investment Company Institute and the Federal Reserve Board. Of that, more than $12 trillion came from defined-contribution plans, including $8.7 trillion held in 401(k)s. With such a massive capital base, even a small allocation to crypto could significantly impact the market. Crypto Leaders Applaud the Decision Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, said the executive order could fundamentally reshape the crypto market. He described the development as the beginning of a “slow, steady, consistent bid” from retirement savings that could lead to “higher returns and lower volatility.” Hougan also emphasized the suitability of crypto in retirement portfolios, calling it “the best-performing asset class in the world over the past decade.” Ji Hun Kim, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI), said the executive order signals crypto’s growing acceptance in mainstream finance. “Americans should have the opportunity and freedom to include these investments within their retirement plans,” Kim stated. He added that CCI appreciated the administration’s “continued commitment to clear policies” and making the U.S. “the crypto capital of the world.” Infrastructure and Regulation Take Center Stage Abdul Rafay Gadit, co-founder of ZIGChain, said the move paves the way for the infrastructure necessary to support tokenized investment products at scale. He pointed out the increasing regulatory clarity under SEC Chairman Atkins, suggesting that a “unified framework” is starting to emerge. However, not all reactions were without caution. Michael Heinrich, CEO of 0G Labs, called the development a “watershed moment” for the industry. Still, he warned of the dual nature of the shift, saying, “Done right, this could unlock trillions in retirement capital for Bitcoin and other compliant assets. Done poorly, it risks political and financial backlash.” He stressed that critical implementation details—such as qualifying tokens, custody arrangements, and regulatory safeguards—would determine the success or failure of the initiative. Bitcoin Seen as Early Beneficiary Joshua Krüger of the dEURO Association believes Bitcoin will be the first asset to benefit from the change due to its institutional backing. “Asset managers such as BlackRock, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton are already lined up with corresponding offerings,” he noted. He said other cryptocurrencies may follow in the medium term, but only after establishing solid regulatory and technical foundations. Tezos co-founder Arthur Breitman echoed these views, noting that the scale of the U.S. retirement market could help legitimize crypto as an asset class. While supporting more options for savers, Breitman expressed concerns over misinformed investment choices. He warned that private assets in retirement accounts often suffer from “high fees, hard-to-determine pricing, and manager manipulation to mask volatility.” Critics Warn of Financial Risks Peter Schiff, a long-time critic of crypto, voiced strong opposition to the move. He argued that allowing crypto in 401(k)s could worsen the already serious U.S. retirement savings gap. “Most Americans have saved far less than needed to have any hope of retirement,” Schiff posted on X. “By allowing Americans to gamble what little retirement savings they have in their 401(k)s on Bitcoin and other cryptos, Trump just made this problem much worse.”",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|REGULATION|FIAT,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-08-08 15:57:18

The arrangement is a move by Binance to rebuild investor trust following its record $4.3 billion fine by U.S. regulators in 2023 and the broader industry fallout from the collapse of FTX. Rebuilding Trust After FTX and Fines BBVA, Spain’s third-largest bank , has recently begun serving as an independent custodian for Binance, the FT reported, citing two people familiar with the matter. JUST IN: Spain’s third largest bank BBVA partners with Binance to keep #Bitcoin and crypto off exchange. Banks are coming pic.twitter.com/hUozPpyAQG — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 8, 2025 The move allows clients to hold their assets off the exchange—a shift that reflects growing demand for secure, third-party custody solutions after the FTX implosion left billions trapped in bankruptcy proceedings. Binance’s partnership with BBVA seeks to mitigate counterparty risk and reassure users amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny. The exchange previously only offered custody through Ceffu, a related entity criticized by U.S. authorities for its opaque relationship with Binance. In early 2024, Binance began offering clients custody options via Switzerland’s Sygnum and FlowBank. Traditional Banks Warm to Crypto The collaboration with BBVA also shows the evolving stance of traditional financial institutions toward digital assets. BBVA’s involvement indicates greater mainstream acceptance of crypto, as regulatory frameworks mature in the U.S. and EU. One source told the FT that BBVA’s established reputation enhances Binance’s credibility. “If you say BBVA, people are like ‘box tick, next’,” the person said, referencing due diligence processes commonly used by investors before trading on exchanges. BBVA has not only agreed to custody crypto assets for Binance users, but has also expanded its own crypto offerings. The bank now allows Spanish retail clients to trade and store bitcoin and ether through its mobile app and has advised private banking clients to allocate up to 7% of their portfolios to digital assets. Safer Custody Structure Using U.S. Treasuries Under the reported arrangement, users’ funds are held by BBVA in U.S. Treasuries, which Binance accepts as margin for trading on its platform. One source said the model is designed to prevent another FTX-style collapse by keeping client collateral in a “safe place.” This structure separates custody from trading and lending activities—an operational distinction regulators have encouraged following the risks exposed by FTX’s demise. Crypto Exchanges Adjust to Investor Demands Following regulatory crackdowns and shifting investor expectations, crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase are reassessing their roles as all-in-one platforms. Acknowledging user concerns, Binance is leaning on institutions like BBVA to provide added layers of protection and legitimacy. Both Binance and BBVA declined to comment on the arrangement. NYDFS Secures Settlement From Paxos Over Binance Dealings On Thursday, it emerged that Paxos Trust Company has agreed to a $48.5 million settlement with the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) over allegations it failed to monitor illicit activity linked to its former partner, cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The regulator said it found that Paxos failed to properly monitor its relationship with Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. The penalty includes a $26.5 million fine and a commitment by Paxos to spend $22 million improving its internal compliance systems.

The new coin is stealing the spotlight this August with a major milestone that could redefine its position in the DeFi market. The project is now priced at $0.035 in phase 6 of the presale. Phase 7 will appreciate 14.29% to $0.04. Existing investors are eyeing a 200-400% profit when the token goes live. Mutuum Finance has already garnered over $14.1 million in funding and has been backed by over 14,900 investors. Mutuum Finance could be one of the next 100x crypto tokens in 2025. While broader market sentiment hints at an impending altcoin surge, Mutuum Finance’s rapid protocol expansion and growing ecosystem utility are fueling bullish sentiment within its community. Ethereum Coils Toward $5,000 as Institutional Momentum Builds Ethereum is currently trading at approximately $3,463, consolidating above critical support and showing signs of technical strength. Analysts highlight key resistance in the $4,000–$4,200 range, if ETH breaks above this zone, it could open the door toward $5,000 in 2025, propelled by record ETF inflows and major upgrades like Pectra and EIP‑4844 improving scalability and adoption. At the same time, some bullish models suggest even loftier targets, projecting ETH could reach $7,000–$10,000, or potentially $16,000+, should broader technical patterns such as symmetric triangles and wedge breakouts materialize alongside continued institutional demand. As Ethereum navigates this pivotal phase, investor interest is gradually shifting toward emerging DeFi protocols with real-world utility, such as Mutuum Finance. Investors Eye 71% Returns in Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Presale Mutuum Finance is priced at $0.035 in presale stage 6 after a presale stage 5 sell-out. More than $14.1 million has been raised and more than 14900 early investors are in the presale. Token price in Presale Stage 7 will be $0.04, a 14.23% hike from Stage 6. Mutuum Finance Strengthens Protocol Security with CertiK-Backed Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched an Official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, its security and transparency partner. Users will be rewarded with 50,000 USDT in value for reporting possible bugs on the project. The purpose of the bounty program is to provide equal protection for all classes of vulnerabilities. It has been divided into four classes of severity; i.e., major, minor, low, and critical. Mutuum Finance Launches Mass MUTM Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also launched a $100,000 giveaway wherein the participants who take part in the contest will be rewarded in $10,000 MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance: Decentralized Lending Revolution Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi decentralized lending revolution that offers the greatest extent of control over assets to users. It is an open multi-use double-lending platform built by merging Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C lending pool is accessed through smart contracts. The platform responds based on the market sentiment of the time, minimizing lenders’ revenue volatility and economic lending risk. Middlemen are cut out in the P2P model, paving the way for direct lending, which is ideal for volatile assets like meme coins. As Ethereum (ETH) eyes a potential breakout toward $5,000, investors are also turning to emerging DeFi protocols showing real momentum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) chief among them. Now in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035, Mutuum has already raised over $14.1 million and attracted more than 14,900 investors, with early participants set to gain huge gains when the token launches. Backed by a CertiK-audited security framework, a powerful dual-lending protocol, and a bold roadmap, MUTM is positioning itself as one of the most promising DeFi tokens of 2025. Secure your MUTM tokens now before Phase 7 begins and get in early on what could be a 100x altcoin in the next bull cycle.

What truly matters is how usable the offer is, how fair the payout terms are, and whether the rules make it possible to withdraw your winnings. A strong bonus should reward smart play, not just spending. This comparison looks at three platforms: Spartans, Caliente, and Rushbet, and breaks down how each handles bonus offers, eligibility, and real payout potential for crypto users. While Caliente and Rushbet have built strong regional followings, Spartans stands out with global accessibility, higher bonus multipliers, and full crypto support without the usual limitations. Caliente Falls Short on Global Access and Crypto Support Caliente is a well-known name across Latin America, particularly in Mexico, but its promotions remain locked to local regions. Welcome bonuses are often generous for domestic players, yet they come with national ID requirements and limited flexibility. The offers work for Fiat users but leave little room for global crypto players seeking speed and scale. The biggest limitation is the lack of crypto support. Caliente only accepts fiat and e-wallets, making transactions slower and costlier. In an industry moving toward decentralized convenience, Caliente is not structured to compete with the best crypto casinos offering instant payouts and global reach. Rushbet Stays Local While Crypto Players Look Elsewhere Rushbet has built strong brand recognition in countries like Colombia and Peru, offering local bonuses that suit regional currencies. A 100% deposit match may be appealing on the surface, but the offer loses value when compared to platforms like Spartans, which deliver larger bonuses with broader access. Terms and conditions also shift based on geography. Wagering requirements, payout limits, and bonus eligibility vary, which adds friction for players used to uniform crypto standards. Without support for digital currency and fast withdrawals, Rushbet struggles to align with the expectations of users seeking the best crypto casinos worldwide. Spartans Leads the Pack With High ROI and True Crypto Simplicity Spartans sets a new standard for welcome offers with a 300% casino bonus on just a $5 deposit. This gives players up to $200 in bonus funds from the smallest possible entry point. It is ideal for crypto users who want maximum value with minimal commitment. The platform supports BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, and AVAX, with deposits landing instantly in the player’s wallet. No banks, no cards, and no intermediaries. Where Spartans really shines is in its clarity. The welcome bonus comes with a fixed 35x wagering requirement, a 7-day validity period, and a 10x max payout. These terms remove confusion and give players a realistic path to success. Most crypto casinos either bury their restrictions or offer bonuses that are nearly impossible to unlock. Spartans keeps it transparent and achievable. The bonus is widely usable too. Only a small number of slots are excluded, meaning the majority of games contribute toward your wagering progress. That flexibility keeps gameplay fast and strategic, which suits users who prefer to move quickly. On top of the welcome bonus, Spartans also offers daily 25% reload bonuses. With a low $10 entry and the same clear 10x payout cap, this ongoing value makes Spartans one of the best crypto casinos for bonus hunters who want structure and consistency. Points to Remember If bonus value, transparency, and crypto compatibility are your priorities, Spartans stands out as the clear leader. With a 300% welcome bonus, low $5 deposit requirement, and daily reloads, it gives players powerful returns without added complexity. Its fixed 10x payout cap and simple terms create a reliable path for consistent gains. Caliente and Rushbet offer dependable regional experiences, but their fiat-only systems and bonus restrictions limit flexibility for global players. For those using Bitcoin, Ethereum, or stablecoins from anywhere in the world, Spartans provides a seamless, high-reward environment that few platforms can match.

However, this momentum now faces a critical test as mid-term resistance levels come into play. Will the bulls maintain control, or is a reversal on the horizon? ADA Pushes Above Key EMAs: Bulls Seize Short-Term Momentum Analyst Cexscan on X pointed out that Cardano (ADA) is exhibiting a bullish trend on the 30-minute chart. The asset’s price has surged above the 20, 50, and 100-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), indicating rising buying interest and momentum among short-term traders. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Targets $0.80 As Price Retests Key Level – Is An 85% Jump Ahead? Adding further strength to the outlook is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which currently sits in overbought territory. While this typically signals a possible pause or minor retracement, Cexscan believes that the strong bullish pressure evident in price action could override such a correction in the short run, as long as volume remains healthy. Overall, the combination of bullish EMAs, elevated RSI, and sustained momentum paints an optimistic picture for ADA. Cexscan emphasized that if the current trajectory holds, Cardano could continue its upward path, with intraday opportunities unfolding along the way. Cardano Caught In A Tight Range: Will The Breakout Come Soon? Thomas Anderson, analyzing Cardano’s 4-hour chart in a recent update, pointed out that the price was moving sideways around the $0.3374 zone. This consolidation is occurring between a defined resistance at $0.7612 and support at $0.6874, both marked with yellow horizontal lines. The market appears to be taking a breather, potentially gearing up for a more decisive move. Related Reading: A Breakout To Remember: Cardano Price Mirrors Market Conditions That Led To $3.10 ATH Adding to the picture is the 200-period Moving Average, highlighted in red, which sits just above the current price and acts as a dynamic resistance level. This moving average has repeatedly blocked bullish attempts, making it a crucial hurdle to watch. A clean break above it could be a major trigger for renewed buying interest. On the broader daily timeframe, Anderson observed that Cardano remains trapped within a larger consolidation pattern. The RSI indicator is hovering around 51, reflecting a neutral stance, while the MACD indicator is also showing little directional bias. This reinforces the view that the market is waiting for a breakout catalyst before choosing its next path. Anderson concluded by focusing on the ascending trendline resistance as a key technical level. A strong push above that line could pave the way for intraday gains, especially for scalpers. However, if ADA gets rejected at that level, it may head back toward the lower end of the range, offering potential shorting opportunities for traders watching closely.

Following this massive adoption by prominent companies, the overall ETH treasury reserve is now at new levels. Institutional Adoption Of Ethereum Is Still Growing Ethereum’s adoption , particularly at the institutional level, is demonstrating significant growth. In a notable development in the ETH financial foundation, the overall treasury reserve of the altcoin has risen to new landmarks. This milestone underscores a crucial trend of accumulation by protocol treasuries and institutional investors, bolstering trust in ETH’s long-term sustainability. Furthermore, it is indicative of the maturity of ETH’s ecosystem as a whole, as decentralized firms are placing a greater emphasis on capital reserves in order to weather market fluctuations and finance future growth. According to Phoenix, a crypto-related media, big companies are showing rising interest as they keep increasing their Ethereum holdings. Such a massive adoption of the altcoin by large treasury firms is a sign that cryptocurrency’s role in traditional financial markets is growing stronger. The report shared by the crypto media shows that the total Ethereum strategic reserve by these big entities now boasts 3,040,000 ETH, valued at a whopping $11.32 billion. This crucial milestone represents 2.51% of ETH’s total supply in circulation. Phoenix stated that these holdings highlight the changing dynamic between traditional institutions and digital assets as the market develops. Looking at the chart, about 67 large entities currently make up the $11.32 billion valuation of the strategic ETH reserve. Bitmine Immersion Technologies continues to maintain its position as the undisputed leader in ETH holdings, with a massive 833,100 ETH, valued at $3.10 billion. Other notable leading companies include SharpLink Gaming , The Ether Machine, and the Ethereum Foundation, among others. ETH Treasury Reserves Better Than ETH Spot ETFs Investments While ETH treasury reserves have reached new highs, Spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are experiencing huge outflows. Standard Chartered, a financial behemoth, recently offered insights on the two initiatives, addressing the current disparity between them. According to the leading bank, investing in Ethereum treasury shares is preferable to purchasing ETH exchange-traded funds. The Bank’s digital asset researcher, Geoffrey Kendrick, stated that treasuries are providing shareholders with better value for their money than ETFs. Kendrick’s statement implies that ETH treasury stability is still quite strong, highlighting that ETH treasury businesses are starting to outweigh their Bitcoin counterparts in terms of inflows. The expert’s optimism towards ETH treasuries is driven by the fact that Net Asset Value (NAV) multiples are currently about 1. Specifically, NAV is determined by dividing a treasury company’s market capitalization by the total quantity of Ethereum held. Federick is confident that the NAV multiple remains above 1, as the treasury companies are allowing investors to legally evade unfavorable regulations.",Ethereum|bitcoin|Bitmine Immersion Technologies|ETFs|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum foundation|ethereum news|ethereum price|Ethereum treasury|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Geoffrey Kendrick|NAV|Net Asset Value|Phoenix|Sharplink Gaming|Spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds|Standard Chartered|The Ether Machine,EN,0,0,ETH|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|FIAT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-08 16:00:43

With the Demo Trading Platform now active, BlockDAG allows users to purchase BDAG at $0.0016 and access a live trading interface for risk-free practice. This move gives early buyers a unique edge, making the experience interactive and practical well before BDAG lists. This initiative is part of BlockDAG’s roadmap ahead of its GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. Unlike many crypto projects that focus only on promises, BlockDAG has already delivered vital tools, with the trading dashboard at its core. Buyers do not have to wait for listing day to explore the platform. BDAG can be traded now, the interface can be understood in advance, and buyers can plan their strategy before it lists publicly at the confirmed $0.05 price. Live Dashboard Simulates Trades With Real BDAG Purchases The Demo Trading Platform combines actual BDAG purchases with a simulated selling experience. When users apply the code TRADEBDAG, they secure BDAG at the $0.0016 price and gain entry to a professional-grade trading dashboard. The Buy option is live, confirming transactions instantly and updating balances. The Sell option runs in demo mode, allowing users to test trades and refine their approach without any financial risk. The interface features real-time charts, order book insights, and complete controls that mimic those found on major centralized exchanges. This prepares users for the price action and trading volume expected when BDAG lists across 20+ exchanges. In crypto trading, being ready is key. Most presale buyers must wait for launch day to explore the trading environment, often dealing with new systems under pressure. BlockDAG changes that by offering immediate access and a familiar platform to practice on. This reduces uncertainty and helps buyers finalize their trading plans before launch. As BDAG is set to list at $0.05, those who buy now at $0.0016 can expect a 3,025% return. The chance to practice in advance means these buyers are better prepared to act quickly and confidently when BDAG hits public markets. Few presale opportunities provide this kind of tactical edge. $365.5M Raised With 24.7B Coins Sold Ahead Of Launch BlockDAG’s Demo Trading Platform sits within a wider and already functioning ecosystem. With $365.5M raised and 24.7 billion BDAG coins sold, BlockDAG targets $600M before the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. This is backed by real infrastructure: The X1 mobile miner app, used by over 2.5 million people, simulates daily mining rewards. 19,000 ASIC miners have been sold, powering a hybrid system that uses both DAG and Proof-of-Work to produce 10 blocks per second, with potential scalability up to 15,000 TPS. A Cold Wallet integration is also nearing launch. This will allow BDAG holders to manage assets securely while accessing DeFi tools. Additionally, BlockDAG is EVM-compatible. This enables developers to run Ethereum-based smart contracts without needing to recode them. Over 4,500 developers are currently active, with 300+ dApps under development. BlockDAG is establishing itself not only as a trading platform but also as a long-term Layer 1 contender with full ecosystem growth potential. As the GLOBAL LAUNCH release nears, the current $0.0016 price will last. After August 11, BDAG will return to the original listing price of $0.0276. Until then, using the TRADEBDAG code gives buyers a unique window to enter early and train before the public launch. This goes beyond a low price. It gives users a critical head start. Familiarity with the trading tools, real-time price actions, and strategy planning gives early access users a serious edge once volume and volatility rise. Wrap Up! The TRADEBDAG code grants access to BlockDAG’s Demo Trading Platform. It gives early users a rare advantage to buy now, practice today, and aim for returns after launch. With $365.5M secured and the platform already live, the countdown is on. For those seeking more than just to hold coins, for those wanting to start strong when markets open, BlockDAG delivers the tools and access few others provide.The key is not just buying BDAG. It’s being ready when the market goes live. TRADEBDAG provides that readiness starting now.

Ali describes this price point as a “magnet,” suggesting that once $4,000 is cleared, momentum and liquidity could swiftly accelerate ETH to this next major level. The $4,000 Resistance: Why It Matters Ethereum has been flirting with the $4,000 mark for several sessions. At the time of writing, ETH is trading around $3,909, just shy of this crucial threshold. The $4,000 level represents more than just a round number; it is a historically significant resistance zone that has previously marked local tops or points of strong rejection. Overcoming this barrier would signal a decisive shift in market sentiment, confirming that buyers are in control and willing to push valuations higher. $6,400 becomes a magnet if Ethereum $ETH breaks $4,000! pic.twitter.com/e53iO4h3Xn — Ali (@ali_charts) August 8, 2025 The psychological nature of $4,000 also makes it a battlefield for traders. Bulls see it as a breakout point with massive upside potential , while bears defend it to protect existing short positions. This tension has created heightened volatility, with ETH’s intraday range swinging between $3,805 and $3,952 in recent hours. $6,400: A Technically Sound Target? Ali’s projection of $6,400 is not arbitrary. It’s based on technical models and historical price action. In particular, this level aligns with projected Fibonacci extension levels that often act as magnets for price once major resistances are cleared. If ETH can gain sustained traction above $4,000, it would likely trigger short liquidations and attract breakout traders and institutions, rapidly pushing ETH toward this target. The market has seen similar explosive moves in past cycles where key resistance levels were flipped into support, igniting euphoric surges. This time, the convergence of improving market sentiment, broader institutional interest, and Ethereum’s upcoming upgrades may provide the right backdrop for another significant rally. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Risks and Short-Term Scenarios Despite the bullish outlook, Ethereum must close decisively above $4,000 with strong volume to validate the breakout. A failure to do so could result in a retracement toward $3,600 or lower, where the next significant support lies. Traders and investors should therefore approach the market with a balanced perspective, recognizing both the opportunity and the risk at hand. The macroeconomic environment, as well as developments surrounding Ethereum ETFs and overall liquidity conditions, could also influence ETH’s ability to sustain a breakout. However, current market dynamics appear to favor the bulls, especially if momentum continues to build. Outlook Ethereum is on the verge of a potentially significant move. If Ali’s analysis plays out and ETH breaks above $4,000, the $6,400 level could soon come into focus as the next logical destination for price discovery. For now, all eyes remain on whether the bulls can finally push Ethereum past this major hurdle, setting the stage for what could be a historic rally.

49755033,https://timestabloid.com/?p=77419,1754669107,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Predicts XRP Price for September 2025,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-predicts-xrp-price-for-september-2025/,"In a detailed video shared via a tweet, Levi, a well-known member of the Crypto Crusaders community, provided his updated XRP price target for September 2025. While emphasizing that he seldom issues price forecasts tied to specific timeframes, Levi stated that current macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and market structure improvements have prompted him to project XRP’s valuation for next month. The video directed to his audience, laid out the logic behind Levi’s price range estimate of $4 to $5 for XRP. Levi attributed this projection to three primary macroeconomic and market-related factors. First, he cited global trade policies and tariffs, including recent developments under President Trump’s administration. Second, he identified the Federal Reserve’s interest rate trajectory as a pivotal influence. Lastly, he emphasized that potential advancements surrounding XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and infrastructure-related innovations within the XRP ecosystem could significantly affect investor sentiment and market performance. XRP: My INSANE Price Target For September 2025 #XRP pic.twitter.com/FYLsWtb0ml — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) August 6, 2025 Tariff Actions and Short-Term Market Volatility Regarding trade policies, Levi discussed the impact of new tariffs imposed by President Trump on nations such as India and Switzerland. He noted that these measures, particularly in reaction to India’s continued purchase of Russian oil and Switzerland’s unsuccessful trade negotiations with the U.S., have caused short-term volatility in financial markets. Levi explained that although these developments are perceived as bearish in the immediate term, historical precedent suggests that such market dips are typically followed by policy reversals or trade agreements, leading to recoveries. He added that the short-term market response to these geopolitical actions, such as the brief correction seen after tariffs were announced against Canada and India, reflects uncertainty but not lasting damage. Interest Rates, Consumer Spending, and Historical Comparisons Levi further assessed the broader economic backdrop by examining domestic indicators, including declining consumer spending and rising unemployment in the United States. He argued that these conditions could force the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. The analyst pointed to the similarities between the current economic environment and the early stages of the 2020 bull market, where stimulus and rate cuts contributed to rapid asset price appreciation. Levi cited consumer data and historical market behavior to support the view that the Fed is likely to act in response to these conditions to prevent deflation. He referenced data showing that consumer spending is rapidly declining, with inflation already contained, making deflation a potential risk. This, in his view, would leave the Fed with little choice but to reduce interest rates, following the precedent of other regions such as Europe and China. ETF Developments and Levi’s Price Forecast for September In forming his projection, Levi also referenced insights from Grok, a language model, which suggested that if the Federal Reserve cuts rates and XRP ETFs are approved, XRP’s price could reach a high of $5 or a low of $3.50, with a base case at $4.20. Levi described these figures as “reasonable,” particularly in scenarios where ETFs begin injecting institutional capital into the asset. Drawing comparisons with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF launches, he suggested that ETF inflows alone could significantly elevate XRP’s price above current levels. While Levi expressed skepticism about the plausibility of XRP hitting $10 to $15 by September, he maintained confidence in a moderate increase. He explained that based on historical lag effects from monetary policy adjustments, any impact from a rate cut would be partially delayed, with full effects likely observed closer to the end of the year. However, ETF approval would offer a more immediate boost to market demand and liquidity. Levi concluded by stating his expectation that XRP will trade between $4 and $5 in September 2025, provided that either a rate cut or ETF approval occurs.

The cryptocurrency market went through a period of enhanced volatility, and even though Bitcoin is trading flat at the end of it, this doesn’t show the full picture. This time last week, BTC was going through a considerable correction, which resulted in a crash to around $112,000 on August 2nd. From there, the price attempted to recover and pushed above $115K a day later, but the sellers weren’t having it and initiated another serious assault, which resuled in a drop below $113,000. That’s when the situation started to turn. Bitcoin was able to recover and started consolidating above $114K before the first important news of the week took place. US President Donald Trump signed an executive order, which aims to permit Americans to include Bitcoin and other digital assets in their 401(k) retirement plans. The policy wants to expand individual investment freedom, while also reducing government control over retirement assets, citing the potentially greater returns alternative investments can deliver. Bitcoin, alongside the rest of the market boomed on the news, but what happened next was a sight to behold for a huge community within the crypto industry. Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission reached a turning point. Both parties filed a joint stipulation seeking a dismissal of the appeals. The case is more or less over, pending an approval of the court. This ends a more than 5-year old legal dispute which has put the classification of crypto assets as securities or commodities in the spotlight. A lot of it took place during Biden’s administration, when the former Chairman of the US SEC – Gary Gensler – was regulating by enforcement. In any case, many of the altcoins have charted considerable gains during the last seven days. Ethereum is up by 9% and is currently trading just slightly below $4,000, while XRP itself is up by about 6%. Cardano’s ADA is up by 9.6%, Stellar’s XLM i sup by 11%, and so forth. it’s interesting to see if Bitcoin will continue losing its grounds or if another rally would leave the altcoins in the dust.

US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to allow Bitcoin and other digital and alternative assets into US 401(k) retirement plans. XRP’s Price Skyrockets by 13% as Ripple and SEC Drop Court Battle. The case between the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple Labs, spanning for more than 5 years, is about to end. Both parties have agreed to withdraw their appeals. Bitcoin Miners Weather the Storm: No Capitulation in Sight at 7.4% Price Surge. Bitcoin miners are holding strong as prices increase by 7.4% from the last difficulty bottom. They are showing no signs of capitulation, despite the ongoing market turmoil.

They revealed that a staggering 250 million USDC was minted at the USDC Treasury. This event is not just a number; it carries substantial implications for the broader crypto ecosystem, especially concerning market stability and crypto liquidity . What Does 250 Million USDC Minted Signify? When we talk about USDC minted , it means new units of the USD Coin stablecoin have been created and added to circulation. USDC is a digital dollar, pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, making it a crucial asset for traders and investors seeking stability in the volatile crypto market. The process of minting is typically driven by demand from institutions and large investors who wish to convert fiat currency into a stable digital asset. The USDC Treasury acts as the central hub for these operations. It manages the issuance and redemption of USDC, ensuring that each newly minted coin is backed by an equivalent amount of reserves. This transparency is a cornerstone of stablecoin trust. Therefore, a large minting event often signals significant inflows of capital into the crypto space. Why is Stablecoin Minting Important for Crypto Liquidity? The minting of a large sum like 250 million USDC directly impacts crypto liquidity . Increased liquidity means there is more capital available for trading, lending, and other financial activities within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. This can lead to tighter bid-ask spreads, making it easier and cheaper for participants to execute trades. Moreover, robust stablecoin minting often indicates growing institutional interest. Large players frequently use stablecoins to move significant capital efficiently across various exchanges and protocols without incurring the delays and costs associated with traditional banking systems. This influx of stable assets can help stabilize market conditions, providing a less volatile environment for other cryptocurrencies. Who is Whale Alert Crypto and Why Do They Matter? Whale Alert crypto is a well-known tracking service that monitors large transactions on various blockchain networks. Their reports provide valuable insights into significant movements of digital assets, often involving ‘whales’ – individuals or entities holding large amounts of cryptocurrency. By reporting events like USDC minted , Whale Alert offers transparency into market dynamics that might otherwise go unnoticed. Their alerts help market participants understand where capital is flowing, potentially signaling upcoming market trends or shifts in sentiment. For instance, a large stablecoin minting event, as reported by Whale Alert, can suggest an intention to deploy capital into the market, either for purchasing other cryptocurrencies or for participating in DeFi protocols. This real-time data is invaluable for informed decision-making. Navigating the Implications of Increased USDC Treasury Activity The continuous activity at the USDC Treasury , including substantial minting operations, underscores the growing utility and adoption of stablecoins. While increased liquidity is generally beneficial, it also brings certain considerations. One aspect to watch is the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny on stablecoins, given their expanding role in the global financial system. Furthermore, the centralized nature of USDC’s issuance, despite its transparency, remains a point of discussion within the decentralized community. However, for many, the benefits of stability and efficient capital movement outweigh these concerns. The minting of 250 million USDC highlights the ongoing demand for reliable digital dollars in a rapidly evolving market. In conclusion, the recent minting of 250 million USDC is a clear indicator of sustained demand for stable digital assets and a boost to overall crypto liquidity . This event, brought to light by Whale Alert, reinforces the critical role stablecoins play in facilitating seamless transactions and fostering growth within the decentralized finance landscape. As the crypto market matures, the transparent operations of the USDC Treasury will remain a key element in maintaining investor confidence and driving further adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does it mean when USDC is minted? When USDC is minted, it means new units of the USD Coin stablecoin are created and put into circulation, typically in response to demand from users converting fiat currency into digital dollars. Each minted USDC is backed 1:1 by reserves. How does 250 million USDC minted affect the crypto market? A large minting event like 250 million USDC significantly increases crypto liquidity, making it easier and cheaper to trade and participate in DeFi. It often signals new capital entering the market, potentially leading to increased buying pressure for other cryptocurrencies. What is the role of the USDC Treasury? The USDC Treasury is responsible for managing the issuance and redemption of USDC. It ensures that every USDC in circulation is backed by an equivalent amount of reserves, maintaining the stablecoin’s 1:1 peg to the US dollar. Why is Whale Alert important for crypto enthusiasts? Whale Alert tracks and reports large cryptocurrency transactions, providing transparency into significant capital movements. This helps crypto enthusiasts and investors understand market dynamics and potential trends, such as large stablecoin inflows or outflows. Are there any risks associated with large stablecoin minting events? While generally positive for liquidity, large stablecoin minting events can sometimes draw increased regulatory attention due to their growing influence on the financial system. Centralization concerns related to stablecoin issuers are also a topic of ongoing discussion.

This substantial stablecoin minting event, reported by Whale Alert, signals a notable shift in digital asset liquidity. What does such a large infusion of the digital dollar mean for the broader crypto market? What Does USDC Minting Actually Mean? When we talk about USDC minting , we are referring to the creation of new units of USD Coin (USDC). USDC is a stablecoin, which means its value is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Circle, the company behind USDC, issues these new tokens. Each new USDC token created is theoretically backed by an equivalent dollar held in reserve. This process ensures the stablecoin maintains its peg and trustworthiness. The minting process is a critical function for stablecoins, allowing supply to expand or contract based on demand. Why is this Stablecoin Minting Event Significant? The minting of 250 million USDC is a considerable sum, even in the vast cryptocurrency landscape. This large-scale stablecoin minting event can indicate several things. Firstly, it often suggests a rising demand for stablecoins within the crypto space. Traders and investors might be moving funds into stable assets, perhaps preparing for new investment opportunities or seeking refuge during volatile periods. This influx of liquidity could also signal institutional interest. Moreover, such a large minting could precede significant market movements. How Does USDC Minting Affect the Crypto Market Impact ? The immediate crypto market impact of such a large USDC minting is usually an increase in overall liquidity. More USDC means more capital available for trading, lending, and other decentralized finance (DeFi) activities. This can lead to tighter spreads on exchanges and more efficient price discovery. Ultimately, enhanced liquidity generally benefits market participants by making it easier to execute large trades without significant price slippage. Consider the potential scenarios: Increased Buying Pressure: A surge in USDC could be deployed to buy volatile crypto assets, potentially pushing their prices higher. DeFi Growth: More USDC available can boost activity in lending protocols, liquidity pools, and other DeFi applications, fostering ecosystem growth. Market Stability: As a stable asset, increased USDC supply can also provide a cushion during volatile times, offering a safe haven for capital. However, it is crucial to remember that minting alone does not guarantee a specific outcome. The subsequent actions of those holding the newly minted USDC will determine the actual market impact. The Role of the USDC Treasury in Maintaining Stability The USDC Treasury , managed by Circle and its partners, plays a pivotal role in the stablecoin’s operation. It acts as the central hub where new USDC is issued and redeemed. The transparency of these operations is vital for maintaining trust in USDC. Public reports from entities like Whale Alert, which track large transactions, contribute to this transparency. The treasury’s ability to manage supply and demand effectively is what underpins USDC’s stability. They ensure that every USDC in circulation is backed by reserves, typically held in cash and short-duration U.S. Treasury bonds. This robust backing mechanism is fundamental to USDC’s status as a reliable digital dollar in the crypto economy. Navigating the Future of the Digital Dollar The continued minting of large sums of USDC underscores the growing importance of the digital dollar in the global financial landscape. Stablecoins like USDC bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning decentralized world. They offer a stable, liquid, and easily transferable asset that combines the best features of fiat currency with the advantages of blockchain technology. As regulatory frameworks evolve and institutional adoption expands, the role of USDC and similar stablecoins will likely become even more central. Their ability to facilitate fast, low-cost international transactions and provide a reliable store of value within the volatile crypto market positions them as key players for the future. Monitoring minting events gives us valuable insights into these ongoing trends. Conclusion: A Glimpse into Crypto’s Evolving Liquidity The recent minting of 250 million USDC is more than just a large transaction; it’s a window into the evolving dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. This event highlights increasing demand for stablecoins, potential shifts in market liquidity, and the critical role of the USDC Treasury in maintaining the stability of this essential digital asset. As the crypto ecosystem matures, understanding these movements becomes increasingly important for both seasoned investors and newcomers alike. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does “250 million USDC minted” mean? A1: It means that 250 million new units of USD Coin (USDC) have been created and added to the total supply. Each USDC is designed to be worth one US dollar. Q2: Why is new USDC minted? A2: New USDC is minted primarily to meet increasing demand from users and institutions who want to acquire stable digital assets for trading, investing, or participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities. Q3: How does this minting event affect the crypto market? A3: Large minting events typically increase liquidity in the crypto market, potentially signaling future buying pressure for other cryptocurrencies or increased activity in DeFi protocols. It means more capital is available in the ecosystem. Q4: Is USDC backed by real dollars? A4: Yes, Circle, the issuer of USDC, states that every USDC in circulation is fully backed by an equivalent amount of US dollar reserves, held in a mix of cash and short-duration US Treasury bonds.

This is to resolve allegations related to inadequate due diligence on its former partner, Binance, and failures in its anti-money laundering program. NYDFS Probe Finds Paxos Lacked Oversight According to an August 7 press release, the terms of the settlement require the stablecoin issuer to pay a $26.5 million fine and invest $22 million in its compliance program. Paxos previously issued the Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin until 2023, when the NYDFS ordered it to stop over the exchange’s poor geofencing and sanctions controls. According to the regulator, the action was the “first orderly wind down of a stablecoin.” “Regulated entities must maintain appropriate risk management frameworks that correspond to their business risks, which includes relationships with business partners and third-party vendors,” said Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris. Paxos, licensed in 2015 as a limited-purpose trust company, was authorized to operate in the virtual currency space. It later entered a partnership with Binance to issue, market, and distribute BUSD. As part of its regulatory obligations, the firm was required to conduct regular due diligence on Binance. However, New York’s financial watchdog found that it did not have proper controls in place to monitor for serious illegal activity happening on or through the exchange. It also failed to escalate red flags to its senior management and board. One key issue was Binance’s “lax geofencing,” which allowed users in the U.S. to access its unlicensed exchange. A review of historical transactions between 2017 and 2022, focusing on selected digital assets, revealed that approximately $1.6 billion that moved through it was linked to criminal activity. The investigation also found that the platform had processed payments involving entities that had already been sanctioned by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Compliance Issues Beyond its shortcomings with Binance, the New York regulator also found that Paxos had been running a weak compliance program for years. The company’s Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures were described as “unsophisticated,” allowing users with shared addresses, overlapping documents, and suspicious behavior to open multiple accounts undetected. Its poor transaction monitoring system also failed to catch clear signs of money laundering. Authorities noted that the firm had no clear rules for launching investigations after receiving law enforcement requests, which further delayed the detection of illicit activity on the platform. Paxos has since moved to rebrand itself as a compliance-focused blockchain infrastructure provider. The company has stated that the issues identified were historical, have been fully resolved, and did not impact customer accounts. It continues to operate other regulated stablecoins, including Pax Dollar (USDP) and PayPal USD (PYUSD).

Ethereum (ETH) led the rally, breaking past $4,000, while XRP, Stellar (XLM), and Chainlink (LINK) posted double-digit gains. The market’s bullish momentum is largely fueled by key regulatory and policy developments, notably President Donald Trump’s executive order expected to allow crypto investments in 401(k) retirement plans, adding to the pro-crypto shift in US policy. Key crypto news this week The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) clarified that certain liquid staking activities do not qualify as securities, providing regulatory relief for Ethereum staking operations. Meanwhile, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) launched its “Crypto Sprint” initiative to foster innovation and streamline crypto regulations. In a landmark move, President Trump signed an executive order permitting Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and other digital assets in 401(k) plans, potentially channeling billions into the market. Analysts predict sustained buying pressure as a result. Additionally, Ripple and the SEC officially ended their long-standing legal tussle, boosting market sentiment around XRP.

The top altcoin traded around $3,960 at the time of writing. The rally was bolstered by corporate buying, with BitMine Immersion Technologies, led by Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, holding 833,000 ETH valued at roughly $2.9 billion. SharpLink Gaming (SBET) also expanded its Ethereum treasury, owning 521,939 ETH after purchasing 83,561 ETH between July 28 and August 3 for $303 million at an average price of $3,634. All of SharpLink’s ETH is currently staked, yielding 929 ETH in rewards, further solidifying Ethereum’s appeal as a treasury asset.

Source: TradingView, Binance. That said, cracks are starting to show. The RSI has pushed into overbought territory at 71, often a sign of buyer exhaustion before a pullback. A healthy correction toward immediate support at $0.78 could provide the strong footing needed for the next leg higher. On the 4-hour chart, the MACD line continues to widen its lead over the signal line, suggesting the short-term uptrend still has staying power despite the risk of a cooldown. With a stronger footing, the breakout path can extend to reclaim resistance levels at $0.84 and $0.94, the level that capped its recent bull run and the gateway for a continuation. Fully realized, the pattern sets a breakout target of $1.10, representing a potential 46% gain from current levels. While the $10 milestone remains distant, the long-term onboarding of developers across chains and deeper integration into the U.S. TradFi market could build the demand needed to bring it into view. With potential 401(k) adoption, and the October 10 deadline for a spot Cardano ETF decision, the added fuel of rate cuts could attract fresh retail and institutional interest. This Cycle Narrative Could See Stronger Gains While most large-cap coins now consolidate under weak buy pressure, low-cap meme coins like TROLL are posting 2x gains in a single day. On the speculative scene, attention is what attracts fresh retail flows. Few see as much mind share as “mission coins,” fueled purely by social momentum and community conviction.

According to the Financial Times, traders can now keep their funds with BBVA instead of leaving them on the Binance platform. This move is part of Binance’s efforts to rebuild trust after a $4 billion fine in 2023 and rising worries about the risks of keeping assets on crypto exchanges. Binance and BBVA Put a Shield Around Investors’ Funds Crypto investors have grown cautious since the collapse of FTX in 2022, which left billions of dollars locked in bankruptcy . The incident exposed the risks of keeping funds directly on trading platforms. Under this arrangement, BBVA, an independent custodian, will keep traders’ funds in the U.S. Treasuries. Binance will then accept these funds as trading margin. This structure separates custody from trading. This initiative is a common safeguard in traditional finance but is still rare in the crypto world. One person familiar with the deal said it is designed to prevent “a hypothetical FTX 2.0.” By keeping assets with a trusted bank instead of directly on an exchange, it creates a protective layer that shields investors if an exchange faces operational or financial trouble. BBVA Brings Big-Bank Credibility to Binance’s Crypto Push BBVA is a major Spanish and Latin American bank with strong international recognition, bringing significant credibility to the partnership with Binance. According to one source, the bank’s name alone can speed up the due diligence process for traders deciding whether to work with Binance. The bank has been steadily growing its crypto services. In July 2024, BBVA launched Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) trading and custody services. It has even advised wealthy clients to allocate 3% to 7% of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies. The Binance–BBVA deal signals growing cooperation between traditional banks and the crypto sector. Traditional banks are increasingly open to working with the crypto industry. This is supported by favorable U.S. policy under the Trump administration and the European Union’s new MiCA regulations. Part of a Larger Industry Shift This partnership is part of a larger trend among crypto exchanges to offer off-exchange custody solutions. In January 2024, Binance allowed larger clients to use independent custodians like Sygnum and FlowBank. Before that, clients could only store their assets on the Binance exchange or with its custody partner, Ceffu. Notably, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission described Ceffu as a “rebranded Binance entity.” Other major exchanges have taken similar steps. In February 2024, Deribit, which is set to be acquired by Coinbase , partnered with BitGo and Copper to let clients trade while keeping assets in qualified custody .

SOL / USDT 4-hour chart, descending channel breakout feeds into a head and shoulder pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. Post-breakout momentum, however, has started to stall, with resistance emerging at $180 as key indicators flash early warning signs. The RSI has reversed sharply after touching the overbought threshold at 70, often signaling buyer exhaustion before a corrective pullback. The MACD tells a similar story, flattening above the signal line, often an early sign of a short-term reversal on the 4-hour chart. A retest of the channel’s upper resistance trendline as support, in line with the $175 resistance, could be the next step to find more level footing for continued upside. From there, the Solana price can reattempt a breakout from a 7-month head and shoulder pattern. Its neckline rests at $186, the key threshold for a move toward its previous all-time high at $297, representing a potential 75% gain from current prices. While still far from the 5x needed to challenge ETH, fundamentals create a compelling argument.

Bonk’s latest price is near $0.000025, but trading volume is fading, and another meme rally seems uncertain. Polkadot also shows weakness, with DOT trading below key averages and trying to hold above $3.60. Both projects may still hold promise, but if you are tracking the best crypto for the future, Cold Wallet stands out through clear price performance. Cold Wallet’s presale is showing gains already, and it’s only in stage 17 out of 150. The current price is $0.00998, but this could rise fast. If it reaches Stage 30 soon, the price may double. Each completed round means fewer tokens and more value for early buyers. The presale is not just active, it is rising with every tier. Stage 17 in Focus: Cold Wallet Presale Picks Up Pace Cold Wallet is now at stage 17 of 150 with a live price of $0.00998. So far, it has raised $5.8 million, and each stage pushes the cost higher. If it reaches Stage 30, the price could be twice what it is now. That means those buying today are getting in before the next big jump. This is not just early entry, it’s built-in value gain. Each finished stage boosts the price, which means a smaller price gap for later buyers. Early buyers at $0.007 already see returns of over 30%. If the listing target holds, the return could go past 3,000%. As more tiers fill, later gains shrink, making stage 17 still early. This setup is why some now see Cold Wallet as the best crypto for the future. The value is not just in the utility; it’s in the presale design that benefits early action. As the stages move forward, the benefit of getting in now becomes more clear. While Cold Wallet’s app and CWT coin are made for crypto cashback rewards, what’s getting attention now is the way the presale is built. With 134 stages still to go, buying at $0.00998 gives early access to the next jumps in value. For many, this setup is their best crypto for the future pick, and it’s still early in the run. BONK Trades Sideways as Volume Slows Down BONK is trading near $0.000025, and short-term forecasts show a narrow path between $0.000022 and $0.000027. Analysts watching BONK say the drop in trading volume shows weaker market interest going into August. Some short-term models still suggest a bounce, but the current feeling is mixed as BONK has not picked up the energy it had during its last big move. Mid-term forecasts for BONK in 2025 show a range from $0.000017 to $0.000029, which is not far from where it stands today. If the market sees a wide rally, BONK could still move up. But its large supply means it would need strong volume for any major jump. Buyers watching BONK are waiting to see if it can hold support or fall further. Right now, it is stable, but projects like Cold Wallet are gaining attention as some look for better returns elsewhere. DOT Struggles to Recover as Charts Stay Weak DOT is sitting just above $3.60, and the current technical signals show pressure. The RSI is around 40, and the MACD is still in red. It is also trading below its 20-day and 200-day averages, which are at $4.04 and $4.36. These signs suggest momentum remains low. The Stochastic shows a %K near 17, meaning DOT might be oversold. A bounce is possible, but DOT would first need to rise above $4.00 for any real shift. Looking at the larger picture, the charts point to $3.01 as the next support if current levels fail. The main resistance areas are now at $3.75 and $4.67. Without a clear reversal soon, DOT may stay in this range or slide lower. Polkadot’s core development continues, and Gavin Wood’s recent ideas show it is still active. But price movement tells a different story. In comparison, Cold Wallet is showing steady gains, while DOT feels stuck. Key Takeaway: One Moves, Two Wait BONK has not dropped yet, but its forecast shows slow growth unless volume rises. DOT is also showing weakness, with chart signals pointing to a risk of a drop if resistance is not cleared. Both remain on the radar, but they are not seeing sharp gains at this moment. That’s why Cold Wallet stands out for some. It is at stage 17 in its crypto presale , priced at $0.00998, and each stage pushes the price higher. Gains are already happening for early buyers, with those in from Stage 10 seeing a 30% return. With 134 stages left, this step-by-step rise could make it the best crypto for the future for buyers who want to act early instead of reacting late.

Here's Critical Price Levels To Watch For Kaspa, Aptos & Render",https://bitzo.com/2025/08/are-we-early-to-altcoin-season-heres-critical-price-levels-to-watch-for-kaspa-aptos-render,"Crypto enthusiasts are buzzing with anticipation, wondering if the altcoin season is upon us. With dramatic price shifts on the horizon, the spotlight turns to the key levels for Kaspa , Aptos , and Render . Discover which coins are showing promise and might be ready for significant growth in the coming days. Kaspa Price Surge with Limited Long-Term Gains Kaspa recorded a sharp monthly uptick of nearly 15% while showing only about a 1% gain over the past six months. The price moved between $0.0676 and $0.1141 with recent activity reflecting renewed investor interest. Price action over the month suggests a rebound phase with more dynamic trading, whereas the longer-term trend has experienced very little overall growth. Indicators reveal that despite recent gains, market sentiment remains cautious with modest momentum shifts during this period. Currently, Kaspa faces key pivot levels that require close monitoring. The nearest resistance stands at $0.1397, with a second hurdle at $0.1861, while traders find support near $0.0468 and an additional protective level at $0.000371. The coin’s current trading range between $0.0676 and $0.1141 highlights the delicate balance between bulls and bears. Despite the month’s positive price movement, moving average assessments suggest a cautious market sentiment. Traders might explore opportunities by closely watching for a breakout above $0.1397 or preparing for a pullback down to $0.0468 before buying. Aptos Price Pulse: Tracking Recent Trends and Key Levels APT recorded a 3.86% gain over the last week, with a 0.56% rise over the past month. Over six months, a decline of 23.32% is evident. The coin traded between $3.65 and $5.60 during recent observations, reflecting moderate volatility. Price action shows intermittent rallies that struggled to gain momentum amid a broader downtrend. Technical figures indicate mixed performance, with short bursts of recovery failing to offset long-term losses. Price behavior over the past half-year highlights cautious moves and uneven gains, pointing to a market waiting for clearer directional signals. Aptos currently trades in a defined range with clear technical markers. The coin’s price sits between $3.65 at the low end and $5.60 at the high, with the nearest support at $2.98 and the nearest resistance at $6.89. The weekly price movement suggests short-term bullish pressure, but technical indicators favor subdued market sentiment. The Relative Strength Index at 46.72 indicates a near-neutral stance with a slight bearish lean. Moving average recommendations hint at potential selling pressure below support. Trading within this range requires careful observation, with a break above $6.89 possibly sparking renewed buying interest and a slip below $2.98 prompting further downside moves. Altcoin Price Trends and Key Levels Amid Market Volatility RENDER has shown significant movement over the past month, achieving an 18.30% increase, while experiencing a 10.77% decline over the six-month period. The weekly change was modest at 1.68%, indicating short-term steadiness amid broader fluctuations. The recent monthly surge suggests renewed investor interest and potential short-term momentum, contrasted with the longer-term downturn highlighting underlying market weakness. Price swings illustrate the coin’s volatility, with recent gains reflecting immediate demand amid persistent bearish pressure over six months. This mixed picture indicates that optimism has driven prices higher recently, but longer-term factors continue to influence overall performance. The current price ranges between $2.94 and $4.62, with a clear floor at $2.15 and resistance near $5.51. A neutral RSI of 50.03 reflects the lack of a decisive trend, alongside slightly negative momentum. Bulls may seek a break above $5.51 to target $7.19, while bears could push the price down to $0.47 if the $2.15 level fails. Traders should monitor these key levels for decisive moves that could signal a shift in market control and create trading opportunities within this range. Conclusion Altcoin season might be approaching. Critical price levels to watch are essential for gauging the movements of KAS , APT , and RENDER . These coins have shown potential but need to break through specific price points for confirmation. Monitoring these levels can provide insights into market direction and opportunities for investors.

Speaking on Mornings with Maria on Friday, Altman described the technology as a leap forward, capable of delivering assistance on par with having “PhD-level experts at your fingertips.” “You can imagine, like a physician assistant, that a company could build with GPT-5,” Altman said. “That would really potentially save a lot of lives.” He emphasized that the model’s advanced reasoning and problem-solving capabilities could be applied in critical areas such as healthcare, finance, and engineering. Altman also positioned GPT-5 as a powerful new revenue source for the company, outlining plans to sell AI tools directly to businesses. “I think a company like OpenAI will be able to build a $100 billion business line, just selling products to other businesses,” he said, predicting that the productivity and efficiency gains would justify significant investment from clients. One of the most promising uses Altman pointed to was personalized workplace AI assistants. These tools could learn an individual worker’s processes and automate repetitive tasks, allowing employees to focus on higher-level work. According to Altman, such systems could give people “a huge additional leverage to work at the higher level.” Industries that could see the biggest early benefits include software engineering, finance, healthcare, and data entry. Altman cited feedback from developers who have been testing GPT-5, saying, “You hear people say they’re twice as productive, five times as productive. These are huge, huge numbers.” While optimistic about the long-term impact of AI on employment, Altman acknowledged short-term disruptions. Some roles may shrink as automation advances, he said, but he expects entirely new job categories to emerge, ones that would not have been possible before AI’s development. “There will be totally new things that just didn’t exist, they weren’t even possible to think about before AI,” Altman said. GPT-5’s low price puts pressure on competitors According to OpenAI, GPT-5 is currently rolling out to all ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers worldwide on web, mobile, and desktop. Access for ChatGPT Enterprise and Edu plans is expected soon. Altman noted that OpenAI worked to keep costs low across all versions of the model, even at the premium tiers. The launch of GPT-5 comes just days after OpenAI surprised the tech community by releasing two open-source models. According to Cryptopolitan , these releases, gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, mark OpenAI’s first open-weight AI models since 2019. Altman has called GPT-5 “the best model in the world,” though benchmark testing suggests it only slightly outperforms rival models from Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and xAI in certain areas, while trailing in others. Still, GPT-5 is earning praise for its versatility, particularly in coding tasks, and for its aggressive pricing. However, Musk recently said Grok is better. The API is priced at $1.25 per 1 million tokens for input and $10 per 1 million tokens for output, with cached input priced at $0.125 per 1 million tokens. This matches Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro at the basic tier, but avoids higher fees Google charges for extremely heavy usage. The pricing also significantly undercuts Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.1, which starts at $15 per 1 million input tokens and $75 per 1 million output tokens, though Anthropic offers discounts for prompt caching and batch processing. According to TechCrunch , developers say the competitive rates make GPT-5 an attractive choice, especially for programming and automation tasks. Simon Willison, a developer featured in OpenAI’s launch video, called the pricing “aggressively competitive.” Others, including HyperWrite CEO Matt Shumer, noted that GPT-5 is even cheaper than GPT-4o, meaning “intelligence per dollar continues to increase.” On social platforms like X and Hacker News, users described the pricing as a “killer” move in the AI market.

In a tweet shared with his followers, he detailed the circumstances surrounding his initial XRP purchase in March 2020, explaining that he bought the asset at $0.14 or below. At the time, he noted that it was one of the most uncertain moments for him as an investor, emphasizing that many people around him questioned the decision, calling it foolish. CryptoBull highlighted that despite the uncertainty, he held his position. As the months progressed, XRP began to show signs of strength, climbing to $0.65 by November 2020. At that point, he believed a new all-time high was within reach, mirroring the optimism held by many investors who anticipated the asset would follow the broader upward momentum seen across the cryptocurrency market. Let me share a little #XRP story with you: In March of 2020 I bought XRP at $0.14 and below. It was the scariest moment to put money into something when everyone told me I am stupid. As time went by I felt better about it, and, finally in November of 2020 the XRP price… — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) August 7, 2025 SEC Lawsuit and Long-Term Holding However, on December 20, 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed its now widely known lawsuit against Ripple. The price of XRP sharply declined to $0.17 following the announcement, effectively erasing much of the gains from earlier that year. CryptoBull noted that while the broader market went on to reach new all-time highs during the 2021 bull run, XRP did not participate in that rally. Despite this setback, he stated that he chose not to exit his position. Instead, he continued to hold his XRP for the 1,690 days that followed the SEC’s filing. CryptoBull emphasized that this decision was grounded in patience, which he described as the most valuable trait for any investor operating in such unpredictable conditions. His continued commitment to holding the asset through multiple market cycles and regulatory battles forms the core message of his tweet. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Taking Profit as Prices Rise As XRP’s price has recently surged, CryptoBull confirmed that he has started to take profits. He disclosed that he sold portions of his XRP holdings at $2 and $3, and indicated he plans to gradually exit the market if the price continues to rise towards $10 and above. According to him, taking profits is essential and should be done with consideration to individual financial goals and personal risk tolerance. He warned against holding indefinitely out of fear of missing out on further gains. In his view, as the asset’s price rises, the risks associated with hodling increase. This, he suggested, is often overlooked by retail investors who tend to get caught in emotional decision-making during price rallies. By sharing his strategy, CryptoBull aimed to highlight the importance of exiting the market with discipline, rather than being misled by emotional sentiment at peak moments. Final Reflection and Message to Holders In closing, CryptoBull pinpointed the personal cost of holding his XRP position for 1,690 days, expressing contentment with his decision. However, he also noted the importance of knowing when to exit. He posed a final question to his followers, asking whether they could wait as long as he did or if they were equipped to manage their positions with the same level of patience and conviction.

The Order instructs multiple agencies, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to facilitate access to alternative assets for participant-directed defined-contribution retirement savings plans by revising applicable regulations and guidance. Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Democratizes Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors https://t.co/kBmDeAGNv0 — Karoline Leavitt (@PressSec) August 7, 2025 401(k) accounts allow investors to save for retirement without paying taxes on their gains until they start to make withdrawals at the retirement age. According to data from the Investment Company Institute, a total of $8.7 trillion worth of assets are currently held in these accounts. Hence, if President Trump’s EO results in the approval of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) and these funds become eligible to be included in 401(k), billions of dollars could flow into this altcoin in a matter of weeks. XRP Price Prediction: Trading Volumes Skyrocket as XRP Breaks Through Key Resistance Trading volumes for XRP skyrocketed by 153% in the past 24 hours following the news as this could be a landmark moment for crypto and one that favors a bullish XRP price prediction . While other major altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) saw modest gains of around 2%, XRP has taken center stage, surging more than 8% during the same period. XRP’s 4-hour chart paints a bullish picture, with the token breaking through a key resistance at $3.30 following the latest news. A brief pullback to the $3.25 zone could occur during the U.S. session, but momentum is likely to continue into the weekend as more buyers jump in, expecting the price to keep rising alongside billions in fresh capital flowing into the token. The next short-term target sits at $3.65 , the most recent swing high. But given the strength of this breakout, XRP could be gearing up for a push into uncharted territory. A move to $1,000 may seem far-fetched for now, but a jump to $10 is entirely within reach – especially if a spot ETF launches and regulators give the green light for 401(k) inclusion , unlocking major institutional demand. And it’s not just top-tier tokens riding this wave. Meme coin presales like Maxi Doge (MAXI) are also gaining traction. Launched just days ago, MAXI has already raised nearly $500,000 , showing that retail appetite for high-upside plays remains strong in this bullish environment. Maxi Doge (MAXI) Will Use Leveraged Positions to Make the Most of This Bull Market Maxi Doge (MAXI) is more than just a meme — it’s an attitude. It embraces hype, leans into FOMO, and turns bold moves into big opportunities. In this world, there are no red candles, only green days and the belief that one right call can change everything. To back that belief, Maxi Doge is launching the Maxi Fund — a pool powered by 25% of all presale funds , dedicated to investing in the most promising tokens on the market. This fund will take high-conviction bets using up to 1000x leverage , aiming for the kind of gains most traders only dream about. No stop losses. No second-guessing.

Ripple vs SEC is over The SEC officially Announces The Joint Stipulation to Dismiss Appeals, Resolving Civil Enforcement Action Against @Ripple and Two of Its Executives @bgarlinghouse and @chrislarsensf https://t.co/W5RiktZl9y pic.twitter.com/qM9aBq7Gvx — 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗸XRP (@BankXRP) August 8, 2025 With the court’s 2023 ruling stating that public exchange sales of $XRP are not securities, Stellar (which shares Ripple’s technical DNA) stands to benefit materially. Institutional confidence is up, particularly in cross-border payments and remittances, where Stellar has long been a leader. At the same time, Stellar stands on the verge of a transformative technical leap with its upcoming Protocol 23 upgrade, currently slated for a validator vote on September 3. This major network evolution introduces two major developments: parallel transaction processing that dramatically improves efficiency, and the Soroban smart contract platform designed for high-performance decentralized applications. Together, these enhancements position Stellar to handle up to 5,000 transactions per second, a capability that squarely pits it against Ethereum in the rapidly growing areas of DeFi and real-world asset tokenization. Market participants have responded enthusiastically to these developments, driving a 260% increase in trading volume, surpassing $1 billion as developers actively test the new Protocol 23 features. Perhaps more telling is the 199% month-over-month increase in real-world asset (RWA) transactions recorded in July, indicating accelerating institutional adoption ahead of the upgrade’s final validator vote on August 14. Beyond tech upgrades, Stellar’s integration with Visa and growing DeFi activity are also fueling optimism. Its ISO 20022 compliance enhances its appeal for streamlined remittances and corporate payments. At the same time, expansion in the Asia-Pacific region through Marketnode, in partnership with Euroclear and DTCC, shows its growing institutional reach.

The left shoulder, head, and right shoulder are well-defined, with the breakout candle supported by a clear jump in volume. Following the breakout from the neckline, $XLM climbed rapidly, leaving minimal pullback opportunities as buyers pressed the advantage. This run pushed $XLM above both the 50-day SMA at $0.4196 and the 100-period SMA at $0.4111. The SMAs are now in full bullish alignment, with the shorter moving average leading the uptrend and acting as a dynamic support line during minor consolidations. $XLM/$USDT price chart, August 8 (Source: TradingView) The RSI touched highs above 77 during the breakout and has since cooled to 65.73, suggesting momentum remains healthy but not in extreme overbought territory. If RSI holds above 60, the likelihood of trend continuation stays elevated. However, the bears would be watching for further dips in the RSI, possibly towards 50, which would show a weakening momentum and trend shift. The MACD also reflects strong upward momentum, with the MACD line well above the signal line and the histogram still printing positive bars, though the most recent bars show mild contraction, hinting at a possible short-term pause. A retest of the neckline area around $0.4200–$0.4250 could serve as a key validation level, where buyers aim to defend and maintain the breakout structure.

Yet, a new player known as XYZVerse is attracting even more interest, with forecasts suggesting far higher returns. The numbers being discussed hint at growth far beyond what has already been seen, prompting fresh excitement in digital assets. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $15 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.005. At the next 14th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.01, meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits XRP: The Lightning Coin That Wants to Replace Slow Bank Transfers XRP was built for one job: move value fast and cheap. It runs on the XRP Ledger, a public network that anyone can see and use. No boss, no gatekeeper. Once a payment is made, it cannot be reversed or faked. The coin was born in 2012 when Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz minted 100 billion units. Most went to Ripple, the company guiding growth, with 55 billion locked in escrow to stop floods of new supply. In a market hunting for speed, XRP stands out. Bitcoin can feel slow and pricey, and even Ethereum is often crowded. Ripple’s coin settles in seconds, usually costing less than a cent. That makes it handy for global transfers and small payments alike. Recent talk about central bank money and digital dollars has renewed interest in networks that bridge many currencies. If traders turn back to utility after meme coin fun, XRP could shine. Its fixed release plan also eases fear of surprise dilution. Shiba Inu: From Meme to Mighty—Can SHIB Bite Hard in This Bull Run? Shiba Inu, or SHIB, began in August 2020 as a playful answer to Dogecoin. Unlike Doge, it lives on the busy Ethereum network, so it fits easily with many apps there. Its unknown creator, Ryoshi, released one quadrillion coins and sent half to Ethereum’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin. He later gave a chunk to India’s Covid fund and burned 40 % of all coins, turning headlines into rocket fuel. SHIB now powers ShibaSwap, and plans include an art market for NFTs and a vote-driven community hub. Memes still rule the market, and fresh money keeps chasing low-priced tokens. SHIB’s link to Ethereum gives it more room to grow than most joke coins, while new burns keep shrinking supply. Dogecoin depends on tweets; SHIB can plug into every new Ethereum upgrade, from faster fees to future side chains. As Bitcoin edges toward its next halving, traders often flow into smaller coins seeking sharper moves. With active devs, loud fans, and an entry price under a cent, SHIB looks ready to wag in the coming cycle. Conclusion XRP and SHIB have shown strong gains and remain solid choices. However, XYZVerse stands out with its sports focus, early adoption benefits, and ambitious growth plan, aiming for record-breaking returns.

Data from Shib Burn shows that, on Wednesday, a total of 9.81 million SHIB tokens were burned automatically. Of that total, 9.47 million were taken out in a single transaction. This represented a 4-digit increase compared to the previous 24 hours and may have been the result of some big transactions occurring as SHIB climbed above $0.00001250. The Shiba Inu blockchain is designed to burn a portion of its transaction fees to shrink the token’s circulating supply. Although this single-day burn represented only a tiny fraction of the 590 trillion tokens in circulation, it indicates that big positions are being opened. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB Needs Clear Breakout Above $0.00001300 to Keep Rising SHIB’s trading volumes have doubled in the past 24 hours, even though the token has gone up by just 1.7%. This could indicate accumulation by whales in anticipation of what could be SHIB’s next leg up. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is now testing a key resistance level at $0.00001300 on the 4-hour chart, with added strength from the 200-period EMA , making this a critical breakout zone. After over 72 hours of steady gains, a minor pullback to around $0.00001250 could happen — but that dip may serve as a springboard, building the liquidity needed for SHIB’s next leg higher. If the price breaks above $0.00001300 , the next short-term targets are $0.00001500 and $0.00001600 , with growing momentum behind each move. Some dream of SHIB hitting $1 , which would imply a $590 trillion market cap — not realistic under the current token supply. However, a long-term solution could involve a reverse split , a process where the token supply is reduced without changing the overall value of the market cap. By shrinking the number of coins in circulation, the price per token can rise without needing massive new capital. While that’s a future possibility, the current outlook still supports a bullish Shiba Inu price prediction , as the market leans into risk and altcoin strength builds. For investors chasing even higher upside, the best crypto presales could deliver the next 10X returns, especially as capital rotates into newer, high-potential tokens during this bullish phase. Token6900 (T6900) Embraces Core Meme Coin Principles and Raises Over $1.7M Token6900 ($T6900) is not just another meme coin, it’s a reflection of every late-night chart stare, every overhyped rug, and every Solana snipe that almost made it. Now in presale, this project gives early supporters a rare chance to get in before the chaos begins. It has no roadmap, no promises, and no gimmicks. That’s the point. T6900 thrives on pure vibe liquidity , fueled by raw community energy and a hint of early 2000s internet nostalgia. It’s absurd, it’s self-aware, and that’s exactly why it works. With a hard cap of $5 million , only the earliest believers will claim the biggest share.

Meanwhile, XRP, AVAX, LINK, and TRX show signs of strong market action, with investors moving funds in new directions. Which of these coins is truly driving the rally? The answers may surprise even seasoned traders. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price: $0.0001 Price Now: $0.005 Next Stage: $0.01 Final Presale Price: $0.02 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries. So far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Ripple (XRP) Source: TradingView XRP trades between 2.68 and 3.28 today. The last 7 days show a mild slide of 3.02 %. Step back to 30 days and the coin is up 32.26 %. Zoom out 6 months and the gain sits at 25.43 %. RSI at 57.33 and a Stochastic reading of 68.62 hint that buyers keep an edge, while MACD stays a hair above zero at 0.006276. The 10-day and 100-day moving averages hug each other at 2.99 and 2.98, marking a tight coil. Break that coil upward and the chart points to 3.60, a jump of about 20 % from the average. Clear that and 4.20 comes into play, another 28 % higher from the top of the current band. Fail to hold momentum and 2.40 stands ready as first support, roughly 20 % below the mean. A deeper slip could drag action toward 1.80. Momentum favors a push higher. The month-long rally, steady averages, and neutral-to-bullish oscillators suggest bulls may test 3.60 soon. A close above that barrier could ignite a fresh run toward 4.20. If volume dries up, watch 2.40 for a possible floor before the next move. Avalanche (AVAX) Source: TradingView AVAX just delivered a wild swing. The coin dipped 4.31% in the last 7 days, trimming part of a strong 23.91% surge over the past month. The 6-month chart still shows an 8.73% slide, yet price is steady inside a $18.89-$25.64 band. A tight gap between the 10-day average at $22.15 and the 100-day at $22.01 points to a coiled setup. Momentum now tilts a touch higher. A strength score near 58 and a speed gauge around 68 hint the coin is balanced, not stretched. Clearing the first ceiling at $29.89 could unlock a run toward $36.63. From the $22 zone, that move equals roughly 60-65% upside and would wipe out the long-term loss in one stroke. Bulls must defend $18.89. A slip to the firmer $16.38 floor would carve about 25% off current levels, and a tumble to $9.63 would erase nearly 55%. With averages flat but monthly gains firm, the edge stays with buyers for now. Watch $22; hold it and the next test looks north, lose it and the chart resets lower. Chainlink (LINK) Source: TradingView Chainlink spent the week under mild pressure, sliding 4.70%. Even after that dip the token still shows a strong one month climb of 25.64%. Six month action stays negative at 7.89%, hinting at a broad base built since spring. The current swing keeps price between 14.65 and 18.76 as traders test a short term floor. LINK trades above both its 10 day SMA of 16.71 and its 100 day SMA of 16.54, a sign buyers still guide the trend. Momentum gauges back the view, with RSI at 65.14 and Stochastic near 74, both just below overbought lines. A confirmed push through 18.76 could invite fast bids toward the nearby 21 barrier. Clearing 21 would open a road toward the second ceiling at 25, a gain near 40% from the mid range. Failure to hold 16.50 brings support at 12.99 into play, a slide of about 22%. A deeper fade toward 8.883 would mark a roughly 45% retrace, yet such a level also matches the broad six month floor. Given the fresh monthly momentum the chart still tilts higher, but traders watch 18.76 and 21 to decide the next big swing. TRON (TRX) Source: TradingView TRX keeps edging higher. The token trades inside $0.31-$0.35 after a 3.61% weekly lift, an 18.38% monthly jump, and a 47.50% gain over 6 months. Bulls have led the tape all year and every dip still meets fast bids. The 10-day average is $0.34, above the 100-day line at $0.33. RSI sits at 65.76 and Stochastic reads 84.10, showing strong but not extreme demand. MACD stays positive at 0.001610, hinting that the push has room left. A clean break of the $0.37 lid could launch a run toward $0.40, adding roughly 14% from the midpoint of the current band. If buyers stall, the price may slide to the first floor at $0.30, a drop of about 10%, or in a deeper pullback to $0.27, around 18% lower. The bias is up while $0.30 holds, yet the real story will unfold at the $0.37 line. Conclusion XRP, AVAX, LINK, and TRX are making strong moves this bull run, but XYZVerse stands out as the first all-sport memecoin, uniting fans and aiming for massive growth in 2025.

Jack Dorsey’s Block is set to release groundbreaking Bitcoin mining chips next week. This exciting development promises to reshape the landscape of Bitcoin mining, making it more efficient and accessible for everyone. This strategic move by Block Bitcoin aims to further decentralize the network and push for wider adoption of the leading cryptocurrency. Unveiling Block’s Revolutionary Bitcoin Mining Chips Block, a company renowned for its innovative financial services and commitment to Bitcoin, is making a bold move into the hardware side of the crypto industry. They plan to unveil new, highly anticipated Bitcoin mining chips through their collaboration with Proto Mining. This initiative directly supports their overarching goal: to dramatically improve the efficiency and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. These aren’t just any chips; they are engineered for superior energy efficiency. This focus is paramount for sustainable mining operations, especially as global energy concerns grow. Moreover, the design aims to make mining more accessible to a broader range of participants, actively moving away from the concentration of power in large, centralized operations. Think of it as empowering the individual miner. Jack Dorsey’s Unwavering Vision for Bitcoin Jack Dorsey , co-founder of Twitter and the driving force behind Block, has long been a staunch and vocal advocate for Bitcoin. He views Bitcoin not merely as a digital asset, but as the internet’s native currency, believing it holds the key to a more open, equitable, and resilient global financial system. His commitment extends far beyond rhetoric; Block consistently invests significant resources into Bitcoin-related initiatives, from development grants to infrastructure projects. Dorsey’s grand vision includes making Bitcoin a truly mainstream payment tool for everyday transactions. This ambition is why Block has been actively exploring and implementing ways to enable BTC payments for Square sellers, their merchant processing arm. The impending release of these new, efficient chips is a tangible, foundational step towards realizing this ambitious and transformative vision. How Will Decentralized Mining Bolster the Network? The vigorous push for more decentralized mining is a fundamental cornerstone of Block’s long-term strategy. Currently, a substantial portion of Bitcoin’s computational power, or hash rate, is concentrated within a few large mining pools. This concentration raises legitimate concerns about the network’s security, its resistance to censorship, and its overall democratic nature. By making more efficient, cost-effective, and user-friendly mining hardware available, Block aims to empower individual miners and smaller operations. This strategic distribution encourages a wider, more diverse spread of mining power across various geographical locations and entities. Consequently, a network with more decentralized mining becomes inherently more robust, resilient, and resistant to single points of failure or malicious attacks, thereby reinforcing Bitcoin’s core principles of decentralization and immutability. Paving the Way for Wider Bitcoin Adoption Block’s comprehensive efforts are part of a much larger, cohesive strategy to drive broader Bitcoin adoption across various sectors. They are not solely focused on the technical aspects of mining; they are equally dedicated to exploring how Bitcoin can integrate seamlessly and intuitively into everyday commerce and personal finance. This includes simplifying the process for businesses of all sizes to accept Bitcoin payments, making it as straightforward as accepting traditional currencies. The release of these state-of-the-art Bitcoin mining chips is a crucial, foundational step in this journey. By strengthening the network’s underlying infrastructure and ensuring its long-term health, Block is effectively paving the way for Bitcoin to evolve into a truly global, widely accepted, and indispensable currency. This holistic approach thoughtfully addresses both the supply side (mining and network security) and the demand side (payments and usability), creating a virtuous cycle for growth. Potential Hurdles and the Road Ahead for Block While Block’s initiative is promising, several challenges lie ahead: Intense Market Competition: The mining hardware market is fiercely competitive, dominated by established players. Block must consistently demonstrate a significant technological and cost advantage to gain substantial market share. Evolving Regulatory Landscape: The global regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies, particularly mining, is constantly in flux. Changes in policy could impact operations and market access. Rapid Technological Advancements: The pace of innovation in chip design is incredibly fast. Block will need continuous research and development to remain competitive and ensure their chips stay at the forefront of efficiency and performance. Block’s imminent launch of new Bitcoin mining chips marks a truly pivotal moment for the entire cryptocurrency space. This strategic move, spearheaded by visionary leader Jack Dorsey , unequivocally underscores Block’s deep and unwavering commitment to enhancing the efficiency, security, and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. By fostering more robust decentralized mining practices and actively promoting wider Bitcoin adoption , Block is poised to play a crucial role in bringing Bitcoin into the mainstream. This development could empower individuals and businesses alike, driving forward the digital financial revolution with renewed vigor. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are Block’s new Bitcoin mining chips designed for? Block’s new Bitcoin mining chips are designed to significantly improve the efficiency and decentralization of the Bitcoin network, making mining more accessible and sustainable for a broader range of participants. Why is Jack Dorsey so committed to Bitcoin? Jack Dorsey views Bitcoin as the internet’s native currency and a key to a more open and equitable global financial system. His commitment drives Block’s initiatives to support Bitcoin’s infrastructure and adoption. How do these chips promote decentralization?

Will Dogecoin Skyrocket Above $1? The analyst’s daily chart (BINANCE: DOGEUSDT) frames nearly two years of price action inside a broad, magenta-coloured ascending wedge whose support has risen from roughly $0.06 in late-2023 to $0.17 today, and whose resistance projects to $1.10–1.60 over the coming months. At press time DOGE is changing hands at $0.2219, up 8.7 percent on the day, having just pierced the wedge’s internal trend line that capped every rally until mid-July 2025. A cluster of Fibonacci retracement and extension levels anchored to the chart’s swing low at $0.0491 and swing high at $0.7605 defines the roadmap that traders are watching. The token has already reclaimed the 0.382 retracement at $0.1399 and the psychological $0.20 handle, and is now hovering above the 0.50 zone at $0.1933 – ahead of the more technically significant golden ratio at 0.618 ($0.2671). Above that, fib-derived hurdles stack at 0.702 ($0.3362), 0.786 ($0.4232), and 0.888 ($0.5596), with the full retrace level at $0.7605 and the 1.272 extension demarcated at $1.6017 – precisely where the wedge’s ceiling converges in the analyst’s projection. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Right Where Past Bull Runs Have Taken Off: Analyst What lends the setup its narrative force is a cyan overlay on the same chart – a fractal copy of DOGE’s eruptive late 2024 leg – that has been transplanted onto the current structure. In that earlier episode the coin rocketed 439 percent once price tagged rising-wedge support, sliced through the internal down-sloping resistance, retested it as support and accelerated straight to the upper boundary. The overlay implies that a similar sequence has begun to unfold: DOGE revisited wedge support in late June, broke the internal trend line in mid-July, and retested it successfully this week– if the fractal continues to rhyme – could embark on a vertiginous sprint that terminates where the 1.272 extension meets the wedge roof just north of $1.60. The monthly view reinforces the bullish undertone. Charting Guy points out that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is on the verge of a bullish cross of its own moving average in the 50–55 band. The last time that crossover occurred, in early 2024, price embarked on the aforementioned 439 percent advance. While momentum has cooled since that high, the oscillator never broke down into oversold territory, suggesting, in classical technical parlance, that DOGE has been basing rather than topping. Sceptics will note that the same wedge has twice rejected advances below $0.50, and that the memecoin still lives below every major high-time-frame supply shelf until $0.76. Yet the chart’s geometry leaves room for a rapid repricing should buyers clear the $0.27–0.34 resistance cluster: the “empty air” between the 0.702 and 0.888 fibs coincides with the steepest part of the wedge. Related Reading: Dogecoin Doomed To Chop? Analyst Sees $0.90–$1.50 Top—But Not Anytime Soon For now, traders have a textbook trigger to watch – the internal magenta down-trend that DOGE has just tested from above. A decisive weekly close above that line, coupled with rising volume, would formally confirm the breakout scenario. Failure to hold $0.20 would invalidate the fractal and shift focus back to wedge support, currently near $0.17. Whether history will repeat with the precision that the fractal projects remains to be seen, but the structural logic on the chart is clear: so long as Dogecoin respects its four-year rising base, the path of least resistance continues to tilt higher – and the upper edge of that structure terminates at $1.60. The coming weeks should reveal whether the meme-asset can turn that technical aspiration into market reality. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.22.

49759566,551755,1754676039,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49759566.jpeg,Bitcoin Gets Elon Musk’s Seal Of Approval Again,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-elon-musk-seal-of-approval-again/,"Late on 7 August 2025, Elon Musk fired off a single “ ” beneath a Coinbase post on X that showcased an animated, Grok-generated revival of the classic Bitcoin “magic internet money” wizard. The billionaire’s trademark minimalist reaction was enough to ignite another round of speculation that he remains firmly in Bitcoin’s corner. The Coinbase clip, captioned “Grok Imagine: Bring this legend to life,” turns the pixelated 2013 wizard into a short, neon-blue video—an unmistakable nod to Bitcoin’s earliest grassroots marketing slogan. Elon Musk Embraces Bitcoin Again The meme itself traces back to a contest on r/bitcoin more than a decade ago. In April 2013, subreddit moderators asked users to design an ad that could run in Reddit’s sidebar; a hastily drawn MS-Paint wizard riding a gold coin and declaring “magic internet money” won by popular vote. Despite (or perhaps because of) its crude aesthetic, the image encapsulated BTC’s outsider charm and has since become shorthand for the cryptocurrency’s defiant irreverence. Musk’s latest emoji is small but strategic. Over the past month he has repeatedly woven Bitcoin into his political and technological ventures. When unveiling the “America Party”—a nascent political vehicle he has floated as an alternative to the two-party system—Musk said “ Fiat is hopeless , so yes,” after being queried if the American Party would “embrace” Bitcoin. That declaration followed a fresh internal transfer of roughly $150 million in BTC by SpaceX, reinforcing the notion that Musk’s companies remain long-term holders. Just days before the wizard post, Musk turned to his xAI assistant Grok to interrogate one of the most persistent existential questions: the quantum-computer threat . “Bitcoin’s hashing remains secure for now,” Grok replied, assigning “nearly 0%” probability that a quantum machine could crack SHA-256 within five years and “under 10% by 2035” given current qubit road-maps. In another example of Musk’s recurring BTC references, June saw the announcement of “XChat,” a new messaging feature on his social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Musk revealed that the system is built on Rust and incorporates “Bitcoin-style” encryption, a choice he framed as a commitment to security and decentralization principles long associated with the cryptocurrency. Musk’s public statements have rarely moved markets as violently as they did during the 2021–2022 bull run, yet his influence endures. Tesla still lists more than 10,725 BTC on its balance sheet, and SpaceX is believed to hold a further nine-figure stash. Against that backdrop, even a laughing-crying emoji reads as tacit endorsement—especially when it revives a relic of BTC’s anarchic infancy. At press time, BTC traded at $116,560.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|coinbase|Elon Musk,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-08 18:00:39

Right now, the focus is on momentum shifts and what the next moves could be. Bonk has fallen sharply over the past week, with double-digit losses pushing many holders to rethink their positions in the memecoin scene. At the same time, analysts looking at ICP see signs of slow progress, but note that stronger adoption and better utility are needed for growth. As crypto payments keep maturing, more users are asking which option is the best crypto for the long term and whether it truly gives back. Cold Wallet is stepping into that conversation. Instead of charging users for activity, this project turns things around: use your wallet, get rewarded, and keep more of what you earn. That shift in 2025 is what many have been waiting to see. Whale Moves Signal a Shift in the Cold Wallet Presale For those watching the Cold Wallet presale, the pace is clearly picking up. Big buyer activity is showing up on trackers as stage 17 begins, with some placing more than $50,000 in a single transaction. This isn’t a rush from small retail buyers. It looks like calculated moves by bigger players trying to secure early positions in what may become one of the fastest-moving projects of 2025. When larger buyers show up this early, it often suggests they see something others don’t yet. So, why is Cold Wallet attracting this attention now? It comes down to real utility and a system that rewards those who act quickly. The presale has 150 pricing tiers. With stage 17 live, the current price is $0.00998, and more than $5.8 million has already been raised. Only 40% of the 10 billion total CWT supply is available through presale, and demand is already climbing fast. For those looking for the best crypto for the long term, early entry here could be key to higher returns. Cold Wallet also includes a built-in reward system for its users. You earn cashback on things like gas fees, swaps, and crypto ramps, and there’s a referral program that pays out in USDT. The large-scale buying happening now isn’t about buzz; it’s about securing access before the next price jump. That’s why early supporters are acting quickly instead of waiting. At the end of the day, the best crypto for the long term may not be the one with just lower fees. It could be the one that rewards your activity. As transaction volume increases and large buyers make their move, Cold Wallet’s presale could reach its limit faster than expected. Bonk’s Price Pullback Raises Concerns for Traders Bonk’s recent price drop has stirred the waters in the Solana memecoin space. The token has fallen more than 14% in the past week and nearly 5% in the past day. Trading volume remains high at $600 million, but most of it is coming from sellers rather than new buyers. Whale exits and broader market risk-off sentiment are adding to the pressure. Many are now watching the Bonk price drop to see whether it finds a floor or continues falling. Short-term projections suggest a dip to $0.000022 if demand doesn’t return soon. Meanwhile, Bonk’s developers have kicked off a 1% buyback program to help support the price and hold up community sentiment. But with other meme projects like Pump Token gaining steam, Bonk’s future depends on how fast the market regains confidence. Right now, it’s a waiting game for those holding out hope for a quick recovery. ICP’s Future Looks Slow but Steady, Say Analysts Recent ICP price prediction reports show a quiet but slightly hopeful outlook. Most short-term forecasts keep ICP between $5.10 and $5.30 by late 2025. Analysts say a small climb could happen if adoption improves and token unlock selling slows after June. Some models suggest ICP could reach $6 or $7 in 2026, while more optimistic takes point to highs above $13, only if Internet Computer sees big traction in Web3, DeFi, and AI spaces. Looking even further, the long-range ICP price prediction is wide-ranging. More cautious analysts expect it to settle around $8 to $10 by 2030, while the most bullish voices have thrown out numbers like $100 or even $175. The key factor remains whether the Internet Computer can attract strong, real-world usage. For now, a slow rise seems more likely than any rapid spike. Cold Wallet Picks Up Steam While Market Wobbles With Bonk sliding and ICP still waiting on adoption growth, Cold Wallet is gaining momentum. Traders and whales are scanning the market for the best crypto for the long term, and Cold Wallet is entering the conversation in a big way. While many coins are stuck or sliding, Cold Wallet’s presale token is moving fast. Large buyers are jumping in, drawn to its structure that rewards every transaction. It’s not just another project; Cold Wallet stands out in a quiet market. If you’re looking for the best crypto for the long term, Cold Wallet’s current pace and rising interest may be the shift others are waiting for. In a market full of dips and uncertainty, this presale is one of the few things gaining real attention.

Others are simply at the starting line. The challenge is telling which ones are sleeping giants. If you’re searching for the top altcoins to buy now, this lineup highlights four lesser-known names gaining momentum before the crowd catches on. One of them is already paying back users, onboarding millions, and remains priced under a penny. Cold Wallet (CWT): Cashback-Driven Self-Custody at Just $0.00998 Cold Wallet offers more than just digital storage. It flips the usual model; every time you pay gas fees, transfer funds, or make swaps, you receive $CWT rewards. Right now, it’s priced at $0.00998, with over $5.8 million raised in the presale, currently at stage 17. The upcoming listing price is $0.3517, offering a 37x price difference. What sets Cold Wallet apart is its continuous reward system. Users can earn up to 100% cashback across transactions just by holding more CWT, no need for staking or lock-ins. With over 2 million users added after acquiring Plus Wallet, and a 150-stage presale that increases the price with each step, Cold Wallet stands out among the top altcoins to buy now. Time matters here. Missing early stages could mean paying a much higher price later. TOKEN6900: Meme Coin Designed for Virality and Speed This isn’t your usual joke coin. TOKEN6900 takes a high-speed approach with limited supply, aggressive burn tactics, and big incentives for early adopters. Its whole setup is built to go viral, rewards, sharing, and speed. A large chunk of its supply is set aside for staking rewards, airdrops, and bonuses linked to trading volume. If meme tokens start gaining again, TOKEN6900 might benefit heavily. Its price remains way below a penny, making it one of the top altcoins to buy now for those banking on social momentum. High risk? Yes. But the upside could be just as big if it gains traction. Little Pepe: A Meme-Based Microcap with NFT Expansion Little Pepe plays the role of the underdog cousin to PepeCoin. It operates with a smaller cap and a tighter supply model. But what really makes it click is how it’s built community: through Telegram-driven campaigns, meme contests, and airdrops that reward user engagement. On top of that, the project has started layering in NFT-based use cases to encourage longer holding. Influencers and collectors in the meme niche are already giving it attention. Still in the microcap range, Little Pepe is among the top altcoins to buy now for those looking for the next meme explosion. AurealOne: Bringing Audio Utility to DeFi AurealOne is focused on real-world audio use cases in Web3, things like licensing music, paying artists, and sharing revenue on-chain. But its token still trades at a deep discount despite MVP progress and early collaborations. While most haven’t noticed it yet, the project is rolling out tools that link creator earnings to blockchain mechanics. Its token design includes deflationary elements, governance use, and airdrops tied to participation. If you’re looking for top altcoins to buy now with actual utility and a long-term vision, AurealOne may check all the boxes. Final Words Finding top altcoins to buy now isn’t about grabbing every sub-penny option. It’s about spotting coins that have strong systems and actual traction. Cold Wallet leads the pack thanks to its user base, rewards model, and current pricing. Whether it’s the viral-ready TOKEN6900, niche-focused Little Pepe, or utility-driven AurealOne, the real advantage lies in catching them before the wider market reacts. Once the spotlight hits, the early entry disappears.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Jan Happel and Yann Alleman – who go by the handle Negentropic – say that Ethereum may have an explosive breakout if the top altcoin reclaims the $4,000 level as support. They also say that ETH may present a buying opportunity on Friday and Saturday, the two days of the week when the price has declined in the last 30 days. “We might be lucky enough to experience one more retrace before ETH punches through $4,000. Friday and Saturday have generally been for accumulating over the past month. Once it does, strap in, because the ride will be wild.” Source: Negentropic/X The analysts say that ETH may consolidate briefly before having a sudden and strong move to the upside. “ETH with a small breather, but the next move is loading and will melt faces.” The Glassnode co-founders also say that the increasing network growth metric for Bitcoin ( BTC ), which measures the number of users and transactions, is flashing a bullish signal for ETH based on historic precedent. “The last time our Network Growth indicator accelerated this strongly while liquidity reset was April 7th – the global bottom this year. ETH rallied over 100% from that point. It’s happening again. You know what comes next.” Source: Negentropic/X ETH is trading for $3,955 at time of writing, up 3.2% in the last 24 hours.

According to his chart shared on X, XRP is poised for a breakout that may take the asset well beyond its current price of $3.35. Chart Signals a Major Breakout Steph’s chart reflects a classic Elliott Wave structure nearing completion . XRP appears to be forming the last leg of the corrective phase (Wave 4), setting the stage for the impulsive Wave 5, often regarded as the strongest and most explosive in the cycle. The breakout points to a potential price target between $9 and $12. This forecast implies a possible 300% rally from the current level, contingent on XRP confirming key breakout zones in the days ahead. The final wave for #XRP pic.twitter.com/BNDHL3lhgw — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 8, 2025 This forecast has caught the attention of many XRP enthusiasts because it combines technical precision with clear momentum indicators. His projection is not based on speculation but rooted in well-established chart dynamics that have historically preceded significant market expansions. XRP’s Price Action and Market Sentiment Currently trading at $3.35, XRP has recently experienced a sharp recovery, supported by broader market optimism and the official conclusion of its long-standing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Though the resolution of the Ripple vs. SEC case provides a cleaner regulatory slate, analysts are now more focused on technical developments and market structure. Momentum has been steadily building. If XRP manages to hold above the $3.30 range and break resistance around $3.60–$3.80 , it would validate the bullish structure identified by STEPH IS CRYPTO. In that scenario, Wave 5 could extend rapidly, aligning with the upper limit of the projected breakout pole. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Defining Moment for XRP This moment could prove pivotal for XRP. The asset is not only reclaiming investor interest but also regaining its place in high-level technical discussions. The “final wave” thesis suggests that XRP is approaching the end of consolidation and is ready for an aggressive move higher. While the market remains unpredictable, the clarity of this wave structure provides a strong case for bullish continuation. With momentum, structure, and sentiment aligning, XRP could soon embark on one of its most significant rallies in recent years. The signals are all there, the final wave is in play, and XRP’s next major leap may already be in motion. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The Zurich-based firm announced Friday it will now offer institutional-grade custody, spot and derivatives trading for SUI, alongside upcoming staking and SUI collateral-backed Lombard loans. Staking is expected to launch in the coming weeks, with loans scheduled for the fourth quarter. All SUI holdings will be kept off the bank’s balance sheet and set up to be bankruptcy remote. The move builds on Sygnum’s July 2025 integration of SUI into its platform, which it says made it the first Swiss bank to fully support the token. By working with the Sui Foundation, Sygnum aims to channel demand from banks, asset managers and high-net-worth individuals seeking secure, regulated exposure to blockchain ecosystems. Christian Thompson, managing director at the Sui Foundation, said the partnership strengthens Sui’s connection to global institutional investors through a trusted, regulated gateway. Sygnum co-founder and CEO Mathias Imbach said the bank’s role is at the “intersection” of digital assets and traditional finance, helping clients access new opportunities within a regulated framework. Sui, developed by former Meta engineers at Mysten Labs, uses parallel transaction processing to improve scalability, akin to cloud-based services. It supports decentralized finance, instant payments, real-world asset tokenization and gaming, and has positioned itself early in the BTCfi segment, which lets bitcoin holders participate in DeFi without compromising security. Sygnum holds banking and digital asset licenses in Switzerland, Singapore, Abu Dhabi, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein, and offers services including regulated banking, asset management, tokenization and B2B solutions.

As Bitcoin maintains dominance above 60%, some traders are turning to alternative projects with clear use cases or persistent liquidity. XRP, Stellar (XLM), and Chainlink (LINK) are among the assets showing renewed traction. XRP Maintains Momentum Above $3 XRP is trading near $3.23 , based on CoinMarketCap data. Volume over the past 24 hours is more than $12.8 billion, and the current market cap stands at roughly $191 billion. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP BREAKING: The parties have filed a Joint Dismissal of the Appeals.

Legal developments and stable investor support have contributed to the climb. XRP is also active across institutional exchanges, which has helped to maintain high liquidity. Forecasts range from mild consolidation to targets closer to $4, depending on ETF demand and macro factors. Stellar Follows With Steady Gains Stellar (XLM) is priced at $0.44, with a total market cap above $13.9 billion. Daily volume is around $1.1 billion, and its price is up more than 50% over the past month. Stellar (XLM) Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) After an extended legal dispute involving another payment protocol was dropped, some investors turned to Stellar as a faster-moving alternative. Trading platforms have responded by increasing XLM pairs, helping to support current price levels. Technical indicators show a range developing between $0.41 and $0.50. If demand holds, several models suggest the token could push toward $0.80 in the coming weeks. Chainlink Benefits From Infrastructure Demand Chainlink (LINK) is trading above $19 , with moderate volatility and consistent on-chain activity. According to data from CoinCodex, LINK has recorded 67% green days over the past month. Daily volume remains high, and short-term projections suggest movement toward $17.95 by the end of August. The token plays a utility role across many DeFi applications, powering oracles used in price feeds and smart contract automation. While not the most talked-about asset in current altseason discussions, LINK has quietly maintained technical strength. TradingView data shows support near $15.90, with resistance sitting around $18.10. A Narrower Altcoin Season The Altcoin Season Index is at 37, below the threshold for a broad rotation. That reading indicates continued strength in Bitcoin compared to altcoins. Still, XRP, Stellar, and Chainlink are showing movement tied to liquidity and use, rather than trend-driven speculation. Market participants are approaching altseason cautiously. The focus has shifted from high-risk tokens to projects with more stable roles in the ecosystem. Each of the three has attracted steady flows without the need for new catalysts. This shift may reflect a maturing market, where altcoin season no longer depends on rapid sentiment swings. Instead, it’s unfolding in segments—driven by volume, infrastructure, and real-world utility.

Two brand-new wallets have collectively moved a staggering 10.98 million SYRUP tokens, valued at approximately $5.4 million, directly from Binance. This substantial Binance withdrawal , as highlighted by on-chain data specialist Onchain Lens via X, immediately raises questions about the entities behind such a considerable crypto wallet activity . This intriguing transfer prompts a deeper look into the mechanics and implications of such large-scale movements in the digital asset space. Understanding the Mysterious SYRUP Token Withdrawal This notable event revolves around SYRUP, a specific digital asset, and its large-scale movement from a major exchange. When such a significant amount of a token is withdrawn from a platform like Binance, it often signals a strategic maneuver by the holders. The sheer volume involved—$5.4 million—makes this particular SYRUP token withdrawal a noteworthy occurrence in the broader crypto ecosystem, drawing the attention of analysts and enthusiasts alike. Key details of this significant transfer include: Scale of Transfer: Approximately 10.98 million SYRUP tokens were moved. Value: At the time of the transaction, the tokens were valued at around $5.4 million. Origin: The withdrawal originated directly from Binance, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, known for its vast liquidity. Wallet Status: Both receiving wallets were newly created, suggesting a deliberate and recent setup for this specific transaction. What Does On-Chain Data Reveal About This Binance Withdrawal? On-chain data provides a transparent and immutable record of transactions occurring on a blockchain. In this instance, Onchain Lens, a reputable source for blockchain analytics, specifically pointed out that the two wallets involved in this massive Binance withdrawal were both newly established. This detail is crucial because it suggests a planned operation rather than an existing holder simply rebalancing their portfolio. The on-chain specialist further speculated that both wallets are likely under the control of the same entity, indicating a coordinated effort to consolidate or move these assets. Analyzing on-chain data is fundamental for tracking the flow of funds and understanding market dynamics. While the identities behind these wallets remain anonymous due to the nature of blockchain, the patterns of their creation and immediate large-scale withdrawal offer valuable clues about potential motivations and strategic intent. Exploring the Implications of Such Crypto Wallet Activity When new wallets suddenly engage in such significant crypto wallet activity , it can have various implications for the market and the token itself. For instance, this could represent an institutional investor accumulating a substantial position in SYRUP, a project team moving treasury funds for development or liquidity purposes, or even a large individual whale preparing for a specific market play. The motivation behind such a considerable large crypto transfer can range from enhancing security by moving assets off-exchange to preparing for a major investment, or even setting up new liquidity pools. The “newly-created” aspect of these wallets adds a layer of intrigue. It strongly suggests that these entities were specifically set up for this purpose, rather than being long-standing wallets that simply decided to move funds. This focused approach is often characteristic of deliberate, high-value operations designed to achieve a specific objective within the crypto landscape. Why Do Large Crypto Transfers Matter for Market Watchers? Large crypto transfers , especially those involving significant amounts like the $5.4 million in SYRUP, are closely monitored by market analysts and observers. Such movements can sometimes precede major market events, such as a large sell-off if the tokens are moved to an exchange, or a new investment if they are moved to a cold storage or a DeFi protocol. While it is too early to determine the exact intent behind this particular transfer, its sheer scale demands attention and careful observation. Understanding these significant movements helps market participants gauge sentiment and anticipate potential future actions of major holders, often referred to as whales. This large crypto transfer from Binance is a prime example of why staying informed about on-chain analytics is vital for anyone looking to understand the underlying currents of the digital asset market. The Future of SYRUP and Binance Withdrawals This event underscores the constant and dynamic flow of assets within the crypto ecosystem. Whether this Binance withdrawal signifies a strategic accumulation, a shift in asset management, or something else entirely, only time and further on-chain analysis will truly tell. For the SYRUP token, such a significant movement by new wallets could potentially impact its liquidity or market perception, depending on the subsequent actions of these entities. For example, if the funds are deployed into a DeFi protocol, it could boost liquidity; if moved to another exchange, it might signal potential selling pressure. Market observers will undoubtedly continue to watch these wallets for any further activity, as their next moves could shed more light on the ultimate purpose of this initial large withdrawal. The inherent transparency of on-chain data allows for continuous monitoring, providing invaluable insights into these intriguing and impactful crypto movements. Summary: A Glimpse into Strategic Crypto Movements The withdrawal of $5.4 million in SYRUP tokens from Binance by two newly-created wallets represents a fascinating piece of crypto wallet activity . This substantial SYRUP token withdrawal , identified through diligent on-chain data analysis, prompts speculation about a single, coordinated entity behind the move. While the exact intentions remain unknown, such large crypto transfers are crucial indicators of strategic plays within the digital asset landscape. It reinforces the importance of monitoring blockchain data to understand the pulse of the market and stay ahead of potential trends. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some common questions regarding this type of crypto event: What is SYRUP token? SYRUP is a specific cryptocurrency token. Its exact utility depends on the project it belongs to, but like other tokens, it can be traded, held, or used within its native ecosystem. Why are newly-created wallets significant in this withdrawal? Newly-created wallets suggest a deliberate, perhaps pre-planned, action. It indicates that the funds are being moved to an address specifically set up for this transaction, rather than an existing, active wallet. This often points to a strategic maneuver. How does on-chain data help track such events? On-chain data provides public, verifiable records of all transactions on a blockchain. By analyzing this data, specialists can track fund movements, identify patterns, and even link related addresses, offering insights into market dynamics and large transfers. What are the potential implications of a large crypto transfer like this? Large transfers can have various implications, including signaling institutional accumulation, preparation for liquidity provision, a shift to cold storage for security, or even potential selling pressure if the funds are moved to another exchange. The subsequent actions of the wallets are key to understanding the intent. Is it unusual for large amounts of crypto to be withdrawn from exchanges? While large withdrawals happen regularly, the specifics—like newly-created wallets and the sheer volume—make certain events particularly noteworthy.

Ukraine is taking a significant step forward, with its parliament poised to review a pivotal Ukraine crypto bill in late August. This legislative move could redefine how cryptocurrencies are treated within the nation, signaling a clear path towards greater integration and regulation for digital assets. What’s on the Table for the Ukraine Crypto Bill? The upcoming parliamentary session will focus on a comprehensive framework for cryptocurrency regulation. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a foundational proposal designed to bring clarity and legal standing to digital assets across the country. The bill aims to establish a clear legal basis for the circulation and management of cryptocurrencies, addressing a long-standing need in the sector. One of the most talked-about aspects of this proposed Ukraine crypto bill involves taxation. For individuals who have already acquired digital assets, the bill suggests a specific pathway for legalization. This is a critical point for many existing crypto holders in the country, offering a chance to formalize their holdings. Understanding the Proposed Cryptocurrency Tax Ukraine The draft legislation outlines a straightforward tax structure for legalized crypto holdings. It proposes a clear framework for the cryptocurrency tax Ukraine residents would pay. Specifically, the bill suggests: A 5% income tax on profits derived from cryptocurrency activities. An additional 5% military duty , which would also apply to these gains. This combined 10% levy is intended to formalize past gains and contribute to national coffers. This taxation approach seeks to encourage existing holders to declare their assets, providing a structured way to bring previously undeclared holdings into the legal financial system. For the government, this represents a new source of revenue and a step towards comprehensive financial oversight. Will Ukraine Bitcoin Reserves Become a Reality? Beyond taxation, the bill touches upon an even more intriguing possibility: the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in the nation’s reserves. Cointelegraph reported that the central bank might gain the authority to incorporate digital assets into its official holdings. This would be a monumental shift, potentially making Ukraine one of the pioneering nations to hold significant crypto as part of its strategic reserves. Ukraine already possesses a notable amount of Bitcoin, reportedly holding 46,351 BTC . Should the central bank be empowered to manage or expand these holdings, it could signify a profound institutional embrace of digital currencies. This move could also bolster national financial stability and diversify reserve portfolios, highlighting the potential for Ukraine Bitcoin reserves to become a reality. Broader Implications of Digital Asset Legislation This comprehensive digital asset legislation has far-reaching implications, not just for Ukraine but for the global crypto landscape. A clear regulatory framework can foster greater investor confidence and attract more businesses to the country’s crypto sector. It provides the certainty that many traditional financial institutions seek before engaging with digital assets, encouraging further investment. The bill’s passage could also set a precedent for other nations considering similar moves. As countries worldwide grapple with how to regulate the burgeoning crypto market, Ukraine’s approach to crypto regulation Ukraine offers a compelling case study. It balances innovation with the need for fiscal responsibility and legal clarity, showcasing a pragmatic path forward. Ultimately, this legislative push signals Ukraine’s commitment to becoming a leader in the digital economy. By providing a clear legal and tax environment, the country aims to harness the potential of cryptocurrencies while mitigating associated risks. The late August review will be a defining moment for the future of crypto in Ukraine. In summary, Ukraine’s impending review of its crypto bill is a significant event for the global cryptocurrency community. It addresses crucial aspects like taxation of past holdings and the potential for central bank crypto reserves. This forward-thinking Ukraine crypto bill aims to integrate digital assets into the national economy, setting a clear path for their future. The outcome will undoubtedly shape Ukraine’s financial landscape and serve as an important benchmark for global crypto regulation efforts.

49760309,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=187104,1754677210,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/49760309.jpeg,Bitcoin CEX Balances: Astounding 9K BTC Shift Signals Investor Confidence,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-cex-balances-shift/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin CEX Balances: Astounding 9K BTC Shift Signals Investor Confidence The cryptocurrency world constantly shifts, and recent data has highlighted a significant movement: Bitcoin CEX balances experienced a notable decline. In the final week of July, approximately 9,000 Bitcoin (BTC) moved off centralized exchanges (CEXs). This substantial crypto exchange outflow , as reported by Sentora (formerly Into The Block), primarily saw these valuable digital assets transferred into secure Bitcoin cold wallets . This trend suggests a fascinating shift in investor sentiment and has potential implications for the overall BTC supply dynamics. What’s Behind the Drop in Bitcoin CEX Balances? Centralized exchanges hold a large portion of the circulating Bitcoin, making their balances a key indicator of market activity. When Bitcoin CEX balances decrease significantly, it often signals that investors are withdrawing their assets rather than leaving them available for immediate trading. This recent 9,000 BTC withdrawal represents a considerable sum, underscoring a deliberate action by many holders, indicative of a large-scale crypto exchange outflow . The data from Sentora specifically points to the destination: Bitcoin cold wallets . These are offline storage solutions, disconnected from the internet, offering enhanced security against hacks and unauthorized access. The movement of such a large volume of BTC into these secure vaults is not a casual decision; it reflects a strategic move by investors seeking long-term safety for their assets. This substantial trend is a pattern worth observing. It can be driven by various factors, from a desire for greater security to a long-term holding strategy. Understanding these underlying motivations is crucial for interpreting market signals effectively, especially when analyzing shifts in BTC supply . Why Are Investors Moving BTC to Bitcoin Cold Wallets? The decision to move Bitcoin from exchanges to self-custody often stems from a combination of factors related to evolving investor sentiment and heightened security awareness. After various incidents involving exchange hacks and regulatory uncertainties, many Bitcoin holders prioritize the safety of their assets above all else. Storing Bitcoin in Bitcoin cold wallets gives individuals complete control over their private keys, minimizing counterparty risk and fostering a sense of true ownership. Key reasons for this shift include: Enhanced Security: Cold wallets are less susceptible to online attacks because they are not connected to the internet. This provides peace of mind for long-term holders. Self-Custody Principle: The ethos of Bitcoin is “be your own bank.” Moving BTC to a cold wallet embodies this principle, empowering individuals with full ownership and control. Long-Term Conviction: When investors move their Bitcoin to cold storage, they typically signal a strong belief in Bitcoin’s future value. They are not looking to trade it actively in the short term, which impacts the available BTC supply for trading. Reduced Trading Temptation: Having funds off-exchange reduces the impulse to engage in frequent, potentially risky, short-term trading, aligning with a more strategic investment approach. This collective action highlights a growing maturity in the market, where participants are increasingly aware of the importance of managing their own digital assets securely. This positive investor sentiment towards self-custody is a significant development for the ecosystem. Impact on BTC Supply and Market Dynamics What does this significant reduction in Bitcoin CEX balances mean for the broader market? A decrease in Bitcoin held on exchanges typically implies a reduction in immediate selling pressure. When BTC is moved to Bitcoin cold wallets , it effectively removes that supply from readily available trading pools. This impacts the perceived BTC supply available for purchase and can influence market dynamics. The implications for BTC supply are noteworthy: Reduced Liquidity on Exchanges: Less Bitcoin on CEXs means less liquidity for large buy or sell orders, which could potentially lead to higher price volatility during periods of high demand. Scarcity Narrative Reinforcement: Bitcoin is inherently scarce, with a fixed supply of 21 million. When a large amount moves into cold storage, it reinforces this scarcity, as a significant portion is held off the market. Potential Price Catalyst: While not a direct price driver, a sustained reduction in available BTC supply on exchanges, coupled with consistent demand, could exert upward pressure on prices over time. This indicates a bullish underlying investor sentiment . This trend suggests that a substantial portion of Bitcoin holders are becoming long-term “HODLers,” rather than short-term traders. This shift in the distribution of BTC supply could have profound effects on market stability and future price discovery, reflecting a mature approach to crypto investing. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Shifting Bitcoin Landscape For both seasoned investors and newcomers, understanding this trend in Bitcoin CEX balances provides valuable insights. The collective movement of 9,000 BTC into Bitcoin cold wallets is a clear signal of prudent asset management and long-term conviction. Consider these actionable insights: Prioritize Self-Custody: If you plan to hold Bitcoin for the long term, explore secure cold storage options. Research reputable hardware wallets and understand best practices for managing your private keys. Monitor On-Chain Data: Tools like Sentora provide invaluable insights into market movements beyond just price charts. Paying attention to crypto exchange outflows and inflows can offer a deeper understanding of market health and evolving investor sentiment . Adopt a Long-Term Perspective: The shift towards cold storage underscores a belief in Bitcoin’s enduring value. For many, this is not a speculative trade but an investment in a decentralized future, securing their portion of the total BTC supply . This trend reinforces the importance of informed decision-making in the dynamic crypto space. The movement of BTC supply off exchanges is a strong indicator of growing confidence and a preference for security among Bitcoin holders. The recent decrease of 9,000 BTC from centralized exchanges to Bitcoin cold wallets in late July is a powerful indicator. It reflects a growing desire among investors for enhanced security and a long-term commitment to their holdings. This significant crypto exchange outflow not only reduces the readily available BTC supply on trading platforms but also highlights a maturing investor sentiment focused on self-custody and resilience. As the market evolves, understanding these on-chain movements becomes increasingly vital for navigating the future of Bitcoin. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are Bitcoin CEX balances? Bitcoin CEX balances refer to the total amount of Bitcoin held by centralized cryptocurrency exchanges on behalf of their users. These balances indicate the BTC readily available for trading. Q2: What is a Bitcoin cold wallet? A Bitcoin cold wallet is an offline storage method for Bitcoin, meaning it is not connected to the internet. This provides a high level of security against online hacks and cyber threats. Q3: Why is a crypto exchange outflow significant? A significant crypto exchange outflow suggests that investors are withdrawing their assets from exchanges, often indicating a desire for self-custody, long-term holding, or a lack of immediate intent to sell. Q4: How does this trend affect BTC supply? When Bitcoin moves from exchanges to cold wallets, it reduces the immediate circulating BTC supply available for trading. This can contribute to a perception of scarcity and potentially influence market dynamics over time. Q5: What does this mean for investor sentiment? This movement indicates a maturing investor sentiment, where security and long-term conviction are prioritized. It suggests growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value and a preference for self-sovereignty over leaving assets on exchanges.

However, he is facing significant challenges to his confirmation, with his nomination currently stalled due to growing opposition and procedural delays. Brian Quintenz once served on the CFTC as commissioner and is an executive at the crypto arm of venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz. Why Brian Quintenz may no longer be fit to run the CFTC Up until very recently, Quintenz was widely seen as the candidate to lead the agency as it prepares to take on a larger role in digital asset regulation. Then, internal emails obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request suggested that Quintenz may have misappropriated confidential CFTC information while he served on the board of Kalshi, a prediction market regulated by the same agency. After a blog post from gambling industry consultant Dustin Gouker detailing the emails started making rounds on Capitol Hill, Quintenz’s public image took a hard hit. The email that has drawn the most scrutiny showed him demanding a briefing on confidential matters, including “seriatims in circulation, employees on administrative leave, a list of open applications, and ARRP submissions” — information that is not typically shared with individuals outside the agency. Critics are now citing the email as evidence of Quintenz crossing ethical boundaries, since some of the requested materials could have given him and Kalshi access to inside information or an unfair advantage over competitors. Two sources familiar with the process have risen to his defense and have claimed Quintenz never got briefed on the materials requested. Industry leaders have launched waves of attacks on Brian Quintenz Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, twin crypto billionaires and founders of Gemini, are one of the biggest forces working against Quintenz’s nomination. Reports claim they personally reached out to President Donald Trump over the weekend to withdraw his support, claiming Quintenz lacks the bold vision needed to align the agency with Trump’s pro-crypto agenda and would not push for the sweeping reforms they think the CFTC requires. The multi-billion-dollar gaming industry is also lobbying against the nomination. Their lobbyists have criticized Quintenz’s support of prediction markets, a business model they think is a potential threat to traditional gambling interests. Last month, the American Gaming Association, in conjunction with 17 tribal organizations and other major gaming groups, wrote a joint letter to the Senate Agriculture Committee demanding a more rigorous review of Quintenz’s nomination. On Monday, Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV), co-chair of the Congressional Gaming Caucus, also urged the CFTC to look into Quintenz, citing his board seat and stock holdings at Kalshi. In a letter sent to Acting Chair Pham, Titus cited the FOIA emails and wrote that the public deserves to know the extent of his financial interest in a sector he may soon be regulating. She also questioned where Quintenz’s loyalty would lie: his business interest or the general good. Quintenz has said he would resign from Kalshi’s board, divest his shares, and recuse himself from matters concerning the company for at least a year if confirmed. However, some think that might not be enough. As it stands, the White House has requested to delay the Senate Agriculture Committee vote, leaving the timeline for the confirmation uncertain. Also, the Senate is now in recess, which means a vote to advance his nomination out of committee will not happen until at least September. Despite all the drama , White House spokesperson Liz Huston has reaffirmed the administration will continue to support Quintenz and expects him to execute Trump’s mission to make America the crypto capital of the world.

The move means regulated investors in Switzerland can now hold, trade and borrow against SUI through Sygnum’s platform, broadening access to the layer-1 blockchain’s ecosystem. The bank’s services are aimed at professional and institutional investors seeking exposure under Swiss financial regulations. Earlier this week, another Swiss institution, Amina Bank, said it had started offering both trading and custodial services for SUI. Amina described the step as making it the first regulated bank globally to support the blockchain’s native asset. The announcements appear to have spurred market activity. CoinDesk Analytics data shows trading volume spiked to 36.45 million tokens over midnight, more than double the 14.31 million daily average, as buyers stepped in to defend a support zone between $3.72 and $3.74. That level has held since mid-July, suggesting short-term traders see it as a key price floor. SUI’s daily gains track closely with the broader crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), which climbed 4.5% in the past day. The token’s monthly performance is also positive, up 7% over the past 30 days, but significantly lower than the broader market, with the CD20 up 24%. For institutional clients, the expansion of regulated access to newer blockchain projects like Sui represents more than just another trading option. It signals growing comfort among banks with integrating blockchain networks beyond the largest, most established assets. In practice, this could mean asset managers, corporate treasuries and high-net-worth clients have more ways to diversify holdings without leaving regulated frameworks. Sui, developed by Mysten Labs, aims to offer high-speed, low-cost transactions using a novel data structure called “objects” to improve scalability. Wider access through banks like Sygnum and Amina could help it compete for developer attention and real-world applications. If demand for bank-mediated blockchain exposure continues to grow, Sui may find itself in a stronger position to attract not only speculative traders but also enterprise adoption.

49762788,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=187119,1754681110,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/49762788.jpeg,Crucial Win: EthereumMax Investors Secure Partial Class-Action Approval,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereummax-investors-lawsuit-win/,"BitcoinWorld Crucial Win: EthereumMax Investors Secure Partial Class-Action Approval The cryptocurrency world often moves at lightning speed, but sometimes, justice takes its time. In a significant development for the crypto community, a California judge has granted partial class-action approval to EthereumMax investors . This decision allows four state-level lawsuits to proceed against the token’s promoters, bringing a renewed focus on accountability in celebrity crypto promotion . What Does This Mean for EthereumMax Investors? This ruling is a pivotal moment for those who invested in EthereumMax (EMAX) during its highly publicized 2021 promotion. While a nationwide class-action was not approved, the judge’s decision to allow state-level cases in New York, California, Florida, and New Jersey is a substantial step forward. These lawsuits specifically target high-profile figures such as Kim Kardashian, Floyd Mayweather, and Paul Pierce, alongside the EMAX founders and their associates. The core allegation in these cases is that the 2021 promotion of EthereumMax was not a legitimate investment opportunity but rather a classic “pump and dump” scheme. This legal progress offers a glimmer of hope for investors seeking redress. Understanding the Alleged Pump and Dump Scheme For those unfamiliar, a pump and dump scheme involves artificially inflating the price of an asset, typically through misleading statements or aggressive promotion, and then selling off the cheaply purchased assets once the price peaks. In the context of the EthereumMax lawsuit , plaintiffs allege that the celebrity endorsements played a crucial role in this artificial inflation. Pump: Celebrities allegedly promoted EMAX to their vast audiences without disclosing their financial ties. This created significant hype and drove up demand. Dump: Once the price reached a desired level, the promoters and insiders allegedly sold their holdings, causing the token’s value to plummet and leaving regular investors with substantial losses. This pattern is a serious concern in the unregulated corners of the crypto market. It highlights the need for investors to exercise extreme caution, especially when dealing with projects heavily reliant on celebrity endorsements. The Role of Celebrity Crypto Promotion and Regulatory Scrutiny The involvement of celebrities like Kim Kardashian in the EMAX investors saga brought significant attention to the potential pitfalls of undisclosed paid promotions. Kardashian previously faced action from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for her role. She settled with the SEC for $1.2 million, agreeing to pay back the $250,000 she received for the promotion, plus penalties, and to not promote any crypto asset securities for three years. Cointelegraph reported on this settlement, emphasizing the regulatory body’s stance on transparency. This SEC action, coupled with the ongoing crypto legal action , sends a clear message: celebrity influencers must disclose their financial relationships when promoting investment opportunities, especially in the volatile crypto space. Investors should always question the motivations behind such endorsements. What Can Investors Learn from the EthereumMax Lawsuit? The ongoing legal battle serves as a stark reminder of the risks involved in cryptocurrency investments, particularly those pushed by high-profile figures. Here are some actionable insights for current and prospective crypto investors: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never rely solely on celebrity endorsements. Thoroughly investigate the project’s whitepaper, team, technology, and community. Understand the Risks: Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile. Invest only what you can afford to lose. Beware of Hype: Excessive hype, especially without clear utility or innovation, can be a red flag for a potential pump and dump scheme . Check for Disclosures: If a celebrity promotes a crypto asset, look for clear disclosures of their compensation. Regulatory bodies like the SEC require this transparency. Consider Legal Recourse: If you believe you have been a victim of fraud, consult with legal professionals about your options, as demonstrated by the EthereumMax lawsuit . This partial class-action approval is a significant step towards holding individuals accountable for their roles in potentially misleading crypto promotions. It reinforces the growing scrutiny from both regulators and the judiciary on the crypto market. The journey for the EMAX investors is far from over, but this ruling provides a strong foundation for their pursuit of justice. It underscores the evolving landscape of crypto legal action and the increasing pressure on promoters to act responsibly. This case will undoubtedly set precedents for future celebrity endorsements in the digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is EthereumMax (EMAX)? A1: EthereumMax (EMAX) is a cryptocurrency token launched in 2021 that gained significant attention due to celebrity promotions, but later saw its value decline sharply amidst allegations of a pump and dump scheme. Q2: Who are the celebrities involved in the EthereumMax lawsuit? A2: The lawsuits name celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, Floyd Mayweather, and Paul Pierce, among others, for their alleged roles in promoting the EMAX token. Q3: What is a “pump and dump” scheme in crypto? A3: A pump and dump scheme is a fraudulent practice where the price of an asset is artificially inflated through misleading promotions (the “pump”), after which the perpetrators sell their holdings at the inflated price (the “dump”), causing the price to crash and leaving other investors with losses. Q4: Has Kim Kardashian faced any prior action regarding EthereumMax? A4: Yes, Kim Kardashian settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for $1.2 million in 2022 over her undisclosed promotion of EthereumMax. Q5: What is the significance of the partial class-action approval for EthereumMax investors? A5: The partial class-action approval means that four state-level lawsuits can proceed, allowing a group of investors in specific states to collectively pursue claims against the promoters, potentially leading to financial recovery and setting a precedent for future crypto legal action. Q6: How can investors protect themselves from similar schemes? A6: Investors should always conduct thorough due diligence (DYOR), be skeptical of projects heavily reliant on celebrity endorsements, understand the inherent risks of crypto, and look for transparent disclosures from promoters.

Hypercube, WaterLab, and Algorand Bet Big",https://cryptonews.com/news/using-tokenization-and-crypto-donations-to-solve-the-global-water-crisis/,"The world is facing a water crisis that is expected to have a major impact on humanity in the coming years. A report from the United Nations predicts that by 2030, global demand for water will exceed sustainable supply by 40 percent. The World Economic Forum further not es that terrestrial water storage decreased by almost 1.3 trillion tonnes between 2005 and 2015. Blockchain For Solving Water Shortages While it’s frightening to think that a water shortage may soon devastate the world, blockchain technology and cryptocurrency are being leveraged to solve some of these challenges. Pietro Gorgazzini, managing director at Hypercube, told Cryptonews that with sufficient funds, virtually any region in the world could extract enough water from alternative sources to solve water scarcity. “Over 70 percent of our planet is covered by water, so the common misconception is we have plenty, but only 2.5 percent of this is freshwater, and only a fraction of that is considered sustainable and renewable, therefore useful for human survival,” Gorgazzini said. “Hypercube is on a mission to prove that drinking water can be found from wastewater, the sea, the air, and even high depths.” Gorgazzini elaborated that Hypercube has created a global water credit system to demonstrate how water can be used from alternative sources. “Hypercube selects virtuous water facilities worldwide and conducts both remote and on-site audits through appointed third parties, making sure they fully comply with water credit protocol to qualify as originators,” he said. “We then connect flowmeters to our system through APIs, registering each cubic meter of water being reclaimed along with all relevant data on the Algorand blockchain, which serves as a public and immutable registry.” The transparency that blockchain provides allows all parties to have access to the data generated by participating water facilities. In addition, for each cubic meter of water recorded, a “WTR token” worth an equivalent water credit is issued. Tokenized Water Credits on Algorand!

Wastewater is being converted into tokenized WRT… pic.twitter.com/PPOBQEB2V9 — Algorand Foundation (@AlgoFoundation) March 31, 2025 “Water-intensive companies can purchase WTR tokens and retire them—returning them irreversibly to redeem the equivalent water offset for their ESG reports,” Gorgazzini noted. Funds from each transaction are also used to reward water facilitators of the underlying reclaimed cubic meters. Gorgazzini explained that these funds can be used to cover the cost of infrastructure, including audits, and fund new water initiatives in regions and communities that need it the most. Although Hypercube was launched in April 2024, the company has already tokenized over 50 million cubic meters of reclaimed water. Gorgazzini hopes Hypercube will hit 100 million cubic meters by the end of the year. “We’ve successfully onboarded some of the largest international NGOs, leading auditing companies, consulting firms, and all the relevant stakeholders needed to ensure global endorsement,” Gorgazzini shared. He added that the most important achievement to date has been the current initiatives that wouldn’t have been possible without tokenization . “For example, Hypercube enabled the full revamping of a wastewater reuse facility in northern Italy, which now processes over 7 million cubic meters per year,” he said. Tokenization For Profitable Water Production A project known as WaterLab is also using tokenization to generate freshwater by funding the deployment of water desalination systems. Aaron Mandell, founder and CEO of WaterLab, told Cryptonews that he believes water is actually a limitless resource, yet most of it needs to be refined—or desalinated —before use. Unfortunately, water desalination is often challenging and costly. In order to combat this, Mandell explained that WaterLab issues a tokenized water credit to fund the costs of desalination. “We finance the desalination system by selling water credits, which are tokenized water contracts,” he said. “Each token is a contract for one unit of water (1 token = 1 m3). Water credits are generated by producers of water or desalination plants, which WaterLAB then tokenizes and sells to water holders.” saltwater is unlimited – as soon as we harness desalination there will be no one without water. https://t.co/eroG9YgrO8 — WaterLAB (@_WaterDAO) July 25, 2025 Mandell elaborated that water holders can be described as people who want to buy water purely as a financial hedge (like an oil future) or those who ultimately want to redeem their contract for the delivery of physical water. WaterLab has currently deployed water desalination systems in the US, Nicaragua and in the Bahamas, where additional water is needed or there is limited infrastructure. WaterLab Water Miner. Source: WaterLab “We have enough desalination capacity currently in operation to produce 1 million units of water (1M m3), which makes up the current supply of credits. We are also funding desalination research to further advance the technology,” Mandell remarked. Crypto Donations For New Water Campaign While blockchain and tokenization are solving water production challenges, crypto donations are currently being raised to bring clean water to 2 million people across five continents. A creator-led fundraising campaign known as “TeamWater” was launched on August 1 and will run through the entire month of August. The campaign’s goal is to raise $40 million in just one month to fund long-term, community-driven water solutions. TeamWater just crossed the $10,000,000 mark!!! We’re now 25% of the way to the goal of giving 2,000,000 people clean water for decades each GO DONATE – https://t.co/ECmQ6pJq7o pic.twitter.com/N6XcdDJuXq — MrBeast (@MrBeast) August 6, 2025 Crypto donation platform The Giving Block is the official crypto partner behind TeamWater. Pat Duffy, co-founder of The Giving Block, told Cryptonews that as of August 4, the campaign had already raised over $2.7 million in crypto donations alone. “This represents an impressive 40 percent of the total donation amount received so far. The crypto community is showing up in a big way to help drive this movement forward,” Duffy said. Web3 Models Have Potential, But Challenges Remain Although there is potential for blockchain and cryptocurrency to help solve the water crisis, a number of challenges may slow progress. According to Gorgazzini, the biggest challenge from a business development perspective is that many traditional industries remain skeptical of Web3 models . “Just mentioning blockchain can trigger concerns,” he said. In order to overcome this, Gorgazzini believes that education is key. “We need to engage with stakeholders and policy makers early on.” Mandell added that while the Web3 community is passionate about solving environmental issues related to water, many of these individuals remain well-versed in cryptocurrency, but not blockchain models. “This also needs to change in order for the market to grow,” he said. “Web3 will be most impactful when it becomes entirely invisible—when individuals can buy water assets without realizing the profit is related to tokenization.” The post Can Tokenization Unlock Sustainable Water?

By 2022, NEAR’s price crashed to below $2.00, losing over 90% of its peak value. Throughout 2023, NEAR saw low volatility, with prices remaining below $2.50 for most of the year. Since the start of 2024, NEAR has experienced a strong recovery, climbing to $7.80. However, after reaching the $8.00 mark in mid-May, it fell back to $5.60. In June, NEAR traded between $4.48 and $7.66. It rose from $5.20 to $6.04 in July but closed the month below $5.00. NEAR started August at $5.00, declining to $3.89 by the end of the month. In September 2024, the asset bounced back and closed the month above the $5.20 mark. In October, the price stumbled and fell to $4.850 in the first few days before closing the month below the $4.00 mark leaving a negative outlook at the start of November.

Recently, a double bottom pattern has emerged in their charts, hinting at a potential price increase. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors might find this development intriguing. The analysis delves into whether these tokens are poised for growth, offering valuable insights into their future performance. Cosmos (ATOM): Past Trends and Current Price Trading Levels Cosmos has shown mixed behavior over recent periods with a month-over-month increase of 8.17%, highlighting renewed buyer interest. Its price has fluctuated between $3.64 and $5.06, reflecting volatility amid overall market changes. A weekly gain of 6.04% indicates short-term optimism, while a six-month decline of 2.09% suggests broader market pressure. Price movements during these timescales point to consolidation with intermittent bursts of activity keeping traders alert to evolving conditions. Current trading levels position Cosmos within a defined price corridor. The price range of $3.64 to $5.06 is supported by immediate support near $3.07 and impending resistance around $5.90. A secondary resistance is set at $7.31, with deeper support at $1.66. Oscillators indicate a neutral balance between bulls and bears, with no strong trend evident. Traders may look to buy near support for potential rebounds or target resistance near $5.90 for selling opportunities. Managing risk with stops just below support is advisable as the market awaits clear signals. Watch for volume spikes that could influence price movement. Celestia Market Pulse: Recent Trends and Key Price Levels Celestia showed a 7.80% monthly rise even as the previous six months brought a steep decline of 42.99%. The coin experienced a modest gain of 2.98% in a single week, highlighting some short-term strength despite longer-term pressures. Price behavior over the past month indicated a recovery phase, with brief rallies that struggled to sustain momentum over a half-year view. The mixed performance underscores volatile phases marked by short bursts of upward movement amid an overall bearish trend in the longer timeframe. Celestia currently trades between $1.25 and $2.20, with important technical levels in play. A strong support level sits at $0.82, while a key resistance forms around $2.72. Indicators show a Relative Strength Index of 46.83, with restricted buying power and bears maintaining influence over the longer decline. Trading within these ranges calls for caution: consider entering near the support level at $0.82 and prepare to exit if the price nears the resistance around $2.72. The current environment may offer range-bound opportunities for quick trades while awaiting a more definitive trend direction. Conclusion Both ATOM and TIA show a double bottom pattern, indicating a potential reversal. This pattern often signals a shift from a downtrend to an uptrend. Investors may view this as a sign of upcoming price increases. If confirmed, it could mark a favorable opportunity for those interested in these cryptocurrencies.

Recently, a significant update emerged regarding BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. Many in the crypto community have been eagerly watching for potential new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for popular altcoins. However, a spokesperson for BlackRock has clarified their current position, stating that the firm “does not have any plans to file an XRP ETF or SOL ETF at this time.” This announcement is a crucial piece of information for anyone following the institutional adoption of digital assets and the future of a BlackRock ETF . What’s the Latest on BlackRock’s XRP and SOL ETF Plans? BlackRock, a name synonymous with global finance and substantial investment vehicles, recently addressed speculation surrounding new cryptocurrency offerings. A spokesperson for the firm explicitly told The Block that “at this time, BlackRock does not have any plans to file an XRP ETF or SOL ETF .” This direct statement puts a temporary halt to hopes for immediate institutional investment products tied directly to these specific cryptocurrencies from the asset management titan. The clarity from BlackRock is important, as their previous moves, like filing for a Bitcoin spot ETF, have significantly impacted market sentiment and legitimacy for digital assets. Investors often view a BlackRock ETF as a stamp of approval, signaling maturity and broader acceptance for the underlying asset. Why Isn’t BlackRock Launching More Digital Asset ETFs Now? Understanding BlackRock’s cautious approach to certain Digital Asset ETF offerings involves looking at several factors. Firstly, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum remains complex and uncertain in many jurisdictions, particularly in the United States. While Bitcoin has seen successful spot ETF approvals, other digital assets, like XRP, have faced ongoing legal scrutiny, which naturally creates hesitancy for major financial institutions. Secondly, market maturity and liquidity for some altcoins might not yet meet the stringent requirements BlackRock typically demands for its investment products. Establishing robust custody solutions and ensuring market integrity are paramount for any new Crypto ETF . What Does This Mean for XRP and SOL Holders? This announcement from BlackRock, while not entirely unexpected by some, carries weight for holders of XRP and SOL. For those hoping for an immediate surge in price driven by institutional inflows via a dedicated XRP ETF or SOL ETF , the news suggests patience is required. However, it is crucial to remember that ‘no plans at this time’ does not mean ‘never.’ The cryptocurrency market evolves rapidly, and regulatory clarity could shift. Investors should focus on the fundamental developments of XRP and SOL projects, their utility, and broader market trends rather than solely relying on ETF approvals. Diversification and understanding the inherent volatility of digital assets remain key strategies. How Does This Impact the Wider Crypto ETF Market? Despite BlackRock’s current position on XRP and SOL, the overall trend towards institutional adoption of digital assets continues. The success of existing Bitcoin spot ETFs, including BlackRock’s own IBIT, demonstrates a strong appetite from traditional investors for regulated crypto exposure. Discussions around an Ethereum spot ETF are also ongoing, suggesting a gradual expansion of the Crypto ETF market. This measured approach from major players like BlackRock indicates a strategic, step-by-step entry into the broader digital asset space, prioritizing assets with clearer regulatory pathways and established market infrastructure. The future will likely see more innovation in the Digital Asset ETF sector, but perhaps at a more deliberate pace for newer assets. BlackRock’s clarification regarding no immediate plans for an XRP ETF or SOL ETF serves as a reminder of the evolving and often cautious nature of institutional engagement with the cryptocurrency market. While it may temper some immediate expectations, it underscores the importance of regulatory clarity and market maturity for new investment products. The journey for digital assets into mainstream finance is ongoing, and each announcement, whether positive or cautious, shapes the path forward for crypto ETFs and investor confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Is BlackRock planning any other crypto ETFs soon? While BlackRock has stated no current plans for XRP or SOL ETFs, they have successfully launched a Bitcoin spot ETF (IBIT) and discussions continue around an Ethereum spot ETF. Their strategy seems to be a measured expansion into digital assets. Why are institutional ETFs important for cryptocurrencies? Institutional ETFs provide a regulated and accessible way for traditional investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly owning the underlying assets. This can bring significant capital, enhance legitimacy, and reduce volatility. What are the main challenges for new crypto ETFs? Key challenges include regulatory uncertainty, particularly for assets deemed securities, ensuring robust custody solutions, and achieving sufficient market liquidity and maturity to meet institutional standards. Does this announcement negatively impact XRP and SOL long-term? Not necessarily long-term. While it removes immediate ETF-driven price speculation from BlackRock, the underlying projects of XRP and SOL continue to develop. Their long-term success will depend more on utility, adoption, and broader market conditions than solely on ETF approvals.

In late July and early August, several leading brokerages and think tanks canceled their events and halted stablecoin research on orders from financial regulators, according to sources familiar with the matter. Authorities are also concerned that stablecoins could be used as a new tool for fraudulent activities in mainland China. While cryptocurrency transactions are completely banned in the country, some recent official statements have led to speculation that China's approach to the sector may be softening. The approval of Hong Kong's development as a digital asset hub and the stablecoin regulations that came into effect this month, in particular, have increased interest among Chinese companies.

They want to avoid a herd mentality when the risks are unknown,” said Christopher Wong, a Singapore-based currency strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. Despite China's crypto ban, over-the-counter digital asset transactions reached $75 billion in the first nine months of 2024, according to Chainalysis data. Warnings have been raised in recent months about illicit fundraising activities linked to virtual currencies and stablecoins in regions such as Beijing, Suzhou, and Zhejiang. *This is not investment advice.

The deal’s all-stock nature raises broader questions about shareholder protections amid volatile AI infrastructure valuations. Institutional investor resistance may indicate shifting expectations for governance and transparency in high-growth infrastructure sectors. Two Seas Capital, which holds a 6.3% stake in the Bitcoin miner Core Scientific, said it will vote against the company’s proposed acquisition by CoreWeave, according to an open letter published by the firm. The letter, addressed to fellow shareholders, argues that the all-stock deal undervalues Core Scientific and leaves investors vulnerable to price fluctuations in CoreWeave’s shares. Objection Raised by Two Seas Capital The firm described the transaction structure as “deficient” and said it believes the deal unfairly favors CoreWeave at the expense of Core Scientific shareholders. “We are not philosophically opposed to a merger of these two parties,” wrote Sina Toussi, founder and CIO of Two Seas Capital. “We are also investors in CoreWeave, believe in its strategy, and respect its management team. Moreover, we have advocated for this combination as we clearly recognize the strategic merits,” said Toussi.

It cited rising demand for computing power driven by AI applications as a key factor in its decision. While Two Seas also holds an investment in CoreWeave and acknowledges the strategic rationale behind a merger, it called on Core Scientific’s board to secure terms that encapsulate the company’s full value, including potential synergies. Alleged Undervaluation of Core Scientific The letter said Two Seas plans to solicit other shareholders to vote against the current terms unless revisions are made. “We believe the Company’s most promising days lie ahead,” the letter said. “In our view, there is no compelling reason to sell Core Scientific at an underwhelming valuation with a deficient structure.” Some institutional investors are questioning all-stock mergers involving infrastructure firms tied to AI, especially when deal structures expose shareholders to post-closing price swings. These concerns often focus on whether equity-only transactions provide sufficient protection or value in volatile markets. The Core Scientific case also points to ongoing debate around how much future demand for compute infrastructure should factor into deal pricing. As competition increases and asset valuations shift, shareholder votes may become a more active checkpoint in determining the direction of consolidation in this sector.

For those keenly observing the cryptocurrency and broader tech markets, the emergence of groundbreaking AI tools presents both immense opportunities and complex challenges. One such development capturing significant attention is the rise of AI-generated AI videos , particularly the viral phenomenon dubbed ‘brainrot’ videos. These captivating, often bizarre clips are redefining digital storytelling and user engagement, driven by innovative startups like OpenArt. What are ‘Brainrot Videos’ and Why Are They Trending? You’ve likely scrolled past them on your social media feeds: short, hyper-imaginative clips featuring characters like a shark in sneakers or a ballerina with a coffee cup for a head. These are the so-called ‘brainrot videos,’ a term coined to describe their often nonsensical yet strangely compelling nature. They are currently gaining significant traction, especially among younger users, due to their unique visual style and rapid production. What makes these brainrot videos so appealing is their ability to deliver a quick, often humorous, and visually striking narrative that stands out in a crowded content space. The appeal lies in: Novelty: They offer something distinctly different from traditional video content. Ease of Consumption: Short, digestible formats perfect for platforms like TikTok. Creativity Unleashed: AI allows for character and scenario combinations previously unimaginable or too costly to produce. This trend highlights a broader shift towards AI-assisted content creation, making it accessible to a wider audience than ever before. OpenArt’s Revolutionary ‘One-Click Story’ Feature At the forefront of this new wave is OpenArt , an AI startup founded in 2022 by two former Google employees. With approximately 3 million monthly active users, OpenArt is not just riding the trend; it’s actively shaping it. The company recently launched its highly anticipated ‘one-click story’ feature in open beta, a tool designed to drastically simplify video production. This innovative feature allows users to: Input a single sentence, a script, or even an audio file like a song. Transform that input into a one-minute video complete with a coherent story arc. The versatility of this tool is impressive. It can generate light-hearted stories ideal for TikTok, more serious explainer videos for YouTube, or even compelling music videos. OpenArt even envisions its application in advertising, offering a new avenue for brands to create dynamic, engaging content quickly. The ‘one-click story’ feature provides three distinct templates: Character Vlog: Users upload an image of their character and enter a prompt to guide the narrative. Music Video: The software analyzes uploaded songs, understands the lyrics, and generates animations that align with the song’s themes, such as illustrating flowers blooming in a garden for a nature-themed track. Explainer: Designed for educational or informational content, simplifying complex topics into engaging visual stories. Users maintain creative control, able to edit individual clips by revisiting the editor’s storyboard mode and tweaking prompts for a more refined result. OpenArt’s platform stands out by aggregating over 50 different AI models, including popular ones like DALLE-3, GPT, Imagen, Flux Kontext, and Stable Diffusion, allowing users to choose their preferred tools for generation. The Power of Generative AI in Video Creation The core of OpenArt’s innovation lies in its masterful application of generative AI . This technology, which can produce new content from existing data, is democratizing video production by significantly lowering the barrier to entry for aspiring creators. Previously, creating animated or highly visual content required extensive skills in animation, graphic design, and video editing, along with expensive software and hardware. With generative AI, the process is streamlined: Speed: Content that once took days or weeks can now be produced in minutes. Accessibility: Individuals without specialized technical skills can create professional-looking videos. Innovation: The ability to experiment with unique characters and narratives is greatly enhanced, leading to novel content forms like ‘brainrot’ videos. This shift empowers a new generation of digital artists and content creators, fostering an environment where imagination is the primary limit, not technical proficiency or budget. The ability to quickly iterate and refine ideas means creators can adapt to trends and audience feedback at an unprecedented pace. Navigating the Complexities: IP and Ethical Challenges for AI Videos While the benefits of tools like OpenArt are clear—such as rapidly producing content with original characters and narratives—the landscape of AI videos is not without its controversies. The rapid advancement of generative AI has brought numerous ethical and legal issues to the forefront. These include concerns about: Imitating Artists’ Styles: AI models can learn and replicate the distinctive styles of human artists, raising questions about attribution and compensation. Intellectual Property (IP) Rights: The use of copyrighted characters or imagery in AI-generated content poses significant legal risks. Misuse and Misinformation: The ease of creating realistic but fabricated videos raises concerns about the spread of deepfakes and misinformation. During testing, OpenArt acknowledged that its Character Vlog option might inadvertently venture into legally grey areas, particularly concerning characters like Pikachu, SpongeBob, and Super Mario. The potential for IP infringement is real, as evidenced by recent lawsuits, such as Disney and Universal suing AI firm Midjourney over AI-generated images. Users should be acutely aware that creating videos that infringe on copyright could lead to their content being removed from social media platforms. Furthermore, users found to have contributed to infringement could face legal action from copyright holders. Coco Mao, co-founder and CEO of OpenArt, addressed these concerns, stating, “We try to be cautious around the IP infringement. When you upload some IP characters, by default, the models we use will reject them, and it’s not able to produce the IP character, but sometimes it slips.” Mao also expressed openness to discussing licensing agreements with major IP holders, indicating a proactive approach to these complex legal challenges. OpenArt: A Promising AI Startup with Big Plans What truly sets OpenArt apart in the crowded AI space is its commitment to character consistency. Unlike many average video models that produce simple, standalone clips users must manually piece together, OpenArt aims to ensure that both visuals and narrative remain cohesive throughout the video. “A problem that a lot of AI couldn’t really handle well is to have the character consistent in the same video…If you don’t have the same character, then it’s hard to get immersed in the story,” Mao explained. This focus on narrative immersion is a significant differentiator, making OpenArt’s outputs more compelling and professional. Looking ahead, OpenArt has ambitious plans for its ‘one-click’ feature, including enabling users to create videos featuring conversations between two different characters. The development of a mobile application is also on their roadmap, promising even greater accessibility and convenience for creators on the go. Financially, OpenArt operates on a credit-based system, offering several plans to cater to different user needs: Basic Plan: $14 per month for 4,000 credits, including up to 4 One-Click stories, 40 videos, 4,000 images, and 4 characters. Advanced Plan: $30 per month for 12,000 credits, including up to 12 One-Click stories. Infinite Plan: Priced at $56 per month for 24,000 credits. Team Plan: Available for $35 per month per member. To date, OpenArt has successfully raised $5 million in funding from notable investors like Basis Set Ventures and DCM Ventures. The company boasts a positive cash flow and is on track to achieve an impressive annual revenue rate exceeding $20 million, signaling strong market adoption and financial health for this innovative AI startup. OpenArt’s journey highlights the dynamic nature of AI innovation. By simplifying complex creative processes and addressing user needs for narrative consistency, OpenArt is not just creating ‘brainrot’ videos; it’s pioneering a new era of accessible, AI-powered storytelling. While the ethical and legal challenges surrounding AI-generated content remain, OpenArt’s proactive approach and commitment to continuous improvement position it as a key player in the future of digital media. For creators, marketers, and enthusiasts alike, understanding these developments is crucial as AI continues to reshape how we consume and produce content.

For those keenly following the cutting-edge of technology, much like the advancements in blockchain and cryptocurrencies, the latest collaboration between NASA and Google represents a monumental stride. They are jointly developing an AI medical assistant , a groundbreaking tool designed to ensure the well-being of astronauts on unprecedented long-duration voyages, especially to Mars. This initiative not only pushes the boundaries of medical support but also highlights the critical role of advanced AI in enabling future space missions . Why is Earth-Independent Space Health Crucial? For decades, astronauts on the International Space Station have benefited from relatively close proximity to Earth, allowing for real-time communication with medical experts in Houston, regular resupply of medicines, and the option of a swift return home if severe health issues arise. However, as NASA, in partnership with private ventures like Elon Musk’s SpaceX, sets its sights on journeys to the Moon and Mars, these luxuries will no longer be available. The sheer distance and duration of these future space missions necessitate a paradigm shift in space health protocols. Astronauts will need to be self-sufficient, capable of handling complex medical situations without immediate external support. This looming reality is the driving force behind NASA’s push for ‘Earth-independent’ medical solutions. Unveiling the AI Medical Assistant: CMO-DA At the heart of this transformative effort is the Crew Medical Officer Digital Assistant (CMO-DA), an experimental AI medical assistant born from the collaborative genius of NASA Google AI . This proof-of-concept tool is specifically engineered to empower astronauts to diagnose and treat symptoms effectively, even when direct communication with Earth is compromised or impossible. Running within Google Cloud’s Vertex AI environment, CMO-DA is a multimodal system, processing information through speech, text, and images. David Cruley, a customer engineer at Google’s Public Sector business unit, explained that the project operates under a fixed-price Google Public Sector subscription, covering cloud services, application development infrastructure, and model training. Significantly, NASA retains ownership of the source code and has played a pivotal role in fine-tuning the underlying AI models, leveraging the Vertex AI platform’s access to both Google and third-party models. Rigorous Testing and Promising Astronaut Care Outcomes The effectiveness of CMO-DA, the pioneering AI medical assistant , has been rigorously tested through simulated medical scenarios. NASA and Google subjected the tool to three distinct challenges: an ankle injury, flank pain, and ear pain. A panel of three physicians, including an experienced astronaut, meticulously evaluated the assistant’s performance across critical aspects: initial evaluation, history-taking, clinical reasoning, and treatment planning. The results were highly encouraging, showcasing a remarkable degree of diagnostic accuracy. The assessment found the flank pain evaluation and treatment plan to be 74% likely correct, ear pain at 80%, and an impressive 88% accuracy for the ankle injury. These promising figures underscore the potential of CMO-DA to significantly enhance astronaut care in remote space environments. The Evolutionary Path for Space Health and Beyond The development roadmap for this advanced AI medical assistant is intentionally incremental, reflecting a cautious yet ambitious approach. NASA scientists have outlined plans to integrate additional data sources, such as direct inputs from medical devices, to further enrich the AI’s diagnostic capabilities. A key future objective is to train the model to be ‘situationally aware,’ meaning it will be attuned to the unique physiological and environmental conditions of space medicine, including the profound effects of microgravity. While Google’s Cruley remained circumspect about the company’s immediate plans for regulatory clearance to deploy this type of medical assistant in terrestrial doctor’s offices, the potential for such a transition is evident. The lessons learned from developing this tool for space health could undoubtedly have broad applicability to other areas of healthcare, extending its impact far beyond future space missions and offering innovative solutions for medical challenges on Earth. The collaboration between NASA and Google on the Crew Medical Officer Digital Assistant marks a pivotal moment in human spaceflight and medical technology. This AI medical assistant is not merely a tool; it’s a testament to human ingenuity, preparing us for the next giant leaps in space exploration. By empowering astronauts with autonomous medical capabilities, we are not only safeguarding their health on long-duration missions but also laying the groundwork for revolutionary advancements in healthcare that could benefit everyone on Earth. As we look towards a future where humanity ventures deeper into the cosmos, the synergy of AI and space medicine promises a healthier, safer journey for all.

Inflation has blown up to 25%, the highest in 34 years. Dollars are almost impossible to get. Trust in the government is hanging by a thread. So people are moving fast into cryptocurrencies, as a way to keep their businesses running and their savings from shrinking. At El Alto International Airport, a shop sells candy and sunglasses in USDT , a stablecoin tied to the dollar. A top university sends paychecks in Bitcoin to foreign professors. For a while, the state oil company even got permission to make foreign payments in stablecoins. In just the first half of 2025, digital transactions shot up more than five times, hitting $300 million. “Among importers, crypto use is high,” Oswaldo Barriga said. “When they can’t access hard currency and need to make urgent payments, crypto becomes a viable alternative.” Bolivians turn to digital money as the economy falls apart The numbers behind the crisis are grim. The government has run budget deficits for 11 years in a row. Foreign debt has grown to about a quarter of the country’s GDP. The natural gas industry, once a steady source of dollars, has collapsed. On top of that, the boliviano’s fixed exchange rate has made imported goods more expensive. For most people, the value of their money is dropping every week. This has created a perfect opening for crypto. Many see it as a way to avoid the slow death of their savings. But it’s not without risks. Some stablecoins have been caught with shaky reserves. Bitcoin’s price can jump or crash in a single day. Even so, the distrust in banks and government is so deep that people prefer the risk. With a presidential election coming on August 17, no one expects a quick fix, and the shift toward digital assets is already too far along to stop. Getting US dollars is a headache. Banks sometimes allow only $100 a week in withdrawals. On the black market, one dollar goes for 14 bolivianos, double the official rate, the same price many pay for one USDT. This has made stablecoins a practical stand-in for cash. In downtown La Paz, Christopher Salas runs a small coffee stand. Most customers still pay in bolivianos, but some use satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin, by scanning a QR code linked to their Blink wallet. “I’m not the only one using Bitcoin,” Christopher said. “There’s a barbershop over there and a gym that also accepts satoshis.” For him, it’s both a way to protect his savings and, as he put it, “a way to go against the system, against bureaucracy.” Platforms and payment systems race to keep up with demand Crypto platforms are seeing a rush of new users. Carlos Neira, who co-founded Colombian wallet provider Meru, said Bolivian accounts on his platform have grown by 6,600% since the ban was lifted. Binance is also popular for its low fees and beginner tutorials. But there are reminders of how fragile the market can be. The Terra stablecoin collapsed in 2022, wiping out billions. In 2021, Tether paid $41 million to settle US claims that it lied about its reserves. Even the US dollar, the anchor for most stablecoins, is down about 8% this year, according to data from Bloomberg , because of changes in US trade policy. The government’s involvement has been minimal since legalizing crypto. Unlike El Salvador, which made Bitcoin legal tender and heavily promoted it, Bolivia simply ended the ban and stepped back. Adoption here has been driven by the public, not a state campaign. In El Salvador , only 4.9% of transactions in 2023 were in Bitcoin despite the law. Other Latin American countries have also seen people turn to crypto during inflation (like Venezuela and Argentina), but mostly as savings. In Bolivia, it’s becoming a payment tool. “Foreign companies view Bolivia as the epicenter of the crypto ecosystem in Latin America,” Mauricio Dulon said at a recent crypto summit in La Paz. That interest has brought more providers into the market. Hugo Miranda of the Bolivia Internet Foundation said both global and local companies are moving in fast. Social media influencers are promoting crypto as a way to escape financial limits. Businesses are adapting, too. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

49763924,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=187146,1754682911,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/49763924.jpeg,Microsoft Lens’s Shocking End: How Copilot AI Reshapes Mobile Scanning,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/microsoft-lens-copilot-ai/,"BitcoinWorld Microsoft Lens’s Shocking End: How Copilot AI Reshapes Mobile Scanning The world of technology is constantly evolving, and for those deeply invested in the fast-paced shifts of the digital landscape, especially in areas like cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance, understanding these transitions is key. We often see how new innovations like AI promise revolutionary changes, sometimes at the cost of beloved, simpler tools. This very trend is now playing out with the unexpected retirement of Microsoft Lens , a straightforward yet incredibly effective mobile scanning app that many users relied upon for quick, fuss-free digitization. The End of an Era: Farewell, Microsoft Lens For years, Microsoft Lens stood out as a beacon of simplicity in a crowded app marketplace. Launched in 2015, originally as Office Lens, it offered a clean, intuitive way to transform physical documents, whiteboards, business cards, and even handwritten notes into digital files. What made it particularly appealing was its commitment to core functionality without the common pitfalls of modern apps—no hidden fees, no aggressive subscription pushes, just pure utility. It expertly converted scans into various formats like PDF, Word, PowerPoint, and Excel, complete with useful filters for enhancement. However, the winds of change are blowing, and Microsoft has officially announced the discontinuation of this popular mobile scanner app . The timeline for its retirement is clear: September 15, 2025: Lens will be retired from iOS and Android devices. November 15, 2025: The app will be removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play. December 15, 2025: New scans will no longer be possible. Existing scans will remain accessible on the user’s device. This decision, first highlighted by BleepingComputer, marks a significant shift, as Microsoft directs users towards its more expansive, AI-centric offering: Copilot AI . Is Copilot AI a True Replacement for AI Document Scanning ? Microsoft’s strategy is clear: consolidate functionalities into its AI flagship, Copilot AI . The intent is to leverage advanced AI capabilities for a more integrated user experience. While Copilot is undeniably powerful in many respects, particularly its conversational AI and content generation, questions arise about its suitability as a direct successor for dedicated AI document scanning . The core issue highlighted by users and tech observers is a feature parity gap. While Copilot can indeed handle some scanning tasks, it currently lacks several key functionalities that made Lens so effective and user-friendly: Direct Integration: Lens allowed seamless saving of scans directly to OneNote, Word, or PowerPoint. Copilot does not currently offer this level of direct integration for scanned content. Business Card Scanning: A standout feature of Lens was its ability to accurately scan business cards and save contact information to OneNote. This specific functionality is missing in Copilot. Accessibility Features: Lens incorporated valuable accessibility tools like read-out-loud and Immersive Reader integration, crucial for many users. These features are not present in Copilot’s scanning capabilities. This disparity suggests that while Copilot is a versatile AI assistant, it may not yet be a one-to-one replacement for the specialized, optimized experience Lens provided for document scanning. Users who valued Lens for its specific, streamlined purpose might find themselves looking for alternative solutions. The Broader Implications of AI Integration in Apps The discontinuation of Microsoft Lens in favor of Copilot AI is more than just an app update; it’s a microcosm of a larger trend in the tech industry: the pervasive AI integration into existing software ecosystems. Companies are increasingly embedding AI capabilities into their core products, aiming for a unified, intelligent experience. The goal is often to simplify user workflows, automate tasks, and provide predictive insights, thereby driving a new wave of digital transformation. On one hand, this move promises innovation. AI can enhance scanning by improving OCR (Optical Character Recognition) accuracy, automating categorization, and even summarizing scanned content. For a company like Microsoft, consolidating features into Copilot could lead to a more powerful, all-encompassing productivity suite. On the other hand, it raises questions about user choice and the “bloat” factor. Will specialized, single-purpose apps like Lens be sacrificed at the altar of multi-functional AI platforms, even if the AI doesn’t perfectly replicate the specialized tool’s utility? The popularity of Lens, evidenced by its 92.3 million downloads since 2017 and over 322,000 downloads in the last 30 days alone (according to Appfigures), underscores that there is a significant user base that valued its simplicity and dedicated functionality. This user base might now face a dilemma: adapt to Copilot’s different workflow, or seek out third-party alternatives that still offer the focused scanning experience they prefer. Navigating the Future of Digital Transformation As we navigate this period of rapid digital transformation, the case of Microsoft Lens serves as a poignant reminder that while AI promises immense potential, the transition isn’t always seamless for the end-user. The convenience of a dedicated, no-frills tool is often underestimated until it’s gone. For businesses and individuals who rely heavily on efficient document digitization, this shift necessitates evaluating new workflows and exploring the evolving landscape of AI document scanning solutions. The move by Microsoft signals a future where AI isn’t just an add-on but the central nervous system of our digital tools. While this promises exciting advancements, it also challenges developers to ensure that the integration of AI truly enhances, rather than diminishes, the user experience for specific tasks. The coming months will reveal how users adapt to Copilot’s capabilities and whether Microsoft will further refine its AI offerings to fully compensate for the loss of a simple, effective tool like Lens.

In a new strategy session, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 800,200 followers on the social media platform X that if the top crypto asset by market cap were to plunge below $115,000, it could see a significant dip in price. “Bitcoin didn’t break entirely through the resistance here. Small corrective day, however, on the lower timeframes, it’s clear that Bitcoin is trending upwards again. Crucial area to hold at $115,000. If that’s lost, likely new lows.” Van de Poppe goes even further and says that if the crypto king can hold the support zone, it will lead to a new all-time high (ATH) price. “Phenomenal break upwards on the altcoin and Bitcoin markets. It’s still facing the next resistance, but the trend seems to be kicking back upwards. What is crucial to hold? $114,800 Hold that and we’ll be seeing a new ATH. Right on edge with the rates falling downwards.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Bitcoin is trading for $116,497 at time of writing. Moving on to the largest smart contract platform by volume, Van de Poppe says that the top altcoin appears ready to make a move toward the $4,000 price tag in the coming days. “ETH is back to $3,900 and is likely going to attack that $4,000 resistance in the coming days. The markets are strong, volume is picking up, more volatility is coming in and the joy will be back.” The trader goes on to note that he believes there is an opportunity in altcoins as they are currently being overlooked and will see massive gains in the next 2-4 months . “I think that the altcoin markets are extremely mispriced… Almost all altcoins haven’t gotten back to their previous levels, which means that there’s still a massive opportunity that people overlook as they are too busy screaming on social media how bad the markets are. I remain all-in into altcoins as I think that there’s 200-500% to be made in the next 2-4 months. A lot of altcoins haven’t really gotten back to their levels from early ’25. Of course, some aren’t going to be showing momentum, but the recent move of ETH is the first step forwards to a more risk-on appetite.” Ethereum is trading for $3,945 at time of writing.

According to multiple analysts, three tokens stand out during this correction: XRP, Shiba Inu (SHIB), and MAGACOIN FINANCE, a rising star among political crypto projects. XRP Eyes $11–$37 Targets Based on Historical Cycles XRP continues to attract bullish outlooks from analysts despite macro headwinds. Market expert EGRAG recently identified a key ascending resistance trendline, dubbed “The Chasm,” that has historically limited XRP’s rallies. In past cycles, a breakout from this level triggered explosive gains. If XRP merely “touches” the Chasm line, projections place it around $11. Meanwhile, a full breakout similar to its 2017 move could push it as high as $37, according to EGRAG. Supporting this outlook, other technical analysts point to XRP’s recent breakout from a bull flag formation. Chart Nerd, a prominent analyst, highlights XRP’s $2.60 support zone and sets near-term targets at $8 and $15. He emphasized whale accumulation and renewed social momentum as key drivers during this dip. These developments make XRP one of the best altcoin to buy during this dip. Shiba Inu Targets 156% Rally as Technical Setup Strengthens Shiba Inu (SHIB) also enters the spotlight as one of the best altcoin to buy during a dip, following a confirmed bullish divergence on the two-day chart. According to analyst Javon Marks, SHIB could rally over 156%, aiming for a target near $0.000032, if it maintains support at the current consolidation level around $0.0000125. Further backing the bullish narrative, SHIB recently broke out of a descending channel, with analyst Jonathan Carter identifying key resistance levels at $0.00001400, $0.00001750, and beyond. High-volume zones and whale activity continue to suggest that the memecoin could be preparing for its next leg up. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Best Altcoin to Buy for 700% Potential? Likewise, MAGACOIN FINANCE is standing out as the most promising altcoin among emerging projects. With a politically charged narrative, meme utility, and strong anti-centralization messaging, the token has gained ground across analyst reviews and community discussions. Several presale rounds have already sold out, and analysts are forecasting an easy 700% gain based on early momentum, viral engagement, and strategic roadmap execution. MAGACOIN FINANCE is particularly attractive to retail traders seeking alternatives to institutional products stalled by regulatory uncertainty. As traders pivot away from slow-moving ETF approvals and into trend-driven opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the best altcoin to buy now, not just during this dip, but for the broader 2025 cycle. Conclusion While the broader crypto market remains under pressure, savvy investors are using this dip as a strategic buying opportunity. Analysts are placing XRP, Shiba Inu (SHIB), and MAGACOIN FINANCE at the top of their watchlists. This is thanks to strong technical setups, growing community momentum, and significant upside potential. While all three altcoins present compelling opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early-stage momentum and unique narrative could offer the most significant upside for risk-tolerant investors.

Within just a few months, its record-breaking presale has captured massive attention, with experts already comparing its growth trajectory to the likes of Tron (TRX) , a coin that achieved meteoric success in its early days. With more than 80% of Phase 2 tokens sold , a recently secured CoinMarketCap (CMC) listing , and plans to revolutionize the $100 billion content creation economy , Ruvi AI is positioned as a high-growth opportunity. Here’s an in-depth look at why investors are flocking to this project and why you might want to act fast before the price hikes by 33% in the next stage. How the CoinMarketCap Listing Boosted Ruvi AI Securing a CoinMarketCap listing is a monumental milestone for any cryptocurrency. Recognized as the go-to platform for tracking and analyzing crypto projects, CMC lends instant credibility to listed tokens while opening them up to a massive market of investors worldwide. For Ruvi AI, this milestone couldn’t have come at a better time. The listing dramatically increased visibility, resulting in unprecedented presale momentum. Numbers That Speak Volumes Over 220 million tokens sold in Phase 2 alone. More than $2.8 million raised , showing enormous investor enthusiasm. A dedicated community of 2,700+ investors , with numbers growing daily. The CoinMarketCap listing has placed Ruvi AI firmly on the radar, driving its presale into record-breaking territory. With visibility at an all-time high, demand is showing no signs of slowing. Revolutionizing Content Creation With AI Unlike many tokens that rely purely on market speculation, Ruvi AI’s value proposition is rooted in real-world utility. At the heart of its ecosystem is a groundbreaking AI-powered super app designed specifically for content creators, marketers, and digital agencies.

Unified Workflow System Unlike juggling multiple disconnected tools, the super app provides a single, integrated platform that simplifies every stage of production from start to finish. These features address the inefficiencies faced by creators today while making the RUVI token integral to a rapidly growing global economy. Strategic Partnership With WEEX Exchange Ruvi AI is preparing for global scalability, partnering with the renowned exchange WEEX to ensure smooth trading and accessibility for RUVI token holders around the world. Benefits of the WEEX Collaboration Worldwide Reach: WEEX gives investors worldwide easy access to buy, sell, and trade RUVI tokens. Beginner-Friendly Platform: The intuitive design caters to new crypto enthusiasts while supporting advanced tools for experienced traders. High Liquidity: Transactions remain quick and uninterrupted, even as token demand soars. This partnership guarantees RUVI token visibility and paves the way for seamless transactions as more investors join the platform. Act Before the Price Hike Right now, Ruvi AI tokens are priced at $0.015 during Phase 2. However, with more than 80% of this phase already sold out, Phase 3 is fast approaching, and when it does, the token price will increase by a hefty 33% to $0.020. Investors who move now can lock in not just the lowest price but also gain access to exclusive VIP bonuses , boosting their token holdings. VIP Bonus Structure at a Glance VIP 2 ($750 Investment): Tokens = 50,000 Bonus = 20,000 additional tokens (40%) Total Tokens = 70,000 VIP 3 ($1,500 Investment): Tokens = 100,000 Bonus = 60,000 additional tokens (60%) Total Tokens = 160,000 VIP 5 ($7,500 Investment): Tokens = 500,000 Bonus = 500,000 additional tokens (100%) Total Tokens = 1,000,000 These bonus tiers make early participation even more rewarding, creating a unique opportunity to maximize returns.

These transparency measures give investors peace of mind as they join one of the crypto market’s fastest-growing communities. Could Ruvi AI Match Tron’s (TRX) Growth Story? Tron (TRX) rose to prominence by addressing inefficiencies in digital transactions while building a global fanbase. Similarly, Ruvi AI combines real-world utility, strong partnerships, and an emphasis on scalability , creating a perfect storm for incredible growth. Analysts believe Ruvi AI could easily surpass Tron’s early performance, potentially delivering six-figure returns for early backers. Wrap-Up Ruvi AI is rewriting the playbook for success in the cryptocurrency space. Its CoinMarketCap listing , record-breaking presale, and revolutionary AI-powered super app make it a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for forward-thinking investors.

Prices drop, sentiment turns negative, and many investors retreat. But for those with long-term vision, this is often where the biggest opportunities begin. Buying in a bear market means getting assets at a discount – something seasoned investors call a “building phase” rather than a downturn. Some early movers are already looking toward strategic plays, including MAGACOIN FINANCE, a fast-growing altcoin that’s seeing record presale activity. As attention shifts away from hype and toward fundamentals, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are positioning themselves for the next breakout. Bitcoin Bitcoin remains the most trusted name in crypto, and for good reason. It’s limited to 21 million coins, making it a hedge against inflation and currency debasement. Despite market dips, BTC has consistently bounced back, often leading each new bull cycle. It’s the coin institutional investors tend to turn to first when risk appetite returns. Ethereum Ethereum has built an entire ecosystem that continues to evolve. With thousands of apps running on its blockchain and its recent upgrades reducing energy consumption and boosting scalability, ETH remains one of the strongest assets to hold during downturns. It’s a bet on innovation, not just speculation. MAGACOIN FINANCE While the top cryptos remain solid options, some investors are betting on bigger returns with emerging assets. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now targeting a massive 74x rally, drawing strong attention as early-stage demand hits new highs . With each round selling out faster than the last, it’s attracting comparisons to early-stage breakouts like DOGE and SHIBA – but with a utility-focused roadmap that aims to reward long-term holders. This could be the best altcoin for those seeking early-mover gains before broader adoption. Solana (SOL) Solana stands out for its fast transactions and low fees—features that matter more than ever in a market that demands efficiency. With developers flocking to its ecosystem and institutional interest growing, SOL has the momentum to push forward even when market conditions get tough. XRP XRP continues to be a favorite among those betting on traditional finance merging with blockchain. With its focus on real-world utility and ongoing developments in global payment systems, XRP is still considered a strong hold, especially with legal clarity expected to further unlock its price potential. Final Thoughts Bear markets are uncomfortable—but they’re also where wealth is built. Investors who stay focused on quality assets and adopt smart strategies like dollar-cost averaging, diversification, and staking can ride out the downturn and come out stronger. Bitcoin and Ethereum remain core holdings, but emerging stars like MAGACOIN FINANCE could offer the kind of explosive upside that turns down markets into unimaginable opportunities.

But while XRP aims for $4, all eyes are quietly pivoting toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi player rising with its ambitious roadmap and disruptive lending protocol. Mutuum Finance is in Phase 6 and is presently valued at $0.035. The next price increase will bring Mutuum Finance to $0.04 in phase 7. Investors in this stage of investment will earn a return on investment of 250-350% once the token goes live. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has crossed more than $14.1 million raised and welcomed more than 14,900 distinct holders. As analysts track XRP’s next move, Mutuum Finance’s bold 50x growth target is stealing the spotlight. XRP Breakout Setup: Testing $3.00 Support with $4–$5 in Sight XRP is currently trading around $2.88, after recently bouncing off critical support at $2.80 and reclaiming the $3.00 zone amid renewed investor interest. Technical patterns are emerging, including a bullish falling wedge, which analysts suggest could propel XRP toward $3.65–$4.00, with longer-term targets extending to $5.50 should momentum sustain. Meanwhile, veteran trader Peter Brandt forecasts a possible 60% rally targeting $4.47, and broader sentiment, including ETF speculation and whale accumulation, is fueling a consensus that upside toward $4 to $7+ is within reach this cycle. Amid this setup, capital and attention are gradually shifting toward emerging utility‑focused DeFi tokens such as Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Unveils Phase 6 of Its Presale Mutuum Finance has concluded Phase 5 of its presale and advanced into Phase 6, where its tokens can be bought at $0.035. Its next price increase will be another 14.29% to drive the price of its tokens up to $0.04. Early adopters shall be rewarded with a huge ROI when the token reaches $0.06 upon listing. MUTM presale has already raised over $14.1 million and accumulated over 14,900 individual holders. Mutuum Finance Joins Hands with CertiK to Unveil $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance is in collaboration with CertiK to bring onboard a Bug Bounty Program. The program’s reward fund stands at $50,000 USDT. Four categories i.e. low, minor, major and critical will be rewarded under the program. The program shows the vision of Mutuum Finance to establish community-driven, secure and sustainable ecosystem. The project has also been rigorously audited by Certik on user fund security and security of the blockchain. This is a milestone on Mutuum Finance’s vision for an open institution-grade DeFi protocol. Mutuum Finance Launches MUTM Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is giving away a $100,000 giveaway where the users will be rewarded in $10,000 MUTM tokens. Its recently launched leaderboard system will also reward the top 50 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) holders. As Ripple (XRP) eyes a potential surge toward $4 and beyond, savvy investors are also zeroing in on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi gem priced at just $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale. With over $14.1 million raised and 14,900+ investors already on board, MUTM offers early buyers a projected 250-350% ROI at launch and a bold upside potential driven by real-world lending utility, institutional-grade security, and a fully audited infrastructure. While XRP captures short-term momentum, Mutuum Finance is building long-term value. Secure your MUTM tokens now before the price jumps in Phase 7, position yourself for exponential growth before the market catches up.

This is the first time in eight months that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has come this far. However, the price rally coincides with increasing Ethereum traction amongst institutional clients. Ethereum Price Performance Nears Dec. 16 Level On Friday, the broader crypto market saw the price of ETH climb to $4,000 for the first time in eight months. For perspective, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap traded above $4,000 on December 16 and hit a peak of $4,107. Fast forward to the present day, it has gone as far as hitting $4,013.67 on American crypto exchange Coinbase. At press time, the leading altcoin has seen some slight correction, losing only a fraction of its recent gain. Per CoinMarketCap, ETH price is currently at $3,967.27, corresponding with a 3.61% increase within the last 24 hours. This digital asset has also gone 10.23% higher over the last 7 days. It made a more outstanding performance in the last 30 days, with more than a 48% rally in price gains. Other Key Metrics Signal a Bullish Breakout The market cap of the coin has reached $478.15 billion, further repositioning the coin in the second position. Moreso, it is clear that it is gradually nearing the key $500 billion market capitalization. In terms of its 24-hour trading volume, Ethereum has a 27.21% surge and is now at $42.53 billion. On August 5, 2025, the Ethereum blockchain handled 1.74 million daily transactions , based on a 7-day average. At this level, it beat its old record of 1.65 million from May 2021. From all indications, ETH may have successfully come out of a gloomy season. It equally suggests that more people are using the Ethereum network. SharpLink Gaming and Others Accumulate Ethereum There has been a plethora of companies expanding their corporate treasuries to include Ethereum. SharpLink Gaming, which is backed by Consensys co-founder Joseph Lubin, increased its Ethereum holdings by nearly 80,000 ETH. Altogether, this addition brings the company’s total Ethereum holdings to 360,807 ETH, marking a 29% increase from the past week. Ether Machine is also building its Ethereum reserves at a fast rate. In the long run, this platform plans to contest SharpLink Gaming’s Ethereum position.

49764110,551475,1754683219,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49764110.jpeg,"Analyst Shares Where Bitcoin, Ethereum, And XRP Prices Will Be By 2032",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-ethereum-and-xrp-prices/,"A bold prediction for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP prices by March 2032 has surfaced on social media, which places into perspective the future of the cryptocurrency market. The forecast, which was shared by crypto commentator Fapital on the social media platform X, reveals a vision of where these leading assets could stand seven years from now. Notably, the figures he posted put Bitcoin trading at $889,969.42, Ethereum at $28,050.73, and XRP at $23.22 within the next seven years. Comparing The 2032 Predictions To Current Price Price predictions are a common feature of the crypto industry, with analysts offering their takes based on technical and fundamental analysis to project how leading assets might grow in the coming years. However, Fapital’s prediction is not based on technical analysis but rather visions of where leading cryptocurrencies could be trading in 2032, based on the current pace of price increases. As shown in the image below of top crypto assets, the prediction puts Bitcoin trading at $889,969.42, Ethereum at $28,050.73, and XRP at $23.22. Bitcoin, currently trading at $116,650, would need to climb by about 662% over the next seven years to hit $889,969.42. Ethereum, which is currently at $3,900 and pushing toward $4,000 again, would have to rise roughly 619% to meet the $28,050.73 projection. XRP, now at $3.34, would require a jump of nearly 595% to match $23.22. The projection also puts BNB trading at $5,887.46, Solana trading at $1,281.96, Tron trading at $2.607, and Dogecoin trading at $1.552. At the time of writing, Solana is trading at $174, which means it would need an increase of around 637% to reach $1,281.96. Dogecoin, at $0.2219, would have to soar more than 599% to get to $1.552. Finally, Tron, which is trading at $0.3381, would have to leap by more than 671% to match the $2.607 target. A Look Back Over Seven Years Interestingly, 2032 could line up with another bullish cycle that’s entirely different from the current one, and it is highly likely that a bearish phase will have occurred between now and then. These 2032 predictions might be huge, but their magnitude might become clearer when viewed in the context of where these cryptocurrencies were trading seven years ago. Back in August 2018, Bitcoin was trading around $7,600 after its 2017 rally, which means its price has increased by about 1,430% between then and now. Ethereum was trading around $400, and this figure translates to an increase of about 870% based on the current price action. XRP, on the other hand, had briefly crossed $3 before retracing in 2018. Solana was not yet launched in 2018, Dogecoin was trading around $0.002, and Tron was trading under $0.05. Fast forward seven years, and the market has transformed more than many would’ve expected in 2018. The crypto market has been steadily witnessing inflows f rom new investors in the past two or so years. If this growth continues on a long-term upward path, then the next seven years could easily produce similar or even greater returns.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|BNB|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Fapital|solana|tron|XRP,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|XRP|MARKET|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-08 20:00:19

Market expert CrediBULL Crypto has outlined how these costs influence XRP’s value compared to Bitcoin, concluding that both cryptocurrencies follow the same pricing formula. XRP Price Formula Mirrors That Of Bitcoin A recent discourse on X social media has reignited discussions on whether production costs play a decisive role in determining the prices of cryptocurrencies. CrediBULL Crypto weighed in, explaining that both Bitcoin and XRP follow the same fundamental pricing model, where the cost to produce, combined with speculative and utility value, determines the market price. Related Reading: XRP Price Crash Could Deepen As Bearish Formations Gather For Bitcoin, the analyst notes that the cost to mine, taking into account energy consumption and time, represents a significant portion of BTC’s market price. This production cost forms the “X” variable in the analyst’s pricing equation, with the remainder driven by speculative demand and utility. In contrast, CrediBULL Crypto highlights that XRP’s production cost is negligible, arguably near zero, meaning its market price is primarily driven by demand, adoption, and other speculative factors. Whether mined or premined, the analyst asserts that the market ultimately assigns a value above the production cost based on perceived utility and shifts in investor sentiment. CrediBULL Crypto’s statement comes in response to a recent clash between market expert BD and Robert Breedlove, a Bitcoin maximalist. In his post, Breedlove suggested that XRP’s “100% premined” status set it apart from Bitcoin, which he asserts is a 0% premined coin. The Bitcoin maximalist also warned investors of the potential consequences of this difference, subtly implying that XRP could be a scam token. BD countered, asserting that market demand, not production method, dictates price. He further emphasized that neither mining costs nor premined supply inherently determines a cryptocurrency’s long-term value. Demand Dictates Long-Term Survival Following CrediBULL Crypto’s statement, a community member argued that premined assets, like XRP, could carry higher risks, such as large-scale sell-offs or “rug pulls,” potentially driving their value to zero. They further suggested that BTC’s mined supply structure offers more protection against such scenarios. CrediBULL Crypto, however, pushed back, stating that production costs do not guarantee long-term survival or resilience. He noted that demand can disappear for any asset, regardless of whether it costs $5 or $100 to produce. He added that the same principle also applies to Bitcoin and XRP, which are respectively priced at $116,601 and $3.34, at the time of writing. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Historical 90% XRP Crash Against Bitcoin, But This Will Happen First The analyst further pointed out that just because a commodity costs money to produce does not make it inherently valuable. Without sustained interest, even a high-cost-to-produce asset could collapse in value. To illustrate this point, the analyst compared it to investing substantial resources into digging a massive hole—a process requiring real effort but might hold no value if no one finds the hole useful.

Security Expert Warns of Exit Scam Tactics from CrediX Finance The hack unfolded dramatically when attackers gained administrative control of the project’s multisig wallet on August 4, exploiting bridge privileges to mint unbacked collateral tokens. On August 5, in what is now a deleted X post , CrediX Finance reassured the community that it had successfully negotiated with the exploiter to return the stolen funds within two days in exchange for payment from the protocol’s treasury. CrediX immediately took its website offline to prevent additional user deposits while instructing existing users to withdraw funds directly through smart contracts. The company also pledged to reimburse users for lost funds through an airdrop distribution. Speaking with Cryptonews, Circuit CEO Harry Donnelly criticized negotiation-based recovery methods, noting they are frequently employed as exit scam strategies. He emphasized that “automated threat response should be standard to ensure assets are kept out of harm’s way, rather than hoping to bargain with bad actors.” More than two days have elapsed since the promise, and the company has maintained radio silence, deleting all official accounts and leaving users without recourse or communication.

The organization advised users to avoid interacting with any CrediX smart contracts and announced plans for a compensation and recovery strategy for Metavault users by mid-next week. Community Reactions and Collateral Damage An on-chain analyst and co-founder of Sonic MementorBot express ed sympathy for CrediX victims while criticizing their trust in unrealistically high APR promises from lending vaults. “Metavaults are always risky. Exploiter sent funds to Tornado instead of returning,” the analyst observed. The multi-chain yield-bearing protocol Trevee also joined to reveal that the CrediX hack indirectly impacted its operations through a $1.6 million scUSD loan to Stability’s metaUSD, which became fully exposed to CrediX following a bank run. Similar to other users attracted by high APY and favorable borrowing rates, Trevee believed metaUSD was secure due to its associated 87% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. https://t.co/SWI64Bg0gL — Trevee (Prev. Rings Protocol) (@Trevee_xyz) August 8, 2025 The team reported reducing its exposure to over $700,000 but expressed frustration that “the Credix team has since deleted their accounts, abandoning the project and denying all responsibility.” Trevee promised to develop fund recovery plans addressing the shortfall and committed to updating affected users promptly. CrediX operated as a lending protocol employing an innovative credit scoring model designed for emerging markets, specializing in projects utilizing stablecoin payment platforms.

According to Schwartz, this misconception is not only false but also fundamentally misunderstands how the XRP Ledger operates. “By far the biggest misconception is that Ripple somehow controls the ledger,” he said. “It’s a public blockchain. Every node enforces every rule. The consensus model doesn’t control the blockchain—it’s got censorship resistance as a built-in network feature.” Schwartz explained that Ripple operates only around 1% of the network, a tiny fraction of the more than 35 validators that currently maintain the decentralized system. He emphasized that most of the validators are independent of Ripple, and the network’s rules are objective, not subject to the whims of any single entity. David Schwartz sets the record straight once and for all! Ripple does NOT control the $XRP Ledger It’s a public, decentralized blockchain Ripple runs ~1% of the network No secret backdoor No censorship possible Biggest misconception is Ripple controls XRP FALSE! pic.twitter.com/lzO2anFPYg — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) August 7, 2025 A Public Ledger, Not a Private System Schwartz made it clear that the XRP Ledger has run since 2012 as a fully decentralized blockchain, governed by a global, distributed network of validators. Unlike private or permissioned chains, no one, including Ripple, can unilaterally block or censor transactions. He added that while Ripple is an active contributor to the ecosystem, supporting infrastructure upgrades, developer grants, and community programs, it has no control over the ledger itself. “We would love for everybody to trust us completely,” Schwartz said, “but people having to trust us is all downside.” He further noted that the company has no interest in gaining control over the network. Doing so would only create external pressures and potential vulnerabilities. “We wouldn’t want to be able to censor transactions because then people could pressure us to do so,” he said. “That’s not the kind of role we want.” Schwartz also emphasized the transparency inherent in blockchain networks like XRP’s. “If a transaction were ever censored, everyone would know,” he said. “There’s no incentive for secrecy. The system is designed to be fair, open, and trustless.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Solid Support Amid Growing Confidence At the time of report time, XRP is trading at approximately $3.21, with a 24-hour range between $3.03 and $3.37. The token has shown resilience despite recent market fluctuations and has been buoyed by increasing regulatory clarity following the conclusion of Ripple’s long-running case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. XRP could climb to $5 by year-end, driven by fundamental improvements, developer ecosystem growth, and increasing investor confidence. Forecasts suggest the path forward for XRP remains strong, especially with lingering doubts about centralization now addressed head-on by Ripple’s top executive. A Decentralized Ledger with Renewed Clarity David Schwartz’s remarks, amplified by Xaif’s post, reinforce a vital truth for the crypto community: Ripple does not control XRP. The XRP Ledger is—and always has been—public, decentralized, and censorship-resistant. With this myth laid to rest and market momentum accelerating, XRP stands on firmer ground than ever.
