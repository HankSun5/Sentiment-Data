As of August 2025, the SEC confirms that liquid staking and staking receipt tokens (SRTs) are not classified as securities under federal law — as long as specific conditions are met. The implications are enormous. For top protocols like Ethereum and Solana — and emerging players like MAGACOIN FINANCE — this new clarity could unlock a fresh wave of participation, innovation, and capital. Staking is no longer a gray zone; it’s now a green light — for protocols that follow the rules. Ethereum: Regulatory Clarity Fuels Institutional Inflows Ethereum stands as the largest staking ecosystem by volume — and the SEC’s guidance couldn’t have come at a better time. With ETH 2.0 fully operational and over 30 million ETH staked , the decision not to treat liquid staking as a security eliminates a critical overhang. The ETH community has long pushed for clarity around liquid staking providers like Lido and Rocket Pool, and now with this clarification, institutions that were once hesitant can move in with confidence. Analysts believe this could trigger a 15–20% increase in ETH staking participation within the next 90 days. More importantly, this removes friction for ETH ETFs to integrate staking yields — a feature that could dramatically enhance product competitiveness and returns in regulated markets. Solana: Fast and Nimble, Ready to Scale Solana’s staking model has always emphasized speed and simplicity. With validator participation on the rise and mobile access through the Solana Saga ecosystem, the protocol is now better positioned to scale user-facing staking tools — especially under compliant frameworks. With the SEC confirming that purely administrative staking models are exempt, Solana-based dApps can now confidently integrate SRT functionality into their DeFi layers without triggering securities concerns. Projects focused on gaming, yield optimization, or RWA tokenization may now find staking easier to integrate — and easier to market. Solana also benefits from low transaction costs, making staking and redemption of SRTs fast and affordable — a major advantage over Ethereum’s fee-heavy ecosystem. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Regulatory Tailwinds Meet Early Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE is fully audited, supported by a strong and growing community of investors. Still in its early phase but rapidly gaining traction, MAGACOIN FINANCE is among the few presale tokens to have fully embraced staking from the start. The project is showing serious conviction from early adopters. More importantly, MAGACOIN’s architecture aligns perfectly with the SEC’s clarified criteria — it performs purely administrative tasks, distributes yield from the protocol itself, and avoids discretionary management. Analysts now suggest that this regulatory alignment, combined with upcoming exchange listings and meme-fueled virality, could drive 35x–50x ROI potential through Q4. Final Take: The Path Is Clearer, and the Race Is On The SEC’s guidance on staking is more than just legal clarity — it’s a catalyst. Ethereum can expand institutional use. Solana can scale integration. And MAGACOIN FINANCE , with its early compliance-ready design, is emerging as the undervalued gem investors didn’t see coming.

Last month, XRP reached a yearly high of $3.66 but later declined to $2.70, failing to maintain momentum. Currently, the asset is attempting to recover and re-establish support above $3 . In this context, EGRAG’s historical trend analysis offers valuable insights into potential long-term trends. The Chasm Line – A Recurring Barrier Since 2014 According to EGRAG , the Chasm line is an upward-sloping resistance trendline on XRP’s monthly chart that has historically restricted its price growth. The line has served as a critical point of resistance in multiple market cycles, with XRP reacting strongly each time it approached this level. #XRP – The Chasm: Touching it , $11 and Surpassing it $37: This is the ‘The Chasm Chart’ https://t.co/40pb8cxpQq pic.twitter.com/vpd66zzAea — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) July 19, 2025 During the 2017–2018 cycle (referred to as Cycle 1), XRP reached a local peak of $0.3988 by May 2017, which coincided with the Chasm line. This resulted in a sharp correction followed by a six-month consolidation period. Eventually, XRP regained momentum, broke above the Chasm line, and surged by approximately 2,000%, reaching an all-time high of $3.31 in January 2018. In the subsequent 2020–2021 cycle (Cycle 2), XRP again approached the Chasm trendline, peaking at $1.96 in April 2021. Although this represented a 420% increase from earlier lows, XRP attempted to breach the resistance line but was unsuccessful, leading to a decline shortly after. Current Cycle and Price Projections Now, in what EGRAG refers to as Cycle 3, XRP is positioned for another potential retest of the Chasm line. The analyst outlines two possible scenarios based on historical price behavior. In a conservative outcome, XRP could repeat the 2021 pattern by only reaching the Chasm line without breaching it. This would represent a 420% gain from its recent price levels, resulting in a projected peak of $11. In a more aggressive scenario, XRP could mirror its 2017 breakout by not only reaching but surpassing the Chasm line. If it were to follow a similar 2,000% price rally, EGRAG estimates a potential price of approximately $37 per token. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additional Bullish Perspectives from Chart Nerd Supporting the broader bullish outlook, another market analyst known as Chart Nerd recently suggested that XRP has broken out of a bull flag pattern. In his analysis, XRP is currently targeting $15, with interim price levels to monitor. He places the immediate breakout support around $2.60, indicating that sustained support above this level could lead to a continued move toward $8 and eventually $15 if momentum persists. While XRP continues to consolidate around the $3 range, technical analysts remain focused on long-term resistance levels and historical trends. EGRAG’s Chasm line framework provides a data-driven lens to project possible future price points, ranging from $11 in a limited rally to $37 in an extended breakout. Combined with complementary bullish signals, XRP’s next major moves could be shaped by how it interacts with this historical resistance level.

The dismissal marks the resolution of a lawsuit which was initiated in December 2020 when the SEC accused Ripple that its sales of XRP tokens constituted an unregistered securities offering. Ripple and the SEC move to end litigation According to court documents submitted to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the parties “reached an agreement-in-principle, subject to Commission approval, to resolve the underlying case.” The case had been on appeal after a final order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (No. 20-cv-10832), which gave Ripple a partial win in 2023 by stating that XRP was not a security in secondary market sales. The joint dismissal had signatures from attorneys representing Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, Christian A. Larsen, and the SEC, confirming that Ripple and its executives authorized the agency to file the stipulation with their signatures included. It is a fitting end to a tumultuous lawsuit that has lasted five years and had huge implications on the industry. Now that the appeals have been withdrawn, Ripple is cleared of any further federal litigation linked to XRP’s regulatory status. The decision is expected to influence how other tokens are treated under U.S. securities law, especially as lawmakers continue to hash out crypto regulation frameworks. What’s next for XRP following the dismissal? The conclusion of Ripple’s case with the SEC is bullish news. Following the resolution announcement, the XRP token surged in value, crossing the $3 mark, proof of growing investor optimism. XRP price rallied after news of SEC settlement. Source: Coinmarketcap According to data from Glassnode, over 80% of XRP’s supply is in wallets that have not been touched for over a year, evidence of strong holding conviction. Long-term holders are already in profit, and short-term holders have been cautiously loading up in anticipation of XRP ripping higher. Another possible catalyst for XRP’s great price action movement is the use case that it has in Japan where Aplus, a credit card firm owned by Shinsei Bank, has partnered with SBI VC Trade to allow customers to convert their reward points into XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. The token price is currently hovering around $3.27, but going by the bullish sentiments on X since the end of the SEC’s case against Ripple, XRP may be touching new heights soon.

Prices have been moving upward since 2022, now standing 100% higher than three years ago. Analysts point to worsening government deficit spending, ongoing inflation, and a weakening labor market as the backdrop for the rally. US stock futures were slightly higher Thursday night after the Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded its second loss in three trading days. Contracts tied to the Dow rose 82 points, or 0.2%, while futures for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 also increased 0.2% each.

Tariffs trigger market adjustments President Donald Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs went into effect at midnight Thursday. The highest duties included 41% on Syria and 40% on Laos and Myanmar. Earlier in the day, stocks got a boost after Trump confirmed his 100% tariff on imported semiconductor chips would exempt companies “building in the United States.” The US dollar strengthened after Bloomberg reported that Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller is a leading contender to be nominated as Fed chair by Trump’s administration. Waller has met with members of Trump’s team but not the president. Meanwhile. Trump announced his nomination of Stephen Miran, current chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, to replace Adriana Kugler on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Miran will serve until January, completing the remainder of Kugler’s term after her resignation last week. The dollar index rose 0.18% to 98.36, while the greenback gained 0.1% to 147.49 yen.

This milestone, shared by blockchain analytics platform Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock), underscores just how central stablecoins have become to global crypto flows in 2025. Dominated by Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), this explosive surge in activity paints a picture of growing reliance on stable digital assets not only by retail investors but also by institutions seeking seamless liquidity, cross-border settlement, and DeFi utility. Analysts say this momentum is fueling what many are calling “Stablecoin Summer” – a wave of capital inflows and integration deals that’s reshaping how value moves across chains. For new investors scanning the market for smart entry points, these dynamics are reinforcing the need to find opportunities before they become saturated. That’s exactly why interest is surging toward early-stage crypto launches offering strategic incentives – such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, currently in presale with a 50% bonus code active for a limited time. USDT and USDC cement market dominance According to Sentora’s August 5 report, USDT remains the undisputed king, processing over $1.6 trillion in cumulative monthly volume. USDC holds firm in second place, with its usage rising steadily across Ethereum, Solana, and newer blockchains like Base and Blast. Smaller stablecoins are also getting traction. DAI, FDUSD, and PYUSD posted sizable growth, hinting at increased experimentation and utility diversification among users. Even niche assets like GUSD, FRAX, and TUSD recorded measurable volumes, further illustrating the space’s fragmentation and evolution. Regulation fuels confidence One of the most significant tailwinds behind this growth is regulatory clarity. The GENIUS Act, signed into US law on July 19, lays out clear federal guidelines for stablecoins and digital asset-backed financial products. The legislation includes reserve mandates and oversight mechanisms from the Federal Reserve – factors that are making stablecoins more palatable for traditional finance players. Combined with Europe’s MiCA framework, the clarity is opening the door for deeper institutional involvement in on-chain transactions, from tokenized bonds to real-time remittances. In effect, stablecoins are no longer fringe – they’re becoming financial infrastructure. For early investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a strategic edge As capital flows increasingly favor stable platforms and secure token infrastructures, one presale is catching serious attention: MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project is offering new investors an exclusive 50% bonus with the code EXTRA50X, a move analysts say reflects growing urgency as supply tightens ahead of listing. The project has already drawn comparisons to early-stage SHIBA INU and DOGECOIN, not just for its viral potential but also for its commitment to secure infrastructure and strong community growth. Early participants aren’t just betting on hype – they’re positioning ahead of what could be a parabolic launch into major exchanges. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out isn’t just its community engagement. It’s the timing. The presale window is closing fast, and the bonus code gives newcomers a rare chance to maximize their allocation before broader market access and exchange-driven volatility set in. For those who missed out on early-stage Avalanche or ADA, this could be a second chance. Stablecoin utility is expanding fast Outside of trading volume alone, stablecoins are increasingly the glue holding DeFi and cross-chain apps together. From yield farming to NFT marketplaces, from on-chain payroll to Layer-1 bridge liquidity, the use cases keep growing. Institutions, fintech startups, and payment providers are all integrating stablecoin rails to reduce costs and increase speed. And as users become more comfortable with using digital dollars, the barrier to entry for altcoins with smart distribution models like MAGACOIN FINANCE also drops. Conclusion Stablecoins are no longer just a place to park capital—they’re powering a financial revolution. And with $1.5 trillion in monthly activity, that revolution is moving fast. But while the top stablecoins cement their place, the real alpha lies in emerging assets. MAGACOIN FINANCE is grabbing headlines not just for its infrastructure, but for the rare opportunity it offers: early access and bonus rewards. As legacy assets mature, many investors are shifting toward undervalued, secure, and community-backed presales – and MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading that pack.

49717923,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/solana-or-xrp-which-crypto-is-best-to-buy-this-month/,1754611140,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49717923.jpeg,Solana or XRP? Which Crypto Is Best to Buy This Month?,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/solana-or-xrp-which-crypto-is-best-to-buy-this-month/,"Crypto investors are watching closely as two major players regain focus. Solana (SOL) stands out for its ultra-fast transactions, affordability, and thriving DeFi and NFT ecosystem. Meanwhile, XRP remains a go-to for institutional-grade cross-border payments, backed by real-world partnerships and growing adoption, despite past regulatory overhang . Yet, amid the buzz around these established tokens, a fresh opportunity is gaining serious analyst support. MAGACOIN FINANCE, fully audited and backed by an expanding investor community, is emerging as a top altcoin to buy now . Solana (SOL) – Performance Meets Innovation Solana’s network can handle thousands of transactions per second at a fraction of the cost, making it a favorite among developers and DeFi users alike. Forbes reports that SOL has delivered massive returns since launch, and the platform continues to attract both retail and institutional app builders. It’s fast, scalable, and has cemented its place in the smart contract arms race. Still, the question remains whether most of Solana’s gains have already occurred. Without new catalysts—such as blockbuster app launches or protocol upgrades, the token may face consolidation as speculative interest cools. XRP – Utility and Institution-Friendly Momentum XRP’s appeal lies in its utility: it’s built for fast, low-cost settlements between financial institutions. Many analysts see this as a real advantage over speculative tokens. According to Forbes, XRP has gained substantial value over the years, solidifying its spot among the top cryptos for long-term investors. Its infrastructure and partnerships give it credibility many altcoins lack. That said, XRP’s future depends heavily on adoption and continued regulatory clarity. Much of its upward trajectory hinges on renewed global usage, a pace often slower and steadier than the rapid flips seen in more speculative markets. MAGACOIN FINANCE Offers Audited Security and Community-Driven Momentum While Solana and XRP both hold appeal, analysts are increasingly turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE as a new gem . This project has earned its credibility through a fully audited codebase , a clear roadmap, and growing investor interest writing on forums and social channels. That foundational trust, combined with rounds selling out in minutes , makes it a rare example of early – stage entry with structural integrity. In trending markets, newer coins that build trust and community often outperform older, acknowledged assets. Analysts predict MAGACOIN FINANCE could return exponentially more compared to tokens like SOL or XRP in a fast-moving bull run. With exchange listings approaching, the project’s timing and promise make it a favored option for traders seeking momentum without sacrificing credibility. Why Early-Stage Still Beats Big-Cap Momentum While Solana and XRP offer stability and proven narratives, their price actions are increasingly tied to macro headwinds or sector-wide events. In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still largely uncorrelated – offering a rare chance at fresh entry before broader crypto investors arrive. Its combination of security, community, and presale scarcity gives it a workflow similar to early Avalanche or Polygon – both of which surged dramatically once awareness hit. Now, analysts see a comparable setup unfolding in the early stages of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion If you want a reliable bunker for crypto exposure, SOL and XRP both make compelling cases: one for innovation, the other for utility. But if you’re tracking the next breakout – the altcoin that could rally sharply after exchange listings – MAGACOIN FINANCE is earning attention as a smarter speculative entry. With its transparent credentials and growing base, it’s one of the most talked-about picks right now among traders who believe the next major rally starts before the crowd catches on .

New SEC filings show Buffett’s short-term Treasury bill holdings declined by $42.867 billion at the close of the second quarter of the year when compared to December 2024, with total holdings of T-bills now at $243.605 billion. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway purchased 5,030,425 more shares of Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI) last month at around $21 per share, bringing its total holdings of SIRI to 124,807,117 shares. SIRI is trading for $20.97 per share at the close of the market on Wednesday. Also last month, Berkshire Hathaway dumped nearly $1.23 billion worth of shares in the domain name giant Verisign. Verisign announced the Omaha-based investment giant would sell 4,300,000 shares of the company’s common stock to the public for $285 per share. The sell-off materialized after Buffett’s firm acquired multiple new stocks in the first quarter of 2025. Filings with the SEC earlier this year showed Berkshire added 865,311 shares of the swimming pool supply giant POOLCORP (POOL) for nearly $262 million in Q1. The firm purchased an additional 6,384,676 shares of the alcohol producer Constellation Brands (STZ) for nearly $961 million and it acquired 238,613 new shares of Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) worth approximately $204 million. Berkshire also bought 112,401 new shares of Heico Corporation (HEI), an aerospace and electronics firm, worth nearly $50 million in Q1.

49717477,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=800645,1754611206,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/49717477.jpeg,Bitcoin Faces A Black Swan — Bitwise Sounds The Alarm,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-faces-a-black-swan-bitwise/,"Last Friday’s US July Employment Situation release has delivered the kind of statistical jolt that rarely shows up outside crises, forcing traders to re-evaluate both the macro outlook and Bitcoin’s near-term path. Payrolls grew by just 73,000, but the shock lay in the record-large negative revisions: May and June were marked down by a combined 258,000 jobs, slicing the three-month hiring average to 35,000 and erasing nearly all of the second-quarter’s reported momentum. The Bureau of Labor Statistics notes that revisions of that magnitude have been seen only during the Covid collapse. Is Bitcoin Really Facing A Black Swan Event? Bloomberg Economics chief US economist Anna Wong wrote: “The downward revisions to May and June payrolls in the July jobs report constitute a black swan event – a three-standard-deviation move with less than a 0.2% chance of occurrence in the last 30 years. Adjusted for our estimate of the job overstatement from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ birth-death model, the three-month hiring pace turns outright negative.” The data, she wrote in a terminal note circulated Friday, “flipped the labor-market script” from re-acceleration to abrupt cooling. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could See Another Crash To Fill This Imbalance Before Rally To $120,000 The market’s crypto voice on the issue has been Bitwise Europe’s head of research, André Dragosch, who spent the morning posting a string of warnings on X. First came the news, ”According to Bloomberg chief economist Anna Wong, the most recent payroll revisions were a ‘black swan event’.Will probably get even worse before it gets better…”, then the maxim, “Yes – bad for payrolls = good for bitcoin, at least over the medium to long term.” Minutes later he argued that deeper revisions could force emergency easing: “NOTE: There is a strong case for a negative June jobs print after further downside revisions which could lead to a 50 bps rate cut in September… Plan accordingly. #Bitcoin” By mid-afternoon he pushed the point to its logical extreme: “ATTENTION: We are probably just a single negative NFP print away from a significant repricing in Fed rate cut expectations. US labor market & inflation data surprises are still as bad as during Covid but traders only price in 2 cuts until Dec 2025… Printer is coming… ” Interest-rate futures moved sharply in Dragosch’s direction. On Wednesdays, the CME FedWatch Tool showed a 91 percent probability of at least one cut at the 17–18 September FOMC meeting. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari acknowledged that “the real underlying economy is slowing,” while Governor Lisa Cook called the size of the revisions “concerning.” Related Reading: US Delay On Bitcoin Audit Is A Bullish Red Flag, Says Strike CEO Bitcoin’s price action captured the tug-of-war between recession fear and liquidity hope. The flagship cryptocurrency slumped to $111,920 on 2 August, its lowest print since early July, immediately after the payroll release and President Donald Trump’s subsequent firing of BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. A tentative rebound toward $111,500 followed as rate-cut odds ballooned this week. Yet, Bitcoin remained tethered to macro headlines rather than its own cycle. Still, the first clear sign of positioning for easier policy has emerged in fund flows. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net $91.6 million inflow on 7 August, snapping a four-day outflow streak that had drained more than $380 million from the vehicles. Whether Bloomberg’s and Dragosch’s black-swan framing proves prescient will depend on the next few data prints and the Fed’s tolerance for risk. For now the market is caught between those poles: one bad jobs number away from a full-blown policy response, but one more shock away from a broader risk-off spiral. The only certainty, as Wong’s probability math and Dragosch’s full-throated alerts both imply, is that the margin for error has evaporated. At press time, BTC traded at $116,359.

49717482,550290,1754611219,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49717482.jpeg,"Bitcoin Price Down, But Hashrate Sets New All-Time High",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-down-but-hashrate-new-all-time-high/,"Bitcoin miners have taken the 7-day average Hashrate to a new all-time high (ATH), despite the fact that the token’s price has been down recently. Bitcoin Hashrate Has Just Set A New Record The Bitcoin “ Hashrate ” refers to the collective amount of computing power that the miners as a whole have connected to the blockchain. Miners use their computing resources to compete against each other, so this power never actually works as a collective, but the Hashrate is nonetheless a useful metric as it provides insight into the sentiment among the chain validators. When the value of the metric rises, it means new miners are joining the network and/or existing ones are expanding their facilities. Such a trend implies BTC mining is looking lucrative to this group. On the other hand, the indicator observing a decline suggests some of the miners have decided to disconnect their machines from the blockchain, a potential sign that profitability is going down. Now, here is a chart from Blockchain.com that shows how the 7-day average value of the Bitcoin Hashrate has changed during the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day average Bitcoin Hashrate fell to a low of 889 exahashes per second (EH/s) on August 3rd, but since then, the metric has seen a sharp jump that has taken its value to 952.5 EH/s. The low in the metric coincided with the price plunge to $112,000 for the asset. This trend wasn’t anything unusual, as miner revenue is correlated to the cryptocurrency’s value. Miners earn the major part of their income through the block subsidy , which is denominated in BTC. Moves up and down in the coin’s exchange rate, therefore, directly impact the USD value of their rewards. Interestingly, the rebound in the Hashrate to the new ATH has come despite the fact that Bitcoin has been unable to make a recovery from its earlier price plunge. Miners sometimes expand in anticipation of future action, so the new power that has just come into the network could be a sign that miners are hoping bullish winds will return for BTC. Only time will tell, though, whether this bet will work out. The latest jump in the 7-day average Bitcoin Hashrate has meant that its value has broken the previous record of 943.6 EH/s set back in June. A consequence of this ATH in miners’ computing power is that the Difficulty is also set to see an adjustment to a new high. The “Difficulty” is a feature on the BTC blockchain that controls how hard miners would find it to perform their duty. It exists to limit how fast miners can solve blocks and earn the block reward. Increases in Hashrate speed up the miners, so the network responds by upping its Difficulty just enough to bring them back to the standard pace. The next automatic network adjustment is estimated to occur on Friday and will take the metric’s value to a new ATH of 129.13 terahashes, according to data from CoinWarz . BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $116,300, up more than 2% over the last 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin All-Time High|bitcoin hashrate|bitcoin price|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-08 00:00:19

With 200,000+ holders, 2.5 million global users via its mobile mining app, and 19,000+ ASIC miners already sold, BlockDAG is achieving in months what most Layer 1 projects take years to build, and it’s doing it before public trading even begins. As the GLOBAL LAUNCH release nears on August 11, this rapid ecosystem growth is catching attention beyond retail buyers. Developers, miners, and even institutional observers are watching closely. With more than $364.5 million already raised in presale and a $600 million goal in sight, BlockDAG’s progress is being driven by working products, expanding user participation, and technology that’s already operational, not just planned for the future. An Active Community Driving Early Growth BlockDAG’s 200,000+ holders aren’t just watching, they’re using. Many are deeply involved through the X1 mobile miner app , which has reached 2.5 million users worldwide in just a short time. This app, available across markets, allows users to simulate daily BDAG mining, building habits and increasing exposure to BlockDAG’s mission as a high-speed, decentralized Layer 1 platform. But this isn’t just for show. The app offers functional value now and will unlock real benefits after launch. It also leads into the mining ecosystem, where over 19,000 ASIC units have been sold. These devices are part of BlockDAG’s hybrid Proof-of-Work model, providing critical support for decentralization and securing the network at scale. This hands-on involvement is a major factor behind BlockDAG’s viral adoption. Unlike many presales that depend purely on speculative interest, BDAG is gaining real users before launch. That early momentum has helped generate over $364.5 million in presale participation, making it one of the top-performing offerings in the past seven years. How a Growing Ecosystem Supports Future Price Potential BlockDAG’s growth isn’t just in user numbers. Its Demo Trading Platform is already live, giving buyers a chance to purchase BDAG at $0.0016 and practice trading risk-free ahead of the confirmed $0.05 listing. A Cold Wallet is also on the way, providing secure storage and expanding token functionality. Meanwhile, more than 4,500 developers are contributing to over 300 dApps across the network. This expansion is built on solid technical ground. BlockDAG’s hybrid DAG and Proof-of-Work setup has shown throughput of 10 blocks per second in testing and supports between 2,000 and 15,000 TPS, outperforming most current Layer 1s. This infrastructure ensures the network can scale without risking centralization or congestion. These developments are fueling growing speculation that BDAG could reach $1 within its first year of trading. With the current price at $0.0016, this suggests a 625x return for early buyers. Even the confirmed launch price of $0.05 offers a 3025% ROI, a rare figure that’s backed by real-world adoption and live tools. BlockDAG’s presale is about more than buying early, it’s about joining a network that’s already delivering results. With every user, miner, and dApp, the value of the ecosystem increases, encouraging further growth. That cycle is well underway and speeding toward the August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release. A Live Ecosystem Preparing for Public Trading BlockDAG’s platform is no longer a vision, it’s live and growing fast. With 200,000+ holders, millions of users, and live infrastructure in place, the project is shaping up as one of the strongest early crypto platforms this year. The window to buy at $0.0016 is narrowing, and with it, the chance to be part of the next growth phase. For those focused on adoption and utility, not just hype, BlockDAG’s expanding ecosystem shows there’s a lot more ahead, and it’s just getting started.

According to fresh data from Glassnode, long-term TRX holders have booked over $1.4 billion in realized profits in a single day, the second-highest daily figure of 2025. What’s more, daily profits have remained close to $1 billion for several days straight, signaling a calculated cash-out phase by seasoned holders. Many of these exits trace back to the 2020–2021 cycle. These aren’t fluke trades or panic sales. They’re strategic exits from early investors, who are taking advantage of favorable prices and booking hefty gains while keeping TRX’s price steady around $0.33. This quiet profit-taking wave stands in contrast to the sharp, panic-driven dumps typical of crypto downturns. New Project Earns Investor Trust with Top Ratings While some early TRX investors are cashing out, others are redirecting their capital into promising new opportunities—MAGACOIN FINANCE chief among them. This rising project has been gaining serious momentum, not just for its growth potential, but for its credibility. Backed by top-tier security audits and a rapidly expanding holder base, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing comparisons to early-stage breakout tokens. Its community has grown over 10x in the past few weeks, and analysts point out the project’s low entry price and unique tokenomics could set the stage for significant ROI . For those watching the smart money flow, MAGACOIN’s traction is hard to ignore. Tron Outlook: Stability or Slip? With early holders stepping aside, Tron now faces a delicate balancing act. If new investors absorb the selling pressure, TRX could maintain its price levels and possibly trend higher. But if buying slows while exits continue, a dip may be on the horizon. What’s important is that these aren’t desperation moves—TRX’s long-term holders are simply rotating profits. And as new narratives take shape across the altcoin market, many of them are choosing to back fresh projects with better upside—projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion Tron’s recent surge in realized profits shows that early holders are finally cashing out after years of waiting. This isn’t a market crash—it’s a reshuffling of capital. And as whales move on, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a top choice , armed with security credentials, rapid growth, and bullish investor momentum.

Uniswap’s recent dip has left traders wondering whether it signals a broader shift or just a temporary pause. Meanwhile, Ethereum price prediction models are growing more aggressive, fueled by institutional flows and ETF activity. But Cold Wallet ($CWT) takes a different approach. It already delivers cashback rewards for swaps, gas fees, and on-ramp activity, making it one of the few projects offering tangible utility before launch. Its $270 million Plus Wallet acquisition brought in over 2 million users, proving that traction is not theoretical. Now listed on CoinMarketCap, Cold Wallet ($CWT) is no longer just a promising idea. With the token still in presale, its price sits far below its confirmed listing value. That combination of live product, user growth, and structural upside positions it as the best crypto for payments heading into 2025. Uniswap’s Dip Could Open’s Door to Stronger Upside Push Uniswap’s recent 6% decline from $11.19 to $10.36 surprised some traders, but it appears to be more of a breather than a breakdown. The broader trend still leans bullish, with UNI comfortably trading above its 200-day simple moving average of $7.79 and an RSI of 61.45 suggesting balanced momentum. Trading volume remains robust at over $77 million, a sign of continued engagement rather than fear. Support sits around $10.30, and resistance is near $11.60. If UNI holds $10.60, a renewed push upward is possible. This pullback may ultimately serve as the launchpad for a stronger advance. Ethereum Builds Toward $6K Target as Accumulation Accelerates Ethereum’s technical and on-chain signals are aligning for a major leg up. Institutions are moving ETH into cold storage, reducing exchange supply, while staking activity continues to lock more tokens away. These trends suggest long-term commitment and reduced sell pressure across the board. Forecasts now extend beyond $4,500, with some analysts pointing toward $6,000 to $8,500 targets by 2025. Technical charts show resistance clusters near breakout zones, and whale accumulation confirms growing confidence. Ethereum is no longer just building momentum; it is building structure for the next wave of upside. Cold Wallet Presale Steps Into Spotlight as Real Utility Meets Global Visibility Presales often generate noise without delivering substance, but Cold Wallet is flipping that pattern. Its CoinMarketCap listing has brought serious visibility, transforming it from a niche project to one gaining attention from analysts and global trading communities. With a working cashback system already live, Cold Wallet rewards users for gas fees, crypto swaps , and even on-ramp or off-ramp activity, turning everyday crypto transactions into tangible returns. This is not just future-facing talk. Cold Wallet recently finalized a $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet, immediately integrating more than 2 million users. The wallet’s reward structure is already functioning, allowing users to earn Cold Wallet Token (CWT) directly through blockchain activity. That core mechanic has helped shift perception, placing Cold Wallet on a growing list of serious contenders in the utility token space. Now in stage 16, the project has raised over $5.7 million, yet the token is priced at just $0.00942. With a confirmed launch price of $0.3517, this represents a 36x gap on paper. Some analysts suggest the true potential could be closer to 1000x, especially if Cold Wallet’s cashback system gains traction across the global crypto user base. In a market filled with speculation, Cold Wallet is offering functionality and scale. The timing of its CoinMarketCap debut aligns with rising adoption and working mechanics. That mix of momentum, utility, and exposure is placing Cold Wallet on watchlists as the next major breakout in crypto payments. Key Takeaways Uniswap’s price swings and Ethereum’s forecasts continue to depend on market sentiment and institutional trends. Cold Wallet is taking a different route by building real systems with measurable utility. Its cashback feature is already live, its $270 million Plus Wallet acquisition has added over 2 million users, and its CoinMarketCap listing now positions it on the global stage.

49717544,https://timestabloid.com/?p=77316,1754611254,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Shiba Inu (SHIB) Potential Price In a $45B Market Cap Scenario,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-shib-potential-price-in-a-45b-market-cap-scenario/,"Shiba Inu has recently seen a decline in price and market position, falling to the 22nd largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Currently, SHIB’s market valuation stands at around $7.3 billion, following a 1.58% decline over the past week and a 20% drop over the last two weeks. This performance reflects a broader trend across the crypto market, with Bitcoin also down 1.24% in the same seven-day period and XRP struggling to stay above the $3 level. Analyst Projects SHIB to Hit $45B Market Cap Despite recent setbacks, some market observers maintain a bullish outlook for SHIB. Prominent crypto influencer Jake Gagain recently projected that Shiba Inu could achieve a $45 billion market capitalization before the end of 2025. This estimate, if realized, would represent the highest valuation in the asset’s history. My 2025 Price Predictions: $DOGE : $87 Billion MC $SHIB : $45 Billion MC $PEPE : $32 Billion MC $PENGU : $25 Billion MC $BONK : $18 Billion MC $BRETT : $12.5 Billion MC $TRUMP : $9 Billion MC $SPX : Flips The Stock Market $WIF : ZERO — JAKE (@JakeGagain) August 6, 2025 Previously, Shiba Inu reached its peak market value of $39.3 billion in October 2021, temporarily surpassing Dogecoin. However, it did not exceed the $45 billion mark at any point . Gagain’s projection would therefore establish a new all-time high, implying an increase of $37.7 billion, or approximately 516%, from SHIB’s current market value. Price Estimation Based on $45B Market Cap Scenario At the time of writing, SHIB is priced at $0.00001262 , with a circulating supply of around 589.24 trillion tokens. If the market cap increases to $45 billion, the price would rise proportionally to approximately $0.00007636. This prediction implies a 516% surge from current levels, bringing it near the asset’s all-time high of $0.00008845, set in late 2021. Moreover, if the projected price is measured against SHIB’s recent low of $0.00001004 observed in June, it reflects an even more pronounced appreciation of approximately 660%. This projection is consistent with another forecast by analyst Hunters Company, who suggested that SHIB could approach $0.000070 after rebounding from a critical support zone, as highlighted in his TradingView analysis. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Capitalization Forecasts for Other Meme Coins In addition to SHIB, Jake Gagain also shared his end-of-2025 projections for other meme-related cryptocurrencies. He expects Dogecoin to reach an $87 billion valuation, followed by PEPE at $32 billion and PENGU at $25 billion. BONK is forecasted to rise to $18 billion, while BRETT could grow to $12.5 billion. Gagain also noted a bullish view on SPX, suggesting it could outperform traditional equities. However, he expressed a bearish outlook on WIF, predicting that its value would decline to zero. While Shiba Inu is currently facing market headwinds, long-term forecasts remain optimistic among certain analysts. If SHIB reaches the projected $45 billion market cap, it would not only establish a new record but also restore prices near their previous all-time highs. These forecasts reflect growing confidence in the asset’s potential to regain momentum as market conditions improve.

Trump’s administration is following through with its promises to safeguard free expression, economic participation, and fairness in the U.S. financial system . President Trump signs executive order to end politicized debanking President Donald J. Trump has signed a sweeping executive order prohibiting banks and federal regulators from denying financial services to Americans based on political beliefs, religious affiliations, or lawful business activities. The order, titled “Guaranteeing Fair Banking for All Americans,” directs federal banking regulators to eliminate guidelines and practices that facilitate what it calls “politicized or unlawful debanking.” The policy also targets the removal of the widely criticized “reputational risk” as a factor in bank decision-making. The administration describes these guidelines as systemic abuses by financial institutions and regulators that have, in some cases, frozen payrolls, denied account openings, or refused payment processing to lawful individuals and businesses. The White House fact shee t noted several examples of such cases including a major banking institution that denied ticket-payment processing for a Republican event and only reversed its decision after receiving backlash, federal regulators encouraging banks to flag individuals for transactions with companies like Bass Pro Shop or Cabela’s, or for using terms such as “Trump” or “MAGA” in payment descriptions without any evidence of criminal activity. Two major banks also allegedly denied services to Trump’s own business. “The banks discriminate against conservatives, they discriminate against religion, because they’re afraid of the radical left, I suspect,” Trump said. “Nobody knows the banking industry better than me, and I’m not going to let them take advantage of you any longer.” The executive order requires federal regulators to remove all language in their guidance and examination materials that supports politicized or unlawful debanking. It instructs regulators to review financial institutions for current or past policies encouraging such practices and take remedial actions, including fines or consent decrees. Cases of unlawful debanking based on religion are to be reported to the Attorney General. The order instructs the Small Business Administration to push financial institutions under its jurisdiction to reinstate clients previously denied services for these reasons. Finally, it states that federal regulators should develop a comprehensive strategy to prevent such practices in the future, including potential legislative solutions. The White House said the order also addresses issues raised during a Senate Banking Committee hearing earlier this year, where witnesses testified about being “debanked” for political or ideological reasons. Trump opens retirement vehicles to crypto Trump signed a second order , this one titled “Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors,” which will allow more than 90 million American private-sector workers to invest in alternative assets, including digital assets, that have previously been available mainly to government employees and certain institutional investors. Under the current system, many private sector workers with 401(k) accounts have access only to a limited selection of mutual funds and traditional investments. According to Trump’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, who praised the announcement on social media platform X, the change will “allow more than 90 million American workers… to access the same range of alternative assets… that are available to government workers, for better returns and diversification.” The White House said this move is designed to “level the playing field” between private and public sector workers and offer Americans more tools to achieve long-term financial security. Digital asset advocates see the policy as a major win for the cryptocurrency industry, which has often struggled with access to traditional banking services. Within the cryptocurrency community, Trump’s orders are being viewed as a means to dismantle structural barriers that have hindered innovation and financial participation. “No American should be denied access to financial services because of their political or religious beliefs,” the fact sheet states, adding that investment opportunities should not be “limited by outdated rules or unfair restrictions.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Imagine a scenario where a significant portion of your retirement savings, specifically your 401(k), finds its way into the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. This isn’t just speculation; the potential for substantial crypto retirement funds flowing into the market is becoming a tangible reality. The Astonishing Potential of Crypto Retirement Funds Recent analysis paints a compelling picture of the massive influx that could occur. Ryan Rasmussen, a research analyst at crypto asset fund manager Bitwise, highlighted on X (formerly Twitter) that U.S. 401(k) plans currently hold a staggering $8 trillion in assets as of September 2024. New capital continuously flows into these plans each week. Consider this: If just 1% of these existing assets were allocated to crypto, it would inject an impressive $80 billion into the digital asset market. Furthermore, this would establish a steady, ongoing flow of new capital, deepening the market’s liquidity. Bloomberg’s more optimistic estimate places the 401(k) market at an even larger $12.5 trillion, which would translate to a monumental $125 billion inflow if just 1% was invested. This illustrates the sheer scale of potential crypto retirement funds . Why is 401k Crypto Investment Now Possible? This significant shift isn’t accidental; it’s backed by crucial policy changes. A pivotal development occurred when former U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order. This order specifically allowed 401(k) retirement plans to explore investments in alternative assets. What are alternative assets? They include diverse options such as real estate, private equity, and, importantly, cryptocurrencies. This executive action opened a new pathway for traditional retirement vehicles to consider what was once seen as a niche or speculative asset class. The move signaled a growing recognition of digital assets within mainstream finance, paving the way for increased 401k crypto investment opportunities and broader acceptance. This growing acceptance underscores the potential for future growth in the sector. What Are the Benefits of Retirement Crypto for Investors? For individuals looking at their long-term financial health, including crypto in a retirement portfolio offers several compelling advantages. Diversification is a primary benefit, as cryptocurrencies often move independently of traditional markets, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Potential for Growth: Historically, some cryptocurrencies have shown significant growth potential, offering a different return profile than stocks or bonds. Inflation Hedge: Certain digital assets are viewed by some as a potential hedge against inflation, preserving purchasing power over time. While the allure of high returns is strong, it is crucial for individuals to conduct thorough research and consider their risk tolerance. Consulting a qualified financial advisor before making any retirement crypto decisions is always recommended to ensure alignment with personal financial goals and to understand the nuances of retirement crypto strategies. Navigating Challenges in Institutional Crypto Adoption Despite the immense potential, the path to widespread institutional crypto adoption is not without its hurdles. Volatility remains a key concern for many traditional investors. The crypto market can experience rapid price swings, which may not align with the conservative nature of typical retirement portfolios. Regulatory clarity is another ongoing challenge. While progress has been made, a comprehensive and consistent regulatory framework is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Investor education is vital. Many individuals are unfamiliar with the technical aspects and inherent risks associated with digital assets. However, the presence of specialized crypto asset fund managers like Bitwise helps bridge this gap, offering structured products and expert analysis to facilitate safer institutional engagement and responsible digital asset investment . This ongoing push for institutional crypto adoption is a positive sign for market maturity. The Broader Impact of Digital Asset Investment The potential inflow of billions from 401(k)s into the crypto market signifies more than just new capital. It represents a profound shift towards mainstream acceptance and maturation of the entire digital asset ecosystem. This increased interest in digital asset investment signals a growing confidence in the long-term viability of cryptocurrencies. Increased investment from retirement funds could lead to greater market stability and liquidity, benefiting all participants. It also signals a vote of confidence from a traditionally conservative investment sector, potentially encouraging further innovation and development within the crypto space. This expanding landscape of digital asset investment underscores a future where cryptocurrencies play an increasingly integral role in diverse financial portfolios, including those built for long-term retirement planning. The future of 401k crypto investment looks promising. The prospect of tens of billions of dollars flowing from U.S. retirement funds into cryptocurrencies is a powerful indicator of the evolving financial landscape. Fueled by policy changes and growing interest, the integration of crypto retirement funds into mainstream investment strategies holds immense potential for both individual investors and the broader digital asset market. While challenges exist, the trajectory points towards a future where digital assets are a recognized component of a diversified retirement portfolio. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can all 401(k) plans invest in crypto? A1: No, not all 401(k) plans currently offer direct crypto investment options. The executive order opened the door, but individual plan administrators must still decide to include alternative assets like crypto. Q2: What are the main risks of investing retirement funds in crypto? A2: Key risks include high market volatility, potential regulatory changes, security concerns (e.g., hacks), and the complex nature of digital assets. It’s crucial to understand these risks before any 401k crypto investment . Q3: How much of my 401(k) should I allocate to crypto? A3: There is no universal answer, as it depends on individual risk tolerance, financial goals, and overall portfolio diversification. Financial advisors often suggest a small percentage (e.g., 1-5%) for highly speculative assets within a well-diversified portfolio. Q4: Is there a specific type of crypto that 401(k) plans can invest in? A4: Typically, if a 401(k) plan offers crypto exposure, it’s often through a fund or trust that holds established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), rather than direct individual coin purchases. This approach is part of the broader trend of institutional crypto adoption . Q5: What role do crypto asset fund managers play? A5: Crypto asset fund managers, like Bitwise, create regulated investment vehicles that allow traditional investors and retirement plans to gain exposure to digital assets. They manage the complexities of custody, security, and market analysis on behalf of their clients, facilitating digital asset investment .

A recent notable development involves Jack Dorsey’s payment company, Block (formerly Square), which has significantly boosted its Block Bitcoin holdings . This move underscores a growing trend of institutional confidence in digital assets, particularly Bitcoin. Why Are Block Bitcoin Holdings Significant? Block’s latest increase in its Block Bitcoin holdings highlights a deliberate and consistent approach to integrating Bitcoin into its corporate treasury. In the second quarter, the company added another 108 BTC, pushing its total reserves to an impressive 8,692 BTC. This steady accumulation is not merely an investment; it reflects a broader commitment to Bitcoin as a foundational technology and a strategic asset. For years, Block, under the leadership of Bitcoin advocate Jack Dorsey, has been at the forefront of crypto innovation. Their dedication extends beyond simply holding Bitcoin; they actively invest in its ecosystem. This includes initiatives like Bitcoin development, mining, and fostering greater accessibility through their Cash App. A Closer Look at Block’s Strategic BTC Acquisition The data regarding Block’s recent BTC acquisition comes from crypto investor HODL15Capital, shared via X (formerly Twitter). This consistent accumulation strategy positions Block among the leading public companies with substantial Bitcoin reserves. It demonstrates a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and its potential as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. This crypto strategy is multifaceted. Beyond direct investment, Block aims to make Bitcoin more usable and accessible for everyday transactions. Their ongoing projects, like the TBD division, focus on decentralized financial services built on Bitcoin. This integrated approach suggests that their Bitcoin holdings are not just passive investments but integral to their future business models. The Broader Impact of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Block is not alone in embracing corporate Bitcoin . Many public companies, including MicroStrategy and Tesla, have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This trend signifies a maturing market where digital assets are gaining legitimacy as viable treasury alternatives. Companies often cite reasons such as diversification, inflation hedging, and the potential for capital appreciation. However, challenges exist. Bitcoin’s price volatility can impact corporate balance sheets, and the regulatory landscape remains fluid. Despite these hurdles, the growing number of companies like Block adopting corporate Bitcoin suggests a fundamental shift in how businesses view and utilize digital assets. It builds trust and paves the way for wider mainstream acceptance. What Does This Mean for Jack Dorsey’s Block and the Future? The vision of Jack Dorsey Block is clear: to build an open financial system for everyone, with Bitcoin at its core. Their increasing Block Bitcoin holdings reinforce this mission. This commitment could inspire other corporations to explore similar strategies, further accelerating institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. For investors and enthusiasts, observing Block’s consistent Bitcoin accumulation provides valuable insight. It signals a strong conviction from a major tech company regarding Bitcoin’s future. As Block continues to innovate within the Bitcoin ecosystem, its strategic moves will likely influence broader market trends and the ongoing evolution of financial technology.

This significant rise firmly places the market in the “Greed” zone, signaling a strong shift in positive crypto market sentiment among participants. What does this mean for your investment strategy, and how can you interpret this crucial market indicator ? What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reveal? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by the software development platform Alternative, offers a powerful snapshot of investor sentiment in the dynamic cryptocurrency market . It simplifies complex market data into a single, understandable number from 0 to 100. 0 (Extreme Fear): Investors are overly worried, potentially leading to panic selling. This can present buying opportunities. 100 (Extreme Greed): Indicates the market might be due for a correction, as prices could be overinflated by irrational exuberance. As of August 8th, the index stood at 74, a substantial 12-point jump from the previous day. This upward movement clearly reflects an improving mood across the crypto space, indicating growing confidence. Key Factors Driving This Market Indicator Understanding how the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is calculated enhances its reliability. It aggregates data from several critical sources, providing a holistic view of the cryptocurrency market ‘s emotional state. Six primary factors are considered: Volatility (25%): Measures Bitcoin’s current volatility and maximum drawdowns. Higher volatility often signals fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Analyzes current volume and momentum. High buying volume on positive days suggests greed. Social Media (15%): Scans social media for crypto-related hashtags, measuring sentiment and engagement. Surveys (15%): Polls investors directly. (Currently paused.) Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Tracks Bitcoin’s share of total crypto market capitalization. Rising dominance can indicate fear or strong Bitcoin bull run. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google search data for crypto terms, looking for spikes in fear-related or greed-related searches. By combining these diverse data points, the index offers a comprehensive, data-driven perspective on prevailing investor sentiment . Navigating the “Greed” Zone: Implications for Your Portfolio The index’s current position at 74 firmly places it in “Greed” territory. While exciting, it demands a balanced perspective. High greed levels can be a double-edged sword: Potential for Further Gains: Strong crypto market sentiment often fuels upward price movements as more capital flows in. Risk of Correction: Historically, extreme greed can precede market corrections. Widespread optimism might lead to profit-taking. Savvy investors often use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as a contrarian indicator. When it’s in “Extreme Fear,” some see it as a buying opportunity. Conversely, “Extreme Greed” might signal caution or time to consider taking profits. It’s one of many valuable market indicators to consider. Leveraging This Market Indicator Effectively The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool, but most effective when integrated into a broader investment strategy. It helps you understand the prevailing emotional climate, vital in volatile markets like cryptocurrency. Actionable Insights: Gauge Market Psychology: Use the index to discern if the market is driven by emotion. Avoid FOMO: A high index helps resist buying into hyped assets at inflated prices. Identify Opportunities: A very low index might signal a good time to research and potentially invest in projects you believe in. Complement with Research: Always combine the index’s insights with your own fundamental and technical analysis. Do not rely solely on one market indicator . The current 74 reading suggests a robust and confident cryptocurrency market . However, continuous monitoring of the index, alongside other research, remains key to making informed decisions. Conclusion: Understanding Investor Sentiment is Key The surge of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 74 signifies heightened confidence and positive investor sentiment within the cryptocurrency market . While this “Greed” zone indicates strong momentum, it also reminds prudent investors to stay vigilant. By understanding what this powerful market indicator represents and how its components work, you can better navigate the ups and downs of the crypto world. Remember, informed decisions are always your best asset. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index measure? A1: The Crypto Fear & Greed Index measures the current emotional state of the cryptocurrency market , ranging from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed), by analyzing various market factors. Q2: Why is the index currently in the “Greed” zone?

Q3: How can investors use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A3: Investors can use this market indicator to gauge overall market psychology, avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) during periods of high greed, or identify potential buying opportunities during extreme fear, always complementing it with further research. Q4: Are surveys still a factor in the index calculation?

On this day, a massive volume of Bitcoin options expiry contracts will mature, potentially stirring the waters of the digital asset market. Traders and investors are closely watching as billions of dollars in derivatives prepare for settlement. This event is not just about numbers; it reflects market sentiment and can influence future price movements for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. What Does the Bitcoin Options Expiry Entail? On August 8, at 08:00 UTC, a staggering $4.11 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) options are set to expire. This event, tracked by leading crypto options market data provider Deribit, is a major point of interest for market participants. Options contracts grant holders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price by a specific date. Understanding these mechanics is crucial for anticipating market behavior. Put/Call Ratio: For BTC, the put/call ratio stands at 1.45. A ratio above 1 indicates more put options (bets on price decline) than call options (bets on price increase). This suggests a prevailing bearish sentiment among option holders regarding Bitcoin’s immediate future. Max Pain Price: The max pain price for BTC is currently $116,000. This is the strike price at which the largest number of options contracts will expire worthless, causing maximum financial loss for option holders. While not a definitive price prediction, this level often acts as a magnetic pull for the underlying asset’s price around the expiry time. Such a substantial expiry volume for Bitcoin options expiry could lead to increased volatility, as market makers adjust their hedges and traders manage their positions. How Will Ethereum Options Expiry Compare on August 8? Simultaneously, on the very same day, around $864.16 billion in Ethereum options expiry contracts will also mature. This colossal figure highlights the growing maturity and immense scale of the Ethereum derivatives market. Understanding the dynamics of Ethereum options expiry is equally vital for a holistic market view, especially given its significant valuation. ETH Specifics: Ethereum’s put/call ratio is 1.14, also indicating a slight bearish lean among ETH option holders. The max pain price for ETH is $3,650. This point represents where most ETH options would expire without value for their owners. Market Implications: Such large expiries, especially for both major cryptocurrencies, can lead to increased volatility across the entire crypto options market. Traders often adjust their positions ahead of these events, which can significantly influence spot prices for both BTC and ETH. The sheer scale of these expiries demands attention from all market participants. Why is This Crypto Options Market Event So Important? The sheer volume involved in this upcoming crypto options market expiry means it can significantly impact short-term price action for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Large expiries often lead to increased trading activity as market makers adjust their hedges and traders close or roll over their positions. This creates both opportunities and heightened risk for participants. Volatility Spikes: Expect potential price swings around the expiry time. Market participants might observe increased liquidity or, conversely, rapid price movements if a significant number of options are exercised or allowed to expire. Strategic Positioning: Savvy investors analyze these key metrics, including the max pain price and put/call ratio, derived from Deribit options data . This analysis helps them inform their trading strategies. Understanding these indicators provides valuable insights into the collective sentiment of options traders and can help predict potential market reactions. The August 8 expiry acts as a significant liquidity event, drawing attention to how these derivatives influence the broader market structure. Understanding Max Pain Price and Deribit Options Data Insights Navigating the complexities of options expiry requires careful analysis of available data. While the max pain price offers a theoretical anchor for where the underlying asset might settle, the actual market outcome can deviate based on broader market sentiment and unexpected news. Challenges include predicting how market makers will rebalance their portfolios and the overall direction of the spot market. Data Interpretation: Deribit options data provides crucial transparency into the derivatives landscape. Traders utilize this information to gauge potential support and resistance levels, anticipate market maker behavior, and effectively manage their own risk exposure. This data empowers informed decision-making. Risk Management: For those holding options or planning trades around August 8, it is prudent to review positions carefully. Consider the potential for increased volatility and manage leverage accordingly. Derivatives markets are complex, and understanding these expiry dynamics is a key component of robust risk management. The convergence of these significant expiries on a single day amplifies their potential impact, making diligent preparation paramount. Conclusion: Navigating the August 8 Expiry The August 8 Bitcoin and Ethereum options expiry presents a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. With billions of dollars in contracts maturing, understanding the put/call ratios and max pain prices is essential for all participants. While these events can introduce volatility, they also offer valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements. Staying informed and prepared is key for navigating these significant derivatives milestones successfully. Traders should monitor real-time data and adjust their strategies as needed. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin options expiry? A Bitcoin options expiry is when derivatives contracts, which give the holder the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell BTC at a specific price, reach their maturity date and are settled. What is “max pain price” in crypto options? The max pain price is the strike price at which the largest number of open options contracts will expire worthless, causing maximum financial loss for option holders. It often acts as a magnet for the asset’s price near expiry. How does the put/call ratio indicate market sentiment? A put/call ratio above 1 suggests a bearish sentiment, as there are more put options (bets on price decline) than call options (bets on price increase). Conversely, a ratio below 1 indicates a bullish sentiment. Will the August 8 expiry definitely cause price volatility? While large options expiries often correlate with increased volatility due to hedging and position adjustments, they do not guarantee specific price movements. It is a significant factor to consider, but not a definitive prediction. Where can I find reliable crypto options market data? Leading crypto options exchanges like Deribit provide comprehensive data on options contracts, including expiry dates, strike prices, put/call ratios, and max pain levels.

The company reported revenue of $998 million for the three months ended June 30, ahead of the $976 million analysts had forecast. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.33, below the $0.36 consensus. Monthly active users totaled 578 million globally, and Pinterest said it had 102 million monthly users in the U.S. and Canada — unchanged from the prior quarter. North America remains the source of the vast majority of the company’s revenue. Robert Biggar, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, noted that user numbers are stagnant in all regions except outside the U.S., raising concerns about growth in Pinterest’s most lucrative market. Pinterest sees revenue surge as AI and shopping push pay off Despite the mixed results, Pinterest projected stronger-than-expected revenue for the current quarter, forecasting $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion versus the $1.02 billion analysts expected. The results suggest the company’s advertising business is expanding even as the broader online search landscape adapts to new AI-driven dynamics. Under CEO Bill Ready, Pinterest has focused heavily on shopping and “visual search,” showing posts that make it easier for users to discover and buy products directly within the app. The company has also leaned into AI to sharpen ad targeting and content recommendations — moves that helped drive the revenue beat. Pinterest shares had risen about 35% year-to-date ahead of the report, but the stock has shown large swings around earnings in recent quarters — jumping double digits after upbeat guidance in May and surging following its holiday-quarter results in February. More men are flocking to Pinterest Just days ago, Pinterest released its first-ever trend report, revealing that men now make up more than one-third of its 570 million global active users—over 171 million, most of them Gen Z. These users defy the usual social media stereotypes, with Pinterest noting they “largely reject the toxicity you might find elsewhere online” and prefer authentic, positive engagement. Male users are diving into diverse content—from Pilates and smart parenting to product research and unique travel ideas. To capture even more of this audience, Pinterest has launched a dedicated “Pinterest Man” hub, showcasing trending topics and shoppable styles—a move that could heat up competition with TikTok, whose TikTok Shop is expected to attract 50 million U.S. buyers this year. Wellness is a major draw. Searches for Pilates outfits are up 300%, rock climbing up 115%, and hydration-related terms up 50%. Interest in health boosters like electrolytes and coconut water has climbed 45%. According to GWI, half of Gen Z and millennial men on Pinterest care about their appearance, fueling spikes in grooming and fashion searches. Sea salt spray hair routines are trending, as are skincare practices like microneedling. Men’s facials are up 230%, and male nail art searches have surged 115%. Goth, grunge, and even jorts are making fashion waves. Men are also embracing tech and finance content. Searches for 3D printing designs have skyrocketed over 1,200%, eclipsing the 800% rise in AI video interest and 265% growth in programming tutorials.

This surge comes amid major price swings in Bitcoin and Ethereum, pushing institutional and retail traders to hedge aggressively and speculate on coming market shifts. With altcoin derivatives now representing over 83% of all Binance Futures activity, capital rotation into higher-beta assets appears to be accelerating—further fueling volatility across the board. Daily futures volume peaked at $134 billion and while Bitcoin still anchors the market with $79B in open interest, the broader narrative is shifting. Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and meme coins are dominating the charts—suggesting a growing appetite for leveraged bets as the market braces for another breakout, or breakdown. Bitcoin Eyes $135K While Traders Hedge on Pullbacks Bitcoin (BTC) is currently hovering around $113,000–$115,000 after dipping from a recent local high of $123,000. Analysts attribute this pullback to long-term holders cashing out and short-term capitulation following the initial ETF-driven surge. However, the broader sentiment remains cautiously optimistic. The Fear & Greed Index sits at 60, reflecting moderate bullishness. Technical charts suggest neutral-to-upside potential, with $135,000–$140,000 still in play for year-end targets. Notably, leading voices like Scaramucci and Beard continue to back a $150K–$170K BTC by 2025-end, barring any macroeconomic disruptions. ETF flows remain strong, institutional inflows are stable, and many view the $110K–$115K range as a key accumulation zone. Ethereum Derivatives Pop as Institutions Accumulate Ethereum (ETH) has also seen sharp corrections, currently trading near $3,500 following outflows from ETH-based ETFs and broader market weakness. Yet on-chain data and trading desks point to quiet accumulation by institutional players—particularly in the $3,400–$3,600 range. ETH remains a strategic play. Despite short-term turbulence, traders see a return to $3,800–$4,000 in the near term, with bullish projections calling for $6,000 by late Q3 if momentum continues. Derivatives activity for ETH futures is heating up, echoing early 2021 setups. While meme coins and alt-bets gain traction, ETH is still considered a “liquidity anchor” by major funds. Momentum with Surge in Institutional-Scale Inflows The explosive rise in futures trading isn’t just benefiting BTC and ETH. As traders hunt for the next breakout asset, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a prime candidate. In recent weeks, Top market analysts have list MAGACOIN FINANCE among the best altcoins to buy for long-term gains . Community momentum is rising fast, fueled by utility-first design and viral meme culture. This hybrid appeal—combining fundamentals with meme coin energy—has driven massive whale inflows and community traction. With its current presale model offering scarcity-based access, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining real traction as a strategic bet in a volatile altseason landscape. For traders looking beyond the noise, it’s becoming a serious consideration. Conclusion: Binance Liquidity Signals New Cycle Binance Futures activity is more than just a number—it’s a barometer for risk appetite. And right now, that appetite is returning. Bitcoin and Ethereum remain at the core, but traders are increasingly rotating toward altcoins and derivatives to capture the next big leg of this market cycle. Amid that momentum, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are being watched closely—not just for their community strength, but for the asymmetric upside they may offer in the months ahead.

Currently, a key metric, the Altcoin Season Index , stands at 36. This figure signals a significant period often referred to as Bitcoin Season . This index, tracked by platforms like CoinMarketCap (CMC), provides valuable insight into which segment of the digital asset market is leading the charge. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Tell Us About Bitcoin Season? The Altcoin Season Index is a widely watched metric that helps investors gauge the prevailing sentiment and performance within the cryptocurrency market. When this index registers below 90, it generally indicates that the market is in a Bitcoin Season . This means that Bitcoin (BTC) is outperforming the majority of altcoins over a specific timeframe, typically the last 90 days. A score of 90 or higher suggests an Altcoin Season , where altcoins are performing better than Bitcoin. A score below 90, like the current 36, confirms that Bitcoin is currently dominating the market’s performance. This dominance isn’t just about price appreciation; it often reflects a shift in investor focus and capital allocation. During a Bitcoin Season , capital tends to flow into Bitcoin, often seen as a safer or more stable asset in volatile times, or simply as the primary driver of broader crypto market trends . Why Are We Seeing This Bitcoin Season Dominance? Several factors can contribute to Bitcoin’s renewed dominance and the current Bitcoin Season . Macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and significant institutional interest often play a pivotal role. When global economic uncertainty rises, investors sometimes flock to Bitcoin as a “digital gold,” perceiving it as a hedge against inflation or traditional market instability. Furthermore, major developments specific to Bitcoin, such as halving events, ETF approvals, or significant technological upgrades, can attract substantial capital. This inflow naturally boosts Bitcoin’s performance relative to other digital asset performance , drawing attention and liquidity away from altcoins. It’s a natural ebb and flow within the dynamic crypto ecosystem. Historically, Bitcoin often leads market recoveries or major bull runs, with altcoins typically following later once Bitcoin has established a strong foundation. This pattern reinforces the concept of a Bitcoin Season as a foundational phase. Navigating Your Portfolio During a Bitcoin Season Understanding the implications of a prevailing Bitcoin Season is essential for managing your cryptocurrency portfolio effectively. While altcoins might experience less significant gains or even corrections during this period, it doesn’t mean they are without opportunity. Instead, it encourages a strategic approach. Key considerations for investors: Risk Assessment: Altcoins, especially smaller cap ones, can be more volatile. During a Bitcoin Season , their downside risk might be amplified if Bitcoin experiences a correction. Capital Allocation: Some investors may choose to increase their Bitcoin holdings or convert some altcoin positions into BTC to capitalize on its potential dominance. Research and Patience: This period can be an excellent time to research promising altcoin projects that might perform well once the market shifts back towards an Altcoin Season . Patience is key, as altcoin rallies often follow Bitcoin’s lead. Observing the Altcoin Season Index helps you anticipate these shifts, allowing you to adjust your strategy proactively rather than reactively. What Comes After Bitcoin Season? Preparing for the Next Altcoin Surge While the current Altcoin Season Index points to Bitcoin dominance, the cryptocurrency market is cyclical. A Bitcoin Season often precedes or is intertwined with periods where altcoins eventually catch up or even outperform Bitcoin. This is when an Altcoin Season typically begins, driven by renewed investor confidence and a willingness to explore higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities. To prepare for the eventual shift, keep an eye on: Bitcoin’s Stability: A period of consolidation or steady growth for Bitcoin often signals that capital might soon rotate into altcoins. Emerging Narratives: New technologies, sectors (like DeFi, NFTs, GameFi), or specific project developments can ignite altcoin rallies. Market Sentiment: A general increase in positive sentiment and retail interest can broaden participation beyond just Bitcoin. By staying informed about these crypto market trends and monitoring the Altcoin Season Index , you can position yourself to potentially benefit from future shifts in digital asset performance . In conclusion, the Altcoin Season Index at 36 clearly indicates we are navigating a period of Bitcoin Season . This phase highlights Bitcoin’s current leadership in the broader crypto market trends . While this means altcoins may take a backseat for a while, it also offers a valuable opportunity to reassess portfolios, conduct thorough research, and strategically prepare for the inevitable return of an Altcoin Season . Understanding these market cycles is paramount for long-term success in the dynamic world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Altcoin Season Index?

49719786,550835,1754614806,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49719786.jpeg,Ripple to Acquire Stablecoin Payments Firm Rail for $200 Million,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-stablecoin-payments-firm-rail-200-million/,"Ripple has announced plans to acquire Toronto-based payment infrastructure company Rail in a $200 million deal aimed at strengthening its footprint in the stablecoin sector. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025, subject to regulatory approval. Rail is known for its cross-border payment capabilities using tokenized dollars and is backed by investors including Galaxy Ventures and Accomplice. The move signals Ripple’s intention to scale its stablecoin initiative, RLUSD, at a time when regulatory clarity around stablecoins is increasing in the United States and globally. With the recent enactment of the GENIUS Act and updated guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on stablecoin accounting practices, Ripple’s acquisition appears to be strategically timed to align with new compliance requirements. The comapny’s President Monica Long stated the deal will help broaden RLUSD’s reach as institutions adopt stablecoin-based payment systems. Rail’s Market Position and Ripple’s Expansion Strategy Rail projects that it will manage approximately 10% of the estimated $36 billion global business-to-business (B2B) stablecoin payment volume. By utilizing tokenized US dollars for cross-border transactions, Rail seeks to reduce settlement times from multiple days to just a few hours. Ripple aims to use Rail’s infrastructure to support regulated payment processing in key markets including the US, Canada, and selected emerging economies . The acquisition gives Ripple a customer-facing payments platform at a time when fintech firms and corporations are increasingly exploring compliant digital dollar solutions. According to the company, this will enhance RLUSD’s appeal among institutions seeking transparent and efficient payment rails. The deal also builds on Ripple’s previous acquisition activity, following a $1.25 billion agreement in April to purchase Hidden Road, a multi-asset prime broker focused on liquidity and custody services. Stablecoin Competition and Regulatory Context Ripple’s broader stablecoin strategy includes recent steps such as applying for a US banking license in July and partnering with Bank of New York Mellon for custody services . RLUSD, launched in December 2024, has grown to over $500 million in circulating supply. Despite this growth, the stablecoin market is still largely controlled by Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. Ripple’s recent acquisitions suggest an ambition to position RLUSD as a serious competitor by providing both infrastructure and compliance under one umbrella. The GENIUS Act, signed into law earlier this summer, represents the first federal legislation in the US focused on payment stablecoins. As more institutions enter the space and demand for regulated stablecoins increases , Ripple appears to be preparing for accelerated adoption by enhancing its network capabilities and compliance infrastructure.

49719783,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=800824,1754614809,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/49719783.jpeg,"Bitcoin Investors Turn To ‘Smart DCA’ As Market Trades Below On-Chain Fair Value Of $117,700",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-investors-dca-market-chain-fair-value-117700/,"Following a brief dip to $112,200, Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered slightly, trading around the $116,300 level at the time of writing. While concerns remain about BTC’s inability to decisively break the $120,000 resistance level, on-chain data suggests the asset may be in an accumulation phase – potentially gearing up for its next breakout toward a new all-time high (ATH). Bitcoin Currently In Accumulation Phase, Analyst Says According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor BorisVest, a strategy called Smart Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) may help Bitcoin investors accumulate the asset more strategically and improve long-term performance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rejected At $120,000: Binance Whale Inflows Suggest Possible Drop To $110,000 In his analysis, BorisVest noted that investors often struggle to time their entries into BTC. Many tend to buy during local tops due to fear of missing out (FOMO) and avoid entering the market during bottoms out of fear of further declines. Smart DCA offers a way to bypass these emotion-driven decisions. The strategy recommends accumulating BTC when its market price falls below the 1-week to 1-month realized price – a period during which short-term holders are often in loss, resulting in heightened sell-off. BorisVest explained: At these levels, short-term holders are usually underwater, leading to increased sell pressure. Smart DCA activates hourly purchases during such periods, helping to bring the BTC and USD cost basis closer together. Currently, the 1-week to 1-month realized price stands at approximately $117,700. As long as BTC trades below this level, Smart DCA continues to flash an accumulation signal. Once BTC climbs above this threshold, the strategy advises gradually selling previously accumulated coins. With Bitcoin now trading near $116,000, the analyst suggests that the asset is still in an accumulation phase – though it’s approaching the realized threshold. According to data from CoinGecko, BTC remains about 5.2% below its ATH of $122,838, recorded on July 14. Is BTC Unlikely To Hit A New ATH? Despite holding steady around $115,000, some analysts warn that Bitcoin’s realized price is slowly beginning to show signs of fragility. A drop below the $105,000 mark could lead to increased downside momentum, potentially triggering a larger sell-off. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Rising New Investor Dominance, Old Holders Yet To Capitulate Notably, Binance’s net taker volume has slipped back into negative territory, raising concerns about a near-term correction. Additionally, rising Bitcoin ETF outflows have shown signs of weakness, adding another layer of uncertainty. Still, not all indicators are bearish. Some on-chain metrics suggest BTC may simply be entering a cooling-off period after a brief overheated phase. At press time, BTC trades at $116,316, up 2.1% in the past 24 hours.

These companies hold Ether (ETH) as a primary asset in their corporate treasuries, offering a unique form of exposure to the Ethereum ecosystem. However, even with this exciting development, a crucial voice of caution has emerged: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin . He acknowledges the value these firms bring but issues a stark warning against the dangers of excessive leverage. Understanding the Rise of ETH Treasury Firms What exactly are ETH treasury firms ? Simply put, these are businesses that choose to hold a significant portion of their corporate reserves in Ether. This strategy provides them with direct exposure to the potential growth of Ethereum, aligning their financial health with the success of the blockchain. The market for these firms is substantial, reportedly valued at around $11.77 billion. Leading examples include BitMine Immersion Technologies, holding $3.23 billion in ETH, and SharpLink Gaming, with $2.02 billion in ETH. Buterin sees this trend as a positive development, offering a robust way for companies to gain exposure to ETH. These firms represent a growing institutional interest in Ethereum, moving beyond speculative trading to integrate crypto assets into traditional corporate finance. This shift is a testament to Ethereum’s increasing maturity and perceived long-term value. The Peril of Ethereum Leverage : A Vitalik Buterin Warning While supportive, Buterin’s primary concern revolves around the potential for excessive leverage within these firms. He specifically warns against the risk of turning this valuable investment strategy into an “overleveraged game.” What does excessive leverage mean in this context? It refers to borrowing significant amounts of capital against existing ETH holdings. While leverage can amplify gains, it dramatically increases exposure to crypto market risk . If the price of ETH drops significantly, highly leveraged positions can face margin calls. This could force firms to sell their ETH holdings to cover debts, potentially triggering a cascading price collapse. Such a scenario could destabilize the broader Ethereum market, affecting all participants. Buterin highlighted that current ETH treasury firms are generally more resilient than past failures like Terra, which collapsed due to unsustainable leverage models. However, vigilance remains key to prevent similar pitfalls. Navigating the ETH Price Rally and Future Considerations Ethereum has shown remarkable strength this year, experiencing a significant ETH price rally of 163%. This impressive performance has helped ETH narrow its performance gap with other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana. A portion of this demand has indeed come from the increasing interest and holdings by ETH treasury firms . For firms considering or already employing an ETH treasury strategy, Buterin’s advice underscores the importance of prudent risk management. It’s about balancing the desire for exposure with the need for financial stability. Maintain healthy collateralization ratios if using any form of leverage. Diversify assets where appropriate, even within a crypto-focused treasury. Regularly assess market conditions and potential volatility. Ultimately, Buterin’s insights serve as a valuable reminder that while innovation and growth are vital, responsible financial practices are paramount to ensuring the long-term health and stability of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Summary: A Balanced Approach to ETH Treasuries Vitalik Buterin’s stance on ETH treasury firms offers a nuanced perspective: embrace the innovation and value proposition of holding Ether, but remain acutely aware of the dangers of excessive leverage. The recent ETH price rally showcases Ethereum’s potential, yet navigating the inherent crypto market risk requires a disciplined approach. By prioritizing caution and resilience, these firms can contribute positively to the Ethereum ecosystem without succumbing to the pitfalls of overextension. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an ETH treasury firm? An ETH treasury firm is a company that holds Ether (ETH) as a significant portion of its corporate treasury reserves, aiming to gain exposure to the Ethereum ecosystem’s growth. Q2: Why is Vitalik Buterin warning against excessive leverage? Vitalik Buterin warns against excessive leverage because borrowing too much against ETH holdings can lead to forced liquidations during price drops, potentially causing a cascading collapse and increasing overall crypto market risk . Q3: How large is the market for ETH treasury firms? According to reports, the market for ETH treasury firms is currently valued at approximately $11.77 billion, with major players like BitMine Immersion Technologies and SharpLink Gaming. Q4: Has the demand from ETH treasury firms impacted the ETH price rally? Yes, the increasing demand from ETH treasury firms is cited as one factor contributing to the significant ETH price rally seen this year, helping ETH narrow its performance gap with other major cryptocurrencies. Q5: How can firms mitigate the risks of holding ETH in their treasury? Firms can mitigate risks by avoiding excessive leverage, maintaining healthy collateralization ratios, diversifying assets where appropriate, and continuously monitoring market conditions and volatility.

Wagering clauses, max cashout limits, and provider exclusions can turn a solid promo into a losing deal. To find the easiest bonus to cash out casino fans can count on, it’s not about who offers the biggest match, it’s about who offers the fairest terms. This article compares three notable platforms: Spartans , BetMGM, and PartyPoker. The goal? See which one delivers a deal that actually lets players withdraw their bonus winnings with minimal friction. Spartans: The Bonus with Straight Rules and Clear Rewards Spartans have earned attention in the crypto gambling world by offering simple and well-defined promotions. Their welcome bonus gives players a 300% match on a $5 deposit, capped at $200. The standout here is the 35x wagering requirement, which is reasonable by current industry standards. Combined with a 10x max cashout rule, this gives players achievable targets and removes the confusion that clouds most bonuses. For those chasing the easiest bonus to cash out casino platforms can provide, Spartans check the key boxes: clarity, structure, and fairness. Excluded providers like Popiplay, 3Oaks, and Pragmatic Play are listed clearly, helping players avoid mistakes. The bonus remains valid for 7 days, giving a practical time frame to meet the wagering terms. Thanks to full crypto support for both deposits and withdrawals, players also avoid long waits or third-party banking delays. Every element here keeps gameplay smooth and straightforward, making Spartans a rare example of a bonus that feels worth claiming. BetMGM: Well-Known Name, But Conditions Are Heavier BetMGM is a major player in the casino space, but its bonuses aren’t as player-friendly as the branding suggests. Their common 100% match offer comes with a 40x wagering rule, meaning a $100 bonus requires $4,000 in play before withdrawal becomes possible. This is a typical setup in traditional casinos, but it hardly fits the category of easiest bonus to cash out casino players are seeking. Game contribution rules are also tight, slots may count just 10%, and table games often count for nothing. Without a payout cap, BetMGM’s bonuses might seem generous, but the high wagering often wipes out player balances before reaching the cashout stage. The platform’s narrow game eligibility list forces players to stick to select slots, reducing freedom and strategy. For those who value flexibility and efficient progress, BetMGM’s structure creates more hurdles than help. PartyPoker: Focused on Poker, Not Bonus Payouts While PartyPoker is best known for its poker rooms, it also extends some bonus offers for casino users. Most include a matched deposit deal with wagering requirements in the 35x–45x range depending on geography and campaign. At a glance, these seem close to Spartans’ terms. However, the lack of a defined cashout cap is misleading. Pair that with limited game contribution options and tight regional limits, and it becomes harder to finish the wagering without major risk. Many bonuses here rely on “missions” or timed challenges to unlock progress, which makes them more complicated than helpful. This approach adds layers that casual players might find overwhelming. Compared to Spartans’ simple structure, PartyPoker demands more speed, volume, and game-specific grinding. For players who just want to play and withdraw winnings without chasing a gamified reward system, PartyPoker doesn’t deliver the easiest experience. Spartans Sets the Standard for Cashable Casino Bonuses When placed side by side with BetMGM and PartyPoker, Spartans clearly offers the easiest bonus to cash out casino players can use with confidence. Rather than complex wagering rules or hidden limits, Spartans provides upfront clarity. From the 35x playthrough to the 10x payout cap and visible game exclusions, every element is built around fairness. Players can focus on actual gameplay instead of navigating tricky bonus mechanics. BetMGM asks too much in terms of wagering volume and restricts game variety, while PartyPoker complicates the process with missions and limited liquidity. Spartans simplify everything. With fast crypto payments and straightforward conditions, players have a real chance to turn bonus funds into withdrawable winnings. It’s not about handing out the biggest numbers, it’s about making those numbers realistic. For those looking to play smart and actually cash out, Spartans stand as the top option.

49720470,https://thecoinrise.com/solana-rallies-4-eth-volume-nears-240b-but-blockdags-10-btc-auction-steals-the-spotlight/,1754614841,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/49720470.jpeg,"Solana Rallies 4%, ETH Volume Nears $240B, But BlockDAG’s 10 BTC Auction Steals the Spotlight",https://thecoinrise.com/solana-rallies-4-eth-volume-nears-240b-but-blockdags-10-btc-auction-steals-the-spotlight/,"As capital rotates across the top crypto for 2025, a clear trio has emerged: Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), and BlockDAG (BDAG) . Each is registering a headline-worthy breakout—but only one is fundamentally shifting the investment narrative. Solana surged 4.05% to $168.48 after Artelo Biosciences became the first pharmaceutical firm to commit $9.475 million of its treasury to SOL. Meanwhile, the latest Ethereum (ETH) recent update reveals July’s on-chain volume surged to nearly $240 billion—its highest since December 2021. Yet, the loudest buzz is around BlockDAG. With over $364 million raised, a 10 BTC auction in play, and a price set to jump 17x on August 11, BDAG is no longer just a presale—it’s the market’s main event. And the window to act is closing fast. Solana (SOL) Price Surge Sparks Institutional Interest Solana’s 4% rally to $168 was more than just a market bounce, it was driven by institutional confidence. Artelo Biosciences became the first pharmaceutical firm to commit part of its treasury to SOL, allocating $9.475 million in a move that could influence other biotech players eyeing digital asset diversification. Technically, Solana is flashing bullish signals. The price rebounded cleanly from the lower Bollinger Band at $156.83, while MACD crossover indicators point toward a possible continuation. With volume backing the move, $180 is the next key resistance, and a breakout there could open a path toward $185 or even $190. Beyond price action, the Solana ecosystem is expanding. Solaxy, the first Layer-2 on Solana, is nearing mainnet launch and offers up to 70% staking APY. That momentum reinforces Solana’s reputation for scalability. Still, BlockDAG presents a sharper value proposition. With entry prices still low, broader infrastructure, and stronger upside, the smart capital is watching BDAG closely. Ethereum (ETH) Recent Update Shows Revival at Scale Ethereum isn’t sitting out this cycle either. July’s on-chain data shows that ETH processed over $238 billion in transaction volume, a 70% jump from June and the highest since its December 2021 peak. It also logged 46.67 million transactions, surpassing its previous monthly high set during the last bull cycle. That level of activity signals real demand. With ETH trading at $3,700 and breaking into multi-year highs, the bullish momentum now has fundamental support. The seven-day moving average of Ethereum transactions reached 1.64 million, just below its all-time peak, while active addresses hit 17.55 million, the highest since May 2021. Investors are watching for continued momentum as Ethereum’s L2 ecosystem expands and staking rates hold firm. Still, with its valuation already running hot, it’s less about catching the next 5x and more about long-term positioning. That’s precisely why eyes are drifting toward BlockDAG, where the runway for exponential growth is far longer and cheaper. BlockDAG’s 17x Opportunity, 10 BTC Auction, and Viral Momentum While Solana and Ethereum are posting gains, BlockDAG is rewriting the script entirely. The presale has now raised more than $364 million, and the clock is ticking: its discounted $0.0016 Global Launch release price expires on August 11, after which it jumps 17x to $0.0276 (Batch 29 rate). With a confirmed launch price of $0.05, the near-term upside is clear and measurable. Buyers entering before the August 11 cutoff are automatically enrolled in BlockDAG’s 10 BTC Auction. The more a user spends, the higher their odds of winning a share of the Bitcoin prize pool. It’s a clever incentive that’s driving even more volume into the platform ahead of the price jump. BlockDAG is far from a meme play. It’s backed by infrastructure: Dashboard V4 just went live, allowing real-time charting and simulated trading, while the X1 mining app now has 2.5 million users globally. Exchange listings are also locked in with five top-tier platforms, including MEXC, BitMart, XT.com, CoinStore, and LBank. What sets BlockDAG apart, however, is its architecture. Combining blockchain with DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) technology, BDAG delivers high-speed scalability, EVM compatibility, and a low-code smart contract builder. This mix positions it as not just another Layer-1, but a multi-use ecosystem with real-world performance baked in. If BlockDAG hits its projected target of $0.05 post-launch, today’s $0.0016 entry represents an over 3,000% return; and that’s just at the first listing. While SOL and ETH chase new highs, BDAG offers the one thing investors crave most: asymmetric upside at the ground floor. The Bottom Line The crypto market rarely moves in sync, and this week proves it. Solana’s 4% surge is backed by real adoption, Ethereum’s $240 billion July confirms its dominance, and both show strong potential in 2025. Yet neither offers the raw upside of BlockDAG. With over $364 million raised, a 10 BTC auction running, and a 17x discount set to vanish by August 11, BlockDAG isn’t just participating in this cycl; it’s leading it. The platform’s real infrastructure, including the X1 app, Dashboard V4, and exchange presence, makes it far more than a speculative flyer. For those scanning the top crypto for 2025, Solana and Ethereum remain strong bets. But if you’re looking for maximum return on capital in the next major wave, BlockDAG is the one stealing the spotlight, and for good reason.

With many meme-focused names losing steam, a few projects are steadily gaining traction and earning more attention in research discussions. Below are four names often ranked as the best crypto coins for 2025, starting with a presale that some say is still quietly undervalued. 1. Cold Wallet (CWT): Analysts See a 37x Gap Before Listing Cold Wallet is emerging as one of the best crypto coins for 2025, with analysts calling it a “rare high-upside setup.” Recently listed on CoinMarketCap, it is now in stage 16 of 150 in its presale, selling at $0.00924, while the launch price is locked at $0.3517. That’s a gap suggesting a 37x jump before it even reaches public markets. Cold Wallet lets users earn CWT as cashback on everyday actions like gas fees, swaps, and on/off-ramp moves , all through a self-custody, non-custodial wallet. The acquisition of Plus Wallet, with over 2 million users, has boosted its growth plans. With over $5.7 million raised, Stage 16, and an overall ROI of 4,900%, early-stage watchers say such pricing gaps are rare this late in a presale. Those entering in Cold Wallet ($CWT) at $0.00942 could see returns of about 3,633% if it lists at $0.3517. Its CoinMarketCap listing has already sparked more buying, and several community analyst groups have added it to their “long-term” watch lists. 2. Chainlink (LINK): Real-World Oracle Demand Builds Long-Term Trust Chainlink remains a regular mention among the best crypto coins for 2025 thanks to its key role in blockchain data delivery. As DeFi and smart contracts spread across multiple chains, Chainlink’s oracle system is seen as essential infrastructure. LedgerScope’s Felix Orman noted in June, “Chainlink has the first-mover advantage in decentralized oracles, but the real edge is in integrations; more than 1,800 projects now use it.” The Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is awaited by multi-chain builders, while enterprise use from SWIFT and Vodafone adds long-term credibility. Though LINK might not offer extreme early-stage style gains, its consistent progress and critical network role keep it a strong choice for those seeking reliable infrastructure exposure heading into 2025. 3. Stellar (XLM): Payment Network Finds New Institutional Backing Stellar is sometimes overlooked in the layer-1 conversation, but analysts say it belongs on the best crypto coins for 2025 list due to fresh interest from the traditional finance space. Deals like the Stellar Development Foundation’s partnership with MoneyGram and USDC integration have turned it into a real tool for remittances and payment rails worldwide. Quant researcher Angela Li said, “Stellar is expanding its on-ramp network in regions where banking is broken. This is more fintech than just blockchain.” With low-cost transactions and KYC-ready design, it’s well placed as a bridge between fiat and crypto for regulated payments. While price growth has been modest in recent quarters, rising developer activity and adoption in cross-border use could push recognition as bigger financial platforms bring it into their systems. 4. Cardano (ADA): Careful Growth and New dApps Could Shift the Trend Cardano remains a frequent topic in best crypto coins for 2025 discussions, with its focus on peer-reviewed progress and formal methods setting it apart. Its slower development pace compared to faster chains has also made it appealing in markets facing tighter regulation. Technical analyst Jared White says, “ADA’s strength is in its careful but complete design. With the extended UTXO model and Hydra update, it’s now ready for real-world dApps.” New DeFi projects like Liqwid and Indigo Protocol are adding gradual activity, though total value locked still lags behind top competitors. Analysts agree that if clearer rules arrive in 2025, Cardano’s academic roots and methodical build could make it a preferred platform for those wanting compliance-ready options. Final Word From early presales like Cold Wallet, offering a rare utility setup with a 37x price gap, to established infrastructure names like Chainlink, Stellar, and Cardano, analysts suggest the shift is toward utility over hype when picking the best presale crypto coins for 2025 . Each one here serves a key Web3 role , self-custody, data oracles, payments, or smart contracts , and all share a clear path to adoption. For long-term portfolios, mixing early-stage chances like CWT with strong foundations like LINK and ADA could create a balanced approach with both upside and proven utility.

49720168,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=186836,1754615411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/49720168.jpeg,Unlocking Crypto Investment: 90 Million Americans Gain Access to Digital Assets,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/invest-crypto-access-americans/,"BitcoinWorld Unlocking Crypto Investment: 90 Million Americans Gain Access to Digital Assets Exciting news is emerging for millions of American workers eager to invest in crypto . Recent statements from David Sacks, the White House’s AI and crypto czar, suggest a significant shift. A new executive order by President Donald Trump is poised to grant over 90 million U.S. workers a direct path to alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies. This development could reshape the landscape of personal finance and crypto investment across the nation. What’s Driving This New Path to Invest in Crypto ? The announcement by David Sacks, as reported by Cointelegraph on X, highlights a pivotal moment. The executive order aims to broaden the investment horizons for a substantial portion of the American workforce. Essentially, it seeks to empower everyday Americans by providing them with more choices for their retirement savings and long-term financial planning. This initiative recognizes the growing interest in digital assets and their potential role in a diversified portfolio. For decades, traditional investment vehicles have dominated retirement plans like 401(k)s. However, the rapid evolution of the cryptocurrency market has sparked a demand for greater access. This executive order could be a direct response to that demand, potentially opening doors for millions who previously found it challenging to incorporate crypto into their official retirement accounts. It signifies a governmental acknowledgment of crypto’s increasing relevance in the broader financial ecosystem. Understanding the Potential of 401(k) Crypto Allocation The financial implications of this move are substantial. Bitwise research analyst Ryan Rasmussen previously estimated that even a modest 1% allocation of 401(k) assets to crypto could inject a staggering $80 billion into the market. Consider the sheer scale: 401(k) plans represent a massive pool of capital, designed to secure workers’ futures. Allowing even a small percentage to be directed towards cryptocurrencies could lead to significant institutional adoption and liquidity. Increased Market Liquidity: A new influx of capital from 401(k) plans could enhance the overall liquidity of the crypto market. Broader Adoption: Mainstream access through retirement accounts could accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrencies as legitimate investment vehicles. Diversification Benefits: For individuals, adding crypto might offer diversification benefits, potentially enhancing portfolio returns, though it also introduces new risks. However, it is crucial to approach crypto investment with a clear understanding of its volatility and risks. While the potential for growth is attractive, careful consideration and professional advice remain paramount for any investment decision, especially when dealing with retirement funds. Navigating the Landscape of US Crypto Access While the prospect of 90 million Americans gaining access to digital assets is exciting, there are complexities to consider. Regulatory clarity has long been a challenge for the crypto industry in the United States. This executive order, therefore, could be a step towards providing a more defined framework for how cryptocurrencies integrate into traditional financial systems. Clear guidelines are essential for both investors and financial institutions. Furthermore, education will play a vital role. Many individuals may be new to the concept of cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology. Financial advisors and educational resources will be crucial in helping these potential new investors understand the nuances, risks, and opportunities associated with this asset class. Empowering individuals to make informed decisions will be key to the success of this expanded access. Beyond 401(k)s: Expanding Digital Assets Horizons While the focus is currently on 401(k)s, this executive order could symbolize a broader shift in how the U.S. government views cryptocurrencies. It suggests a move towards integrating them into mainstream finance rather than isolating them. This broader acceptance could pave the way for other forms of crypto investment , such as expanded access in other retirement accounts or more streamlined processes for direct crypto purchases. The ripple effect could extend beyond individual investors, influencing institutional interest and innovation within the blockchain space. As more Americans get a direct path to invest in crypto , it could foster a more robust and mature digital asset ecosystem, encouraging further development and utility for various cryptocurrencies. In conclusion, the potential for 90 million Americans to gain access to crypto investment through their 401(k)s marks a transformative moment. This executive order could significantly boost US crypto access , inject substantial capital into the market, and accelerate the mainstream adoption of digital assets . While opportunities abound, responsible investing and continuous education will be essential for navigating this exciting new frontier.

The jump was powered by Cash App’s lending growth and steady payment volumes across its platforms. The company had previously forecast $9.96 billion in gross profit for 2025. News of the appointment caused Block shares to rise 8% in after-market trade in New York on Thursday. Cash App, Block’s peer-to-peer payment and banking platform, pulled in $1.50 billion gross profit for the quarter—an increase of 16% YoY—topping an expected $1.42 billion by analysts. The signature player here was Borrow, a short-term lending service, Cash App said, which sold faster than anticipated. Card spending also supported the buy now, pay later features. Monthly active users remained steady at around 57 million, but the company expects revenue to climb without adding more users. Chief Financial Officer Amrita Ahuja said revenue acceleration in the year’s second half does not depend on active user growth. Square and efficiency bolster results Square , Block’s merchant-facing division, continued to deliver solid gains in the second quarter, reinforcing its role as the company’s second major growth engine alongside Cash App. The business, best known for its sleek card readers and point-of-sale systems used by coffee shops, restaurants, salons, and small retailers, saw gross payment volume (GPV) climb 10% year-over-year to $64.25 billion. While this fell slightly short of Wall Street’s $66.33 billion forecast, analysts noted the growth was still strong given the challenging macroeconomic environment and tighter consumer spending in some sectors. Higher transaction volumes and broader adoption of value-added services lifted Square’s gross profit 11% over last year. The company’s buy now, pay later (BNPL) service, which enables customers to split payments into installments, is seeing strong growth across merchants and consumers on the platform, driving better sales and customer retention for sellers. Square has also started shipping its Bitcoin mining chips to clients as part of a wider strategy targeting the cryptocurrency infrastructure market over the long term. I say go, and the revenue on these deliveries should be more material as the year progresses. Operation efficiency is also increasingly a core focus for Block, with Square playing a large part. Artificial intelligence tools for product development, fraud detection, personalized merchant servicing, and lower operational costs have been deployed across the company. The savings from all of this will be funneled into Block’s pockets to redeploy that money toward growth initiatives, which the company hopes can increase margins. Perhaps most importantly for Square, the future of the business is clouded in as much uncertainty as ever: Bloomberg Intelligence analysts identified three main growth catalysts for the business -deepening engagement among Cash App users to drive transaction frequency higher, growing Square’s merchant base across not only small and mid-sized businesses but larger enterprises and in geographies outside of its existing markets, and optimizing operations to further profit without sacrificing innovation. If macroeconomic conditions stabilize and small-business spending rebounds in those areas, Block could be better poised for growth starting in 2025. Firm stays upbeat despite headwinds Block reported an adjusted net profit of $385 million for the second quarter, or 62 cents per share, up from 47 cents a year ago. Revenue came in at $6.82 billion, matching market expectations. The company has also enjoyed a boost in investor confidence since joining the S&P 500 in July. CEO Jack Dorsey also addressed the rise of stablecoins, noting their role in remittances. He said if stablecoins became more common in payments, Block would consider entering the space, but he stressed that Bitcoin remains the company’s focus. Dorsey said Bitcoin remained unique as it was entirely new and possessed qualities no stablecoin possessed. He added that the company’s goal was to make Bitcoin a native currency of the internet and to see it used as everyday money. He noted that Block’s strong quarter underscored its position as a leader in digital payments, with growth in Cash App lending and an expanding Square merchant base. He focused on Bitcoin, signaling confidence in the company’s future — a sentiment reflected in Wall Street’s reaction. Get seen where it counts.

While ETH continues to dominate headlines, all eyes are now on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi protocol under $1 that’s gaining serious traction for its innovative approach to asset lending. Mutuum Finance is in Phase 6 and is presently valued at $0.035. The next price increase will bring Mutuum Finance to $0.04 in phase 7. Investors in this stage of investment will earn a return on investment of 71.43% once the token goes live at $0.06. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has crossed more than $14.1 million raised and welcomed more than 14,900 distinct holders. Mutuum Finance could outpace Ethereum with 55x gains. Ethereum Eyes $5,000 as Utility Tokens Gain Spotlight Ethereum is currently trading around $3,660, consolidating above key support in the $3,550–$3,700 range after rebounding from recent highs near $3,800. Institutional flows remain robust, with over $150 million in spot ETH ETF inflows recently recorded, even as futures sentiment stays cautious, signaling renewed confidence in the network’s trajectory. Experts forecast ETH could reach $5,000 in Q3 2025, supported by shrinking exchange supply, DeFi demand, and upcoming protocol upgrades. While Ethereum remains central to the DeFi ecosystem, some investor attention is shifting toward smaller utility-based protocols like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Reveals Phase 6 of Its Presale Mutuum Finance has concluded Phase 5 of its presale and advanced into Phase 6, where its tokens can be bought at $0.035. Its next price increase will be another 14.29% to drive the price of its tokens up to $0.04. Early adopters shall be rewarded with a 71.43% ROI when the token reaches $0.06 upon listing. MUTM presale has already raised over $14.1 million and accumulated over 14,900 individual holders. Mutuum Finance Joins Hands with CertiK to Unveil $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance is in collaboration with CertiK to bring onboard a Bug Bounty Program. The program’s reward fund stands at $50,000 USDT. Four categories i.e. low, minor, major and critical will be rewarded under the program. The program shows the vision of Mutuum Finance to establish community-driven, secure and sustainable ecosystem. The project has also been rigorously audited by Certik on user fund security and security of the blockchain. This is a milestone on Mutuum Finance’s vision for an open institution-grade DeFi protocol. Mutuum Finance Launches MUTM Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is giving away a $100,000 giveaway where the users will be rewarded in $10,000 MUTM tokens. Its recently launched leaderboard system will also reward the top 50 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) holders. Ethereum may be headed toward $5,000, but the spotlight is starting to shift. With over $14.1 million already raised and nearly 14,900 early adopters on board, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a serious contender in the next wave of DeFi growth. Its unique dual-lending model, strong security focus, and early-stage value under $0.04 have investors eyeing potential 55x gains, returns that even ETH might struggle to match. As the next bull run gains momentum, it may not be the big names that lead, it could be the builders like MUTM.

Public companies are actively accumulating SOL to earn passive income and gain long-term exposure to the network. Staking rewards of up to 8% are making Solana attractive to treasury strategists. The move marks a shift in how companies manage idle capital in the digital space. Instead of just holding Bitcoin, they are now diversifying into proof-of-stake ecosystems that offer real returns. Three public companies have this week disclosed major SOL acquisitions. Their holdings combined now exceed 3.5 million tokens. As this trend gains momentum, investors are also turning their attention to early-stage opportunities—most notably MAGACOIN FINANCE. Public Companies Move Big into Solana Three publicly listed companies—Bit Mining, Upexi, and DeFi Development Corp.—are leading the current wave of Solana accumulation. Each has made major purchases and plans to stake their holdings to generate yield. Bit Mining, once focused mainly on Bitcoin operations, bought 27,191 SOL this week for $4.5 million. The firm launched its own validator and announced plans to raise $300 million to build out its Solana treasury. This move signals a deliberate pivot toward proof-of-stake assets. Upexi, a U.S. supply chain and brand management company, made the largest move. It raised over $200 million in July and increased its SOL holdings from 735,692 to more than 2 million. Most of the tokens have already been staked, earning the company around $65,000 daily in passive income. DeFi Development Corp., formerly Janover, also joined the race. The company added another 110,466 SOL to its reserves, bringing its total to over 1.2 million tokens. It now plans to stake the full treasury across multiple validators. The firm’s shift to blockchain began after its acquisition by former Kraken executives. These companies now control over $590 million in SOL. Their strategies reflect a growing shift toward blockchain-based yield models in corporate treasury management. XRP Attracts Quiet Institutional Attention XRP is building its own case for institutional inflow as Solana pivots to staking. Ripple’s recent regulatory clarity in the U.S. has helped restore confidence in the token. Analysts note that the real-world use case of XRP in global payments makes it a strategic choice for institutions that want exposure without high volatility. If market conditions stabilize, XRP could attract more capital from investors rotating out of Bitcoin and into altcoins with regulatory strength. MAGACOIN FINANCE Named the Best Crypto Presale As corporate capital crowds into large-cap assets, some investors are looking earlier in the cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention in that space. Analysts have named it the best crypto presale for the upcoming bull cycle because of its low entry point and focus on decentralized finance. Unlike hype-driven projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE has a roadmap focused on governance tools, staking utilities, and integration into emerging DeFi ecosystems. Its early-stage profile appeals to traders looking to front-run the next wave of adoption. Conclusion Companies are no longer just holding Bitcoin. They’re building active, yield-focused treasuries around Solana. XRP is quietly gaining favor as regulatory clarity improves. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers early exposure to those seeking value ahead of the next bull market rotation.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Manufacturers of bitcoin (BTC) mining equipment won't be feeling the pinch of a new round of tariffs the White House has imposed on the semiconductor industry, as the largest chip manufacturers like TSMC and Samsung have an exemption from the new rules due to their investments in the U.S. Officials in Taiwan confirmed to local press that TSMC would have an exemption from the 100% tariffs because of its facilities in Phoenix, which opened in 2023. South Korean officials also confirmed that Samsung would have a similar exemption because of its fabs in Texas . TSMC and Samsung manufacture the Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) designed by BTC mining companies like Bitmain, Canaan, and Bitdeer. Bitmain and Canaan didn't respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk. A spokesperson for Bitdeer confirmed that they partner with TSMC to manufacture the ASICs used for their miners, and thus wouldn't feel the pinch of tariffs. The spokesperson also said that they expect to bring online a U.S.-based factory to assemble the miners within a year. Broadly speaking, the market seems to have shrugged off the new tariffs. In Taipei, the TAIEX, an index of Taiwan's stock market, is set to open trading Friday up 2.3% with TSMC up 3% and approaching record highs. Even the targets of these tariff policies are in the green. SMIC, the Shanghai-based rival to TSMC, which lacks a U.S. facility, is up on the week in Hong Kong, outperforming the Hang Seng index. Market Movers: BTC: Bitcoin has entered a bullish cooldown after hitting a $123K all-time high, now trading at $117,386.04, with softer momentum and weaker on-chain signals pointing to short-term consolidation or mild downside risk, according to a report by CryptoQuant. ETH: Glassnode data shows short-term capital flow has shifted from Solana to Ether, with ETH/SOL at a year-to-date low and ETH/BTC breaking above its 200-day EMA for the first time in two years, as ETH trades at $3,905.42 (+6.43%) and approaches $4K, with open interest at $58B and network activity at record highs. Gold: Gold is trading at $3,387, up 0.5%, as the market weighs the impact of tariffs on India for importing Russian oil. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets opened mixed Friday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 1.18% and the Topix hitting a record 3,031.78, led by sharp gains in Nippon Chemical Industrial, Miyakoshi Holdings, J-Lease, and Japan Electronic Materials. S&P 500: Stocks rose Wednesday, with the S&P 500 up 0.73% to 6,345.06, as Apple jumped 5% on news it will boost U.S. manufacturing investment by $100B to a total of $600B over four years.

A massive £9 billion ($12 billion) crypto class action has reached the UK Supreme Court. This high-stakes case involves investors who are appealing a previous decision regarding the Binance delisting of BSV in 2019. It’s a development that could set a crucial precedent for the entire digital asset industry. What is the BSV Lawsuit All About? At its core, this legal claim is about seeking damages for alleged losses. A group of Bitcoin SV investors initiated the claim against several prominent crypto exchanges, including Binance, Kraken, Bittylicious, and ShapeShift. Their central argument revolves around the 2019 delisting of BSV. The investors believe this action prevented the token from achieving its full price potential. The case has been a long and winding road through the UK legal system. It represents one of the largest cryptocurrency-related legal claims to date. Why are Bitcoin SV Investors Challenging the Binance Delisting? The investors argue that the Binance delisting , alongside similar actions by other exchanges, constituted anti-competitive behavior. They claim these actions essentially stifled the market for BSV, thereby impacting its value and their investments. This is a common concern in the fast-evolving crypto space, where exchange decisions can significantly influence token prices. The investors initially sought substantial damages, believing they were unfairly disadvantaged. They contend that had BSV remained listed, it would have experienced significant price appreciation, similar to other digital assets during that period. The Legal Journey: Reaching the UK Supreme Court The path to the UK Supreme Court has been challenging for the Bitcoin SV investors . Their case has navigated various levels of the British legal system. Previously, the Court of Appeal largely dismissed their claim, finding in favor of the exchanges. However, the investors have shown resilience, now seeking permission to appeal that dismissal to the highest court in the UK. This pursuit highlights the determination of the investors to have their arguments heard at the highest judicial level. The decision by the Supreme Court to grant or deny permission to appeal will be a pivotal moment for this ongoing BSV lawsuit . What are the Broader Implications of This Crypto Class Action? This crypto class action holds significant weight beyond just the parties involved. If the appeal is granted and ultimately successful, it could establish a precedent regarding the responsibilities of crypto exchanges concerning token listings and delistings. This might lead to: Increased scrutiny on how exchanges make listing decisions. Potential legal challenges for future delistings across the industry. A shift in how investors view their rights when an exchange removes a token. Conversely, if the appeal is dismissed, it would reinforce the existing legal framework and potentially limit future class actions based on similar grounds. Therefore, the outcome of this BSV lawsuit is keenly awaited by market participants. The pursuit of this £9 billion legal claim by Bitcoin SV investors against major exchanges like Binance underscores the growing maturity and legal scrutiny within the cryptocurrency market. As the case reaches the UK Supreme Court, the industry watches closely. The decision will not only impact the investors and exchanges involved but could also shape the future landscape of digital asset regulation and investor protection globally.

The post was accompanied by the caption “Bitcoin vs XRP” and a direct appeal to viewers stating, “If you don’t know XRP Army, you really gotta check this out.” The video primarily focused on the environmental concerns surrounding Bitcoin mining and presented XRP’s consensus mechanism as a more energy-conscious alternative. Garlinghouse Criticizes Bitcoin’s Energy Consumption The footage showed Garlinghouse addressing the significant energy demand required for Bitcoin mining , which he said now consumes approximately one percent of global energy usage. He described this figure as a “holy shit moment”, indicating that the scale of Bitcoin’s energy consumption, particularly in light of growing environmental awareness, should be a cause for serious reflection. Garlinghouse emphasized the disconnect between Bitcoin mining practices and the ongoing push by environmental activists and organizations for greener alternatives. He questioned the logic behind continuing to expand Bitcoin’s energy consumption footprint, stating that the practice “makes no sense at all” in the context of modern environmental expectations. #Bitcoin vs #XRP pic.twitter.com/9pzRmxN0E4 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) August 5, 2025 XRP Ledger Built to Avoid Energy Waste The Ripple CEO acknowledged that the environmental foresight behind the XRP Ledger predated his involvement with the company. He credited the early architects of the XRP Ledger with recognizing the unsustainable trajectory of proof-of-work models. According to him, these engineers foresaw the exponential energy demands associated with proof-of-work mining and intentionally chose to implement a consensus algorithm that did not require high electricity usage for transaction validation. Garlinghouse explained that Bitcoin’s design necessitates increased computational effort as it nears its hard cap of 21 million coins. As more coins are mined, the difficulty level increases, leading to greater energy requirements. He described this compounding energy demand as a structural feature of Bitcoin that the XRP Ledger was specifically built to avoid. Alternative Consensus Mechanism Emphasized According to Garlinghouse’s statements, the XRP Ledger employs a different consensus model that is considerably more efficient. He described it in simplified terms but stressed that the energy implications were a key design decision from the outset.

By promoting Garlinghouse’s remarks, Rietveld drew attention to the contrast between XRP’s consensus approach and the energy-intensive process associated with Bitcoin. The video serves to reinforce the long-standing narrative within segments of the crypto community that XRP offers a scalable and environmentally viable infrastructure for digital payments, particularly when compared to legacy proof-of-work systems. While Bitcoin continues to be defended by its proponents as a decentralized and censorship-resistant monetary network, the concerns raised in the video bring renewed focus to the ongoing discourse around the environmental impact of blockchain technologies. Garlinghouse’s remarks, as shared by Rietveld, highlight a continued effort by Ripple and its supporters to position XRP and the XRP Ledger as forward-looking and sustainable components of the digital asset ecosystem.

The Case Is Over,https://timestabloid.com/big-news-for-xrp-sec-and-ripple-jointly-dismiss-appeals-the-case-is-over/,"On August 7, 2025, defense lawyer James K. Filan announced that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs Inc. had jointly filed a dismissal of their respective appeals, bringing an end to one of the most closely followed cases in the digital asset industry. Filan shared the update on X, stating, “The parties have filed a Joint Dismissal of the Appeals. The case is over.” The Joint Stipulation of Dismissal, filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, formally concludes both the SEC’s appeal and Ripple’s cross-appeal. The document, dated August 7 and signed by the legal representatives of both parties, confirms that each party will bear its costs and fees. This effectively terminates the litigation stemming from the original lawsuit filed by the SEC in December 2020 against Ripple Labs, Bradley Garlinghouse, and Christian A. Larsen. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP BREAKING: The parties have filed a Joint Dismissal of the Appeals. The case is over. pic.twitter.com/QMATRLnxnS — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) August 7, 2025 Legal Framework and Signatories The legal notice specifically cites Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 42(b)(1) as the basis for the dismissal. According to the filing, the Commission, Ripple, Garlinghouse, and Larsen have all agreed to the terms. Attorneys from Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick, as well as Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP and Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, acted on behalf of Ripple and its executives. On the SEC’s side, the document is signed by Acting General Counsel Jeffrey B. Finnell, Solicitor Tracey A. Hardin, and Appellate Counsel David D. Lisitza and Ezekiel L. Hill. The Certificate of Service, signed by Ezekiel L. Hill, certifies that all relevant parties were electronically served through the Court’s ACMS system on August 7, 2025. Impact on Ripple and XRP This joint dismissal brings closure to the long-standing legal battle, which has significantly impacted XRP’s market position and the broader regulatory outlook for digital assets in the United States. The litigation originally revolved around whether XRP constituted a security under U.S. law, with the SEC alleging that Ripple conducted unregistered securities offerings. Ripple disputed the claims, leading to years of litigation, several partial rulings, and a great deal of public interest. With the appeals now officially withdrawn, there will be no further judicial review of prior rulings from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, presided over by Judge Analisa Torres. That decision had partially favored Ripple, ruling that XRP sales on public exchanges did not constitute securities transactions, though it held Ripple accountable for certain institutional sales.

Market participants had long awaited a resolution, as the case’s outcome had implications for token classification and enforcement actions across the sector. Responding to the announcement, the XRP community expressed a range of reactions online. One X user, Tailan, commented humorously, “I was used to this case now is going to be a bit boring who should we fight now? Bank cartels?” As the legal uncertainty lifts, Ripple can now focus on business expansion, including its global payments network and potential U.S. regulatory advancements. The SEC, for its part, appears to be shifting its focus to other digital asset enforcement cases still ongoing in various jurisdictions. The conclusion of this case clears a major legal cloud hanging over XRP and removes a critical overhang from Ripple’s operations. The digital asset community will now closely watch how this final development influences regulatory frameworks, industry innovation, and the positioning of XRP in the evolving financial landscape.

If enacted, this landmark policy would redefine the relationship between digital assets and the US financial system. Bitcoin Steps Into The Political Spotlight Bitcoin has officially entered the hall of power, as the US President Donald Trump is preparing to sign an executive order that would prohibit banks from refusing services to Bitcoin and crypto-related companies. This move signals a major shift in the US policy and ends years of financial censorship against the crypto industry. Related Reading: Strategy Expands Bitcoin Holdings With Massive Third-Largest Acquisition According to a crypto enthusiast, Henry, with this impending order, the crypto industry appears to be getting serious respect from the White House, after years of regulatory uncertainty and political pushback. In the coming days, Henry suggests that positive developments are on the horizon, especially involving Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. This kind of attention from the highest levels of government could shake up the entire market and trigger a wave of institutional interest and volatility. If this happens, it would be more than just good news, as it would be a game-changer. Not only could it act as a major catalyst for BTC, it would also open the doors for crypto businesses to access traditional financial services, which they need for growth. Bitcoin is gaining recognition among the highest forms of governments across the world. Reports show that the Indonesian Vice President Gibran Rakabuming Raka is exploring the possibility of adding Bitcoin to the country’s national reserves, according to a recent post from Bitcoin Indonesia. The move represents a bold step toward integrating digital assets into sovereign finance. If implemented, Indonesia would become one of the first major Asian economies to formally recognize BTC as a reserve asset, signaling a shift in how governments hedge against inflation, currency risk, and geopolitical uncertainty. The global spotlight is increasingly turning to crypto adoption at the state level. The Bhutan Government Moves $59.2 Million In BTC Several countries are engaging BTC globally at a rapid rate. In a significant and quietly executed move, the government of Bhutan has transferred 517 BTC, valued at approximately $59.2 million, to a new cryptocurrency wallet. This substantial transfer of BTC, reported by Crypto Rover on X, has sparked speculation among analysts and the crypto community about potential custody changes or strategic moves.

49722139,550903,1754618434,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49722139.jpeg,"India Escalates Crypto Tax Enforcement With Over 44,000 Notices To Traders",https://bitcoinist.com/india-crypto-tax-enforcement-44000-notices-traders/,"India’s Income Tax Department has intensified its efforts to curb tax evasion in the cryptocurrency sector, sending more than 44,000 notices to traders who failed to disclose their virtual digital asset (VDA) transactions in their income tax returns. Indian Tax Watchdog Ups The Ante In a recent session of the Rajya Sabha (Upper House of the Parliament), India’s Minister of State for Finance, Pankaj Chaudhary, revealed that the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) had launched enforcement actions against non-compliant crypto users. These include reassessment notices, surveys, and search-and-seizure operations under the Income Tax Act, 1961. To promote voluntary compliance, the CBDT has initiated targeted awareness efforts through its NUDGE campaign (Non-Intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable). Under this program, a total of 44,057 emails and messages were issued to individuals who were found to be investing or trading in crypto assets but had not reported these transactions in their tax filings. The Indian government introduced a tax on digital asset income starting in the 2022-23 financial year. Since then, taxpayers have reported approximately ₹705 crore ($80.6 million) in crypto-linked income for FY 2022-23 and 2023-24 combined. However, enforcement actions such as surveys and raids led to the discovery of an additional ₹630 crore ($72 million) in undisclosed income related to cryptocurrencies. It’s worth noting that accusations of tax evasion have been directed not only at individual taxpayers, but also at crypto exchanges. Notably, the CBDT is leveraging data analytics tools such as Non-Filer Monitoring System (NFMS), Project Insight, and its internal databases to increase oversight of crypto transactions. The report adds: These tools help cross-reference information provided in tax filings with actual transactions reported by Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) via TDS returns. Discrepancies identified through this system are followed up with enforcement actions to ensure accurate reporting and recovery of tax dues. Uncertainty Plagues India’s Crypto Ecosystem While India ranks among the top countries globally for crypto adoption, its taxation and regulatory stance have been a point of contention. The combination of a 30% tax on crypto profits and a 1% TDS on every trade has discouraged many retail traders and investors. As a result, a number of crypto exchanges in India have reported dwindling trading volumes, leading to businesses announcing layoffs or getting shut. Earlier this year, crypto exchange Bybit announced it was temporarily halting its operations in India due to lack of regulatory clarity. In contrast, neighbouring country Pakistan has shown a more receptive approach toward digital assets. Earlier this year, the South Asian country stated that it would tap excess energy to mine more BTC. Similarly, the UAE continues to cement its place as the global hub for crypto businesses. In November 2024, the nation eliminated Value Added Tax from all transactions in cryptocurrency exchanges and conversions. Despite these challenges, there are signs that India may be reassessing its approach. In July 2025, Pradeep Bhandari, spokesperson for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), called on the government to explore creating a national Bitcoin reserve, suggesting potential long-term interest in integrating crypto into the financial system. Adding to the momentum, Coinbase, the largest US-based crypto exchange, is set to re-enter the Indian market later this year, signaling that global firms remain optimistic about India’s long-term crypto potential, even amid short-term uncertainty. At press time, BTC trades at $116,720, up 1.2% in the past 24 hours.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto taxation|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|Income tax department|india|India Crypto Tax|Tax Evasion,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-08 02:00:34

Pete Bannon, the company’s chip and Dojo supercomputer chief, has departed after nearly a decade of service. He joined Tesla in 2016 from Apple, where he had been a key figure in designing the company’s A-series chips. At Tesla, Bannon became instrumental in building the company’s custom silicon capabilities, overseeing projects to help define the automaker’s AI ambitions. Bannon’s most high-profile responsibility was leading the development of Dojo, Tesla’s in-house supercomputer designed specifically for artificial intelligence training. He reported directly to CEO Elon Musk and was considered central to Tesla’s strategy to reduce reliance on external AI hardware providers like Nvidia. His departure comes as Tesla makes a significant strategic pivot. The company has decided to shut down the Dojo program entirely, dissolving the team that has been working on it for years. Engineers from the project are being reassigned to other computing and data center initiatives within Tesla’s broader operations. Bloomberg was the first to break the news, later confirmed by multiple industry sources, that Musk personally ordered the change in direction. At Tesla, Dojo stood out as one of the company’s most ambitious technical projects. The system was intended to be a bespoke AI training platform driven by Tesla-designed chips that could handle the vast amount of video and sensor data collected daily from its global fleet. That data is essential to advancing Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) and robotics programs, for which Dojo was expected to be central. Tesla winding down the project represents a huge departure from its AI roadmap. The move suggests the company is stepping back from a strategy of building its own AI chips effectively from scratch toward working more closely with established chip and hardware makers. Musk orders reboot of AI strategy Elon Musk is changing Tesla’s AI strategy . Instead of developing its own computing hardware, Tesla will outsource more to vendors like Nvidia, AMD, and Samsung. The deal signed with Samsung by Tesla for its future-gen A16 AI chips is estimated at $16.5 billion. The company is also rapidly ramping up using Nvidia’s AI training high-performance GPUs. The move is a significant departure from Musk’s initial vision for Dojo, which was intended to become the AI equivalent of Tesla’s well-regarded Supercharger network and a point of differentiation that would help it outpace rivals. The Dojo project has faced technical challenges and delays since its unveiling in 2021. Many engineers who worked on the system have left the company. Around 20 have already moved on to launch an AI startup called DensityAI . Tesla’s decision to close the Dojo team effectively ends its in-house supercomputing push. The company will now channel resources into other AI infrastructure and driver-assistance projects. On the company’s July earnings call, Musk had said Tesla expected the latest Dojo version to run at scale next year. But the abrupt shutdown suggests priorities have shifted. Tesla eyes partnerships for compute needs The service marks a shift for Tesla, which, up until now, has been doing all training computing internally. Most of the heavy lifting will be done by Nvidia’s latest GPUs . AMD is also likely to contribute processing for some projects. Samsung will play a key role in Tesla’s chip production. It’s a way for Tesla to tap into state-of-the-art hardware at little risk and cost instead of just building its gargantuan supercomputers from scratch. The move comes as Tesla tests limited Robotaxi services in Austin and San Francisco. In Austin, a human safety supervisor still rides in the passenger seat. In San Francisco, human drivers operate the vehicles while users hail them through a “Tesla Robotaxi” app. Tesla has seen an exodus of senior talent this year, with the departure of Bannon adding to the list. Former Optimus robotics head Milan Kovac, software VP David Lau, and Musk’s former chief of staff Omead Afshar have also left. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Just recently, a significant Pendle PENDLE deposit of 900,000 PENDLE tokens, valued at approximately $4.65 million, was observed moving into the major crypto exchange Binance. This substantial Binance transfer immediately sparked discussions and had a notable impact on the token’s value. Understanding the Pendle PENDLE Deposit: What Happened? About half an hour before the initial reports, a multisignature wallet linked directly to the innovative Pendle protocol executed this sizable transaction. The transfer, amounting to 900,000 PENDLE tokens, was swiftly moved to Binance. This information was brought to light by crypto analytics account @EmberCN on X, providing timely insights into the blockchain’s transparent movements. Volume: 900,000 PENDLE tokens. Value: Approximately $4.65 million at the time of transfer. Origin: A multisignature wallet associated with the Pendle protocol. Destination: The prominent cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. Such large transfers from project wallets to exchanges often precede significant market events or strategic moves, making them crucial points of interest for investors tracking crypto market activity . Why the Binance Transfer Matters for PENDLE Price Surge Following this substantial Binance transfer , the PENDLE token experienced a remarkable uptick in its price. According to data from CoinMarketCap, PENDLE was trading at $5.09, reflecting an impressive 27.2% increase in just 24 hours. This sudden PENDLE price surge highlights the immediate market reaction to large-scale movements of assets. Several factors could contribute to such a rapid price response: Increased Liquidity: Depositing tokens to an exchange can prepare for increased trading volume, which might be interpreted positively by the market. Strategic Intent: It could signal an upcoming partnership, listing, or a strategic treasury management decision by the Pendle protocol team. Speculative Trading: Traders often react quickly to large transfers, anticipating potential buy or sell pressure, leading to volatility. The market often interprets such a move as a sign of forthcoming developments, leading to a surge in demand and price. Implications for the Pendle Protocol and DeFi Yield Pendle Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to tokenize and trade future yield. This innovative approach enables users to lock in future yield at a fixed rate or speculate on yield fluctuations. The recent Pendle PENDLE deposit into Binance could have several implications for the protocol’s future and its role within the broader DeFi ecosystem. For the Pendle protocol , this transfer might be part of a broader strategy: Ecosystem Development: Funds might be allocated for new initiatives, partnerships, or expanding the protocol’s offerings.

Understanding these potential reasons is key to grasping the full scope of this significant Binance transfer . Navigating Crypto Market Activity: What Investors Should Know For investors, observing significant transactions like the Pendle PENDLE deposit offers valuable insights into potential market shifts. While a PENDLE price surge is exciting, it is always important to approach such events with a balanced perspective. The crypto market is dynamic and can be volatile. Here are some actionable insights for navigating such crypto market activity : Research Thoroughly: Always look beyond the headlines. Investigate the protocol’s fundamentals, its use cases, and its long-term vision. Monitor On-Chain Data: Tools that track large wallet movements, like the one used by @EmberCN, can provide early signals. Consider Risk: High volatility can lead to significant gains but also substantial losses. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversify: Spreading investments across different assets can help mitigate risks associated with single token movements. Staying informed and exercising caution are paramount in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency.

Sheetz, a popular convenience store chain with locations across multiple states, is offering 50% off all purchases between 3 pm and 7 pm when paid with cryptocurrency through Flexa.

Steak ‘n Shake just reported saving 50% on payment fees by using Bitcoin over credit cards. These are signs that US businesses are starting to view digital assets as not just investments but as functional payment tools. Regulatory Divergence Between the U.S. and EU Across the Atlantic, the European Banking Authority has finalized draft rules giving “unbacked” crypto assets like Bitcoin a 1,250% risk weight, meaning EU banks would need €12.5 million in capital for every €1 million in BTC holdings. While the measure may limit crypto exposure in Europe, it also formalizes Bitcoin’s place in the financial system, a step analysts say could strengthen long-term adoption. By contrast, U.S. policy is moving in the opposite direction. President Donald Trump announced plans to allow cryptocurrencies in 401(k) retirement plans, opening the door to a $9 trillion market. Ether rose 4% on the news, and crypto-related equities rallied, with Coinbase gaining 3%, Galaxy Digital 6%, and Bitmine Immersion 8%. Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz called it a “milestone” for integrating digital assets into mainstream finance. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technicals Signal Bullish Continuation From a charting perspective, Bitcoin remains in a bullish flag pattern that has been consolidating since late July’s high of $123,255. The pattern’s lower bound aligns with an upward trendline from April and the 50-day SMA at $113,154 — a key support confluence that has drawn consistent buying interest. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum is turning positive, with the daily RSI at 54 after bouncing from earlier oversold conditions. Defending the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement at $113,682 has reinforced the case for an upside move. A breakout above $117,350 could open a path back to $123,255, with further targets at $126,981 and $131,574. If $113,150 fails, however, short-term sentiment may turn cautious, exposing $110,725 and $107,768. Traders eyeing an entry may look for a high-volume move through $117,350 to confirm the breakout. Bitcoin is coiling inside a bullish flag at $116.8K, holding trendline + 50-SMA support. A breakout above $117.35 could target $123K, then $127K.

The Ethereum Foundation , a cornerstone of the blockchain ecosystem, has stepped up in a major way. They are committing to match up to $500,000 in community donations to bolster the Roman Storm legal defense . This move directly supports the co-founder of Tornado Cash, Roman Storm, who is currently navigating complex Tornado Cash legal issues in court. Why is the Ethereum Foundation Stepping Up? Hsiao-Wei Wang, the executive director of the Ethereum Foundation , publicly announced this significant commitment on X (formerly Twitter). This decision highlights the foundation’s dedication to supporting individuals facing legal challenges within the decentralized space. Furthermore, it sends a clear signal of solidarity from a prominent entity in the blockchain world. The matching fund initiative aims to provide crucial financial resources for Storm’s ongoing trial. He faces serious charges, including money laundering and sanctions violations, which stem from his involvement with Tornado Cash, a well-known crypto mixer. This support is viewed by many as a defense of core decentralized principles. What Are the Charges Against Roman Storm and Tornado Cash? Roman Storm is a co-founder of Tornado Cash, a decentralized protocol designed to enhance transactional privacy on the Ethereum blockchain. Users deposit crypto into a pool and withdraw it later from a different address, effectively obscuring the link between sender and receiver. While this technology serves legitimate privacy needs, it has unfortunately also been exploited by illicit actors. The U.S. government sanctioned Tornado Cash in August 2022, alleging its use in laundering billions of dollars, including funds stolen by North Korean hackers. Storm’s arrest and subsequent trial have sent ripples through the crypto community, raising profound concerns about developer liability and the future of crypto privacy regulations . How Will This Impact Crypto Privacy Regulations and DeFi Legal? This case extends beyond Roman Storm himself. It represents a critical test for the entire decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and the fundamental principle of financial privacy. The outcome could set powerful precedents for how governments approach open-source software development and the responsibilities of developers whose tools are used for illicit activities. Many in the crypto community view the prosecution of developers as a direct threat to innovation and the fundamental right to privacy. The Ethereum Foundation ‘s support, therefore, underscores the perceived importance of this case for the future of decentralized finance (DeFi) legal frameworks globally. It highlights the ongoing tension between regulatory oversight and the ethos of decentralization. How is the Community Supporting Roman Storm? The announcement from the Ethereum Foundation has invigorated the community’s efforts to support Storm. Already, there have been significant grassroots fundraising initiatives from various corners of the crypto world. The foundation’s matching pledge amplifies these efforts, demonstrating a collective commitment to protecting developers and defending privacy-enhancing tools. This collective action showcases the strong sense of community and mutual support within the crypto space. It is a powerful example of how the decentralized ethos can translate into real-world action when foundational principles are perceived to be under threat. Furthermore, it reinforces the idea that the community stands united against what they see as overreach. What Lies Ahead for Tornado Cash Legal Issues? The legal proceedings involving Roman Storm are complex and ongoing. The outcome will undoubtedly have far-reaching implications for developers, privacy tools, and the broader regulatory landscape. This case will likely shape future discussions around the intersection of technology, privacy, and law enforcement for years to come. As the trial progresses, the crypto world will be watching closely. The robust support from the Ethereum Foundation and the wider community will be vital for Roman Storm as he navigates these challenging legal waters. This situation emphasizes the urgent need for clearer crypto privacy regulations that effectively balance innovation with legitimate security concerns.

Ethereum Open Interest Has Gone Up By More Than 8% As explained by CryptoQuant author Maartunn in a new post on X, the Ethereum Open Interest has heated up during the past day. This indicator keeps track of the total amount of derivatives positions related to ETH that are currently open on all centralized exchanges. It takes into account for both short and long positions. Below is the chart shared by Maartunn, showcasing the recent trend in the Ethereum Open Interest. From the graph, it’s apparent that the Ethereum Open Interest has just gone up by around $1.9 billion and reached the $24.5 billion mark. This corresponds to a notable increase of 8.5%. The jump in derivatives market positions has come alongside a price rise for ETH. Generally, sharp price action like a rally attracts the attention of the masses, so speculative activity can note an uptick. The scale of the Open Interest increase, however, does stand out this time around. The cryptocurrency’s price has gone up by 4% during the past day, which, while certainly not small, is only half the rise in the Open Interest. This would indicate particularly intense speculation in the market. Historically, a spike in the indicator is something that has often led into volatility for Ethereum. The reason behind it is that new positions mean the leverage in the sector goes up. This can make mass liquidation events more probable, which tend to unravel in a volatile manner. Considering how strong the climb in the Open Interest has been relative to the asset’s price, it’s possible that sharp action could be ahead for ETH this time as well. A significant amount of liquidations related to the coin have already occurred over the past twelve hours, as data from CoinGlass shows. As is visible above, liquidations related to Ethereum have totaled at $119 million in this period. This makes ETH the coin with the largest derivatives flush, far ahead of Bitcoin’s $32 million in second place. Naturally, the majority of the liquidations have involved short positions. In total, the cryptocurrency sector as a whole has seen $284 million in liquidations during the past day, $233 million of which have come inside the past twelve hours alone. ETH Price With its latest rally, Ethereum has broken away from the rest of the market and recovered above the $3,820 mark.",Ethereum|ETH|Ethereum Derivatives|Ethereum open interest|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-08 03:00:00

The Chainlink (LINK) price outlook is becoming increasingly bullish as it aims to reclaim the $22 range. Litecoin (LTC), despite facing an ETF ruling delay, is showing signs of a strong technical setup that has analysts intrigued. But the most unexpected and aggressive move comes from Cold Wallet. Still in presale, Cold Wallet (CWT) just acquired Plus Wallet in a massive $270 million transaction. This deal not only brought in over 2 million users, but also confirmed that over 645 million CWT tokens have already been sold. With a potential 4,900% ROI from its current $0.00942 price to launch, Cold Wallet is doing more than promising; it’s delivering. Chainlink (LINK) Price Outlook Turns Bullish as $22 Comes Into View Chainlink’s rebound has flipped the narrative. With a 2.44% bounce pushing LINK to around $14.66, confidence is returning to the market. Analysts tracking the Chainlink (LINK) price outlook are now revising short-term projections upward, with targets ranging between $22 and $28 if momentum continues through the next quarter. This is a notable recovery from July lows and reflects growing belief in Chainlink’s real-world relevance. At the core of Chainlink’s value is its decentralized oracle network, which enables smart contracts to securely pull off-chain data into on-chain environments. With new integrations rolling out and institutional interest growing, LINK’s role in Web3 infrastructure keeps expanding. It remains one of the few projects that bridges traditional data with decentralized ecosystems. While crypto volatility remains a factor, Chainlink’s history of uptime, security, and ongoing development puts it in a favorable position. Should demand for reliable oracles rise, LINK may not just return to the top 10, it might lead a new wave of data-centric crypto adoption. Litecoin (LTC) Recent Update: ETF Decision Paused, But Bullish Pattern Holds The Litecoin (LTC) recent update focuses on the SEC’s delay in approving the proposed Litecoin ETF. While delays typically rattle confidence, this one hasn’t shaken LTC’s technical structure. The price continues to consolidate within a bullish flag pattern that suggests potential for an upward breakout. A confirmed move past $95 could open a run toward $110 or even $120, according to multiple technical analysts. Litecoin continues to attract attention as a reliable and efficient blockchain. Known for fast transactions and low fees, it holds many of the same traits that have kept Bitcoin popular, but operates with higher speed and greater flexibility. Its capped supply and consistent network uptime give it staying power as a hedge in the altcoin market. Despite institutional approval being postponed, underlying market behavior shows steady accumulation. If technical support remains intact and price action confirms the breakout, Litecoin could quickly return to its status as a reliable top crypto performer in the current cycle. Cold Wallet Transforms Presale Model with $270M Acquisition and Real Utility Cold Wallet isn’t just riding hype, it’s creating infrastructure. While still in Stage 16 of its presale, priced at just $0.00942, Cold Wallet has already moved over 645 million CWT coins, raising more than $5.75 million. That alone would make it notable, but the bigger story is the $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet, bringing more than 2 million active accounts into its network. This is more than a merger of names. Cold Wallet is absorbing Plus Wallet’s proven usability and integrating it with CWT-powered cashback functionality. Users now earn rewards on every gas fee, token swap, and fiat transaction, automatically and with no staking or complex onboarding. It’s a clear shift from the standard crypto presale that sells ideas without showing results. ColdWallet.com, valued at just $2 million, wasn’t the centerpiece. The value here lies in the platform’s capacity to deliver a real product to a sizable audience before hitting public markets. As the user migration finalizes, full access to the Cold Wallet rewards system becomes available without delay. This kind of rollout, with features, functions, and users in place, is rare in the presale space. All indications suggest that Cold Wallet is preparing for aggressive expansion post-launch. With a structured roadmap, active user base, and embedded earning mechanisms, it’s setting a new standard for self-custody crypto solutions. This isn’t a theoretical play; it’s one of the top crypto performers stepping into the spotlight with proof already in hand. Who’s Really Leading the 2025 Crypto Field? Chainlink and Litecoin are both showing clear signs of life. The Chainlink (LINK) price outlook continues to climb, backed by renewed confidence in its oracle utility. The Litecoin (LTC) recent update, although clouded by ETF delays, still points to an imminent technical breakout if resistance breaks. But Cold Wallet is moving differently. While others wait for catalysts, Cold Wallet has created its own. A $270 million acquisition during crypto presale , over 645 million tokens sold, and a live reward ecosystem make it a standout. Where most projects offer roadmaps, Cold Wallet offers working features, real users, and a strong ROI pathway. For anyone watching the rise of top crypto performers, Cold Wallet is more than just a name to know; it’s a real-time shift in how presales can work when execution leads the way.

Ethereum (ETH) is showing signs of institutional-led growth as accumulation continues and reserves top $10 billion. Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains one of the highest trending cryptos, but its July rally now faces technical resistance and potential reversal. And then there’s BlockDAG , a project still in its presale phase, yet already functioning with a live dashboard, mining tools, and a growing user base exceeding 2.5 million. As investors explore what’s real, what’s peaking, and what still has room to grow, BlockDAG presents a structurally sound alternative with actual utility and a favorable entry point. This article compares the current state of Ethereum and Shiba Inu to BlockDAG’s fundamentals and ROI potential to explain why it’s attracting early participants ahead of its launch. Ethereum (ETH) Price Rally News Ethereum is gaining traction with institutional support driving its current rally. Whale wallets added over 833,000 ETH , valued at more than $3 billion , in recent accumulation waves, pushing ETH beyond $3,700 . Even more notably, Ethereum’s combined reserves across regulated custodians and institutional wallets have now exceeded $10 billion . The catalyst appears to be growing interest in ETH-based spot ETFs, such as BlackRock’s ETHA product, and continued demand from DeFi and staking ecosystems. From a structural standpoint, ETH’s chart remains bullish, with analysts targeting a potential run toward $6,000 if current levels hold. That would mark a new cycle high for the network and reinforce Ethereum’s position as a resilient Layer 1 protocol. However, at its current maturity and price, Ethereum’s upside, while promising, is no longer early-stage. The opportunity now lies in whether it can sustain momentum in the face of tightening liquidity across broader markets. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Technical Hurdles Shiba Inu’s July surge was among the strongest short-term moves this year, briefly rising over 30% . But it now faces a familiar challenge: sustaining momentum through resistance. SHIB’s current price structure is trapped in a descending channel , characterized by lower highs and lower lows. Unless it breaks out of that formation, analysts warn the July gains could quickly erode. Technical indicators show RSI in the overbought zone, hovering around 78, while exchange reserves have climbed, suggesting whales may be positioning to take profits. Without reclaiming structural support and resistance zones, SHIB risks fading back toward its pre-rally levels. While it remains a high-volume, highly searched token, technical strength and upside clarity remain limited. Traders are watching closely, but the path forward demands a decisive breakout. BlockDAG: The Highest Trending Crypto with Real Utility and ROI Structure In contrast to ETH’s maturity and SHIB’s technical limitations, BlockDAG offers something fundamentally different, a live, utility-driven ecosystem before the token even launches . The presale has already crossed $364 million , with the current $0.0016 price available until August 11 . This presale isn’t operating on speculation; it’s being driven by user participation, functional tools, and a model built for sustained engagement. Dashboard V4 is already live, simulating real exchange functionality. Users can view charts, place simulated trades, and track wallet balances, creating familiarity with trading mechanics well before listing. It’s designed to replace static presale portals with dynamic user experience. The X1 mobile miner , adopted by over 2.5 million users , lets participants simulate daily mining, offering 20 BDAG/day in a gamified format. Its hardware counterpart, the X10 , has been demoed producing up to 200 BDAG/day , creating a layered mining system that’s both accessible and scalable. BlockDAG’s underlying architecture is also built for long-term performance. It combines blockchain security with DAG efficiency, enabling transaction speeds between 2,000 and 15,000 TPS . The system will support smart contracts, dApps, and eventual cross-chain capabilities, giving it the adaptability of a modern Layer 1 chain with a broader user funnel. But one of the clearest investor motivators is the ROI math . At the current price of $0.0016 : If BDAG lists at $0.05 , early buyers would see a 3,025% return At $1 , ROI increases to 62,400% If it reaches $10 , the return climbs to 624,900% These projections are not theoretical stretch goals, they’re straightforward calculations based on today’s pricing structure. With no vesting applied to current buyers and 20 exchange listings already confirmed, the liquidity path is defined and immediate. Gamified mechanics like Buyer Battles and the 10 BTC Auction add additional buying incentives, awarding unsold token allocations or BTC rewards to top daily participants. These systems sustain community activity and reinforce BlockDAG’s appeal beyond passive investing. Where Ethereum reflects stability and Shiba Inu reflects volatility, BlockDAG stands as a functional growth engine, engaging users now while offering asymmetric upside upon launch. The project’s clear roadmap, working tools, and growing network suggest it’s not just the highest trending crypto today, but one of the most structurally compelling new assets entering the market in 2025. The Last Line Ethereum’s fundamentals are strong, driven by institutional support and ETF interest, but its upside is increasingly priced in. Shiba Inu, while still trending, faces resistance and lacks structural confirmation for further gains. BlockDAG, however, presents a balanced opportunity that blends real-time user engagement, technical scalability, and unmatched presale ROI potential. With $364 million raised, a token price of $0.0016, and millions already participating through Dashboard V4 and mobile mining, BlockDAG is not just gaining attention, it’s earning it. For investors looking beyond headlines and into functional value, BlockDAG is the clear standout in 2025’s high-potential crypto landscape.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP are all struggling to maintain recent support levels. Traders are growing cautious as the expected ETF decision remains elusive. Prices are dropping across the board. Risk sentiment is shifting fast. Bitcoin’s fall below its support level has dragged down most altcoins. Ethereum is losing ground despite strong fundamentals. XRP has slipped after a period of relative strength. Analysts now warn of another leg lower if key support levels break. As the market cools off, investors are already eyeing a new entrant—MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin Struggles to Hold Key Levels Bitcoin’s sharp decline has triggered alarm across the market. After briefly consolidating near $116,000, it failed to hold momentum and dropped below $115,000. The move erased recent gains and pushed traders into a defensive stance. Whale activity has dropped. On-chain data shows reduced inflows into major wallets. ETF optimism, once a strong narrative, has now faded into silence. Without an immediate catalyst, analysts believe Bitcoin could retest the $100,000 range. Leverage across futures markets has increased the downside risk. Liquidations have risen, especially among short-term traders. Bitcoin is now in a wait-and-watch zone, dependent on either regulatory clarity or external macro signals. Ethereum Falls Despite Strong Use Case Ethereum has also dropped in value following the broad market volatility. ETH has dropped below its $3,600 support level after it rallied last month. The drop has happened despite its strong developer activity and a growing Layer 2 ecosystem. Institutional flows into ETH have slowed significantly, as seen in its ETFs. Investors seem more focused on preserving capital than chasing rallies. Ethereum’s proof-of-stake model continues to reduce supply, but demand has weakened for now. Analysts agree that Ethereum remains one of the most solid projects in crypto. However, its short-term performance remains tied to broader market moves. XRP Dips as Market Cools Off XRP had a strong few weeks after its regulatory clarity in the U.S. However, that momentum has faded. The token has now fallen below its recent high of $3.5 and is testing new short-term lows of $2.95. Institutional interest has also cooled. Ripple’s expansion into global payments continues, but that hasn’t stopped price pressure. Analysts expect XRP to face more downside unless broader sentiment improves. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Visibility as Traders Shift to Early-Stage Tokens As larger assets correct, early-stage tokens are getting attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining visibility as one of the more promising projects in the presale space. Analysts have called it the best crypto presale for new investors targeting big returns, citing its low entry point, capped supply, and well-structured DeFi framework. The project includes governance tools, staking options, and future integrations into decentralized markets. Traders are actively discussing MAGACOIN FINANCE across online forums. Its fresh narrative and untapped potential are driving interest during this volatile period. Many see it as a way to gain asymmetric exposure while avoiding the high volatility of major tokens. Conclusion The crypto market is in a critical phase. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP are losing momentum as ETF hopes fade and risk-off sentiment spreads. However, even in downturns, capital finds direction. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a potential breakout in the presale landscape, offering an early-stage opportunity for investors seeking the next trend before the broader market shifts again.

The demand is rising for online casinos that deliver provable fairness, clear RTPs, and fast withdrawals. It’s no longer about flashy games with unclear outcomes or platforms that delay cashouts. Players now prioritize fairness, verified results, and the ability to claim their winnings without waiting. This review highlights the best crypto casinos offering dependable payouts. Spartans leads the list, followed by Stake.com, Roobet, BC.Game, Bet365, and 1xBet, all selected for their ability to support regular returns. 1 . Spartans: Ranks #1 for Predictable Crypto Casino Wins In 2025, Spartans stands as the top pick for crypto users seeking reliable returns. This platform focuses on fairness, transparency, and immediate crypto withdrawals. Every game; whether it’s slots, crash, or tables, displays RTP data, allowing players to see the odds and outcomes before they place a bet. Supporting major digital assets like BTC, ETH, and USDT, Spartans lets users manage both casino games and sports bets through a single wallet. This setup helps players maintain better control over their balance and betting strategies. Spartans also include built-in fairness tools, giving players proof of random outcomes and access to full payout histories. Though high-risk games are available, the platform leans toward games that offer reliable returns. Instant withdrawals prevent the temptation to keep playing while waiting for payouts, a feature that helps serious bettors avoid loss cycles. Spartans blend speed, transparency, and trust, making it the top choice for consistency-focused crypto gamblers. 2. Stake.com: Well-Known but Built for High-Risk Play Stake.com is one of the biggest names in crypto gaming, boosted by influencer campaigns and a vast game library. Its platform supports provably fair systems and speedy payouts, but the games often carry high variance. While this appeals to thrill-seekers, it can make sustained wins harder to achieve. High-volume withdrawals may be subject to manual checks, and despite its reputation, Stake.com isn’t always the go-to choice for players seeking consistency over adrenaline. 3. Roobet: High-Energy Experience, Low RTP Visibility Roobet is known for its energetic vibe and partnerships with major brands. It’s a hotspot for crash game fans and those chasing big outcomes. However, its game design usually favors risk-heavy mechanics, which can challenge players looking for regular returns. Payout speeds vary, and while the site uses provable fairness, it lacks the full RTP visibility offered by platforms like Spartans. For steady play, Roobet may not check all the boxes. 4. BC.Game: Big Game Catalog, But Delayed Payout Issues BC.Game brings variety through an extensive game catalog and ongoing bonuses. For players who enjoy chasing rewards, it’s a strong option. Still, when it comes to predictable withdrawals, it falls short. Reports of delayed payouts surface regularly, and its RTP details are often buried or unavailable. While it’s entertaining, it’s less suited to those who want measurable long-term betting outcomes. 5. Bet365: Legacy Platform Adding Crypto, Slowly Bet365 has stepped into the crypto space, expanding its payment options for digital asset users. As a legacy betting site, it offers a massive sportsbook and casino, but its crypto tools are still developing. Payout times tend to be slower than those on crypto-first platforms, and there’s limited access to RTP transparency. For crypto bettors wanting speed and clarity, Bet365 may not deliver consistently. 6. 1xBet: Global Reach, But Cashout Consistency Lags With its wide reach and acceptance of cryptocurrencies, 1xBet caters to users across different regions. It offers a mix of games and sportsbook options, but its crypto experience can feel uneven. Slow withdrawals and unclear bonus conditions have raised concerns, especially for players prioritizing consistency. While winnings are possible, the platform’s performance varies based on location and payment methods. Spartans Sets the Bar for Consistent Wins For those who value steady wins over occasional jackpots, choosing the right crypto casino matters more than ever in 2025. Transparent terms, provably fair games, and instant crypto access are key. Spartans rank first by offering all three. With fast withdrawals, high RTP visibility, and built-in fairness, it sets the standard for consistent play. While Stake.com and Roobet excel at delivering excitement, Spartans is built for players who want their skills and strategy rewarded predictably.

Millions of Americans now hold tokens in their wallets. Blocking all of it suddenly would be nearly impossible. At the same time, leaving this sector with no rules puts everyday investors in harm’s way.

He points out that tens of millions of people own digital assets today. Pulling the plug now would ripple through trading platforms, payment apps, and even major Wall Street firms. Levine argues that such a move would simply drive innovation and jobs offshore. Hostile Past Still Looms Under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, most tokens were treated as stocks. That meant they needed to register under securities laws—a process that almost no project could clear. In practice, that stance rendered crypto “illegal” in the US. Many developers and investors felt shut out. Matt Levine: “We will ban crypto” is no longer feasible for the SEC, and “we will ignore crypto because it’s not a security so not our problem” is not very attractive for the SEC. The only choice left is “we will regulate crypto, but in a way that you like. pic.twitter.com/hBFXTmMnh5 — Sar Haribhakti (@sarthakgh) August 7, 2025 According to analysts, crypto serves two purposes: it powers networks and it offers investment chances. That split role creates regulatory headaches. Many tokens act much like shares in a company, yet they also run on open software and community rules. The SEC knows how to protect stock investors, but digital coins need different safeguards. Project Crypto Signals Change Current SEC Chair Paul Atkins launched “Project Crypto” this year. The goal is to carve out faster, clearer paths for token registration. Projects that truly function as securities could follow a new, streamlined process.

A significant event involving DOGE whales has caught the attention of investors worldwide, suggesting potential shifts in the popular meme coin’s trajectory. This surge in buying activity signals a renewed interest and confidence in Dogecoin’s future, creating a ripple of excitement among enthusiasts. What Are DOGE Whales Doing? In a move that has sent ripples across the crypto community, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez reported on X (formerly Twitter) a remarkable accumulation by large holders. Specifically, DOGE whales —identified as entities holding between 10 million and 100 million DOGE—have collectively acquired a staggering 230 million Dogecoin within a single 24-hour period. This massive purchase amounts to approximately $50.85 million, a substantial sum that underscores the conviction of these major players. This kind of substantial crypto whale activity often precedes significant price movements. Whales, with their deep pockets, can exert considerable influence on market dynamics. Their actions are closely watched as indicators of underlying sentiment and potential trends. For Dogecoin, this influx of capital from large holders suggests a strong belief in its short-term or even long-term potential. Scale of Purchase: 230 million DOGE bought. Value: Approximately $50.85 million. Participants: Whales holding 10M to 100M DOGE. Timeframe: Within 24 hours. How Does This Impact Dogecoin Price? Following this considerable accumulation, the Dogecoin price has already shown a notable positive reaction. According to data from CoinMarketCap, DOGE was trading at $0.2211, marking an impressive 8.19% increase in the past 24 hours. This immediate uptick highlights the market’s responsiveness to significant whale movements. When large amounts of a cryptocurrency are bought, it reduces the available supply on exchanges, potentially driving up demand and, consequently, its price. This positive price action could also trigger a ripple effect, encouraging smaller investors to consider DOGE investment . Increased buying pressure from both whales and retail investors could create a powerful upward momentum. However, it is crucial to remember that the crypto market is volatile, and past performance does not guarantee future results. While this whale activity is a strong bullish signal, various factors can influence Dogecoin’s sustained growth. Transitioning from a mere meme coin, Dogecoin’s recent performance, bolstered by such large purchases, positions it more seriously within the broader meme coin market . This makes it an interesting asset to monitor for those looking for potential gains. What Does This Mean for Your DOGE Investment Strategy? For current and prospective Dogecoin investors, understanding this crypto whale activity is key. While it presents a bullish outlook, it’s also a reminder to conduct thorough research. Whale movements can be influential, but they are just one piece of the puzzle. Consider the broader market trends, Dogecoin’s development updates, community sentiment, and overall economic conditions. Actionable Insights for Dogecoin Investors: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on reports regarding DOGE whales and other major market players. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose, especially in volatile assets like meme coins. Diversify: While Dogecoin might be appealing, a diversified portfolio can mitigate risks. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide if your DOGE investment is for short-term gains or long-term holding based on your financial goals. The recent whale accumulation underscores the dynamic nature of the meme coin market and Dogecoin’s unique position within it. This significant influx of capital is a strong indicator of renewed confidence, but always approach the market with a well-thought-out strategy. The recent acquisition of 230 million DOGE by influential DOGE whales , valued at over $50 million, is a powerful statement of confidence in Dogecoin. This substantial crypto whale activity has already contributed to a notable increase in the Dogecoin price , demonstrating the market’s sensitivity to large-scale investments. For anyone considering a DOGE investment , this event serves as a compelling signal within the ever-evolving meme coin market . While promising, prudent investors will combine this insight with their own research and risk management principles. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Who are DOGE whales?

This double-digit gain has lifted XRP's price to $3.32, its highest level since July 28. The price upswing has been underpinned by sophisticated, anticipatory block option trades on Deribit, involving a bullish bet on volatility. Block trades are large transactions executed over-the-counter and outside of the public order book to minimise their impact on the prevailing market price of an asset. The first block trade executed Thursday involved the simultaneous purchase of 100,000 contracts of the Aug. 29 expiry call and put options at the $3.20 strike. The trader paid over $416,000 in premiums for the so-called long straddle strategy, which stands to profit from wild swings in either direction. A similar large straddle was also booked at the $3.10 strike. The large non-directional flow points to growing institutional interest in XRP, Deribit's Asia Business Head Lin Chen told CoinDesk. ""XRP has outperformed BTC this year, and we are now seeing a surge in block trades and institutional interest in XRP options. We have also launched year-end XRP options to cater to this demand,"" Chen said. Traders use straddles when anticipating a major volatility event – such as a big earnings report, a key court ruling, or a significant product launch – but are uncertain whether the impact would be bullish or bearish. The risk-reward profile of a long straddle is defined by unlimited profit potential and limited risk. Coincidentally, on Thursday, the Securities Exchange Commission and Ripple jointly agreed to drop their appeals in the Second Circuit court case, bringing to an end to a prolonged legal tussle. Ripple uses XRP in faciliating cross-border transactions. Limited loss, unlimited gain strategy The maximum loss in long straddles is capped at the total premium paid for both the call and the put. The maximum profit, however, is unlimited as the price can theoretically move up or down indefinitely. To break even, the price must move in either direction by an amount equal to the total premium paid. Options are derivative contracts designed to protect traders from bullish or bearish volatility. A call option provides cover against uptrends in the underlying asset, while a put option offers insurance against market swoons.",Markets|XRP|Options|Deribit|Markets|News,EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|BUSINESS|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-08 03:18:05

Today, we’re diving deep into the recent crypto perpetual futures liquidation data from the past 24 hours. This breakdown reveals significant shifts and offers key insights into market sentiment, especially concerning short positions across major cryptocurrencies. Let’s uncover what these numbers truly mean for traders and investors alike. Understanding Crypto Perpetual Futures Trading and Liquidations What exactly are perpetual futures, and why does their liquidation matter so much? Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they have no expiry date, making them highly popular for continuous trading. However, they come with significant risk, primarily due to leverage. A crypto liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This happens because the trader’s margin (collateral) falls below a required level, usually due to adverse price movements. When a position is liquidated, the trader loses their initial margin and any remaining funds in that position. It’s a stark reminder of the volatility inherent in perpetual futures trading . Over the last 24 hours, the market witnessed a substantial wave of liquidations, particularly impacting short positions. Here’s a quick look at the breakdown: BTC: $53.67 million, Short 84.36% ETH: $175.24 million, Short 87.83% XRP: $24.36 million, Short 76.80% These figures highlight a clear trend: the vast majority of liquidated positions were short bets, meaning traders were betting on prices to fall. When prices unexpectedly rose, these short positions were squeezed, leading to forced closures. This phenomenon, known as a ‘short squeeze,’ can further fuel upward price momentum as liquidations force traders to buy back assets to cover their positions. Why Did So Many Short Liquidations Occur? The high percentage of short liquidations indicates a market that moved against the expectations of many bearish traders. This often happens during periods of unexpected positive price action or when a significant number of traders are over-leveraged on the short side. When a sudden upward price movement occurs, these leveraged short positions quickly become unprofitable, triggering margin calls. For instance, the substantial Bitcoin Ethereum liquidation figures show that even major assets are susceptible to these rapid market shifts. Traders often use high leverage (e.g., 10x, 20x, or even 100x) in perpetual futures to amplify potential gains. However, this also magnifies losses, making even small price movements potentially catastrophic. A tiny price increase against a highly leveraged short position can wipe out an entire account. Understanding these dynamics is vital for anyone participating in the crypto market. Liquidations are not just isolated events; they can create ripple effects, increasing market volatility and sometimes leading to cascade effects where one liquidation triggers another. Navigating the Volatile Waters: Actionable Insights for Traders Given the significant crypto perpetual futures liquidation activity, what can traders do to protect themselves? First and foremost, risk management is paramount. While leverage offers the allure of amplified profits, it demands extreme caution. Consider using lower leverage, especially if you are new to perpetual futures trading or if market conditions are highly volatile. Moreover, always implement strict stop-loss orders. A stop-loss order automatically closes your position when the price reaches a predetermined level, limiting your potential losses. This is a fundamental tool for managing risk in any leveraged trading scenario. Understanding market sentiment and not blindly following the crowd can also provide an edge. Sometimes, the majority’s position becomes the most vulnerable. Finally, continuous learning about market indicators and technical analysis can help you make more informed decisions. Staying updated on news and macroeconomic factors that influence crypto prices is also crucial. Remember, the goal is not just to make profits but to preserve capital. Conclusion: A Clear Picture of Market Dynamics The recent 24-hour crypto perpetual futures liquidation data paints a vivid picture of market volatility and the inherent risks of leveraged trading. The overwhelming dominance of short liquidations across BTC, ETH, and XRP underscores the power of unexpected market movements and the consequences of over-leveraging. For traders, these events serve as a powerful reminder of the importance of robust risk management strategies and a deep understanding of market mechanics. By learning from these breakdowns, participants can better navigate the unpredictable currents of the cryptocurrency market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is crypto perpetual futures liquidation? Crypto perpetual futures liquidation is the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange when their margin falls below a certain threshold due to adverse price movements. This prevents further losses for the exchange. Why do traders use perpetual futures? Traders use perpetual futures to speculate on the price movements of cryptocurrencies without owning the underlying asset. They can also use leverage to amplify potential gains, although this significantly increases risk. What is a ‘short liquidation’ and why is it significant? A short liquidation occurs when a trader who bet on a price decrease (a ‘short’ position) is forced to close their position because the price unexpectedly increased. It’s significant because a large number of short liquidations can trigger a ‘short squeeze,’ pushing prices even higher as traders are forced to buy back assets. How can traders avoid liquidation? Traders can avoid liquidation by using lower leverage, maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts, and implementing strict stop-loss orders to automatically close positions before they reach the liquidation threshold. Does high crypto perpetual futures liquidation indicate a market top or bottom? High liquidation volumes, especially of one side (e.g., short positions), often indicate a significant price reversal or strong trend continuation. While not definitive, large liquidations can signal exhaustion of a particular market sentiment, potentially leading to a temporary bottom (after a short squeeze) or top (after a long squeeze).

The rally combines technical breakout pressure with a significant shift in the token’s fundamental narrative. The SEC settlement eliminates a multi-year litigation drag, potentially unlocking greater institutional participation in U.S. markets. Price action shows heavy accumulation above $3.10, followed by consolidation above $3.30 — suggesting strong conviction among buyers even after the initial spike. The ETF filing from SBI adds a parallel demand driver, positioning XRP for higher beta moves if spot Bitcoin ETF inflows continue. Technical Analysis Overview XRP explodes 11% higher in the 24-hour period ending August 8, rocketing from $2.99 to $3.30 in a blistering rally. The digital asset accelerates most aggressively between 19:00-22:00, obliterating multiple resistance levels. Trading volume erupts past 300 million at 21:00 alone. The session spans a $0.35 range, marking 12% volatility from $2.97 lows to $3.33 peaks. New resistance forms at $3.33. Strong demand emerges above $3.10 in the session's final hours. News Background The Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple Labs have jointly ended their appeals in the high-profile XRP lawsuit, concluding a multi-year legal battle that has clouded the token’s outlook since 2020. In a Thursday filing, the Second Circuit Appeals Court recognized the dismissal, with both sides agreeing to bear their own costs and fees. “Following the Commission’s vote today, the SEC and Ripple formally filed directly with the Second Circuit to dismiss their appeals,” Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty said on X. The resolution removes a major regulatory overhang for XRP, coming alongside other bullish developments such as Japan’s SBI Holdings filing to launch a Bitcoin-XRP ETF.

Heavy sell-offs pushed DOGE below the $0.205 support mark, triggering a spike in trading volume—at one point reaching nearly 878 million tokens exchanged in a single session. The intense volume suggests institutional exits and broader market risk aversion are both in play. Historically, August has not been kind to DOGE. Median monthly returns have been negative for three years in a row. This time is no different, with some analysts warning of further losses toward $0.185 unless DOGE reclaims key levels quickly. As bearish sentiment lingers, attention is turning to other top meme coins like XRP and SHIBA INU, where similar vulnerabilities are forming. Amid these negative trends, Analysts have shown positivity towards emerging alts like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP Struggles to Stay Above $3.00 XRP, Ripple’s flagship token, has remained a top performer in 2025 thanks to regulatory clarity, but recent price action suggests trouble may be brewing. After rebounding from a $2.80 low, XRP is once again stuck under resistance at $3.09, with support forming just below at $2.91. Analysts note that large short positions—along with sharp $50M+ whale transfers—are introducing instability. Market models suggest XRP could swing between $2.94 and $3.39 in August, but some are betting on a breakout to $4.45 if conditions turn favorable. Still, the immediate outlook remains cloudy unless volume increases and institutional sentiment recovers. A drop below $2.91 would likely trigger cascading sell-offs. SHIB Faces Ongoing Sell Pressure Despite Burns Shiba Inu (SHIB) is also under pressure. The token is hovering around $0.0000122, down more than 35% year-to-date and nearly 8% in the past day alone. Even with over 600 million tokens burned recently, sellers continue to dominate. The bearish trend has remained intact for months. Technical charts offer some hope: if SHIB can break above $0.000013 resistance, it could rally 24% to $0.000015. But with crypto-linked stocks falling and speculative capital pulling back, traders remain cautious. Most analyst models predict further weakness before any meaningful upside returns. Bullish Momentum Switches To High Growth Altcoins As DOGE, XRP, and SHIB face uncertain short-term outlooks, a rising number of investors are looking to newer assets with strong foundations and upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about names in altcoin circles. MAGACOIN FINANCE is fully audited, security-verified , and attracting a growing global community. The project’s security-first architecture and zero-tax model are drawing both whales and early investors alike. With the presale still active and a structured roadmap already underway, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers an increasingly rare chance for conviction-based entry—especially amid altcoin uncertainty. Conclusion: Market Uncertainty Builds as Whales Reposition The meme coin market is at a crossroads. DOGE is slipping, XRP is coiling for a big move, and SHIB remains locked in bearish momentum. While short-term pain persists, long-term opportunity is quietly shifting toward newer, more resilient ecosystems. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a compelling pick for long-term gains—especially as major players rotate capital toward high-conviction altcoins with real traction.

A groundbreaking collaboration has emerged, poised to shape the future of digital assets in Asia. Animoca Brands, a leader in Web3 and gaming, has joined forces with Standard Chartered Bank Hong Kong (SCBHK) and telecom giant HKT to form a new joint venture, Anchorpoint Financial. Their mission? To develop a regulated stablecoin business and, critically, to secure a Hong Kong stablecoin license . This strategic move marks a significant milestone for the region’s evolving crypto landscape. What is Anchorpoint Financial and Its Mission? Anchorpoint Financial represents a powerful alliance between diverse industry leaders. This joint venture brings together Animoca Brands’ deep expertise in blockchain and digital entertainment, SCBHK’s robust financial infrastructure and regulatory experience, and HKT’s extensive telecommunications network. Their collective goal is clear: to establish a compliant and innovative regulated stablecoin ecosystem within Hong Kong. The venture officially submitted its application for a stablecoin issuer license to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on August 1. This date is significant because it coincided with the effective date of Hong Kong’s new Stablecoins Ordinance, signaling their readiness to operate within the new regulatory framework from day one. Why is a Hong Kong Stablecoin License So Crucial? Hong Kong has been proactively positioning itself as a global hub for virtual assets, and the introduction of its Stablecoins Ordinance is a testament to this ambition. Securing a Hong Kong stablecoin license under this new framework is not just a formality; it represents a stamp of approval, indicating adherence to stringent regulatory standards. This move can: Foster Trust: A regulated environment builds confidence among institutional and retail investors. Attract Investment: Clear rules attract more traditional financial players and capital into the digital asset space. Promote Stability: Regulated stablecoins are designed to maintain their peg, offering a more reliable medium for transactions and value storage. This proactive approach to digital asset regulation Hong Kong is setting a benchmark for other jurisdictions. How Does This Benefit Animoca Brands’ Vision? For Animoca Brands, this venture into regulated stablecoins is a natural, yet significant, evolution. Known for its extensive portfolio in blockchain gaming, NFTs, and the metaverse, Animoca Brands is now extending its influence into the foundational layer of Web3 finance. The development of an Animoca Brands stablecoin through Anchorpoint Financial can: Enhance Ecosystem Utility: Provide a stable, regulated currency for transactions within their vast Web3 ecosystem. Bridge Traditional Finance: Create a compliant on-ramp and off-ramp for users and businesses, connecting the crypto world with traditional banking. Drive Mainstream Adoption: By offering a regulated product, they can appeal to a broader audience who might be hesitant about unregulated cryptocurrencies. This strategic diversification reinforces Animoca Brands’ commitment to building a comprehensive digital future. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead for Anchorpoint Financial? While the prospect of a Hong Kong stablecoin license is exciting, Anchorpoint Financial will navigate various challenges and seize significant opportunities. The regulatory landscape, though clearer, will continue to evolve. Ensuring robust compliance, managing technological complexities, and building market adoption will be key. However, the opportunities are immense: First-Mover Advantage: Being among the first to secure a license in Hong Kong offers a significant competitive edge. Global Reach: A successful model in Hong Kong could serve as a blueprint for expansion into other regulated markets. Innovation Hub: The venture can become a hub for stablecoin innovation, exploring new use cases beyond basic transactions, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and cross-border payments. Their success could pave the way for further institutional adoption of digital assets in the region. The formation of Anchorpoint Financial and its pursuit of a Hong Kong stablecoin license represents a pivotal moment for both the individual entities involved and the broader digital asset industry. This collaborative effort by Animoca Brands, SCBHK, and HKT highlights a growing trend: the convergence of traditional finance with innovative blockchain technology under clear regulatory guidance. As Hong Kong solidifies its position as a leading crypto hub with strong digital asset regulation Hong Kong , initiatives like this are crucial in fostering trust, driving adoption, and building a more robust and compliant digital economy. The future of regulated digital assets looks incredibly promising. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Anchorpoint Financial?

49726766,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=800927,1754625600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/49726766.jpeg,Bitcoin’s Comeback or Bull Trap? Analysts Warn of ‘Excessive Optimism’,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-comeback-or-bull-trap-analysts-warn-of-excessive-optimism/,"Bitcoin’s recent price action has drawn renewed attention as the asset attempts to rebound from last week’s decline. Following its July peak above $123,000, BTC experienced a downturn, hitting lows around $112,000 over the weekend. However, the latest data now suggest a gradual recovery in progress, with the cryptocurrency trading above $116,000 at the time of writing. Despite this modest rebound, some analysts are warning that underlying market sentiment could be pointing to a potential correction. Recent insights from contributors on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform highlight signs of increasing optimism among traders, particularly on Binance. The balance between long and short positions is showing a distinct bias toward the long side, a pattern historically associated with short-term reversals. Related Reading: US Delay On Bitcoin Audit Is A Bullish Red Flag, Says Strike CEO Sentiment Indicators Raise Red Flags on Binance CryptoQuant analyst BorisVest recently discussed how sentiment on Binance, based on long-short positioning, has shifted notably into positive territory. According to BorisVest, the platform’s sentiment metric has shown a surge in long positions as BTC moved from $112,000 to $115,000. He noted that such spikes often coincide with price corrections. “The clustering of green bars in the sentiment chart suggests that traders are increasingly expecting prices to rise. However, excessive optimism tends to be countered by market corrections,” he explained. The analyst added that Binance, given its dominant share in trading volume, provides valuable insight into broader trader behavior. When the long position concentration grows during price increases, it may indicate a potential round of profit-taking. BorisVest stated that a meaningful correction would likely require BTC to fall below the $110,000 mark, which could offer more favorable re-entry points for buyers while restoring balance to the market structure. Bitcoin Leverage Data Shows Mixed Signals for Recovery In a related post, another CryptoQuant analyst, Arab Chain, examined the ongoing decline in Binance’s leverage ratio. Typically, a reduction in leverage is interpreted as a signal that overleveraged traders are exiting the market, thereby reducing volatility and risk of forced liquidations. “Lower leverage suggests less speculative behavior in the short term,” Arab Chain noted, “which often contributes to more stable price action.” Related Reading: Japanese Financial Giant SBI Moves Forward With Bitcoin-XRP ETF Application However, Arab Chain also pointed out that both leverage and price have been falling in tandem, which may reflect weak demand from spot buyers. This combination indicates that the recent downturn lacks sufficient buying support, raising concerns about the strength of Bitcoin’s current recovery.

The latest Ethena price action has brought attention back to the coin, with clear signs of strong demand. On the enterprise blockchain front, VeChain’s recent developments include key protocol upgrades and a significant collaboration with Franklin Templeton. These changes reflect real-world usage and functionality. Still, in contrast to both, Cold Wallet is moving forward with a model that directly benefits the user. Instead of adding more fees, Cold Wallet gives back to users with rewards in CWT. When users cover gas fees, bridge assets, or make swaps, they earn crypto back through the app. This flips traditional usage models by turning daily crypto activity into a source of value. That core idea has become the reason Cold Wallet is gaining traction right now. Why the $0.00942 CWT Price Could Be Significantly Undervalued While many presales focus on features not yet delivered, Cold Wallet is already live and functional. Its cashback reward system is working now, providing returns to users for gas fees, bridging, and swapping. CWT is not an idea waiting to be built. It is active with a live app and an operating cashback system. At $0.00942, the current token presale price is far below the confirmed listing rate of $0.35171. That difference signals more than 40x potential if the price reaches launch levels. The crypto presale is structured across 150 phases with rising prices until it concludes. Only 10% of tokens will be unlocked at launch, with the remainder released gradually over three months to help maintain price balance. In addition, buyers get a 10% bonus, and another 5% comes from referrals. Both bonuses are sourced from a separate pool to keep the token supply stable. Cold Wallet is one of the few projects in the market today that gives rewards from active use. Users are already getting USDT back from swap activity, and future actions such as paying gas or using bridges will return CWT automatically. With reward levels reaching up to 100% for gas fees, the system directly links activity to value. With more than $5.75 million raised so far and a working reward model, Cold Wallet has positioned itself as one of the most interesting projects currently running. It is priced low, live, and already generating value through its cashback tools. ENA’s Upward Price Movement Backed by Active Demand The recent Ethena (ENA) rally is tied to both market activity and usage. Following a 13% gain on July 25, triggered in part by Arthur Hayes acquiring over $1 million in ENA, the token experienced even more growth. The combination of whale interest, new integrations with Anchorage Digital, and rising demand for stablecoins pushed the price up by 28%, even while other coins remained flat. ENA hit $0.70, with strong volume continuing and $1.00 seen as a near-term target. What makes this rise notable is the use behind it. Ethena now has over $7.7 billion locked in value. As platforms such as StablecoinX add ENA to their offerings, this strengthens real adoption. Market analysts expect the next major levels to be between $0.85 and $1.00 based on key Fibonacci chart markers. More users are joining daily, and momentum continues to grow. If you’re not watching this move, it might be one of the clearer trends to pay attention to this week. VeChain Pushes Forward with New Features and Enterprise Links VeChain’s progress has been steady, even if price action has stayed close to $0.03. This latest VeChain update includes the full rollout of the Stargate upgrade, which adds NFT staking and smoother integration for apps. In addition, the Hayabusa testnet is coming in September, aimed at lowering gas costs and improving speed. Another major development is the tie-up with Franklin Templeton to support token-based payments in their BENJI platform. These are not just plans. They are already in motion and working in real business environments. Market analyst Michaël van de Poppe recently highlighted the potential for VeChain to grow by up to 340%, based on current patterns and long-term chart outlooks that point toward $0.12. Though it’s not making constant headlines, VeChain continues to build steadily. Long-term holders and consistent development suggest it may appeal to those who value results over promotion. If you are looking for projects that are consistently active, VeChain remains one to watch. Closing View Ethena’s strong gains and VeChain’s strategic steps are good signs for both projects. ENA shows momentum through rising demand and active use. VeChain is building quietly but meaningfully with protocol improvements and big-name partnerships. Yet Cold Wallet is providing something different: value that’s already being delivered to users right now. With CWT priced at only $0.00942 and set to launch at $0.35171, the 40x potential is based on confirmed details. It doesn’t rely on future promises. Add to that the 10% referral rewards and tier-based cashback that can reach 100%, and it’s easy to see why attention is shifting toward Cold Wallet. It’s live, active, and built to reward its users without needing speculation. If ENA and VeChain are on your radar, Cold Wallet may deserve a closer look as well.

Sui is growing through BTCFi use, Binance Coin (BNB) is moving toward a $2,000 target, and BlockDAG (BDAG) , with over $364.5 million raised, is nearing the end of its key entry point. The $0.0016 GLOBAL LAUNCH release price for BDAG coins will close on August 11. After this date, the rate jumps to $0.0276, marking a 17x rise. This deadline is fixed and not a guess. While SUI and BNB show strong longer-term setups, BlockDAG combines early access with working tools. The countdown has started. Sui (SUI) Market Progress: BTCFi Boost and Ecosystem Growth SUI, which powers the Sui blockchain, is getting more attention as Bitcoin-focused DeFi (BTCFi) grows. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe has noted it as a key asset in the BTCFi trend, helped by its cross-chain aims and advanced smart contract design. After holding the $2.80 level, SUI broke past earlier limits and is now moving toward a zone just above $3.90. With more value locked and rising developer activity, the network is showing solid growth. Its system, built with high speed and the Move programming language, fits BTCFi’s need for secure, easy-to-build apps. Recent price movement shows strength: breakout followed by steady trading often points to a longer rise. Sui is still developing its cross-chain use, but many now see it as one of the best long-term crypto investments for 2025. Binance Coin (BNB) Price Setup: $2,000 Still in Play BNB has been rising throughout 2025 and now sits near a key turning point. With support around $710 to $730 and current levels close to $800, it’s testing a major barrier. Chart experts at CW and BitBull highlight a long-term pattern forming. BitBull links it to the 2020–2021 cycle, where a similar setup brought strong gains. A close above $800 could start a move to $1,000 in Q4, and possibly $2,000 later on. The support for this outlook is not just technical. Activity on the BNB Chain is rising, more users are active, and larger wallets are collecting again. Binance’s top position in global trade adds to the token’s key role in crypto activity. The breakout hasn’t happened yet, but BNB seems to be building toward it. For anyone thinking ahead, it’s worth watching closely. BlockDAG’s $0.0016 Offer Ends August 11 as 17x Entry Closes for Good While SUI and BNB continue their upward paths, BlockDAG presents a pricing edge that these projects do not currently offer. A fixed 17x entry difference and active infrastructure are both in place. The $0.0016 Global Launch release price ends on August 11. After that, the rate shifts to $0.0276, aligned with Batch 29. Though the presale will continue until it hits $600M, the early pricing gap will be gone. This is a confirmed date, not a projection. More than $364.5 million has already been collected, reflecting strong market activity. The appeal of BlockDAG goes beyond the entry point. It is backed by working features: BlockDAG has passed $364.5 million in total raised capital. As the August 11 date gets closer, activity continues to rise. Its Dashboard V4 is already live and gives users the ability to try simulated trades, track live price charts, use order books, and see their BDAG balances in real time. Its X1 mobile mining app uses a Proof-of-Engagement model and now serves more than 2 million users on both iOS and Android.

Paradigm Champions Senate’s Crypto Bill On Thursday, several industry players discussed the differences between the US Congress’s versions of one of the landmark crypto bills. Following the passage of the GENIUS Act, the sector is now focused on the key market structure legislation, which is expected to offer the long-awaited clarity and protection for the industry. Notably, the House of Representatives introduced and already passed the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act of 2025, which seeks to establish a regulatory framework for crypto assets in the US, facilitate the growth of crypto projects, and protect customers. In June, the US Senate started working on principles for its version of the market structure legislation, looking to draft a comprehensive set of rules. As reported by Bitcoinist, the Senate Banking Committee released a draft of its “framework of principles,” outlining six key principles for the upcoming crypto bill, which were allegedly “very well received” by the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector. Today, Paradigm’s General Partner, Dan Robinson, shared the firm’s response to the Senate Banking Committee’s discussion draft on the bill, suggesting that this version is the best approach. Chainlink Labs, Galaxy Digital, Tribe Capital, Multicoin Capital, Electric Capital, and Ribbit Capital co-signed the letter. Robinson argued that while both bills are an “improvement on the Howey -based regime (…), the Senate draft is significantly simpler, and avoids forcing decentralized tokens and protocols to fit themselves into an inflexible legislative framework.” The lawyer explained that the Senate’s draft focuses on the concept of ancillary assets, which “distinguishes the typical crypto asset from securities due to its innate nature.” To the firms, this is the “cleanest test” that protects decentralized crypto assets while preventing traditional securities issuers from improperly exploiting this framework. Paradigm’s VP of Regulatory Affairs added that if regulatory clarity involves replacing the current “inscrutable regime that no one can register under or operate in with another complex regime that requires a phalanx of lawyers & millions of dollars to comprehend, this exercise will have failed.” Industry Players Divided Over Legislation In an X post, journalist Eleanor Terret noted that most of the major crypto Venture Capital (VC) firms, except a16z crypto, “aligned on market structure and token classification for the first time.” Nonetheless, a16z crypto’s Head of Policy and General Counsel, Miles Jennings, disagreed , stating “most major crypto hedge funds is more accurate. Most major crypto VCs supported CLARITY’s token maturity framework.” Jennings highlighted the Decentralization Research Center’s (DRC) summary chart comparing the Senate and House’s versions, arguing that “the undermining of CLARITY’s transfer restriction framework creates short-term incentives to circumvent decentralization and dump on retail. That’s not good for innovation.” Earlier this week, the DCR also submitted its response to the Senate Banking Committee’s discussion draft, underscoring the importance of “building on the strong foundation established by the CLARITY Act.” The non-profit organization considers that while the Senate’s version is still evolving, the House’s “robust, control-based decentralization test” is the better approach. Last month, the DCR and 50 other leading industry players sent a joint letter to Congress leaders supporting the CLARITY Act, the largest coalition of organizations in agreement on a particular test for decentralization, as the post noted. Additionally, the non-profit affirmed that “sound market structure legislation must be grounded in control” and regulatory attention must focus on where it is warranted, while “preserving space for innovation and open systems.” Similarly, attorney Gabriel Shapiro concurred that “the House approach is far superior.” To him, the Senate’s test is a “pure race to the bottom” with “stuff that makes no sense from a policy perspective.” The fewer rights people have, the less regulated something is? it should be the opposite–if they have more rights, they are more protected under general contract law and there is less need for regulation. . . this is how you get pure memecoin mania forever, equity/token conflict of interest forever, etc. . .",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Chainlink labs|CLARITY Act|Crypto legislation|crypto market structure bill|DRC|GENIUS Act|Paradigm|Senate Market structure bill|Stablecoin Legislation|The Decentralized Research Center|US Congress,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|BTC|LINK|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-08 04:00:36

This move, announced by the U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday, is all about keeping the pressure on Iran, who the U.S. believes continues to flout international sanctions. This network includes companies like RUNC Exchange System Company, Cyrus Offshore Bank, and Pasargad Arian Information and Communication Technology, all of which are accused of working behind the scenes to keep Iran’s economy moving despite sanctions. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made it clear that these new measures are part of a broader U.S. strategy to choke off Iran’s financial lifeblood. He emphasized that Washington intends to keep targeting the channels Iran uses to evade sanctions, with the ultimate goal of blocking the revenue that funds the country’s military programs. “Treasury will continue to disrupt Iran’s schemes aimed at evading our sanctions, block its access to revenue, and starve its weapons programs of capital in order to protect the American people,” he said. Targeting key players in Iran’s financial web The new sanctions are focused on companies and individuals that provide Iran with a way to get around the financial restrictions imposed by the U.S. government. RUNC Exchange is one of the main targets, a company accused of being involved in illegal money transfers, making it easier for Iran to sidestep American financial regulations. Another big target is Cyrus Offshore Bank, a key player in moving money that Iran needs to fund its activities. Alongside these, Pasargad Arian Information and Communication Technology, an Iranian tech company, has been added to the list due to its connections to financial dealings linked to Iran’s controversial activities. The Treasury’s efforts go beyond just freezing assets or imposing financial restrictions. This is part of an ongoing attempt by the U.S. to dismantle the network of firms and individuals helping Iran stay afloat economically. Washington’s message is clear: businesses and institutions that choose to engage with Iran will face consequences. It’s a tactic that’s been ramped up in recent years, as Iran continues to search for ways to bypass sanctions and keep its economy moving, especially in sectors that fund its military ambitions. Oil prices react to tariffs and sanctions While the sanctions hit Iran, the broader global market is feeling the heat of new U.S. tariffs. On Thursday, U.S. tariffs against several trade partners went into effect, raising concern about economic slowdowns that could dampen demand for oil. Early Friday trading saw Brent crude at $66.40 per barrel, with a week-over-week drop of more than 4%. Meanwhile, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures slid to $63.82 a barrel, marking a more than 5% decline over the week. The market reaction stems from fears that global economic growth could slow due to these tariffs. In turn, this could reduce the demand for crude oil, as noted by ANZ Bank analysts. This comes on top of decisions made by the OPEC+ group to roll back significant oil output cuts sooner than expected, pushing oil prices even lower. At the same time, the Kremlin confirmed that Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump would meet soon to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine. This diplomatic effort is expected to have a major impact on global markets. Even though Russia’s oil exports continue despite sanctions, new tariffs on India for buying Russian crude oil have kept pressure on oil prices, with analysts warning that the tariff move won’t drastically reduce the flow of Russian oil into global markets.

(PIMCO) and Blue Owl Capital to lead a roughly $29 billion financing package to build out its planned AI-focused data-center campus in rural Louisiana, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg and Reuters. The deal is the latest sign that Big Tech is turning to private credit markets and strategic partners to help shoulder the skyrocketing costs of building the massive compute infrastructure needed for generative-AI workloads. Pimco will offer $26 billion in debt, and Blue Owl will provide $3 billion in equity For weeks, Meta has been in talks with several private credit firms to identify those who could help secure up to $29 billion to finance its large-scale expansion of AI data centers in the US. As of late June, Meta was still in discussions with Apollo Global Management, KKR, Brookfield, Carlyle, and Pimco. The firm was also working alongside Morgan Stanley to assess ways to improve the debt’s marketability. According to reports, Meta was hoping to secure roughly $3 billion in equity and $26 billion in debt. With the latest selections, insiders say Pimco will handle the $26 billion debt financing, while Blue Owl will provide the $3 billion in equity. They added that the debt portion will probably be issued as bonds. They further noted that Apollo Global Management Inc. and KKR & Co. remained contenders to lead the deal up until the final round of negotiations. Lately, private credit players have been increasing their involvement in AI infrastructure. For instance, Blue Owl recently pledged $15 billion to a data center joint venture with OpenAI, which is still collaborating with SoftBank and Oracle on a $500 billion AI facility project. Meta is funneling more investments into AI projects Meta has been stepping up its spending on AI. In June, it revealed plans to invest $14.3 billion in Scale AI , taking a 49% stake without voting rights. The firm also recruited Scale AI’s founder, Alexandr Wang, and some other employees as part of the deal, to which the startup claimed would not affect users since Meta would not have access to business-related data. Around the same time as the Scale AI deal, OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, claimed Meta was luring its staff with signing bonuses of up to $100 million and even larger annual pay packages. Recently, Meta also unveiled its Llama 4 model. However, the AI community’s response to the model has been far from enthusiastic. Developers have flagged weak programming and software development performance, adding that Llama 4 trails innovative challengers such as DeepSeek. For starters, the model’s Scout architecture processed a lengthy 20,000-token document but generated what AI researcher Simon Willison labeled “complete junk output,” with multiple loops. The tech giant has also promoted its Llama 4 as “open source,” yet licensing rules limit genuine open access. Users have to sign in and agree to the license terms before downloading the models. Besides, the model’s release on a weekend sparked outrage among community members. When Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was asked what led to the unusual timing, he remarked, “That’s when it was ready.” Nevertheless, Meta has raised its full-year capital spending outlook to as high as $72 billion, pointing to data center buildouts and mounting infrastructure expenses. In a first for the company, it has also struck a deal to procure nuclear power for its AI operations. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

This positive momentum can also inspire further ETH ETF investment from both institutional and sophisticated retail sectors, creating a virtuous cycle of growth and recognition. While the benefits are clear, potential challenges exist, such as market volatility inherent to cryptocurrencies. However, the regulated structure of ETFs aims to mitigate some operational risks for investors. The transparency and ease of access offered by these products are significant advantages that outweigh some of the underlying asset’s price fluctuations. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for any responsible ETH ETF investment strategy.

While digital assets often march to their own beat, they are not entirely immune to the tremors in conventional finance. Today, we turn our gaze to a critical area: the Asian foreign exchange (FX) market, which is currently experiencing significant shifts driven by mounting tariff jitters, a persistently weak US dollar, and the impending changes at the Federal Reserve. These interconnected dynamics are creating a ripple effect that extends far beyond currency traders, influencing investment decisions and shaping the broader global economic outlook. Asia FX Under Pressure: Navigating the Downturn The Asia FX market has been exhibiting a noticeable downward trend, with several regional currencies creeping lower against major counterparts. This movement isn’t a random fluctuation but rather a response to a confluence of internal and external pressures. For investors, this translates into potential challenges for portfolio valuations and trade dynamics within the region. Export Dependence: Many Asian economies are heavily reliant on exports. When global trade faces headwinds, as it does with rising protectionist sentiments, their currencies often feel the pinch. A decline in export orders directly impacts a nation’s current account, weakening its currency. Capital Flows: Uncertainty often leads to capital flight from emerging markets, including those in Asia. Investors tend to seek safer havens during times of heightened risk, drawing funds away from Asian assets and putting downward pressure on local currencies. Monetary Policy Divergence: While some Asian central banks might be considering tighter policies to combat inflation, others may be constrained by growth concerns, leading to a divergence that can affect currency strength. The general sentiment of global monetary tightening, led by major central banks, also influences how Asian central banks react, often leading to a need to maintain competitive export pricing through weaker currencies. For instance, the Japanese Yen, a traditional safe-haven currency, has sometimes struggled to maintain its strength amidst these dynamics, reflecting the broader uncertainties even in developed Asian economies. The Chinese Yuan, while heavily managed, also experiences pressure from trade negotiations and domestic economic data, impacting the entire region’s currency stability. The Shadow of Tariff Jitters: A Persistent Threat to Global Trade One of the most significant headwinds for Asian currencies, and indeed for the global economy, remains the lingering threat and actual implementation of tariffs. These “ tariff jitters ” create a climate of unpredictability, forcing businesses to re-evaluate supply chains and investment strategies. The ongoing trade disputes, particularly between major economic powers, have far-reaching consequences. Disruption of Supply Chains: Tariffs increase the cost of imported goods, forcing companies to either absorb higher costs, pass them on to consumers, or seek alternative, often less efficient, suppliers. This disruption can lead to reduced production and trade volumes. Reduced Business Confidence: The uncertainty surrounding trade policies makes businesses hesitant to invest in new projects or expand operations. This translates into slower economic growth and reduced demand for goods and services, which in turn impacts currency valuations. Impact on Export-Oriented Economies: Nations like South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam, which are deeply integrated into global supply chains, are particularly vulnerable. A slowdown in global trade due to tariffs directly hits their export revenues, putting downward pressure on their respective currencies. The constant back-and-forth in trade negotiations, coupled with the threat of new tariffs, keeps markets on edge. This environment naturally favors currencies of economies perceived as more insulated from global trade shocks, though such insulation is increasingly rare in our interconnected world. The impact of these trade tensions is not just theoretical; it’s seen in real-time fluctuations of currency pairs and the cautious stance of international investors. US Dollar Weakness: A Global Ripple Effect and Its Implications Paradoxically, even as Asian currencies face pressure, the US dollar weakness itself has shown signs of a decline, a development that carries its own set of implications for global markets. The dollar’s status as the world’s primary reserve currency means its movements have a disproportionate impact on everything from commodity prices to international debt. The recent US dollar weakness can be attributed to several factors: Federal Reserve’s Stance: The Fed’s dovish monetary policy, characterized by low interest rates and quantitative easing, tends to reduce the attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets, leading to outflows and a weaker dollar. Speculation about the timing of tapering asset purchases also plays a role. Global Economic Recovery Hopes: As other major economies show signs of recovery, investors may diversify out of the dollar into currencies of regions with improving growth prospects. This “risk-on” sentiment can reduce demand for the traditional safe-haven dollar. Twin Deficits: Concerns over the US’s budget deficit and current account deficit (the “twin deficits”) can also weigh on the dollar. A growing national debt and a persistent trade imbalance can erode investor confidence over the long term. While a weaker dollar can make US exports more competitive and reduce the burden of dollar-denominated debt for emerging markets, it also means that imported goods become more expensive for US consumers. For the crypto market, a weaker dollar can sometimes be seen as a bullish signal for assets like Bitcoin, which are increasingly viewed as alternative stores of value or hedges against inflation, especially when traditional fiat currencies show signs of erosion. Federal Reserve Succession: Uncertainty and Policy Shifts The prospect of Federal Reserve succession , referring to potential changes in its leadership or key board members, introduces another layer of uncertainty into the global financial equation. The Fed’s decisions on interest rates, inflation targeting, and quantitative easing have profound effects on the US economy and, by extension, the world. Any hint of a shift in the Fed’s approach can send ripples through currency markets. Why is Federal Reserve succession so impactful? Monetary Policy Direction: A new Fed chair or key governors could bring a different philosophy to monetary policy. Will they be more hawkish (favoring higher interest rates to combat inflation) or more dovish (prioritizing economic growth and employment, even at the risk of higher inflation)? The market constantly tries to price in these potential shifts. Market Expectations: Investor sentiment is heavily influenced by expectations of future Fed actions. Uncertainty around leadership can lead to increased volatility as markets try to anticipate policy changes. This can affect bond yields, stock prices, and, crucially, the US dollar’s value. Global Liquidity: The Fed’s actions directly influence global liquidity. If the Fed tightens monetary policy, it can lead to a reduction in dollar liquidity worldwide, making it more expensive for international borrowers to service dollar-denominated debt and potentially triggering capital outflows from emerging markets. Conversely, a dovish Fed can flood markets with liquidity. The process of Federal Reserve succession is often a period of intense speculation, with every public statement from potential candidates or current officials scrutinized for clues about the future trajectory of US monetary policy. This directly influences the US dollar’s strength and, consequently, the relative performance of other major currencies, including those in Asia. What Does This Mean for the Global Economic Outlook? Bringing these threads together – the pressure on Asia FX , the persistent tariff jitters , the prevailing US dollar weakness , and the uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve succession – paints a complex picture for the global economic outlook . These factors are not isolated; they interact and amplify each other, creating a dynamic and often volatile environment for investors and businesses worldwide. Here’s a snapshot of potential implications: Economic Factor Potential Impact Relevance for Investors Trade Tensions Continued disruption to supply chains, higher import costs, reduced global trade volumes. Favors domestic-focused industries, potentially hurts export-heavy sectors. Look for companies with diversified supply chains. Currency Volatility Significant swings in exchange rates, impacting international trade and investment returns. Increases hedging costs for businesses; creates opportunities for currency traders. Diversify currency exposure. Inflationary Pressures Higher import costs (due to tariffs or weak domestic currency) can feed into consumer prices. Consider inflation-hedging assets like commodities, real estate, or even certain cryptocurrencies. Central Bank Responses Divergent monetary policies as central banks balance inflation and growth. Monitor central bank communications closely; interest rate differentials drive capital flows. The prevailing uncertainty suggests that while a robust global recovery is hoped for, it will likely be uneven and subject to significant shocks. Businesses will need to demonstrate resilience, and investors will need to be agile, adapting their strategies to navigate these shifting tides. The interconnectedness of global finance means that no market, not even the burgeoning crypto space, is entirely insulated from these macro currents. Challenges and Opportunities in a Shifting Landscape While the current environment presents clear challenges, it also creates unique opportunities for astute observers. The challenges include increased market volatility, potential for reduced corporate earnings in trade-exposed sectors, and the difficulty of forecasting currency movements accurately. However, opportunities may arise from: Diversification: A volatile traditional market can underscore the importance of diversification, potentially leading investors to explore alternative assets like certain cryptocurrencies that exhibit low correlation with traditional markets. Strategic Hedging: For businesses engaged in international trade, the fluctuating currency values highlight the necessity of robust hedging strategies to protect profit margins. Selective Investment: Identifying resilient companies or sectors that can thrive despite trade tensions or currency fluctuations becomes crucial. This might include domestic-focused industries or those with strong competitive advantages. Commodity Plays: A weaker dollar can often support commodity prices, offering a potential avenue for investment for those looking to hedge against currency depreciation or inflation. The key is to remain informed and proactive, understanding that macro events have micro impacts across all asset classes. Actionable Insights for Navigating Market Volatility In a landscape defined by tariff jitters , US dollar weakness , and Federal Reserve succession concerns, what can individuals and institutions do? Stay Informed: Regularly monitor news from central banks, trade negotiations, and key economic indicators. Information is your most powerful tool. Review Your Portfolio: Assess your exposure to different currencies and international markets. Consider whether your current asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance in this volatile environment. Consider Hedging: If you have significant international investments or business operations, explore currency hedging strategies to mitigate exchange rate risk. Look Beyond Traditional Assets: While the focus here is on FX, remember that traditional market movements can indirectly influence digital assets. A flight to safety or a search for inflation hedges might lead some investors towards cryptocurrencies. Adopt a Long-Term Perspective: Short-term volatility is often a feature of such environments. For long-term investors, focusing on fundamental value rather than daily fluctuations can be a more prudent approach. The interplay of these forces means that vigilance is not just a recommendation but a necessity. The global financial system is constantly evolving, and understanding its core drivers is paramount for anyone looking to preserve and grow wealth, regardless of their primary asset class. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating the Currents of Change The current confluence of factors—creeping weakness in Asia FX , the persistent shadow of tariff jitters , the broad implications of US dollar weakness , and the anticipation surrounding Federal Reserve succession —underscores a period of profound adjustment in global financial markets. These elements combine to create an an environment characterized by heightened uncertainty but also by underlying shifts that could redefine economic relationships and investment opportunities. For market participants, from seasoned forex traders to emerging cryptocurrency enthusiasts, recognizing these macro trends is paramount. The ability to interpret these signals, understand their potential ripple effects, and adapt investment strategies accordingly will be key to navigating the turbulent waters ahead. While the immediate outlook suggests continued volatility, it also compels a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness that defines our global economic outlook .
