Saifedean Ammous explains,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/why-bitcoin-is-superior-to-gold-in-every-way/,"American economist Saifedean Ammous argues that Bitcoin is superior to gold because it has a fixed supply, is digital, and is not controlled by governments, making it a better store of value and a solution to inflation and debt issues in today‚Äôs financial systems. Ammous, author of The Bitcoin Standard , argues in a recent interview that Bitcoin is superior to gold. He believes Bitcoin is a revolutionary form of money. Its fixed supply and decentralized nature make it more reliable than gold. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what #Bitcoin fixes. If we go back to having a HARD money where money is no longer debt, we no longer need to be monetizing debt. We no longer need to get everyone to become a debt slave in order for us to have a form of money.‚Äù ‚Äì @saifedean w/ @JoeSquawk üéØ pic.twitter.com/Tb3HLT2n4o ‚Äî Walker‚ö°Ô∏è (@WalkerAmerica) December 13, 2024 Bitcoin vs. gold Ammous explains that while gold has historically been used as money due to its scarcity and store of value properties, Bitcoin has taken these qualities to a new level. ‚ÄúGold has been used for 4,000 years because it stores value well. But the problem with Gold is that it‚Äôs not as scarce as Bitcoin,‚Äù Ammous states. ‚ÄúThe annual increase in gold supply is around 1.5% to 2%, whereas Bitcoin‚Äôs supply is capped at 21 million, and its annual supply growth rate is even lower‚Äîabout 0.8% during its current four-year period,‚Äù he added. On e of the advantages Bitcoin has over gold is its fixed supply, which is set in stone. ‚Äú There‚Äôs only ever going to be 21 million Bitcoin. That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs a simple fact, and no other form of money can claim such a property,‚Äù Ammous continues. This scarcity makes Bitcoin a somewhat deflationary asset, unlike fiat currencies that governments can print in unlimited quantities. Am mous believes this unique property makes Bitcoin a much stronger store of value compared to gold or any government-issued currency. Another key difference is how Bitcoin operates. While gold relies on physical storage and transport, Bitcoin is purely digital, meaning it can be transferred and stored globally without needing physical handling. ‚ÄúBitcoin is just software. It doesn‚Äôt require a legal framework that is tied to government-backed currencies. It‚Äôs decentralized and automated,‚Äù Ammous points out. He contrasts this with fiat money, which is deeply intertwined with government control and monetary policy. Why Bitcoin is the future of money Ammous also highlights the importance of Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to prevent inflation. Unlike fiat currencies, which lose value over time as central banks print more money, Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply makes it impervious to inflationary pressures. ‚ÄúIn the world of fiat, governments continuously increase the supply of money, which leads to a decrease in its value,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúIn the case of Bitcoin, no one can just print more. It‚Äôs a money that cannot be inflated.‚Äù Ammous stresses the issue of debt in today‚Äôs financial systems. ‚ÄúFiat money is built on the concept of debt. Every time the government needs more money, they increase the currency supply, essentially creating more debt,‚Äù he states. This creates a cycle of borrowing and inflation that benefits the government but harms everyday citizens who watch their savings lose value. In contrast, Bitcoin provides a way out of this system. ‚ÄúWith Bitcoin, you don‚Äôt need to be in debt to participate in the economy. It‚Äôs a form of money that doesn‚Äôt require borrowing or printing,‚Äù he says. The economist believes that Bitcoin‚Äôs technological advantages and fixed supply make it the ideal money for the modern age. ‚ÄúB itcoin is a form of money that is more scarce, portable, and secure than gold,‚Äù he concludes. ‚ÄúIt offers a solution to the problems caused by fiat currencies and offers a future where money is no longer tied to government debt and manipulation.‚Äù With more people realizing Bitcoin‚Äôs revolutionary potential, its value continues to rise as a monetary asset that will outlast and outperform gold in the coming years.

In a recent statement, Morehead outlined the advantages of Bitcoin over traditional reserve assets and highlighted its potential role in US economic policy. Morehead began his remarks by addressing the US‚Äôs dependence on gold as a reserve asset. ‚ÄúThe United States stores $600 billion worth of gold,‚Äù Morehead said, adding that this amount is equivalent to 11 million years of American wages. Despite its historical importance, Morehead argued that gold is becoming obsolete as a reserve asset in the digital age. Turning to Bitcoin, Morehead described it as a ‚Äúmuch better‚Äù store of value than gold. He noted that Bitcoin‚Äôs digital nature, rarity and global accessibility make it a more efficient and forward-looking reserve asset. ‚ÄúGo to digital gold, go to Bitcoin, it‚Äôs much better,‚Äù he said. Related News: Donald Trump's Altcoin Portfolio Has Major Shifts - Here's the Latest After the Volatility Morehead also explained that the US currently owns about 1% of the world‚Äôs Bitcoin supply, which he believes is both a strategic and rational position. ‚ÄúKeep it, increase it,‚Äù Morehead advised, adding that it would be a positive policy decision for the US to expand its Bitcoin holdings. He also noted that other countries have already started owning Bitcoin, indicating that the US should take the lead in adopting BTC as part of its reserve strategy. *This is not investment advice.

Homo Shiba Inu (HOMOSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address ‚Äì 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOSHIB.

This growth reflects broader market bullishness and increased institutional interest in Bitcoin as a financial asset. Key drivers include MicroStrategy‚Äôs inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 and global discussions on national Bitcoin reserves. Moreover, Japan is considering creating a national Bitcoin reserve, signaling that countries are starting to see Bitcoin as an important financial asset. This recognition could increase demand for Bitcoin and strengthen its role in global financial strategies, further supporting its price growth. National BTC Reserves: A Global Push Underpin Bitcoin Price A notable development comes from Japan, where lawmaker Satoshi Hamada has proposed establishing a national Bitcoin reserve. Submitted to Japan‚Äôs National Diet on December 11, this initiative aims to position Bitcoin as a strategic financial asset.

Tamaki has previously advocated for crypto-friendly tax reforms and regulatory improvements, signaling a potential shift in Japan‚Äôs stance on Bitcoin. #„É°„Çø„Éó„É©„Éç„ÉÉ„Éà #metaplanet @Metaplanet_JP #BTC Japanese lawmaker asks government yo create national bitcoin reserve pic.twitter.com/YfTHp1eJgt ‚Äî meow (@foorpfokrow) December 13, 2024 Globally, other nations are also exploring similar initiatives.

Brazil and Poland have introduced similar legislative efforts. These moves signal Bitcoin‚Äôs growing recognition as a strategic asset, driving demand and enhancing investor confidence. MicroStrategy‚Äôs Nasdaq-100 Inclusion and Implications MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, will join the Nasdaq-100 on December 23, becoming the first Bitcoin-focused company in this elite index. This milestone aligns MicroStrategy with major firms like Apple and Tesla, increasing Bitcoin‚Äôs visibility among institutional investors.

MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin strategy, led by Michael Saylor, has positioned the company as a key advocate for Bitcoin adoption. The firm holds $42 billion worth of Bitcoin, and its Nasdaq-100 inclusion is seen as a validation of its approach. However, experts caution that MicroStrategy‚Äôs heavy Bitcoin exposure could lead to a reclassification as a financial firm, potentially disqualifying it from the index. Despite this risk, the move has already pushed Bitcoin price above $102,000 and MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock past $400. Broader Implications for Bitcoin The growing adoption of Bitcoin as a national reserve and increased exposure through institutional channels like the Nasdaq-100 highlight its evolution into a mainstream financial asset. These developments are driving demand and reinforcing Bitcoin‚Äôs role in global financial strategies, making it a central figure in the cryptocurrency market‚Äôs ongoing growth. As nations and corporations deepen their engagement with Bitcoin, its trajectory as a valuable and strategic asset appears increasingly solidified. Bitcoin Price Holds Key Support Near $100,860; Rising Channel Pattern Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $100,860, showing a minor decline of 0.46% in the last session. The chart reveals a rising channel pattern, with Bitcoin testing key support near $100,800. A break below this level could lead to further downside toward $99,736 and $99,000, with stronger support seen at $97,349. On the upside, immediate resistance lies at $101,404, followed by $102,617 and $103,661. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 53.13 indicates neutral momentum, though a dip below 50 could signal increased bearish pressure. Meanwhile, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) around $99,689 is acting as a dynamic support level, reinforcing the ongoing trend. For now, Bitcoin‚Äôs technical outlook suggests cautious optimism, as it remains within its ascending channel. ‚Äì You might also like Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 ‚Äì 2034 $STARS Presale Surges Past $16.8M: Final Days to Participate Crypto All-Stars ($STARS) is redefining staking for meme coin holders with its innovative MemeVault platform.

In another X post, Trader Tardigrade stated that a possible Dogecoin scenario has come up with a double-bottom chart pattern. He added that DOGE had formed two equal lows with a resistance at the neckline, which is at around $0.46. Meanwhile, the crypto analyst also recently stated that the Dogecoin price has gained more buying power with a bullish crossover on the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD). His analysis suggested that Dogecoin could break this resistance at $0.46 and rally to around $0.5 on the next leg of the DOGE bull run. This rally to $0.5 could just be the start of the projected rally to $2.15 based on the bull flag on the Dogecoin price chart. It is worth mentioning that Trader Tardigrade has before now provided more bullish predictions for Dogecoin in this market cycle. The analyst predicted that DOGE could reach as high as $30 in this cycle while advising market participants to start taking profits around $10. What The Next Move Could Look Like Crypto analyst KrissPax provided insights into what the next move up for the Dogecoin price could look like. He stated that following the double-bottom pattern on DOGE‚Äôs chart, a fractal from past price action shows a possible move up through Monday, followed by an upward trend until Christmas.

With the ADA price jumping to a three-year high over the past month, Gambardello said the coin‚Äôs growth has woken up many people. Cardano Price Helped Prove Peer Dominance As Dan Gambardello noted, ADA price jumped from $0.32 to a high of $1.3 over the past month. Gambardello insinuated that this growth, which amounts to 306%, has made Cardano too big to ignore, even for major influencers. The top analyst said major influencers could no longer continue negative coverage of the asset. This, he claims is because these critics now know how silly they will look with sustained negative coverage as ADA prices continue to soar. The sudden Cardano move from .32 to $1.30 woke a lot of people up. Major influencers quickly realized they can‚Äôt continue negative $ADA coverage. They know they‚Äôd look silly through the bull market as $ADA keeps pumping. Now they‚Äôre bullish because they‚Äôve fallen in line. ‚Äî Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) December 14, 2024 The statement from Dan Gambardello hinges on the broad backlash Cardano has received over the past few years. As a media personality in crypto, he has used his platform to promote the coin. Gambardello largely supports major price growth for Cardano. Meanwhile, this is in line with previous ADA price analysis that tips a surge to $2. As of writing, the coin has pared off some of its gains over the past day. It is now down by 6.05% to $1.05 as of writing. The coin has dropped to this lowest level after soaring as high as $1.13 in the past 24 hours. Prospects and Hurdles Despite the massive accolades for Cardano, the underlying protocol has a number of hurdles to cross in the near future. Recently, a Cardano Foundation whistleblower flagged gross incompetence at the organization, sparking community speculation. With the foundation allegedly disaligned with Input Output Global (IOG) and other founding bodies, the prospect of its decentralized endeavors are now in doubt. However, the protocol has continued to innovate in its technological push. With advanced Hydra test and scalability upgrades, analysts like Dan Gambardello are optimistic the future of ADA remains bright.

Qubetics‚Äô commitment to simplifying blockchain adoption has garnered strong market support. During its presale, Qubetics raised over $6 million , distributed more than 324 million $TICS tokens , and attracted a growing community of over 9,400 holders . The current price of $TICS is $0.0311 , with projections indicating significant growth as the QubeQode platform gains traction. Analysts predict that as QubeQode adoption grows, Qubetics will emerge as one of the best cryptos for massive return potential , offering unparalleled growth opportunities for early investors. Hedera: The Leader in Enterprise-Grade Blockchain Hedera Hashgraph has positioned itself as a leader in enterprise-grade blockchain solutions, offering unmatched speed, security, and scalability. Its unique consensus mechanism, known as Hashgraph, sets it apart from traditional blockchains by providing high throughput and low latency.

This surprising turn of event was after the government outlawed the use of crypto in the country in 2017. The decision was part of a global trend in which many countries were skeptical about crypto‚Äôs volatile and unregulated nature. The nation is now laying the groundwork to embrace crypto assets and regulate the sector. Morocco Shift in Strategy: From Crypto Ban to Regulation Back then, the government cited financial instability, terrorism financing, and money laundering as the reasons for banning crypto in the country. The decision seemed like the best way to protect the country‚Äôs economy. In 2024, Morocco‚Äôs financial landscape is now undergoing a profound transformation. The announcement by Bank Al-Maghrib, Morocco‚Äôs central bank, to draft crypto regulations marks a pivotal moment. Central bank governor Abdellatif Jouahri has confirmed that the draft is under review, signaling a commitment to bringing crypto into the formal economy. This change aligns Morocco with a global trend of evolving digital asset regulations. Countries that were once critical of crypto, including China and Bolivia are now developing frameworks to harness its potential . Interestingly, over 130 nations are exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Morocco‚Äôs shift to crypto aims to boost financial inclusion. This is because 42% of the population are still unbanked. Crypto and a future CBDC can bridge this gap. Also smartphones, crypto wallets can enable savings, investments, and cross-border payments. Crypto‚Äôs Underground Rise in Morocco Despite the 2017 ban, cryptocurrencies found fertile ground in Morocco‚Äôs informal economy. In 2023, the country was ranked among the top 20 globally for crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis. It was also listed 13th in Bitcoin usage by Insider Monkey. Ownership of cryptocurrencies steadily climbed, rising from 2.4% of the population in 2021 to 3.1% in 2022. The ban didn‚Äôt stop crypto but pushed it into unregulated underground markets without protections. This exposed the need for formal rules to manage risks and unlock its potential. Challenges on the Road Ahead While Morocco‚Äôs embrace of crypto holds promise, it comes with significant challenges. The government must establish clear regulations to govern transactions and exchanges. This includes efficient Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) measures to prevent misuse. Many citizens remain unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies. This makes public education essential to promote understanding and responsible use. To support adoption, Morocco needs reliable technological infrastructure. This includes securing platforms for transactions and better internet access in rural areas. The authorities need to integrate crypto with traditional banking systems to ensure stability and consumer protection. Additionally, stringent cybersecurity measures need to be in place to protect users against fraud and hacking. Also, international collaboration will help Morocco align its policies with global standards and maintain financial integrity.

This month, the spotlight is shining on three heavy hitters: BTFD Coin, Dogs, and Bone ShibaSwap. These projects are stirring up FOMO across the crypto space faster than a Tim Hortons queue on a Monday morning. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned trader or just looking to park your loonies somewhere promising, you‚Äôll want to stick around for this. Let‚Äôs start with a quick hat tip to BTFD Coin , the absolute headliner of meme coin presales this month. Sitting pretty in its 10th presale stage, this rising star has already raked in over $3.8 million, sold 54 billion tokens, and amassed a loyal community of over 5,100 Bulls. When a project hits a cool million in under ten days, you know it‚Äôs not just riding the hype‚Äîit‚Äôs making waves. BTFD Coin: A Movement Wrapped in Memes If there‚Äôs one word to describe BTFD Coin, it‚Äôs ‚Äúmomentum.‚Äù Short for ‚ÄúBuy The Dip,‚Äù this Ethereum-based gem champions a fearless approach to market downturns, rallying a community ready to seize the dips like a Canuck hitting the slopes. The Bulls Squad‚Äîfour vibrant mascots, including Baby Bull and Nerdy Bull‚Äîaren‚Äôt just cute branding; they‚Äôre symbols of a strong community that‚Äôs already carved out its space in the meme coin cosmos. Add to that a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game where players earn BTFD tokens and a staking APY of 90%, and you‚Äôre looking at utility far beyond the average meme coin. But let‚Äôs talk tokenomics, because this isn‚Äôt some fly-by-night operation. With nearly half its supply allocated to presale and a long-term liquidity lock of three years, BTFD Coin is structured for sustainability. And the best part? The presale isn‚Äôt slowing down. With every stage bringing fresh buzz, the FOMO here is as real as watching your favourite poutine joint run out of gravy. Dogs: Barking Up the Right Tree Ah, Dogs, a meme coin that‚Äôs all about man‚Äôs best friend‚Äîbut with a crypto twist. While Dogs hasn‚Äôt reached the mainstream heights of some of its canine counterparts (looking at you, Dogecoin), it‚Äôs carving its niche by sticking close to its community. Dogs boasts a decentralised governance model that gives its holders a real say in the project‚Äôs future. It‚Äôs like having your hockey team consult you on the line-up‚Äîpretty unheard of, but definitely appreciated. Plus, its meme-worthy charm is backed by utility, including partnerships with animal welfare organisations. Now, isn‚Äôt that a tail-wagging bonus? Its roadmap hints at future integrations and even NFT opportunities, which could set it apart in the crowded field of dog-themed cryptos. If you‚Äôre looking for a coin with heart, Dogs is worth a shot. Bone ShibaSwap: The Utility Powerhouse If Bone ShibaSwap were a weather forecast, it‚Äôd be calling for a blizzard of utility. As part of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, Bone plays a pivotal role in ShibaSwap, the ecosystem‚Äôs decentralised exchange (DEX). This isn‚Äôt just another meme coin‚Äîit‚Äôs the backbone of a project that already commands a cult-like following. Bone isn‚Äôt just about trading on ShibaSwap; it‚Äôs also a governance token, giving holders voting power on ecosystem proposals. Talk about putting your money where your mouth is. And with the upcoming launch of Shibarium, a Layer 2 blockchain solution, Bone‚Äôs role is set to expand even further. The presale might be over, but the buzz around Bone hasn‚Äôt cooled off. Its steady climb in utility and demand makes it a standout in a market full of flash-in-the-pan meme coins. For those who believe in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, Bone is the kind of token that feels more like an investment than a gamble. What‚Äôs the Best Move This Month? When it comes to the best new meme coin presales to invest in this month, each of these contenders brings its own flavour to the table. Dogs offers charm and philanthropy, while Bone ShibaSwap is all about utility and governance. But if we‚Äôre talking about all-around potential‚Äîcommunity, momentum, and unique features‚ÄîBTFD Coin takes the crown. This is a presale that‚Äôs already proving its worth, with strong tokenomics, a thriving community, and features that promise long-term engagement. Whether it‚Äôs staking, gaming, or just vibing with the Bulls Squad, BTFD Coin has positioned itself as the meme coin to beat. The clock‚Äôs ticking, and the BTFD Coin presale won‚Äôt last forever. So, grab your chance to ride the wave while the price is still low‚Äîbecause when it takes off, you‚Äôll want to be on board. Don‚Äôt miss the boat, eh?

The complaint names Pinillo and his associated businesses, Solanofi, Solano Partners Ltd., and Solano Capital Investments, collectively known as the Solanofi entities, as the defendants. Details of The Lawsuit According to a December 10 release from the CFTC, Pinillo targeted at least 1,515 individuals in the United States, including members of his Spanish-speaking congregation. The complaint alleges that he misused his position as a trusted church pastor to promote his deceptive scheme. He claimed to be the CEO of Solanofi, an automated trading platform that offered risk-free profits through high-performance trading of crypto assets. Pinillo falsely advertised guaranteed monthly returns of up to 34.9% and assured participants that the platform was secure and reliable. The pastor gave participants access to an online dashboard showing fake account balances and profits to make the scheme appear legitimate. He also encouraged customers to involve friends and family by offering a 15% referral fee for recruiting new people. However, the document states that there was no trading platform, no trades occurred, and no profits were generated. Instead, Pinillo allegedly misappropriated all funds provided by customers. The lawsuit further claims that the accused failed to disclose critical information when seeking clients. Among the omissions, he did not inform customers that the Solanofi entities were shams, the trading platform was non-existent, and the online account statements were falsified. Additionally, he used the funds from new participants to pay earlier ones in what the CFTC described as a classic Ponzi scheme. Restitution and Similar Cases Following the enforcement action, the regulator is seeking restitution for defrauded participants, the return of misappropriated funds, civil monetary penalties, trading bans, and a permanent injunction to prevent further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and related rules. The case against Pinillo is the latest in a growing number of such schemes in the crypto industry. In March, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged that 17 individuals were responsible for a $300 million Ponzi scheme that targeted more than 40,000 Latino investors through a program called CryptoFX. In August, the financial watchdog also brought complaints against two Georgia brothers accused of defrauding over 80 investors in a $60 million bogus multilevel plan. The same month, NovaTech Ltd. was charged with operating a fake operation that raised over $650 million from more than 200,000 investors, including many in the Haitian-American community.

This follows similar efforts by legislators in the United States, Russia, Argentina, and other jurisdictions. As a finite asset, a strategic Bitcoin reserve is key for consumers‚Äô economic benefits and utility in cross-border payments. According to the House of Councilors document, Satoshi Hamada moved towards a Bitcoin Reserve for the government. He described the importance of the country having the top crypto as its national asset. Hamada proposed converting foreign reserves to crypto assets like Bitcoin, pointing to global jurisdictions. The lawmaker cited neutrality and its decentralized nature to prevent any form of control within a particular country. Global trade with Bitcoin is possible without the influence of specific countries. Crypto enthusiasts argue that it creates a fair financial environment for participants. The initial reaction from the crypto community was positive, as holders lauded the recent push by governments toward digital asset adoption. This could spur institutional investment, raising asset prices and driving market innovation. Although Hamada‚Äôs party holds only two seats in parliament, there is growing optimism of other lawmakers supporting his views. Japan has taken a mixed approach toward digital asset regulation. Last month, the country proposed a lightweight regulation for crypto intermediaries. As global regulations ramp up, crypto enthusiasts believe the country will be more positive to virtual assets. The United States Effect Recent moves by US lawmakers inspired Hamada to pitch a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Ahead of the US elections, Donald Trump backed the crypto industry, pledging positive regulations and ending the present administration‚Äôs ‚Äú war‚Äù on the market. Amongst others, Trump noted that his administration would stop the sale of the nation‚Äôs Bitcoin, creating a reserve. US Senator Cynthia Lummis rolled out a bill for a strategic Bitcoin reserve in a related effort. The bill seeks to make the country a Bitcoin power nation as it will acquire 1 million BTC for five years and hold for 20 years. This will offset the growing national debt, which continues to hinder macro conditions in the market. Sen Lummis proposed selling gold reserves to acquire more Bitcoin, sparking an upward trend among bulls. This has led to several jurisdictions setting sights on a strategic BTC reserve to boost fair competition.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Japan,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-14 21:57:49

Peter Schiff doubts,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-pay-off-u-s-debt-peter-schiff/,"Peter Schiff doubts that 1 million Bitcoins could ever pay off the U.S. national debt, as Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap would need to increase by over 20,000%, which is unrealistic. He also questions Bitcoin‚Äôs global adoption and sees its value increased more by speculation than real demand. Some Bitcoin fans believe that if the U.S. government buys 1 million Bitcoins, it could eventually pay off the massive $36 trillion national debt. However, Peter Schiff doubts this idea, in a recent X post he questioned whether Bitcoin could eventually pay off the $36.25 trillion national debt. For this to happen, Bitcoin‚Äôs total value would have to increase significantly. Currently, Bitcoin is priced at around $100,000. So, 1 million Bitcoin at $100,000 per Bitcoin would be worth $100 billion in total, not enough to pay off the U.S. national debt, which is around $36.25 trillion. Peter Schiff doubts Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to pay off U.S. National debt Schiff says this isn‚Äôt possible, as Bitcoin would have to increase in value by over 20,000%, which is unrealistic. Even if Bitcoin‚Äôs value increases, the U.S. debt keeps growing. The U.S. government borrows money yearly, so the debt is expected to continue rising. This makes the idea of Bitcoin paying off the debt even harder to believe. Plus, by then the National Debt will be much more than $36.25 trillion, requiring a much higher Bitcoin price to pay it off. ‚Äî Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 13, 2024 Peter Schiff has long criticized Bitcoin, saying it lacks value and won‚Äôt replace traditional money or assets like gold. He points out Bitcoin‚Äôs extreme price swings, making it unreliable for saving or buying everyday things. He believes most Bitcoin buyers are speculating, not using it as money. Schiff also doubts Bitcoin will ever be widely adopted. While its price has grown, Bitcoin still needs to be used as a global currency. Only some countries have accepted it as official money, and most governments resist replacing their currencies with Bitcoin. Schiff believes Bitcoin will always remain the world‚Äôs main currency. Some Bitcoin supporters think the cryptocurrency will keep increasing in value as more people adopt it. They believe it could even reach $1 million per coin, making it an alternative to traditional money. However, Schiff sees the idea of Bitcoin paying off the U.S. national debt as highly unlikely. The market cap required for such a scenario is too large, and the growing national debt makes it even less possible. As Peter Schiff says, ‚Äú Bitcoin is a speculative asset, and its value is driven by hope, not real demand.‚Äù While Bitcoin might continue to grow for some, Schiff believes that paying off the U.S. national debt is just an unrealistic dream.

The company‚Äôs inclusion follows an eventful year that saw its stock value increase more than sixfold. The Nasdaq-100 index is up 29.4% in 2024. You might also like: Saylor‚Äôs MicroStrategy added $2.1b in Bitcoin What does it mean? Joining the Nasdaq-100 index ranks MicroStrategy, the software company turned Bitcoin ( BTC ) treasury, among some of the biggest corporations, including Apple Inc., with a market cap exceeding $3 trillion; Microsoft Corporation, valued at over $2 trillion; NVIDIA Corporation, boasting a market cap surpassing $1 trillion; Amazon.com Inc., with its market cap of around $1.5 trillion; and Alphabet Inc., which has a market cap nearing $1.8 trillion. Other newcomers to the index this year include Palantir Technologies and Axon Enterprise. This inclusion typically leads to increased stock purchases as exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, tracking the index adjust their holdings to reflect the changes. To be included in the Nasdaq-100, a company must meet specific criteria and maintain a position of prominence in the stock market. For MicroStrategy, it‚Äôs among the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange based on market capitalization. Inclusion also signifies that the company is among the most valuable and must maintain its stock performance to stay included. Poor performance or a drop in market cap can lead to exclusion, as was the case this year with Illumina, Super Micro Computer, and Moderna. MicroStrategy‚Äôs transformation The firm began acquiring Bitcoin in 2020 as a treasury reserve asset amid declining software business revenue. The strategy has proven remarkably successful, with the company‚Äôs market capitalization now approaching $97.94 billion. The firm recently expanded its Bitcoin holdings further, with Executive Chairman Michael Saylor announcing the acquisition of 21,550 Bitcoin for approximately $2.1 billion between December 2 and December 8, bringing their total holdings to 423,650 BTC. Bernstein analysts view the Nasdaq-100 inclusion as a stepping stone toward potential S&P 500 inclusion in 2025, suggesting further upside for the company‚Äôs stock. The analysts anticipate improved visibility and recognition beyond fresh ETF inflows as a result of the index inclusion.MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock performance has closely tracked Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements, benefiting from the cryptocurrency‚Äôs recent surge past $100,000. This rally has been partially attributed to optimism surrounding President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs victory and expectations of more favorable regulatory conditions for the crypto sector. The company‚Äôs success has redefined corporate treasury management strategies, showcasing the potential benefits of Bitcoin as a reserve asset.

In a tweet accompanied by a detailed technical chart, XRP Captain stated, ‚Äú#XRPHolders It‚Äôs Not Me But The Chart Is Telling Us That #XRP Is Ready To Explode Once Again.‚Äù The chart depicts a series of corrective price movements that culminate in a symmetrical triangle formation, a technical indicator often associated with impending volatility. XRP Captain highlights the completion of Wave E within the triangle, suggesting a bullish move may be imminent. The key resistance level at $2.60 is critical for confirming an upward breakout, while $1.70 is a solid support level to watch in case of a downward move. #XRPHolders It's Not Me But The Chart Is Telling Us That #XRP Is Ready To Explode Once Again pic.twitter.com/GQowgoRyi0 ‚Äî XRP CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) December 13, 2024 Elliott Wave Patterns Signal Potential Breakout The 4-hour chart shared by XRP Captain employs Elliott Wave theory to analyze XRP‚Äôs recent price action. This approach categorizes market movements into repetitive wave cycles, providing insight into investor sentiment and potential future trends. The chart indicates two descending structures preceding a symmetrical triangle, a consolidation pattern that precedes a breakout. With Wave E nearing completion, the formation suggests a high likelihood of price expansion. If XRP can surpass the resistance level at $2.60, it could signal a significant rally, while a fall below $1.70 would invalidate this bullish thesis. This technical setup has drawn considerable attention from the XRP community, many of whom view the chart as confirmation of long-term bullish potential. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Debate Over XRP‚Äôs Market Dynamics XRP Captain‚Äôs analysis has sparked conversations within the cryptocurrency community about whether XRP will adhere to standard market patterns or diverge due to unique factors. James Hernandez, a prominent member of the XRP community, commented on the tweet, expressing a different view. He argued, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think standard market trends apply to XRP. I mean they did before, but XRP is about to revolutionize the global financial world. Other factors are going to determine its growth from here.‚Äù James‚Äô perspective reflects a broader belief among XRP supporters that the asset‚Äôs value is increasingly tied to fundamental developments. Ripple‚Äôs progress in securing global financial partnerships and the anticipated conclusion of its legal battle with the SEC are seen as key drivers of XRP‚Äôs price, potentially overriding traditional market indicators. What‚Äôs Next for XRP? With the start of 2024 approaching, XRP enthusiasts anticipate regulatory clarity and increased adoption to play a pivotal role in determining the asset‚Äôs trajectory. XRP Captain‚Äôs technical analysis provides a compelling case for bullish momentum. Time will reveal whether the token will adhere to these patterns or if external factors will shape its future. For now, traders and holders are advised to stay vigilant as XRP nears a decisive moment in its market cycle.

By 2027, NEAR is expected to rise to $16.90, driven by mainstream adoption. Looking ahead to 2030, NEAR Protocol could witness a significant surge, with its price potentially reaching $27 or beyond. Overall, the prevailing sentiment within NEAR Protocol‚Äôs community is one of cautious optimism, with stakeholders closely monitoring its progress and evolution. As NEAR continues to advance its technology and forge strategic partnerships, questions surrounding its price potential persist, inviting further analysis and exploration of its prospects.

NEAR price fell by over 2.5% at the time of writing. NEAR Protocol sought support and resistance at $6.50 and $7.00, respectively. Near Protocol price analysis for today, December 14, shows that the price rose to the $7.50 mark. NEAR Protocol price analysis 1-day chart: NEAR breaks past $7.50 as bulls charge The 1-day NEAR/USD price chart indicated an upward trend in the market as prices moved toward the $6.50 level. The bulls found support at $3.60 and the price rose to the $7.40 mark before falling back to the $6.50 level. NEAR price falls to $6.50 The Indicators reflect the increasing bearish price sentiment as all three major technical indicators signal rising bullish price sentiments. The MACD is bearish at -0.164 units and suggests falling bullish momentum. Moreover, the EMAs are above the mean position, and the indicator shows a steady momentum turn from bullish to bearish. The RSI also shares this sentiment as the indicator fell to 48.43 from above the 70.00 index level. The converging Bollinger Bands suggest decreasing volatility, indicating that the $7.00 resistance may hold for the week. NEAR price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour price chart of NEAR shows a sudden spike in NEAR price as the asset broke past $6.0. The price movement was followed by a short return to $5.70 before crossing back above the $6.00 mark as the bulls sought to go past the $7.50 resistance. NEAR price breaks down below the $7.00 resistance The RSI is at 37.92, suggesting that the asset is at the bottom of the neutral zone, which indicates that the bears have room for more upward movement in the short term. However, the downward slope suggests increasing selling pressure on the asset, suggesting further gains. The MACD is bearish, with the MACD line at -0.016 showing slight bearish dominance across the 4-hour charts, which has been increasing in recent candles. These indicators collectively issue a steady bullish trend that suggests a consolidation below $7.00.

The strong trade volume suggests increasing activity, indicating a robust force behind the recent fall. As such, the price rose rapidly to the $7.600 mark before stumbling below the $7.50 mark again. Traders should expect NEAR to continue its bullish rally as the bulls chase the $8.00 mark. Currently, the closest support level is $6.50 and below at $6.00, while NEAR Protocol faces difficulty establishing a foothold above the $7.00 level. Is Near Protocol a good investment? NEAR Protocol distinguishes itself in the cryptocurrency market, emphasizing scalability, usability, and developer-friendliness. It aims to facilitate the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, catering to developers and end-users. NEAR‚Äôs innovative technology and user-centric approach make it attractive for mainstream adoption of blockchain applications. With a focus on user experience and developer tools, NEAR Protocol is positioned to drive significant growth in the decentralized application ecosystem. Its potential to disrupt traditional industries and capture market share in the blockchain space makes it an intriguing investment opportunity for those interested in innovative technology solutions. Why is NEAR up? NEAR price rose rapidly after falling to the $4.50 support as the bulls crushed bearish resistances till $6.00 mark. Despite finding short-term resistance at the level, the bulls managed to rise to the $6.50 mark where they hover currently. Will NEAR reach $10? NEAR is experiencing a volatile market movement that may see it reach the $10 mark before the year closes. Will NEAR reach $20? NEAR is expected to cross the $20 threshold by 2027 as the industry continues to see increasing adoption across the mainstream. The bullish rally will be supported by NEAR‚Äôs vision of a scalable future and user and developer-friendly architecture that sets it apart from other blockchains. Will NEAR reach $50? The chance of NEAR reaching the $50 mark depends on various circumstances, such as future network development, market regulations, and the broader cryptocurrency market growth. If NEAR continues its current trajectory, it can reach $50 in the next decade. Does NEAR have a good long term future? Yes, NEAR has a good long-term future due to its innovative technology, focus on scalability, and strong ecosystem development. However, the project needs to keep up with sector developments to maintain its edge in the digital ecosystem. Recent news/opinions on Near Protocol NEAR recently conducted an AMA with fraxfinance founder Sam Kazemian sitting down with NEAR Co-Founder to discuss AI, PMF, DeFi, cross-chain interoperability, and more.

NEAR Protocol historic price sentiment NEAR price history The Near Protocol (NEAR) began its journey in August 2020, aiming to create a scalable and permissionless blockchain. The first recorded trade value in October 2020 was $1.072, closing the year at $1.459 after a recovery. In 2021, NEAR showed an uptrend, starting at $1.305 and reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $7.572 by March 13. A market downturn pushed the price down to $1.537 by July 19, but it rebounded to $11.776 on September 9 and further to $13.168 on October 26. By 2022, NEAR‚Äôs price crashed to below $2.00, losing over 90% of its peak value. Throughout 2023, NEAR saw low volatility, with prices remaining below $2.50 for most of the year. Since the start of 2024, NEAR experienced a strong recovery, climbing to $7.80. However, after reaching the $8.00 mark in mid-May, it fell back to $5.60. In June, NEAR traded between $4.48 and $7.66. It rose from $5.20 to $6.04 in July but closed the month below $5.00. NEAR started August at $5.00, declining to $3.89 by the end of the month. In September 2024, the asset bounced back and closed the month above the $5.20 mark. In October, the price stumbled and fell to $4.850 in the first few days before closing the month below the $4.00 mark leaving a negative outlook at the start of November. November saw NEAR making remarkable strides as the bulls held strong control of markets during the month, a trend that is likely to continue into December.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|NEAR,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-14 22:20:00

Trump‚Äôs Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump‚Äôs Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump‚Äôs Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump‚Äôs Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump‚Äôs Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump‚Äôs Tariffs by entering its contract address ‚Äì 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-14 22:23:00

As the cryptocurrency stabilizes, will Toncoin break to the upside, setting the stage for a fresh rally, or will it falter and dip lower, testing crucial support levels? This consolidation phase is more than just a pause in price action; it represents a pivotal moment that could determine TON‚Äôs next major move. A breakout to the upside could signal renewed positive sentiment, attracting more buyers and fueling a strong upward trend. On the other hand, a breakdown could shift the market sentiment to bearish, with the price heading lower to retest key support zones. In this article, we will explore both scenarios in detail, analyzing the key levels to watch and what a breakout in either direction could mean for Toncoin‚Äôs future trajectory. Toncoin Current Range: Understanding The Consolidation Phase As Toncoin consolidates, current price action suggests the potential for a breakout to the upside. The price has shown signs of bullish momentum within the consolidation range, with gradual upward movements indicating increasing buying interest. Related Reading: Toncoin‚Äôs 90-Day Returns Turn Positive: Is A Massive Rally On The Horizon? Furthermore, this upward pressure within the range is often a precursor to a breakout, as market participants accumulate positions, anticipating a rise above resistance levels. If this momentum continues to build, it could signal that Toncoin is preparing for a strong move on the upside once the price breaks free from its current consolidation zone. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently trending above the 50% threshold, indicating that Toncoin is in positive territory and buying pressure is starting to outpace selling activity, which is often a sign of bullish momentum. When the RSI remains above the 50% mark, it suggests that the asset is more likely to experience upward movement as it reflects an increasing number of buyers compared to sellers. Typically, this level is often seen as a key indicator for possible future gains, showing that market sentiment is leaning toward optimism. As the RSI trends higher, the likelihood of a breakout to the upside increases, reinforcing the optimistic outlook for Toncoin. What Happens After A Breakout? Possible Price Targets And Next Steps After a breakout, TON‚Äôs direction will hinge on whether the move is upward or downward. If the price breaks higher, it could target the $7.2 resistance level, which could act as an initial hurdle. Breaking above this level successfully would indicate strong bullish momentum, potentially triggering upward movement. In this scenario, the next key resistance level to watch would be $8.3. A move past this point could set Toncoin on a path for additional gains, as it would signal that the bulls are in control and the price may continue to climb toward new highs. Related Reading: Toncoin Price Explodes With 17% Rally ‚Äî Can TON Sustain The Momentum? On the other hand, if the breakout is to the downside, the price will likely test the $6 support level. A breach of this level could lead to more declines, with subsequent support zones becoming crucial. Conclusively, increased volatility is common, so traders should watch for confirmation signals after a breakout, such as volume and momentum indicators, to gauge the sustainability of the move. The broader market sentiment also plays a significant role in determining the direction and strength of the breakout.

This partnership aims to use blockchain technology to turn real-world assets (RWAs) into digital forms, focusing mainly on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) assets. A Strategic Partnership to Provide Secured Tokenized Assets According to a release , the partnership‚Äôs first project involves creating tokenized assets called ‚Äúnotes‚Äù linked to a Chinese solar material manufacturer. These notes aim to show the value and sustainability of the company‚Äôs operations. This project offers investors a clear and efficient way to support ESG-focused initiatives. Additionally, this initiative responds to the growing demand for sustainable investments, which require transparency and accountability. Meanwhile, Ant Digital, through its blockchain brand ZAN, will play an important role in this effort. ZAN offers advanced blockchain infrastructure and tools that make tokenizing assets in many industries easy. Likewise, the partnership shows how blockchain is changing traditional asset management. By turning real-world ESG assets into digital tokens, Sui Blockchain and Ant Digital use advanced technology to promote sustainability and build trust with investors. Zodia Custody and Securitize to Boost Tokenized Asset Custody Similarly, Zodia Custody formed a strategic partnership with Securitize , a renowned tokenization platform. This partnership is a step towards providing institutional investors with secure, compliant, innovative solutions for managing tokenized assets. Zodia Custody‚Äôs CEO, Julian Sawyer, expressed his enthusiasm for the possibilities that tokenization brings to the table. He highlighted that tokenization has the potential to redefine how institutions approach investments. Securitization will play a pivotal role in the partnership, allowing institutional investors to access and trade tokenized assets. Notably, the platform is familiar with facilitating the digital transformation of traditional financial markets. In an interview, Carlos Domingo, the CEO of Securitize, emphasized the importance of bridging the gap between blockchain technology and established financial practices. Tokenized Finance: The Future of Asset Management Tokenization transforms financial markets by converting assets into digital tokens on a blockchain. This innovative process introduces higher transparency, faster transactions, and lower costs, appealing to traditional and new-age investors. The tokenized money fund is accessible on a distributed ledger, enabling institutions to conduct real-time transactions and lower settlement risks.

37651618,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52174,1734217208,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"XRP Crash Alert Drives Whales to A Hidden Altcoin With 35,000% Upside Potential",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-crash-alert-drives-whales-to-a-hidden-altcoin-with-35000/,"The recent XRP price turmoil has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, prompting investors to seek refuge in a hidden altcoin that promises extraordinary returns. As XRP struggles to maintain its market position, with its price plummeting to $2.36 after a 3% drop, many are paying attention to RCO Finance (RCOF) , a hidden altcoin in the market. With predictions of a staggering 35,000% upside potential, RCOF has become the focal point for savvy investors looking to capitalize on the market‚Äôs shifting tides. XRP Price Faces Renewed Pressure as Ripple Sells $500 Million The XRP price momentum has taken another hit as Ripple initiated the sale of 200 million XRP from its December reserves, valued at $500 million. This significant sell-off comes at a critical time, with XRP struggling to maintain its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Following a sharp correction from its brief ascent to the third spot, the XRP price now battles to regain ground behind Tether‚Äôs USDT. Ripple‚Äôs substantial selling activity introduces additional downward pressure, potentially dampening the XRP price ability to recover from its recent crash. Despite reaching an all-time high of $2.90 in late November, the token has since slipped to $2.00, driven by dismissed rumors and bearish technical indicators. As Ripple cashes in on its reserves, investors are wary of the token‚Äôs ability to rebound. Meanwhile, whales are increasingly shifting their focus to RCO Finance (RCOF), a hidden altcoin with transformative growth potential. What Makes RCO Finance (RCOF) the New Whale Favorite? RCO Finance (RCOF) is rapidly building attention in decentralized finance (DeFi), capturing investors‚Äô engagement, particularly those looking to pivot from the projected XRP price drop. The platform‚Äôs innovative approach combines cutting-edge technology with user-centric features that cater to traders. The RCOF‚Äôs AI-powered robo-advisor is arguably the crown jewel of RCO Finance. This sophisticated tool leverages historical data, live market trends, and news events to craft personalized investment strategies tailored to individual users‚Äô financial goals and risk appetites. Unlike traditional advisors, which often require significant fees and human oversight, RCOF‚Äôs robo-advisor operates autonomously. It monitors market conditions, adjusting portfolios in real time to mitigate risks. This feature democratizes access to advanced trading strategies, allowing even novice investors to make profits. RCO Finance‚Äôs automated market-making (AMM) system complements the robo-advisor. This fully decentralized trading platform utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning to execute trades without manual intervention. RCO Finance also addresses a significant gap in the crypto market through its real-world asset integration feature. This functionality allows users to invest directly in stocks, bonds, and real estate using their cryptos, bypassing fiat conversion. Through RCOF bridging the divide between digital currencies and tangible assets, the platform opens up new avenues for portfolio diversification and investment opportunities previously inaccessible to crypto holders. In addition to these standout features, RCO Finance prioritizes security and privacy. The hidden altcoin has undergone rigorous audits by SolidProof , ensuring its smart contracts adhere to industry standards. Furthermore, RCOF does not require KYC procedures, allowing investors to maintain anonymity while trading. RCO FInance (RCOF) Presale Opportunities While the future of the XRP price is currently unknown, savvy investors are excited about the possibilities of the RCOF hidden altcoin presale, which is currently underway. Currently priced at $0.077 per token during Stage 4 of the presale, RCOF offers the substantial potential of up to 700% when the token hits the anticipated $0.6 on the exchanges. Participating in this presale grants access to RCO Finance‚Äôs innovative features and positions investors favorably within a rapidly evolving market. Token holders will enjoy various benefits, such as reduced transaction fees, quarterly dividends ranging from 1% to 6%, and exclusive access to AI features. Moreover, early investors can take advantage of promotional bonuses by using codes during their purchase, an initiative to incentivize participation in this promising project. With over $9 million already raised in its presale phase and a growing community of supporters, RCO Finance is poised for explosive growth. For those seeking an opportunity that combines cutting-edge technology with significant upside potential, now is the time to consider investing in RCO Finance (RCOF). As the XRP price faces challenges, RCOF stands ready to deliver unmatched ROI for every investor in the market.

Elon‚Äôs Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon‚Äôs Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon‚Äôs Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon‚Äôs Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon‚Äôs Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon‚Äôs Gold by entering its contract address ‚Äì 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|FIAT|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-14 23:47:00

With over 60% month-long profit, the Dogecoin price is also showing bullish strength as many expect the token to meet higher price targets this year. On the other hand, ETFSwap (ETFS) is taking full advantage of its fresh Uniswap listing to rival Dogecoin and deliver 12,000% more profits to its investors, taking its value to $4. Dogecoin Price Prepares For Further Upsurge As Its Price Consolidates The Dogecoin price impressed meme coin enthusiasts and investors by rallying over 100% in the past few weeks. However, the Dogecoin price is starting to consolidate, forming a bullish flag and settling around a weekly price range of $0.3947 ‚Äì $0.4758. Although the monthly gains the Dogecoin price accumulated have dropped from over 150% to a current 60%, analysts like Ali Martinez have hinted that the Dogecoin price could hit a target of $18 if the bull cycle gets wild in 2025. As this prediction adds to the optimism around Dogecoin, confidence is starting to brew for the Dogecoin price. Although, technical analysis for Dogecoin on TradingView hints at a neutral signal. This means that Dogecoin price could either surge further or drip from here. However, the Dogecoin community remains positive as CoinMarketCap reflects an 87% bullish sentiment for the token. ETFSwap (ETFS) Readies Itself For A Further 12,000% Pump As It Gains Uniswap Listing After already securing a listing on CoinMarketCap, ETFSwap (ETFS) has now made a notable debut on Uniswap , where investors are quickly moving to seize its new opportunities. After completing over 575% pump in its presale, where it sold over 900 million of its tokens and accumulated nearly $10 million in revenue, ETFSwap (ETFS) is presenting a fresh new chance for both old and new investors to reap higher ROI. Considering its wider audience on a prominent exchange platform like Uniswap, ETFSwap (ETFS) is set to utilize this opportunity to deliver 12,000% more returns to its investors. This surge is slated to raise the value of the ETFS token to $4, potentially giving early investors ROIs in multiple folds. Beyond ETFSwap‚Äôs potential for a massive price surge now that it has listed on Uniswap, the platform offers even more lucrative opportunities, as well as unique features that could spark an unprecedented upsurge for the token. For starters, this newly listed altcoin project functions as a fully decentralized platform that allows investors to trade tokenized ETF assets from several financial markets. These include cryptocurrency, commodities, bonds and amplified-based ETFs. Aside from this, all of its ETF products have been backed by Real World Assets, with its smart contract already audited by CyberScope. With an additional KYC verification by SolidProof, ETFSwap (ETFS) not only captures investors‚Äô trust but also shows its potential for a large adoption rate due to its diverse investment options. To top it off, ETFSwap‚Äôs native token, ETFS, offers even more benefits and lucrative opportunities that investors can take advantage of. In addition to being able to buy, own and swap ETFs with cryptocurrencies, users can earn rewards up to 87% APR yield through its staking opportunities. Additionally, there‚Äôs a 36% passive income set aside for those who stake their tokens. ETFSwap (ETFS) also offers distinct AI-powered tools that help investors filter, track, and screen ETF assets so they can make smart ETF investment decisions. Conclusion Although the Dogecoin price is set to reach new price targets in this bull cycle, ETFSwap (ETFS) stands as a better investment option. The platform offers some of the best features for an ETF and crypto trading platform, including 24/7 ETF trading access and live price tracking. These capabilities enable users to make significant profits. With its recent Uniswap listing , massive adoption for the token is expected, making now the perfect time to invest in the ETFS token. According to market experts, investors stand a huge chance to earn big when the token rallies by 12,000% to $4. So, savvy investors should do well to buy now when the price is still affordable and position for ROIs up to 12,000%.

The popular index lists the top 100 largest non-financial companies, including global giants like Amazon, Apple, Nvidia, Meta, and more. This happened after the November 29, 2024, market snapshot found Michael Saylor‚Äôs company with a market cap of around $92B, making it the 40th biggest company on the Nasdaq 100. Can Bitcoin Hit a New ATH with Microstrategy‚Äôs Achievement? Michael Saylor is an active Bitcoin supporter and has sworn to buy Bitcoin despite the price. More importantly, he believes in this token‚Äôs potential, firstly about hitting the $100k mark and later reaching millions over the next few years. With such belief, Microstrategy has 234,650 BTC , worth $43 billion. With that, they have built their strong portfolio but are also building investor confidence, eventually favoring the token‚Äôs price growth. At the time of reporting, Bitcoin is at $101.5k after moving 2% from the ATH of $103.9k. Although the difference is minor, the token is struggling to accomplish the same target again for days. However, the eyes are now on Michael Saylor‚Äôs inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 to affect the Bitcoin price positively. Interestingly, the BTC price has had a minor recovery on the charts past this news, reaching $102.5k earlier in the day. Interestingly, this was the biggest recovery since earlier ATH. Additionally, the buying pressure is strongly persistent on the token. With this buying pressure, high adoption, talks of Bitcoin reserve in multiple parts of the world, Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration, and many other factors, including this firm‚Äôs new achievement, the Bitcoin is to end the year on a positive note. More importantly, the Bitcoin price might hit $108.9K , before the year ends and higher in 2025. CZ Summarised Michael Saylor Firm‚Äôs Strategy in Four Words While sharing the news of the Nasdaq 100, including the business intelligence company, a popular strategist, Jeff Park, shared a one-page executive summary of the firm. The X post conveyed a summary titled ‚ÄúTheory of MicroStrategy,‚Äù but CZ summarised it into just words, joking about the Bitcoin-obsessed company. CZ commented, ‚ÄòBuy bitcoins and hold‚Äô referencing Microstrategy‚Äôs strategies and kidding that they are all about buying this token. More importantly, he said his summary is shorter than the intro line.

Bottom Line Michael Saylor‚Äôs company began buying Bitcoin around four years ago, and in this time, it has built a wealth of $43.18 billion with one of the most promising crypto to buy . Its exponential growth has helped the demand growth persistently, leading to worldwide adoptions. With that, the Bitcoin price recently hit an ATH at $103.9k, and analysts believe the price to hit even $150k by 2025 end, in which Microstrategy might play a bigger role, especially with its inclusion in the Nasdaq 100. This milestone is likely to bring positive sentiments to the industry and the token. Additionally, there are many other factors which would contribute to this journey.

The analyst suggests that if XRP‚Äôs price movement continues to mirror its 2017 trajectory, the cryptocurrency might be on the cusp of a significant breakout. However, it may follow a brief period of consolidation. fyi, if $XRP does still continue to follow 2017, we likely continue to consolidate for another 2 weeks until Christmas time then, we make our face melting move up for about a month until late January pic.twitter.com/E9MH8ljNXG ‚Äî Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy) December 13, 2024 Analysis Overview Charting Guy highlighted that XRP might consolidate until Christmas. Following this, a dramatic upward movement, similar to the one observed in late 2017, could occur, lasting about a month until late January. This projection aligns with historical trends where XRP experienced sharp rallies after periods of accumulation and low volatility. This perspective is supported by the historical price chart included in the discussion. The chart showcases key moments in XRP‚Äôs price history, including its massive rally in late 2017 and its similar, although shorter-lived, rally in early 2021. The ongoing consolidation period in late 2024 and early 2025 appears to fit the cyclical behavior seen in previous market cycles. Community Commentary Adding to the analysis, an X user, Bassi, provided further insight into how the timing of these potential movements could align with broader narratives. Bassi speculated that a rally around December 30 could be attributed to Christmas hype or Ripple‚Äôs stable coin (RLUSD) related developments. Furthermore, they projected January 20 as a potential peak, coinciding with the U.S. Presidential Inauguration Day. This date could mark a turning point for XRP, with the community likely labeling any subsequent downturn as a ‚Äúsell the news‚Äù event. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Factors Influencing the Outlook The discussion underscores several factors that could influence XRP‚Äôs price trajectory: Historical Patterns: XRP‚Äôs past rallies have often followed long periods of consolidation, suggesting that the current phase might precede significant price action. Market Sentiment: Speculative narratives, such as the holiday season or major institutional developments, often play a role in driving short-term price movements in the cryptocurrency market. Macro Events: Broader market conditions, including regulatory developments, macroeconomic trends, and Bitcoin‚Äôs price performance, are likely to have an indirect impact on XRP‚Äôs trajectory. Ripple Developments: Any updates from Ripple, such as progress in adoption or partnerships , could also act as catalysts for price movements.

The trader Ali Martinez tells his 98,500 followers on the social media platform X that social volume and positive sentiment around Aave‚Äôs native token are skyrocketing. ‚ÄúWith the crowd‚Äôs growing focus on AAVE, a brief pullback might be on the horizon, as markets often move against popular sentiment.‚Äù Source: Ali Martinez/X AAVE, the 34th-ranked crypto asset by market cap, is trading at $384.85 at time of writing. Turning to Litecoin, Martinez says that LTC is ‚Äúirrelevant, both fundamentally and technically.‚Äù The analyst argues that Litecoin hasn‚Äôt added anything significant to the crypto industry in terms of innovation. ‚ÄúAnd let‚Äôs not forget: [Litecoin creator] Charlie Lee famously sold all his Litecoin at the top in 2017. If the creator doesn‚Äôt believe in his project enough to hold it, why should I? If the fundamentals don‚Äôt convince you, the technicals should. Litecoin is trading at the same price today as it was in 2017. That‚Äôs seven years of going nowhere. In an industry defined by innovation and growth, LTC stands out as a project stuck in time. It hasn‚Äôt made a new all-time high since its peak in 2017 and has been consolidating in the same range ever since.

Homo Shiba Inu (HOMOSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address ‚Äì 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOSHIB.

The highly anticipated ""Santa rally"" seems increasingly out of reach as macroeconomic uncertainty weighs heavily on the market. Several major cryptocurrencies are underperforming today, with notable losers including SUI ( $SUI ), down 6.5% after peaking at its all-time high of $4.89 last Friday, along with PEPE ($PEPE ), BONK ($BONK ), and Polkadot ($DOT ), all dropping roughly 6%. Adding to the downturn, Cardano ($ADA ), Fantom ($FTM ), and Hedera ($HBAR ‚Äì click for full insight) have each fallen by over 5%, reflecting a broad retreat across the altcoin market. The global crypto market cap currently sits at $3.6 trillion, marking a 1.2% decline in the past 24 hours, while trading volume has dropped sharply by 23.93% (typical for Saturday). Bitcoin 's dominance has increased slightly to 55.74%, as investors shift toward safer bets amid the growing uncertainty. Meanwhile, the Altcoin Season Index on CoinMarketCapsuggests Bitcoin remains firmly in control of the market, leaving altcoins struggling to gain traction. It‚Äôs easy to feel pessimistic in moments like these, but seasoned investors know the drill. After all, if you‚Äôve been through a few of these wild four-year cycles, the strategy remains the same: zoom out, ignore the noise, and prepare for strategic buying opportunities. Let‚Äôs break down the market leader, the king of cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin ($BTC): The Rectangle Pattern and $74K Support Let‚Äôs first address the elephant in the room: the rectangle pattern that formed back in February this year, shortly after the spot ETF approval in January 2024. This pattern broke to the upside on the election results, hitting its full target of $99,000 perfectly before becoming a strong resistance level (now flipped into main short-term support). Now, the rectangle‚Äôs upper edge at $74,000 is playing a critical support role, often considered the ‚Äúline in the sand‚Äù for many BTC investors. Adding further support to this rectangle is the 200-day moving average (green line), which currently sits at $69,000 and is gaining upside momentum. Historically, the 200-day MA serves as a strong dynamic support in bull markets. However, Bitcoin‚Äôs significant decoupling above this level also raises concerns of a potential return-to-mean scenario, which could see the price retrace to align with this long-term trend. Have a good look at 1d: If $74,000 were to break with confirmation, it could trigger a wave of exits, with the next logical stop being a test of the rectangle‚Äôs bottom around $49,000‚Äì$50,000. While such a correction doesn‚Äôt have to happen (or at least not until the next bear market), it‚Äôs worth noting that a breakdown to $74K would represent a 27-28% retracement from the ATH. Brutal as it sounds, this would be a relatively normal correction within a BTC bull market. The $107K Bull Flag: Still in Play? One of the most significant bullish macro formations for Bitcoin this year began with the SEC‚Äôs groundbreaking ETF approval. The January‚ÄìMay 2024 bull flag (green on the 1D chart) remains active, with a clear target at $107,000. This target is no joke, especially since the flag‚Äôs lower trendline extension has acted as a reversal point three times, reinforcing its significance. Interestingly, on the 4-hour chart, another bullish pennant pattern (purple) mirrors this flag‚Äôs target at $107,500. Two independent patterns aligning at the same price level give further weight to this target, making it a key projected take-profit zone. This alignment of patterns illustrates Bitcoin‚Äôs broader bullish potential, provided short-term challenges don‚Äôt derail momentum. The Rising Wedge and Current Challenges While the long-term outlook points higher, BTC is currently trapped in a rising wedge on the 4-hour chart, a bearish pattern by classical charting standards. Notably, the wedge‚Äôs bottom was formed by two significant December flash crashes, which now act as critical levels to watch. $101,000 is holding‚Äîfor now. While Bitcoin briefly broke above six figures, the breakout lacked volume confirmation and momentum, leaving the price vulnerable to a pullback. By the time you read this, the $100K+ price might already be history. If the rising wedge breaks down, the target aligns almost perfectly with the 0.382 Fibonacci level just below $87,000. A close below $90,000 would also invalidate the bullish pennant pattern, significantly weakening the bullish case. Momentum Check: RSI Signals Mixed but Worrisome The daily RSI remains relatively ‚Äòbullish‚Äô, currently holding just above 64 after cooling down from an overbought period in November. This steady position is supported by a strong RSI trendline that has been rising since August 2024 (visible in the chart as the red trendline). As long as RSI respects this trendline and continues its gradual upward movement, Bitcoin retains the momentum for further gains. However, concerns arise when we analyze the 4-hour RSI, which reveals signs of exhaustion. The RSI only reached 76 during BTC‚Äôs December 5 ATH of $103,700, forming a lower high compared to earlier overbought readings. This is an example of bearish divergence, where price makes a higher high while RSI makes a lower high. In simpler terms, this means that while the price climbed, the underlying momentum weakened‚Äîa classic red flag that often precedes corrections or consolidations. Adding to the mixed sentiment, volume during BTC‚Äôs breakout above $100,000 was lackluster, a classic red flag for sustainability in bullish price action. As of now, Bitcoin remains bullish as long as it holds above the 50-day SMA (yellow line) on the daily chart, currently sitting near $99,000, which also aligns with a key horizontal support level. For bulls to regain full control, the wedge must be invalidated by a strong daily close above $103,000, preferably with a notable volume spike. Key Ideas to Trade This Breakout Above $103K: A strong daily close above $103,000 with a clear volume spike would invalidate the wedge and signal momentum to target $107K. Watch for follow-through on the 4-hour timeframe to confirm the breakout. Trading the Wedge: Use the lower trendline of the wedge for potential long entries on price reversals. Confirmation can come from bullish candle patterns (e.g., hammers) or RSI rebounding from oversold zones. Do Nothing: The safest strategy is most likely to just wait. With the FOMC meeting looming on Wednesday, markets are likely to remain hesitant. Instead, consider scouting for entry points to capitalize on a likely retracement (Sunday to Monday night would be my guess). Summary: A Complicated Saturday Night As of Saturday night, Bitcoin remains in a delicate situation. Trading above the short-term bullish 50 SMA (yellow line) on the daily chart and holding the horizontal support at $99,000 keeps BTC in a bullish posture. However, for the king to truly stay strong on this timeframe, the rising wedge must be invalidated with a strong close above $103,000, preferably backed by a significant volume spike. Adding to the complexity, the Fear & Greed Index has returned to Extreme Greed (80) territory, following a brief dip during recent liquidations. Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/ The problem? Those liquidations failed to reset sentiment properly, leaving the market overly optimistic without clearing enough leverage. This makes the current setup even more perilous, as excessive greed often precedes sharp corrections. Meanwhile, the Altcoin Season Index currently sits at 60, signaling a phase of indecision. While the index remains above neutral territory, the sharp drop from last week's 83 confirms what we‚Äôre seeing across the market: altcoin season is suspended‚Äînot entirely called off, but certainly losing steam. Altcoins will likely continue struggling until Bitcoin (and $ETH ‚Äì link to analysis) either consolidates with strength or resolves its current patterns. Let‚Äôs be real‚Äîthis article could feel outdated by Monday if BTC does print a decisive candle soon to target the bullish patterns described. December, despite Moonvember‚Äôs fantastic run, has been tougher than expected. The crypto market is undoubtedly more complex now than last month‚Äîor even last weekend. The easy part of this bull market is over. Santa or no Santa, things are about to get wild. And when Trump takes office alongside the new, allegedly crypto-friendly leadership, we‚Äôll be in for a market environment no one‚Äôs truly prepared for.Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The analyst also suggested that XRP‚Äôs next move could happen sooner than expected. Next Major Support And Resistance Levels For The XRP Price In an X post, Dark Defender mentioned $2.42, $2.52, $2.71, and $5.85 as the next major support levels for the XRP price. Meanwhile, the crypto analyst highlighted $2.29, $2.24, $2.10, and $2.02 as the next major support levels for XRP. The analyst made these remarks while also alluding to a bull flag structure that had formed on XRP‚Äôs daily chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Dominance And Altcoin Season: What The Sudden Volatility Means For The Market Dark Defender asserted that the XRP price would make its next move by tomorrow, noting that the current bull flag had reached its limit. The crypto analyst had recently highlighted a weekly bull flag on the XRP chart, which showed that the crypto could reach double digits in this market cycle. In his most recent X post, Dark Defender also provided an update on his XRP/BTC pair analysis. He stated that what was expected from the XRP price was coming and suggested that it might have already begun. Before now, the analyst predicted that XRP would record ‚Äútremendous‚Äù gains against its Bitcoin pair. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted a bull flag forming on the XRP price‚Äôs 4-hour chart. Based on this pattern, the analyst stated that XRP could experience a brief correction, then break out above $2.46 and rally to $4, which would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for XRP. Two Possible Scenarios For The Third Wave In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades outlined two possible scenarios for the third wave of the XRP price‚Äôs move to the upside. In the first scenario, XRP could record a typical move, extending to the 2.618 Fibonacci level. This puts the price target at $3.82, the crypto‚Äôs current ATH. Related Reading: Bitcoin Daily Bollinger Bands Expand, Why BTC Price Could Rise To $120,000 As Early As Next Week Meanwhile, for the second scenario, CasiTrades stated that if this third wave doesn‚Äôt extend, the XRP price could record the extension play in the fifth wave. If the third wave doesn‚Äôt extend, the price target will be $3.23 instead of $3.82. She added that this target is near XRP‚Äôs current ATH, so the extension play might not occur. CaiTrades cautioned that these are just projections and that the XRP price could adjust with the actual highs. However, she is confident that a big move is coming, as XRP has consolidated with minimal movement over the last day. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.51, up over 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Over the past few days, while the majority of cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP, appear to be struggling to rally, HNT has gained 30% in value following a recent decline. Helium (HNT) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, HNT‚Äôs recent upside momentum has brought it to a crucial resistance level at $9.5. However, this marks the third time HNT has tested this level, and it appears to be weakening. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if HNT breaches this level and closes a daily candle above $9.85, there is a strong possibility that the asset could soar by 22% to reach the $12 level in the near future. Despite a notable rally, HNT‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 65, which is below the overbought region, suggesting that the asset has enough room to continue its upward movement in the coming days. On the positive side, the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe indicates an uptrend, as it lies below HNT‚Äôs current price. HNT‚Äôs Rising Open Interest HNT‚Äôs technical analysis is further supported by on-chain metrics. According to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass , HNT‚Äôs futures open interest has surged by 24%, reflecting traders‚Äô strong interest and confidence in the token as it approaches a crucial breakout. When combining on-chain metrics with technical analysis, it appears that bulls have entered the market and could support the altcoin in breaching the resistance level this time. Current Price Momentum Currently, HNT is trading near $9.47 and has experienced a price jump of over 13.10% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume skyrocketed by 265%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors driven by HNT‚Äôs bullish outlook.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|HNT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-15 02:14:28

Trump‚Äôs Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump‚Äôs Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump‚Äôs Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump‚Äôs Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump‚Äôs Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump‚Äôs Tariffs by entering its contract address ‚Äì 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR.

VanEck Forecasts Bitcoin Soaring To $180,000 VanEck predicts that the crypto bull market will reach a ‚Äúmedium-term peak‚Äù in the first quarter of 2025, followed by new all-time highs by the year‚Äôs end. The firm estimates Bitcoin could soar to approximately $180,000, while Ethereum (ETH) may exceed $6,000, Solana (SOL) could surpass $500, and Sui (SUI) might reach over $10. The report further suggests that the United States will begin to embrace Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, as President-elect Donald Trump promised, anticipating an increase in overall crypto adoption. Related Reading: Australia‚Äôs Biggest Pension Fund Makes Historic $17M Bitcoin Investment, A National First With anticipated changes in leadership at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), numerous spot crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) are also expected to be approved. This includes Ethereum ETPs featuring staking options, as well as in-kind transaction capabilities for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Per the report, the asset manager forecasts that the value of tokenized securities will exceed $50 billion in the coming months, following a 61% growth to $12 billion throughout this year. Most of this value currently resides on permissioned chains, but 2025 is expected to be a breakthrough year, particularly as organizations like the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) explore bridging public and private blockchains. The firm projects that stablecoins will revolutionize payment systems, with daily settlement volumes potentially tripling to reach $300 billion by the end of 2025. This growth, driven by increased adoption in global commerce, remittances, and integration with major technology and payment networks, would position stablecoins to handle transactions equivalent to 5% of DTCC‚Äôs daily volumes. DeFi To Hit All-Time Highs Another intriguing prediction is the rise of one million new AI agents, which VanEck describes as ‚Äúdigital workers‚Äù that autonomously execute tasks or make decisions. These agents are expected to generate significant on-chain activity as they expand their roles beyond decentralized finance (DeFi) into areas such as social media, gaming, and consumer applications. VanEck anticipates that Bitcoin Layer-2 solutions will accumulate a total value locked (TVL) of 100,000 BTC, building on an impressive 600% growth in 2024 that brought the TVL to 30,000 BTC. The report forecasts that Ethereum‚Äôs blob space will generate $1 billion in fees, spurred by the rapid adoption of Layer-2 solutions, rollup optimizations, and high-fee use cases such as tokenized assets and enterprise applications. VanEck predicts that decentralized finance (DeFi) will hit all-time highs, with decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes reaching $4 trillion and total value locked in DeFi rising to $200 billion. This growth will reportedly be fueled by AI-related tokens, consumer-facing decentralized applications (dApps), and the tokenization of assets that drive liquidity and user adoption. Related Reading: Solana Price On The Rise: Key Resistance At $235 Could Spark Major Breakout The non-fungible token (NFT) market is expected to rebound, with trading volumes projected to reach $30 billion in 2025. Despite recent downturns, standout projects like Pudgy Penguins and Miladys have managed to thrive by leveraging strong community ties and transitioning into consumer brands. Finally, VanEck forecasts that decentralized application (dApp) tokens will narrow the performance gap with Layer-1 tokens. In 2024, Layer-1 blockchain tokens outperformed dApp tokens by a factor of two, but innovative dApps in artificial intelligence and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) are anticipated to drive a shift in performance dynamics. At the time of writing, the market‚Äôs leading crypto has managed to reclaim the $101,820 level, recording a 2% increase in the 24-hour time frame.

Dogwifhat (WIF), a Solana-based token, recently skyrocketed by an incredible 12,000%, grabbing the attention of investors everywhere. While such explosive growth is not uncommon in the crypto space, it raises questions about the sustainability and true value of these tokens. Amidst the hype, the Lightchain AI ($LCAI) Presale stands out as a compelling opportunity, merging artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to deliver a project focused on real utility and long-term growth. This article takes a closer look at Dogwifhat‚Äôs recent success and dives into whether Lightchain AI has the potential to match‚Äîor even outperform‚Äîthis level of remarkable growth. Dogwifhat (WIF): The Rise of a Meme-Inspired Token Dogwifhat is a cryptocurrency operating on the Solana blockchain, celebrated for its meme-driven identity and community-centric growth strategy. Unlike traditional blockchain projects with clear utility or technological innovation, Dogwifhat thrives on the viral nature of its brand, leveraging social media and community engagement. Factors Behind Dogwifhat‚Äôs 12,000% Growth Community Engagement: Dogwifhat‚Äôs growth has been driven largely by its passionate community, which fuels its momentum through viral campaigns and online promotions. Low Entry Barrier: The token‚Äôs affordable price before its surge made it an attractive option for speculative investors. Speculation and Hype: Like many meme coins, Dogwifhat‚Äôs meteoric rise can be attributed to speculative trading, with investors hoping to capitalize on short-term gains. Challenges Ahead for Dogwifhat Sustainability: Meme-driven tokens often struggle to maintain their value over the long term without tangible utility. Volatility: The token‚Äôs reliance on market sentiment makes it prone to sharp declines once the hype subsides. Lightchain AI ($LCAI): Built for Long-Term Growth While Dogwifhat‚Äôs rise is a testament to the power of community-driven tokens, Lightchain AI presents a stark contrast with its focus on utility, innovation, and real-world applications. Lightchain AI integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to address key challenges such as scalability, transparency, and efficiency. Key Features of Lightchain AI Proof of Intelligence (PoI): A groundbreaking consensus mechanism that rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations, combining blockchain security with practical utility. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): A revolutionary environment designed to optimize AI-specific tasks, enabling applications in healthcare, finance, and logistics. Sustainability: By minimizing wasteful computations, Lightchain AI ensures energy efficiency, aligning with global environmental goals. Lightchain AI‚Äôs Real-World Applications Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Enhancing predictive analytics for risk management and investment strategies. Healthcare: Enabling AI-powered diagnostics and personalized medical solutions. Supply Chain Management: Improving transparency and accountability in logistics. Can Lightchain AI Replicate Dogwifhat‚Äôs 12,000% Success? Comparing Growth Drivers Hype vs Utility: Dogwifhat‚Äôs growth is fueled by social media buzz and speculative trading, whereas Lightchain AI‚Äôs value lies in its tangible applications and technological advancements. Community Engagement: Both projects benefit from strong community support, but Lightchain AI‚Äôs decentralized governance model ensures active participation in shaping its ecosystem. Scalability: While Dogwifhat relies on Solana‚Äôs infrastructure, Lightchain AI‚Äôs innovative consensus mechanism and AIVM offer unparalleled scalability and efficiency. Factors Favoring Lightchain AI Sustainable Growth: Lightchain AI‚Äôs focus on utility and innovation positions it for consistent growth, avoiding the pitfalls of speculative bubbles. Market Differentiation: By addressing real-world challenges, Lightchain AI appeals to a broader range of investors and industries. Presale Opportunity: The ongoing Lightchain AI presale offers early investors a chance to participate in a project with significant growth potential, starting at just $0.001125 per token. The Path Forward: Challenges and Opportunities For Dogwifhat (WIF): Sustaining Momentum: Maintaining its community-driven momentum will require innovative strategies to keep investors engaged. Expanding Utility: Developing tangible use cases could help Dogwifhat transition from a meme coin to a more sustainable asset. For Lightchain AI ($LCAI): Scaling Adoption: Building partnerships across industries will be crucial for demonstrating the platform‚Äôs utility. Navigating Competition: Competing with established blockchain platforms like Ethereum and Solana will require continuous innovation. Educating Investors: Communicating the value of its technology and applications will help attract a diverse investor base. Which Is the Better Investment? Why Choose Dogwifhat (WIF)?

Bitcoin Adoption Surges Among Nations And Major Corporations Hamada‚Äôs proposal reflects a broader interest in diversifying national reserves with cryptocurrencies, particularly following recent discussions in the Japanese parliament about reserve movements in the US and other countries. This surge in interest comes on the heels of Texas‚Äôs significant legislative efforts. The Texas House of Representatives has introduced a bill aimed at creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve, spearheaded by Republican state Representative Giovanni Capriglione. Related Reading: Australia‚Äôs Biggest Pension Fund Makes Historic $17M Bitcoin Investment, A National First The proposed legislation seeks to enable the state to accept taxes, fees, and donations in Bitcoin, with a commitment to hold these assets for a minimum of five years. Capriglione, who announced the bill during an X Spaces event, emphasized the potential benefits of such a reserve in enhancing Texas‚Äôs fiscal stability and reinforcing its leadership in Bitcoin innovation. ‚ÄúProbably the biggest enemy of our investments is inflation,‚Äù he stated, highlighting that a strategic Bitcoin reserve could provide a win-win scenario for the state. The legislation, titled ‚ÄúAn Act Relating to the Establishment of a Bitcoin Reserve within the State Treasury of Texas and the Management of Cryptocurrencies by Governmental Entities,‚Äù underscores a significant trend of increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Notably, this movement is not limited to nations; following President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs proposal for a US strategic Bitcoin reserve at the National Bitcoin Conference in Nashville earlier this year, there has been a marked uptick in BTC adoption among various countries and private companies. Bitcoinist previously reported that in just the past month, nine major firms from sectors including finance, healthcare, and artificial intelligence (AI) have embraced the market‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency as a strategic reserve asset. October 2025 As Next Major BTC Market Top? As these developments unfold, BTC has recently closed the week above the $100,000 mark, fueling speculation about its future trajectory. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has pointed out that if Bitcoin adheres to historical trends observed in previous market cycles, the next market peak could occur in October 2025. The analyst noted that in the last two cycles, from market bottom to market top, it took approximately 1,065 days, while the duration from one market bottom to the next was around 1,430 days. Related Reading: Dogecoin Will See New ATH Soon ‚Äì Top Trader Sets $2 Target Martinez also identified a critical support level for Bitcoin at $96,870, where approximately 1.45 million addresses accumulated around 1.42 million BTC.

At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $101,477, up 2% on the week after a brief consolidation period and a 7% drop towards $91,000.

Elon‚Äôs Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon‚Äôs Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon‚Äôs Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon‚Äôs Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon‚Äôs Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon‚Äôs Gold by entering its contract address ‚Äì 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|FIAT|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-15 03:49:00

This development is expected to enhance Shibarium‚Äôs utility and accessibility for the broader crypto community. Integration Confirmed Bitget Wallet recently added Shibarium to its list of supported blockchains. The news came to light through a post shared on X by Shibarium Update, a channel dedicated to Shiba Inu developments. The post included a screenshot as evidence of the integration and confirmed that users can now access the blockchain‚Äôs features through the wallet. Notably, Bitget has not released an official statement regarding the integration. Furthermore, while the blockchain is supported on the Bitget Wallet, it has not yet been incorporated into the Bitget exchange. Great news for the #BoneArmy and #SHIBARMY ! Shibarium has now been integrated into the Bitget Wallet (not the exchange yet). #Shibarium #Bone #ShibEcosystem pic.twitter.com/UOdDYILmd7 ‚Äî Shibarium Updates (@Shibizens) December 11, 2024 Expanded Functionality for Users The integration allows Bitget Wallet users to interact with it in various ways, including storing, transferring, swapping, and staking assets within the ecosystem. This new functionality is expected to encourage greater participation in the blockchain network, potentially boosting transaction volumes and user engagement. Bitget Wallet, launched in May 2018, has established itself as a trusted platform for storing and managing cryptocurrency assets. Its significant user base provides an opportunity to expose Shibarium to millions of new users, further expanding the reach of the Layer-2 blockchain. Recent Milestones The Shibarium network has demonstrated consistent growth since its launch in August 2023. Recently, the blockchain surpassed two major milestones, including reaching over 2 million wallet addresses and exceeding 600 million total transactions. As of now , the transaction count has risen to approximately 645.74 million, with an average daily transaction volume of 4.58 million. These statistics highlight the growing adoption of Shibarium, underscoring its potential as a major player in the blockchain space. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Adoption Among Wallets and Exchanges Despite its progress, the integration into major crypto platforms remains limited. Only a few leading exchanges, such as Gate.io and BluBit , have incorporated Shibarium into their services. Additionally, wallets like Frontier and GroveX have integrated Shibarium into their platforms, while MetaMask users can access the blockchain via the Chainlist feature. The community continues to advocate for broader adoption of the blockchain, urging major platforms like Binance, Coinbase, and Ledger to offer support. These efforts are part of a larger push to establish Shibarium as a widely accessible and versatile Layer-2 solution. The integration of Shibarium into Bitget Wallet represents a pivotal step forward for the ecosystem. With Bitget‚Äôs extensive global user base, the move has the potential to drive significant growth and activity on the network. As the community continues to push for broader adoption across exchanges and wallets, the network‚Äôs trajectory remains promising.

This surge highlights Bitcoin‚Äôs resilience and growing institutional acceptance and casts a spotlight on emerging altcoins poised to disrupt the market. Among these is RCO Finance (RCOF) , an undervalued altcoin that investors are beginning to recognize for its potential to skyrocket by an astonishing 50,000%. As the market evolves, Bitcoin and innovative altcoins like RCOF are poised for a major market bull run that aims to push the crypto market cap to a new ATH. Bitcoin Price Targets 120,000 Amid Market-Wide Crypto Surge Bitcoin price has once again captivated the financial world, breaking the $102,000 barrier as the cryptocurrency sector reached a valuation of $3.5 trillion. This rally comes amid significant developments, including bullish comments from President-elect Donald Trump. Trump‚Äôs suggestion of adding Bitcoin to a strategic reserve and unveiling a crypto-friendly agenda spurred market optimism. The crypto market‚Äôs performance over the last 24 hours highlights the space‚Äôs sheer volatility, with $298.5 million liquidated across long and short contracts. While institutional players continue to embrace Bitcoin, this surge reflects renewed confidence in the cryptocurrency‚Äôs role as a hedge against economic instability. The Bitcoin price climb has set the stage for an altcoin boom, with innovative projects like RCO Finance (RCOF) poised to ride the wave of bullish sentiment. As the Bitcoin price builds up toward the $120,000 mark, the race for the next breakout star intensifies, and RCOF‚Äôs explosive potential cannot be overlooked. RCO Finance: The Undervalued Altcoin Set for a Meteoric Rise RCO Finance (RCOF) is not your average altcoin. While many altcoins rely on hype, RCOF is carving its niche with robust use cases and an ecosystem for long-term growth. Its decentralized services platform offers unparalleled scalability, lower transaction costs, and groundbreaking liquidity protocols. At the heart of RCO Finance‚Äôs appeal is its AI-powered Robo Advisor, a groundbreaking tool designed to tailor investment strategies to individual users. This advanced system analyzes vast amounts of historical and real-time market data, allowing it to provide personalized recommendations based on each investor‚Äôs financial goals and risk tolerance. Unlike traditional platforms that leave users to trade alone, the Robo Advisor is a trusted companion, continuously adjusting portfolios in response to market fluctuations. This feature mitigates emotional biases often associated with trading and empowers investors to make informed decisions confidently. Another key feature distinguishing RCO Finance is its Automated Market Making (AMM) mechanism. This fully automated trading platform utilizes cutting-edge AI and machine learning technologies to optimize trade execution. RCO Finance also addresses one of the major challenges in the crypto space: the disconnect between DeFi and TradFi. Through its Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, RCOF allows users to use cryptos to invest in tangible assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. This capability broadens investment opportunities and simplifies transactions by eliminating the need for fiat conversions. As a result, RCOF users can diversify their portfolios across various asset classes without facing the typical barriers associated with traditional investing. RCOF prioritizes security by conducting regular smart contract audits by SolidProof and adopting a non-KYC approach, which provides privacy while ensuring compliance with necessary regulations. With a secure no KYC debit card, investors can access their holdings for daily transactions anywhere in the world. RCO Finance Promises 500x ROI for Investors The current Bitcoin price rally, with its target of $120,000, has injected positive momentum into the altcoin and presale sectors, significantly benefiting RCO Finance (RCOF) . Sales of RCOF tokens have surged, crossing the $9 million milestone and boosting investor confidence in the project. The presale is currently in Stage 4, with each RCOF token priced at $0.0778. Users can also apply the code RCOF25 to receive an additional 25% in tokens with their purchase. With the anticipated listing price of $0.60, investors will gain over 700% ROI once the token hits the market. Analysts predict a 50,000% bull run as RCO Finance gains traction and expands its market presence. Investors participating in this presale will acquire tokens at a fraction of their anticipated future value and access exclusive benefits within the RCO Finance ecosystem. Holding RCOF altcoins grants users voting rights on key platform decisions and eligibility for community rewards exceeding $100,000. This creates an engaging environment where investors can actively participate in shaping the future of RCO Finance while reaping potential financial rewards. As the Bitcoin price aims for new heights in its rally, altcoins like RCO Finance are emerging as promising contenders ready to capture investor interest. Don‚Äôt miss your chance to be part of this exciting journey. Instead, invest in RCO Finance today and position yourself for potential generational wealth!

The altcoin is down by more than seven percent in the last seven days. XRP is still technically within a larger bull market, with no confirmed lower highs or lows on the weekly time frame. Over the last couple of weeks, XRP has experienced a short-term bearish trend within the larger bullish market. Price Prediction Currently, XRP is testing the support levels between $2.33 and $2.40. There is potential for a short-term bounce from this range, but if the price fails to hold above these levels, it may drop to the next support area between $2.00 and $2.23. If XRP manages to hold above $2.40, a break above the $2.62 level could trigger a rally toward $3.00 and possibly test the all-time highs near $3.25. Support and Resistance Levels The main resistance zone is between $2.90 and $3.00, which is the level to watch for potential price rejection. On the downside, the first key support lies between $2.33 and $2.40. If XRP drops below this level, the next support is between $2.00 and $2.23. The upper boundary of the trend channel is also acting as support. A break above this level could lead to a more aggressive breakout, but it will depend on how the price moves in the coming days. Analyst Weighs In According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, if XRP closes below $2.40, especially under $2.29, it could signal a drop toward support levels around $1.90. Strong support is found around $2, where previous resistance is now acting as new support. If XRP maintains this support, it could continue its upward movement. He said that XRP is showing possible signs of a reversal but lacks sufficient confirmation for a solid bullish breakout.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-15 04:04:43

Musk‚Äôs lawyer, Alex Spiro, recently accused the SEC of a harassment campaign against Musk and his companies, including Neuralink. The SEC has given Musk a 48-hour ultimatum to settle and has issued subpoenas. In response to the SEC‚Äôs actions, Musk has gained support from industry leaders. Vivek Ramaswamy, recently appointed to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), criticized the SEC for wasting government resources and frequently losing court cases due to their illegal and unconstitutional rule interpretations. He argued that the SEC‚Äôs actions are undermining public trust in the law. Ripple‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, also weighed in, claiming that Ripple had exposed the SEC‚Äôs lawless tactics early on. Reflecting on their own court case, he pointed out that the SEC has been using litigation to push its own agenda, rather than faithfully following the law. He added that the real issue is how to hold the SEC accountable under its current leadership. He wrote, ‚ÄúThe question isn‚Äôt whether the SEC under Gensler is rogue‚Äîit is. The question is how we hold them accountable?‚Äù Ripple‚Äôs top leaders, along with the crypto industry, celebrated SEC Chairman Gary Gensler‚Äôs upcoming departure. Gensler confirmed he will leave on January 20. Ripple‚Äôs Stuart Alderoty believes that once the regulatory issues are cleared, Ripple will become the top provider of crypto solutions for businesses in the U.S. For the unversed, the SEC has been investigating Elon Musk for delaying the disclosure of his 9.2% stake in Twitter. He only revealed his stake on April 4, 2022, about ten days after surpassing the 5% disclosure threshold required by law. According to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, anyone who acquires at least 5% of a public company must disclose it within ten days.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-15 05:07:58

Sui‚Äôs DEX volume has also surged after an announcement from the Blackpack Exchange. Meanwhile, Rollblock is leading Q4‚Äôs altseason as analysts predict up to 880% ROI for early RBLK investors. Cardano (ADA) Whales Hold Long Positions During Impressive Rally Cardano‚Äôs price was in a brief corrective phase over the last seven days after recording massive 96.48% intra-month gains. Since Cardano‚Äôs concentration indicator has climbed by 0.26% already, analysts believe Cardano whales are holding long positions on the token before an anticipated surge. Cardano‚Äôs large transactions have also increased by 0.52% which suggests high network activity. Cardano is currently trading for $1.14 after an intraday increase worth 5.06%. Cardano‚Äôs volume has decreased by 22.72% which typically suggests decreased selling activity. Since Cardano‚Äôs Momentum and Bull Bear Power indicators are already suggesting bullish dominance, Cardano‚Äôs price could surge towards the $2.5 target before the end of Q4. Sui (SUI) Trading Volume Surges by More than 100% in a Single Day Sui‚Äôs price has rallied by a modest 55.21% over the last 30 days as the broader crypto market entered Q4‚Äôs bull run. Despite this slow growth, Sui has reached a new all-time high price of $4.9 on 12 December. This massive Sui rally is fueled by an announcement from Blackpack Exchange regarding a wallet integration with Sui which triggered a massive rise in Sui‚Äôs DEX volumes. Sui is currently trading for $4.71 after an intraday increase worth 21.85%. Sui‚Äôs volume has also rallied by a massive 113.87% as traders rush to purchase Sui tokens before the price skyrockets any further. Since Sui‚Äôs RSI suggests that there is still room for more growth, analysts expect Sui to reach $7.04 by early 2025. Rollblock (RBLK) Early Investors Enjoy Massive 310% ROI Rollblock is skyrocketing through its presale stages with its viral GambleFi protocol. Not only has Rollblock raised more than $7 million in record time, but its early investors are already enjoying up to 310% ROI. If Rollblock can continue this pace until the end of Q4, analysts are expecting a total of 880% gains for the native RBLK token ahead of its official launch on DEXs and CEXs. The reason why traders are rapidly accumulating RBLK tokens is the project‚Äôs utility. Aside from powering the GambleFi ecosystem, Rollblock‚Äôs investors can also earn a weekly passive income through the platform‚Äôs attractive revenue sharing model. At the end of every week, Rollblock uses up to 30% of its gaming revenue to purchase RBLK tokens on the open market. These tokens are distributed in two categories: 40% are distributed as staking rewards while the remaining 60% are removed from the circulating supply forever. Since the scarce supply creates deflationary pressure on Rollblock, analysts expect the token‚Äôs price to keep increasing in value over time. Aside from reaping these massive rewards, Rollblock investors also get exclusive access to the platform‚Äôs massive gaming library that features 7,000+ AI-powered games. In addition, Rollblock has also announced a new upgrade to its ecosystem which features a betting option. As of last week, Rollblock users can place bets on top sports leagues such as the NBA, NFL, UFC, F1, MMA, LaLiga and more. Even with these exciting features, Rollblock is still selling tokens for a low price of just $0.0415 in stage 9 of its presale. Since analysts are already expecting another price jump before the end of this week, now is the best time to invest in Rollblock at the lowest price it will ever be.

PEPE: A Deflationary Memecoin Inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary memecoin inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme from the early 2000s. Launched on Ethereum, it follows coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. PEPE has no transaction tax and keeps its meme identity without utility. It reached a market cap of $1.6 billion in mid-2023, sparking interest in the crypto world. The roadmap aims to increase visibility through social media trends and exchange listings. It uses a burning mechanism to enhance scarcity and rewards long-term holders. As an ERC-20 token, it benefits from Ethereum‚Äôs security. PEPE is available on Uniswap and major exchanges like Binance. Its deflationary model and strong community may make it attractive in the current market. Dogwifhat (WIF): A New Meme Coin on Solana Inspired by Viral Dog Meme Dogwifhat (WIF) is a new meme coin on the Solana blockchain, inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme. It has gained popularity for its dog-themed concept and community-driven approach. Meme coins like WIF often build strong online communities and spread through viral trends. By operating on Solana, WIF benefits from fast transactions and low fees. The coin focuses on creating a fun and engaging experience for users. In the current market cycle, WIF may attract attention due to its unique theme and the growing interest in meme coins. Its potential lies in community growth and leveraging social media trends. Investors interested in meme coins might find WIF appealing. BONK: Solana‚Äôs Shiba Inu Memecoin Empowering the Community BONK is a Solana-based memecoin with a Shiba Inu mascot that aims to empower the Solana community by redistributing power from venture capital tokens. It surged over 100% after a Coinbase listing and serves as a ‚Äúcommunity coin,‚Äù airdropping 50% of its supply to Solana‚Äôs NFT and DeFi participants. As of mid-December 2023, BONK became the third-largest memecoin by market cap, with a year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Despite challenges like a high total supply and the volatile nature of memecoins, BONK‚Äôs integration into the growing Solana ecosystem, including the launch of the decentralized exchange BonkSwap, positions it as a notable player. The coin looks attractive in the current market cycle. Dogecoin: The Meme Coin Turning into a Crypto Contender Dogecoin (DOGE), launched in 2013, is a cryptocurrency inspired by the Shiba Inu meme. Unlike Bitcoin‚Äôs limited supply, Dogecoin has no maximum limit and adds 10,000 new coins every minute. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer as a lighthearted alternative, it gained massive popularity in 2021. Social media influence, particularly from Elon Musk, propelled it into the top ten cryptocurrencies, with a market value exceeding $50 billion. Dogecoin highlights the power of community and social media in shaping financial markets. Its technology allows for fast transactions, and its active community continues to drive its relevance. The coin‚Äôs potential lies in its widespread acceptance and the enthusiasm of its supporters. Conclusion While coins like PEPE, WIF, BONK, and DOGE show less short-term promise, DOGEN stands out. Tailored for those who aspire to luxury and success, DOGEN is poised for 700% growth by presale‚Äôs end, with potential for massive returns this altcoin season. It builds a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

Here‚Äôs the Bullish Chart,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-foresees-shiba-inu-shib-to-rally-150-heres-why/,"Despite a 10% dip in Shiba Inu‚Äôs (SHIB) price recently, optimism remains strong among analysts who foresee a substantial rally for the token. Predictions suggest that SHIB could rise significantly, approaching its previous all-time high. Market analyst PouyanTradeFX has identified a crucial price level for SHIB that could determine its next significant move. According to a recent analysis shared on TradingView, the token is currently testing a longstanding trendline that has influenced its price movements since 2021. The weekly chart shows that the asset has been in a persistent downtrend since reaching its all-time high of $0.00008616 in October 2021. The token briefly challenged this trendline in March 2024 when it reached $0.00004567. Currently trading at $0.00002822, the digital asset could see a remarkable 163% surge to approximately $0.000074 if it breaks through this resistance level. However, failure to breach the trendline could result in a significant 62% drop to around $0.000011, the analyst warned. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 PouyanTradeFX‚Äôs analysis is part of a broader wave of bullish predictions for the token, even as the cryptocurrency market faces broader challenges. Potential to Erase Another Zero Another analyst, Crypto ELITES, has presented an even more ambitious outlook for SHIB. On December 11, they highlighted the possibility of the token climbing nearly 1,700% to reach $0.00047905, supported by a cup-and-handle pattern observed on its weekly chart. This optimistic forecast hinges on the continued decline of Bitcoin Dominance, which reflects the share of the total market capitalization held by Bitcoin. Bitcoin Dominance has dropped from 61.5% in November to 56.5% currently, indicating a potential shift of capital from Bitcoin to altcoins and meme coins. Recent Performance and Market Sentiment Shiba Inu has experienced a notable price increase of 200% over the past year, demonstrating strong performance compared to many other cryptocurrencies. Despite the current decline, analysts remain confident that the asset is well-positioned for future growth. As market conditions evolve, the asset‚Äôs ability to overcome key resistance levels will likely determine whether these optimistic projections materialize. While substantial gains are possible, investors should also be cautious of the risks highlighted by analysts.

Homo Shiba Inu (HOMOSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address ‚Äì 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-15 06:26:24

Let‚Äôs dive into what makes these meme coins stand out and why they‚Äôre worth your attention. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Presale Powerhouse Ready to Surge If there‚Äôs one presale you can‚Äôt afford to miss, it‚Äôs BTFD Coin .

First, its robust ecosystem includes a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that rewards users while keeping them engaged. Second, its staking rewards offer an impressive 90% APY, making it a long-term income generator. For example, a $650 investment at $0.0001 will get you 6.5 million BTFD coins, which could be worth $3,900 if the price hits $0.0006 after the presale ends. BTFD‚Äôs dedicated community, the Bulls Squad, ensures continued support and market momentum. If you‚Äôre serious about finding the best meme coins for significant returns, BTFD Coin is a no-brainer. 2. Neiro (NEIRO): AI Meets Meme Coin Innovation Neiro is redefining what it means to be a meme coin by integrating artificial intelligence into its ecosystem. It‚Äôs not just about the memes‚Äîit‚Äôs about creating real-world applications that add value for investors. Neiro‚Äôs flagship feature is its AI-powered trading assistant, which provides data-driven insights to help holders make smarter investment decisions. The project is gaining traction for its innovation and the buzz around its upcoming partnerships in the tech space. Why is Neiro a standout? Its ability to blend technology and meme culture positions it as a unique contender in the crypto market, making it one of the best meme coins for significant returns in December 2024. 3. Snek (SNEK): The Meme Coin with Nostalgia and Utility For investors who love nostalgia, Snek is an irresistible choice. Built on the Cardano blockchain, this meme coin takes inspiration from the classic snake game, adding a modern twist with blockchain-based play-to-earn mechanics. Snek has gained significant attention thanks to its seamless integration with the Cardano ecosystem, offering low fees and high scalability. The launch of its play-to-earn platform has increased engagement and demand, making it a hot pick for December. What makes Snek special? Its unique gaming angle and solid blockchain foundation ensure it stands out, offering significant returns for those who get in early. 4.

With this remarkable performance, the asset is forming bullish patterns on its chart, and JD (@jaydee_757), a prominent crypto analyst, has spotted an important one. In a post on X, the analyst drew attention to a breakout from a descending flag pattern on the 4-hour chart. The chart shows that XRP is forming a classic bullish flag after a sharp rally from $1.40 to its recent peak of $2.86. #XRP (4hr) ‚Äì If full candle closes above, this gives us a higher probability of a breakout! If not, expect bottom trendline to hit! Macro view, this chart is irrelevant! ATH is coming! Dumb Money who got REKT for 7 years will DENY! Retweet for updates! TA ALL DAY! $XRP ‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/zovN6Ulv2W ‚Äî JD (@jaydee_757) December 13, 2024 The flag‚Äôs breakout point was identified around the $2.40 range, and at the time of JD‚Äôs analysis, XRP traded at $2.4298, in the early stages of the breakout. JD emphasized the significance of a full-bodied candle closing above the upper trendline of the flag. In his post, he noted, ‚ÄúThe more full body close above the trendline, the higher the breakout probability.‚Äù Such a confirmation could indicate the resumption of XRP‚Äôs upward momentum. In a follow-up post , JD confirmed that XRP closed above the trendline, suggesting a bullish breakout could be underway. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Bullish Flag Pattern and Potential Targets The bullish flag pattern depicted in the chart is a well-known continuation signal. It typically occurs when a steep upward price movement, referred to as the flagpole, is followed by a consolidation phase that trends slightly downward. When the price decisively breaks above the flag‚Äôs resistance, it often signals the start of a new rally with a target price derived by projecting the length of the flagpole from the breakout point. JD did not provide a specific target in his analysis. However, based on JD‚Äôs chart, the implied target for this breakout is well above $3.8. JD noted that a new all-time high is coming, a sentiment shared by other experts . At press time, XRP had dropped slightly, now trading at $2.93, but many experts still believe it can easily close the 37.8% gap required to reclaim its all-time high of $3.84. JD also called out dumb money investors who doubt his analysis. The analyst has previously called out these dumb money investors who missed out on the 2017 rally. Expects expects them to miss out on the current one. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Dogen is the name on everyone‚Äôs lips, hinting at potential gains as high as 15,000% in the near future. Curiosity surrounds this digital coin as investors watch closely to see if it lives up to the hype. DOGEN Rejoys Big Moment: Trump‚Äôs Victory Will Send It to the Moon Guess who is going to join Elon Musk‚Äôs moon mission soon? DOGEN, the boldest meme coin for alpha males, is gearing up for take-off as Trump‚Äôs victory in the recent US election has the entire market euphoric about the prospects of cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins. Donald and Elon are Best Buddies for Meme Coins Donald Trump‚Äôs love for crypto is no secret ‚Äî he‚Äôs promised to make the U.S. the global crypto leader in his campaign. And joining him is none other than Elon Musk , the ultimate Dogecoin (DOGE) fan who‚Äôs backed the crypto movement and even aligned with Republicans earlier this year.

DOGEN will be the Next Star with 500% Surge Following the US election results, Dogecoin (DOGE) has been on a steady rise: from $0.15 to $0.39 in just one week .

Flex Hard, Earn Big ‚Äì DOGEN is Your Power Move! Ethereum‚Äôs Role and Potential in Blockchain Technology Ethereum is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin. It enables smart contracts and a wide range of decentralized applications. The network supports decentralized finance and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon, which enhance transaction efficiency. Ethereum introduced ERC-20 tokens for governance, utility, and value storage, but Ether (ETH) is still needed for gas fees. In 2022, Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge, improving scalability and efficiency. The upcoming sharding phase aims to further boost these aspects. Ether remains central to the ecosystem, facilitating transactions and rewarding stakers. With its continuous developments and key position in the blockchain space, Ethereum holds significant potential in the current market cycle. Conclusion ETH and similar coins show less short-term potential. DOGEN, designed for those seeking luxury and success, expects 700% growth by presale‚Äôs end, with potential for massive returns this altcoin season. Following tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

What sets this coin apart is its cheeky branding and a community that rallies around being unapologetically different.

Built for those who embrace hustle culture, alpha vibes, and the mantra of being unapologetically awesome, Gigachad has created a tribe of like-minded investors who live for high stakes. The coin‚Äôs branding taps into the internet‚Äôs obsession with ‚ÄúChad‚Äù memes, celebrating confidence, dominance, and success. But Gigachad isn‚Äôt just about swagger. It‚Äôs backed by a roadmap promising innovative staking mechanisms, DAO governance for its holders, and plans for a metaverse crossover that will allow Chads everywhere to flex their digital muscles. While it may seem gimmicky to some, this coin has proven its ability to generate hype, and its fiercely loyal community ensures it‚Äôs not just a flash in the pan. If you‚Äôre drawn to big energy and even bigger ambitions, Gigachad might be your meme coin soulmate. Conclusion: Don‚Äôt Miss the Dip‚ÄîGrab the Bull So, what‚Äôs the move?

Cardano (ADA) has surpassed expectations over the past few weeks, and to see if the asset would give everyone a Christmas surprise in the form of a continued surge, we asked ChatGPT what its price would be by December 25. Current Market Performance At press time, Cardano (ADA) is trading at $1.05, marking a 4.06% decline over the past 24 hours. However, this is a minor downturn in a broader upward trend, as ADA has experienced an impressive 88% gain over the past month. This growth reflects increasing investor confidence and renewed market interest in the Cardano ecosystem. Cardano (ADA) Price By Christmas Day ChatGPT predicts that ADA could reach $3 on Christmas Day, a remarkable 185.7% increase from its current price. This would put the digital asset just below its all-time high of $3.1 and is a significant step toward a new all-time high for the digital asset. While ambitious, this prediction raises important questions about the factors driving ADA‚Äôs market performance. ChatGPT provided a detailed analysis of the factors that could help ADA reach this ambitious target. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ecosystem Development and Upgrades: Cardano continues to expand its ecosystem through regular updates and enhancements like the recently released Daedalus v.7.0.0 . ChatGPT highlighted the importance of this continued advancement, stating, ‚ÄúCardano‚Äôs focus on scalability, energy efficiency, and innovative technologies positions it well for future growth, particularly as adoption increases.‚Äù Growing Institutional Interest: Institutional interest in blockchain solutions has been growing, and Cardano‚Äôs reputation as an energy-efficient and scientifically driven platform has made it attractive to larger investors. Earlier in the year, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse listed Cardano among assets for which ETF approval is inevitable , and this puts the asset in a unique class that is highly attractive to institutional investors. Market Sentiment and Adoption: Positive market sentiment around ADA, driven by its expanding decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem and major advancements, could further fuel its rise. Broader Cryptocurrency Market Trends: Finally, broader market trends, such as Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements and increased adoption of altcoins, could also play a role. Bitcoin is currently experiencing a historic run, and the cryptocurrency market has historically seen seasonal surges in December, and credence to the belief that ADA will perform well this month.

Elon‚Äôs Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon‚Äôs Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon‚Äôs Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon‚Äôs Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon‚Äôs Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon‚Äôs Gold by entering its contract address ‚Äì 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner.

According to OneKey, this approach significantly minimizes risks by isolating crypto transactions from everyday device usage. Everyday devices like smartphones and personal laptops are vulnerable to cyberattacks because they are used for a multitude of activities that expose them to malware, such as downloading files, clicking on links, and opening PDFs. Hackers are exploiting these vulnerabilities, as seen in the $50 million Radiant Capital attack, where attackers used fake PDF malware to steal money. ‚ÄúA dedicated device is like putting your crypto in a safe instead of a drawer,‚Äù OneKey said. By using a device solely for cryptocurrency purposes, users can create a clean, focused, and secure environment away from the distractions and risks of general-purpose devices. According to OneKey's statement, the benefits of special devices can be listed as follows: Reduced Risk: Dedicated devices eliminate the installation of irrelevant software, significantly reducing the possibility of backdoor malware attacks. No Distraction: Streamline operations by only installing crypto tools, wallets, and exchange platforms. Enhanced Monitoring: Unusual activity is easier to detect on a device with minimal apps. Related News: Prominent Market Analyst Dennis Gartman Says ""I Will Not Buy Bitcoin"", Explains Why OneKey outlined a simple approach to creating a secure environment for cryptocurrency management: Start Fresh: Use a new or unused laptop or tablet. Perform a clean install of an operating system like macOS or Linux. No Extras: Restrict the device to crypto-related software only; no email, games, or random apps. Use a Hardware Wallet: Pair the device with a hardware wallet like Ledger or OneKey to keep private keys offline. Private Browser: Use a secure browser, especially for accessing decentralized applications (dApps) or exchanges. Add security extensions to block phishing sites. Private Network: Always connect to secure, private Wi-Fi. Avoid public networks and use open source VPN tools like Clash or SSR. *This is not investment advice.

Prominent cryptocurrency analyst Dark Defender (@DefendDark) recently shared an in-depth technical analysis, highlighting the significant resistance and support levels that will determine the next phase of XRP‚Äôs price movement. Hi all. We gave XRP 24 hours on 11-Dec, almost 40 hours since then. Well, $XRP will decide where to go max. by tomorrow. There is no room left on the current Bull Flag. Resistances: $2.42, $2.52, $2.72, $5.85 Supports: $2.29, $2.24, $2.10, $2.02 #XRPArmy #Ripple pic.twitter.com/lHVFKxQIMn ‚Äî Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 13, 2024 According to the analysis, the Bull Flag, a continuation pattern indicating potential upward momentum, has reached its narrowing apex. With minimal room left for price consolidation within this pattern, a breakout or breakdown appears imminent. Dark Defender noted that XRP must make its decisive move as the formation cannot persist much longer without resolution. Key Resistance and Support Levels Dark Defender identified critical resistance levels that XRP must overcome to continue its upward trajectory. These include $2.42, $2.52, $2.72, and the major long-term resistance at $5.85. These levels will likely act as barriers if bullish momentum accelerates, requiring significant buying pressure to break through. On the downside, XRP has several support levels that could prevent a bearish breakdown. These levels include $2.29, $2.24, $2.10, and $2.02. If the price falls below these levels, the current bullish outlook could shift to bearish sentiment, with traders potentially reevaluating their positions. Despite some bearish predictions , XRP has stayed above these support levels, currently trading at $2.37. The analyst noted that the asset‚Äôs closing price on December 14 could determine its direction. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other Technical Indicators and XRP‚Äôs Future The chart indicates that XRP has been consolidating within the Bull Flag since its sharp rally in November. While the Ichimoku Cloud beneath the price adds a layer of support, the narrowing consolidation signifies increasing pressure on the price to break out in one direction. The daily trading volume and overall market sentiment will likely play a pivotal role in determining whether XRP breaks upward or downward. Historically, Bull Flags tend to resolve in the direction of the preceding trend, suggesting a higher probability of an upward breakout. However, external factors could influence the outcome. XRP‚Äôs recent rally has been driven by increasing market confidence and the optimism surrounding its future under Donald Trump‚Äôs administration. If it can break above $2.72 and reclaim its recent peak of $2.86, it could trigger the price surge that Dark Defender and other analysts have predicted multiple times, and send the asset toward higher targets.

The altcoins have performed a lot worse on a 24-hour scale, resulting in a growing BTC dominance. BTC Dominance Increases Monday and Tuesday saw a few violent price rejections for the primary cryptocurrency, which was driven to $94,400 on a couple of occasions during those days. However, the bulls managed to prevail and propelled a few leg-ups that helped BTC recover all losses and were quick to challenge the six-digit entry territory by Thursday. In fact, bitcoin indeed broke through that level and spiked to $102,000 on Friday and Saturday. It was stopped there at first but the bulls drove it even further hours ago to just under $103,000. Nevertheless, it couldn‚Äôt penetrate that line and now sits beneath $102,000. Nevertheless, its market capitalization continues to see new local peaks and sits well above $2 trillion.

The asset‚Äôs on-chain factors are flipping green alongside top crypto on the back of institutional demand and Elon Musk‚Äôs influence. This scenario is similar to the 2021 bull run, which saw the asset soar to an all-time high. Data from crypto analytics from Messari shows that wallets with 1 million DOGE have amassed over 130 billion tokens. This all-time high acquisition indicates increased whale participation in the ecosystem as market confidence ticked upward. A similar situation occurred in the 2021 bull run, as whale addresses began accumulating assets, reaching as high as 110 billion tokens. Like in 2021, Elon Musk‚Äôs presence is also at the center of this rally. The billionaire‚Äôs famous appearance on Saturday Night Live was a huge development for Dogecoin at the time, with bulls projecting more adoption for the asset. After Donald Trump‚Äôs victory, the DOGE price surged alongside the wider market and Elon Musk‚Äôs participation. Musk‚Äôs nomination as joint head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) led to more inflow to Dogecoin. The assets have been up 220% since the November polls, which has attracted bullish interest. A key factor for the DOGE price rise is the possible turn to the altcoin season and meme coin swings. Recent flows into the asset could ignite a similar run in previous bull cycles. On-chain Similarities Attracts Whales Dogecoin‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI) has soared above 70 into the overbought zone, often indicating a retracement. However, in 2021, a similar metric led to continuous bull pressure. While the RSI led to an upward swing three years ago, many remain skeptical about present market conditions. Furthermore, recent price consolidations after previous highs point to the last bull phase. Growth after the US election has stalled for most meme coins, and prices have begun a consolidation phase. A series of outflows mark this as volatility continues. However, the meme coin consolidation is usually followed by a breakout, leading to a frenzy as holders look to pick up huge gains. At press time, Dogecoin trades at $0.40, a 0.2% drop in the last 24 hours, taking weekly exits to 7.2%. Meanwhile, the total meme coin market cap is down 3%, with the market cap at $132.4 billion.",Cryptocurrency|News|Doge|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-15 07:46:31

While Bitcoin (BTC) maintains its support at $100,000, many other major cryptocurrencies are underperforming, showing a retreat across the altcoin market. ‚ÄòTis the season for rallies, profits, and gains, but this weekend has failed to bring much-needed relief for retail investors. While BTC holds steady above $100,000, major altcoins, including Pepe (PEPE), Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Ripple (XRP) are facing bearish action resulting in price drops ranging between 5% and 8%. All hope is not lost as BTC maintains its position, trading around $101,700 . The upcoming weeks should result in recovery as President-elect Trump‚Äôs inauguration draws closer, along with the official resignation of current SEC chief Gary Gensler. Join us as we delve into four altcoin projects analysts predict will soon gain traction. Pepe (PEPE) Pepe (PEPE) is a notable underperformer of the past few days, losing nearly 5% in the 24-hour charts and almost 10% in the weekly charts. The much-beloved memecoin has lost almost 20% of its value since recently setting a new ATH and now trades for $0.00002299 . Pepe¬†(PEPE)¬†is a fan favourite among crypto investors, gaining a whopping 1,520%¬†in the past year. The project is currently the third largest memecoin with a market cap of $9.64 billion. This popular memecoins quickly gained infamy for being a tribute to the 2000s internet meme sensation Pepe the Frog. Pepe has continued a reward streak driven by its robust community, rapid ascent and highly optimistic future projections. Analysts predict the memecoin will potentially increase by over 2100% by 2030, positioning it as a prime opportunity for those interested in meme coins' speculative aspects. Pepe has also handsomely gained since the Trump victory, gaining over 14% in the past month. PEPE‚Äôs popularity and value surged after exchanges Robinhood and Coinbase listed the memecoin for trading, skyrocketing the memecoin to a new ATH of $0.00002748 on December 9, 2024. Floki Inu (FLOKI) Floki Inu (FLOKI) also appears to be having difficulty over the past few days, resulting in a 6.8% decline in the 24-hour charts at the time of writing. Despite releasing a no-fee crypto debit card earlier this week, FLOKI‚Äôs price dropped nearly 14% over the past week. Floki Inu (FLOKI) initially came to market as a celebration of the meme culture but quickly rose through the ranks to become a serious investment opportunity. The project owes its success to a very active community and innovative marketing campaigns, allowing it to expand its utility. Floki Inu recently became a fully functional Web 3 service provider housing a range of Web 3 features.¬†With its expansion, the Floki ecosystem now houses a range of Web 3 ventures, including TokenFi for NFT and asset tokenization, a P2E metaverse, a staking dApp, and a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) marketplace. While FLOKI‚Äôs recent underperformance is understandable, given the broader market downturn in the face of macroeconomic uncertainty, FLOKI will likely recover in the coming weeks. FLOKI‚Äôs zero-fee debit card allows users to spend Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), USD Coin (USDC), tether (USDT), BNB Chain‚Äôs BNB and FLOKI globally at merchants that accept VISA or Mastercard. There are zero transaction and exchange rate fees, and it is compatible with over eight blockchain networks. The card is currently available in 31 European countries with plans to expand the offering to other countries in future. Popcat (POPCAT) POPCAT is a recent addition to the crypto sector, aiming to revive the market still plagued by challenges such as inactive wallets and volatility. The memecoin addresses common issues like pump-and-dump schemes and rug pulls by promoting transparency and security. Utilizing innovative blockchain technology and leveraging the power of the Solana network, POPCAT seeks to provide fast and secure transactions. The project's goals are robust, and its potential to deliver significant returns makes it a coin of interest for those looking to explore new ventures in the digital asset space. POPCAT‚Äôs (POPCAT) market cap has grown to $1.05 billion, but its price has pulled back heavily following a good rally after Donald Trump‚Äôs election victory. POPCAT‚Äôs performance over the past week and month has been very bearish, resulting in a 35% drop in the 30-day chart. Despite its recent underperformance, the memecoin has been successful as the first-ever cat-themed token. POPCAT‚Äôs staggering 6,522% gain over the past year demonstrates that meme culture, backed by strong community support, can propel projects to the top of the market. Husky Inu (HINU) As BTC continues to trade around $100,000, investors must look for well-priced alternative investment opportunities to profit from the bull run, and Husky Inu is precisely that. Powering up for an epic crypto rally! #HuskyInu pic.twitter.com/biysMWXfmx ‚Äî Husky Inu (@huskyinureal) December 12, 2024 Husky Inu (HINU) is the latest Solana-based memecoin to grace the market. Husky Inu was created to bring its holders more value and utility by leveraging this robust blockchain. The project and its native token, HINU , want to make their mark on the saturated memecoin market by building a supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Husky Inu recently launched the presale for HINU, and the fundraising has attracted a fair amount of attention. Husky Inu (HINU) has exceeded its presale goals, smashing its $618,000 fundraising target. Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting. Husky Inu‚Äôs presale success sets the tone for immense gains and is expected to skyrocket following exchange listings. HINU presale tokens are available at a modest $0.00015000 with exceptional profit potential for early backers.

The hearing, about Wyoming‚Äôs stablecoin project, incorrectly claimed that Cardano is based in Wyoming and operated by Input Output Global (IOG), the company founded by Hoskinson. In his response, Hoskinson clarified that Cardano is a decentralized blockchain network, not controlled by any single entity. The Cardano ecosystem is moving toward a more robust governance system to empower its community. Hoskinson also noted that the person in the video excluded XRP, ICP, Hashgraph, Bitcoin, and more from the Wyoming stablecoin project , but included Ethereum, noting that he previously worked at Consensys and implying that ETH was receiving some favorable treatment. This is the guy who made the decision to exclude Cardano, XRP, ICP, Bitcoin, Hashgraph, etc But he did include Ethereum. He knows a lot about it, given his former employer was Consensys‚Ä¶ https://t.co/wfC2thhTB6 ‚Äî Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 14, 2024 Hoskinson and ETH Gate While many in the blockchain community supported Hoskinson‚Äôs clarification, some noted a perceived inconsistency in his stance. Critics pointed to his previous comments regarding the XRP community‚Äôs allegations of bias against XRP, known as the ‚ÄúETH Gate‚Äù conspiracy. ETH Gate is a controversy alleging Ethereum received special regulatory treatment during its 2014 ICO and later, with claims of favoritism by regulators like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The biggest sticking point for the XRP community is the SEC‚Äôs attempt to go after Ripple and XRP while ignoring Ethereum. Many in the XRP community believe that Ethereum‚Äôs creators bribed the SEC for these class actions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Hoskinson has dismissed claims that Ethereum received preferential treatment from regulatory authorities, stating that there is no proof that Ethereum bribed regulators to go after XRP. However, Hoskinson believes the regulator showed favoritism. He stated that this favoritism has extended to the Wyoming stablecoin project. Hoskinson‚Äôs recent remarks align with this belief. He suggests that Ethereum may have benefited from undue favor in the current context. He questioned why Ethereum was included in the regulatory discussion while other major blockchains were excluded but did not allege bribery or similar practices. Meanwhile, Cardano is moving forward with major upgrades of key parts of the ecosystem. The digital asset is in its Voltaire era, and gradually giving all the power to the people through governance voting. Hoskinson has expressed faith in the ecosystem, recently stating that the world will run on Cardano . Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

However, Qubetics‚Äô visionary approach to tokenisation and its dynamic presale structure make it the best altcoin to join in December 2024.

The region‚Äôs strategic economic and regulatory approach, paired with its special relationship with mainland China, has created a unique environment for both institutional investors and blockchain startups. Ivan Ivanov, global CEO of WOW Summit, attributed Hong Kong‚Äôs rise to a blend of progressive regulations and its role as a special economic region. ‚ÄúYou get the excitement and potential of crypto, but with the stability and security of a well-established financial system,‚Äù Ivanov stated. He explained that Hong Kong‚Äôs stablecoin policy , which mandates issuers to secure licenses and hold fiat reserves in local banks, fosters transparency and trust in the sector. With deep connections to the global financial market, including a gateway to mainland China, Hong Kong offers a compelling proposition: cutting-edge technological innovation backed by regulatory oversight that minimizes risk and builds investor confidence. A Trailblazer in Crypto Regulation and Innovation In October 2024, Hong Kong‚Äôs Financial Services and Treasury Bureau (FSTB) unveiled guidelines for integrating AI into financial systems, a move aimed at mitigating risks while enabling innovation. Around the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched Project Ensemble in collaboration with central banks from Brazil and Thailand, focusing on cross-border tokenized settlements. Further cementing its status, Hong Kong‚Äôs Cyberport Web3 network now hosts over 270 blockchain firms, with 120 joining in just the past 17 months. This state-sponsored digital asset hub underscores the government‚Äôs commitment to fostering Web3 and blockchain innovation. Adding to the momentum, Hong Kong‚Äôs largest digital bank ZA Bank introduced retail crypto trading for its clients in November 2024. To encourage institutional participation, the government proposed exempting institutional crypto investors from capital gains taxes, signaling its intent to become a haven for blockchain-related investments. The Road Ahead for Hong Kong Hong Kong‚Äôs robust regulatory framework and strategic initiatives have attracted global attention, creating a thriving ecosystem where financial stability meets technological advancement. With policies designed to balance innovation and investor protection, Hong Kong is positioning itself as a benchmark for crypto-friendly governance. As the region continues to pioneer initiatives in blockchain and digital finance, it is poised to remain at the forefront of the global cryptocurrency industry, shaping the future of financial innovation.

In a new report detailing its predictions for 2025, VanEck analysts say decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes will capture a fifth of centralized exchange (CEX) spot trading volumes. ‚ÄúDespite record-high decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volumes, both in absolute terms and relative to centralized exchanges (CEXs), decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL) remains 24% below its peak. We anticipate that DEX trading volumes will surpass $4 trillion in 2025, capturing 20% of CEX spot trading volumes, driven by the proliferation of AI (artificial intelligence)-related tokens and new consumer-facing DApps (decentralized apps). Additionally, the influx of tokenized securities and high-value assets will catalyze DeFi growth, providing fresh liquidity and broader utility. As a result, we project DeFi TVL to rebound to over $200 billion by year-end, reflecting the rising demand for decentralized financial infrastructure in an evolving digital economy.‚Äù The analysts also forecast that the broader crypto bull market will persist through 2025, with a correction beginning sometime in the first quarter. Once the correction is finished, VanEck has bullish price targets for some of the top crypto assets by market cap. ‚ÄúWe believe the crypto bull market will persist through 2025, reaching its first peak in the first quarter. At the cycle‚Äôs apex, we project Bitcoin (BTC) to be valued at around $180,000, with Ethereum (ETH) trading above $6,000. Other prominent projects, such as Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI), could exceed $500 and $10, respectively. Following this first peak, we anticipate a 30% retracement in BTC, with altcoins facing sharper declines of up to 60% as the market consolidates during the summer. However, a recovery is likely in the fall, with major tokens regaining momentum and reclaiming previous all-time highs by the end of the year.‚Äù The full VanEck report can be read here .

Alongside the report release, Robinhood Crypto is celebrating the first anniversary of launching a digital asset trading division in Europe. Robinhood Releases End of Year Report According to the report , Robinhood Crypto recorded a notional trading volume of $119 billion and $38 billion in crypto assets under custody as of November 2024. The entity said 2024 was an important year for its business because of the milestones it achieved. Robinhood Crypto expanded its services in the United States by achieving full coverage in 50 states and territories, including Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The company increased the number of available cryptocurrencies in the U.S. to 20 by adding new assets like Solana (SOL), Pepe (PEPE), and dogwifhat (WIF). It also launched a new trading application programming interface for its U.S. users, offering tools to view market data, manage portfolios, and place advanced orders. In Europe, Robinhood added 14 new coins for local customers, bringing the number of supported assets to 40. The firm also launched SOL and ether (ETH) staking for its European users. Regulatory Challenges Furthermore, Robinhood‚Äôs crypto wallet saw notable developments. The crypto firm launched the wallet on Android and introduced advanced swapping features across several Ethereum-based networks, including Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and Base. The company also redesigned its token discovery tab, making it easier for users to find and manage their assets. It is worth mentioning that Robinhood‚Äôs 2024 experience was not without challenges. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) slapped the entity with a Wells Notice in May, indicating a threat of legal action over the firm‚Äôs securities law violations. While the SEC has yet to file the lawsuit, Robinhood‚Äôs crypto business has performed well for the year. Johann Kerbrat, vice president and general manager of Robinhood Crypto, said: ‚Äú2024 marked a significant year for the cryptocurrency landscape and recent developments suggest that 2025 is poised to be an even more transformative year, with broader adoption anticipated across the industry.‚Äù The post Robinhood Recorded $119B in Crypto Notional Trading Volume This Year: Report appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Robinhood|United States,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-15 08:04:58

The company focuses on its current products rather than exploring new cryptocurrency ETFs. BlackRock Prioritizes Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently shared updates, citing Jay Jacobs, the head of BlackRock‚Äôs ETF division. Jacobs clarified that the firm‚Äôs immediate focus is on expanding the reach of its Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, which are still in the early stages of adoption among their client base. As such, BlackRock has no intention of launching new ETFs for XRP or other altcoins soon. Chinese cryptocurrency journalist Colin Wu also weighed in , reminding the community of the broader regulatory context in the U.S. He noted that while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may approve ETFs for altcoins like XRP and SOL by the end of next year, BlackRock remains committed to its current offerings. Rumors and Recent Developments Earlier in November, there were rumors regarding BlackRock‚Äôs interest in an XRP ETF after a false filing surfaced. This filing, labeled as a request to establish an iShares XRP Trust, was quickly debunked by BlackRock, which confirmed it had no association with the document. In contrast, other asset managers have moved forward with legitimate filings for XRP-focused ETFs. For instance, WisdomTree applied for a spot XRP ETF in late November. Other firms, such as Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary Capital, have also filed for XRP ETFs throughout the year, signaling a growing interest in the token as an investment vehicle.

Whale Alert, a prominent cryptocurrency tracker, reported a transaction involving 99 million XRP (approximately $234 million) transferred between two anonymous wallets. Data from Bithomp revealed that the sender of this transaction was a wallet associated with Ripple, while the recipient was the U.S.-based BitGo platform, known for providing custodial services to financial institutions. These movements follow two earlier transactions reported by Bithomp, in which Ripple transferred 380 million XRP and 200 million XRP‚Äîvalued at a combined $1.5 billion in fiat. Despite these transfers, the token has shown resilience in the market. Over the past week, its value has increased by approximately 2.8%, and the token is currently trading at $2.49 While regulatory developments could pave the way for ETFs in the future, BlackRock‚Äôs decision to focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum reflects its current strategic priorities. At the same time, significant whale activity and Ripple‚Äôs involvement in large transactions suggest continued interest in the asset, which could influence its future adoption and market performance.

With countless options vying for investor interest, three cryptocurrencies are shaping up as standout contenders. While Monero and Kaspa are grabbing headlines for their unique attributes, Qukbetics ($TICS) is creating a buzz as one of the best altcoins to join in December 2024. Qubetics, with its groundbreaking Web3 vision, is catching the eye of early adopters and seasoned investors alike. The ongoing presale draws unparalleled interest, offering a rare chance to get in before its ecosystem redefines decentralised solutions. This article delves into the latest developments of all three coins: Qubetics, Monero, and Kaspa. Qubetics: Redefining Privacy with dVPN Innovation What if your internet browsing were not only secure but also truly decentralised? Qubetics ($TICS) has turned this vision into reality with its decentralised VPN (dVPN) service . Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on centralised systems, Qubetics leverages blockchain technology to offer unmatched privacy, transparency, and freedom. Imagine browsing the internet without fear of censorship or data tracking‚Äîthis is precisely what Qubetics delivers. Key to its innovation is the peer-to-peer architecture, which eliminates the vulnerabilities of centralised systems. In this ecosystem, users share bandwidth and earn $TICS tokens, creating a self-sustaining network that encourages active participation. Multi-hop routing and encryption further ensure that your online presence remains anonymous and your data is protected. Adding to the excitement, Qubetics recently hosted a live AMA session , offering its community an opportunity to connect with the team and gain insights into its ambitious roadmap. These developments position Qubetics as the best altcoin to join in December 2024, promising transformative solutions for Web3 enthusiasts. Monero: The Pioneer of Privacy Coins Monero has long been recognised as a leading privacy-focused cryptocurrency. By prioritising user anonymity through stealth addresses and ring signatures, it offers unparalleled transaction security. This makes it a favourite among those who value confidentiality in their financial dealings. With no public transaction history, Monero remains a reliable choice for privacy advocates seeking a dependable crypto asset. Kaspa: Lightning-Fast Transactions with Layer-1 Innovation Kaspa is making waves for its ultra-fast transaction capabilities. As a Layer-1 cryptocurrency, it combines security and scalability without compromising on speed. Its efficient architecture allows for near-instantaneous confirmations, catering to a growing need for seamless transactions in the crypto world. For users and developers alike, Kaspa‚Äôs focus on speed and reliability positions it as a contender worth watching in the blockchain ecosystem. The Qubetics Presale Is Live: Why It‚Äôs the Best Altcoin to Join in December 2024 The Qubetics presale is currently in Phase 12, and the numbers speak volumes about this project‚Äôs enthusiasm. With a token price of $0.031 and over $6 million already raised, the momentum is building rapidly. Each week brings a 10% price increase, culminating in a final phase that promises a 20% hike. For those contemplating their next crypto move, this is a moment not to miss. With a post-presale target of $0.25 per token, the return potential for early investors is striking. The structured phases build excitement and reward those who act promptly. If you‚Äôre searching for the best altcoin to join in December 2024 , Qubetics offers an unmissable opportunity with its impressive ROI potential. Conclusion: Why Qubetics Stands Out Among Top Altcoins As 2024 draws to a close, analysts closely watch projects like Qubetics, Monero, and Kaspa for their potential to redefine the crypto landscape. Monero remains the go-to for privacy-conscious users, while Kaspa‚Äôs speed-focused approach addresses scalability challenges. However, Qubetics ($TICS) stands apart with its innovative decentralised VPN, which aligns perfectly with the future of Web3. The ongoing presale offers a rare window of opportunity, with prices poised to soar in the final stages. As the best altcoin to join in December 2024, Qubetics combines cutting-edge technology with tangible use cases, making it a compelling addition to any crypto portfolio. Don‚Äôt let this chance slip away‚Äîexplore the Qubetics presale today and be part of a transformative journey.

While investors continue speculating on the asset‚Äôs next movement, the recent development of a new support region hints at a continued upward trajectory. Related Reading: Ethereum On-Chain Metrics Looking Strong ‚Äì Momentum Building For ETH? ETH Bulls Form Strong Support At $3,700 ‚Äì $3,810 In an X post on December 14, crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed the formation of a critical support zone in the Ethereum market. Based on data from IntoTheBlock, Martinez shares that 3 million distinct wallets acquired 4.6 million ETH, valued at $17.6 billion, at prices between $3,700-$3,810 with an average market price of $3,751. Such high level of accumulation activity identifies this price range as a significant zone of investor interest. Importantly, this heightened buying pressure converts $3,700-$3,810 to a vital support zone as market bulls will be compelled to defend this price range in the case of a price decline. Furthermore, despite Ethereum‚Äôs struggle to make any meaningful breakout past $4,000 so far, investors purchasing massive amounts of ETH at high price levels indicates market confidence in the asset‚Äôs ability to move past the presented resistance and sustain its price growth. However, it is worth noting that Ethereum losing this support zone due to an overwhelming bearish sentiment will result in immediate substantial losses that can induce a further price decline. If this market scenario occurs, ETH could slide as low as $3,565, with the next available support level being $3,303. Related Reading: Bitcoin Confidence Grows As Binance Data Highlights Surprising Market Trends Ethereum Records Eight-Month High Network Growth In other developments, the prominent blockchain analytics platform Santiment reports Ethereum is experiencing an impressive level of renewed market interest. In a recent X post, Santiment states that an average of 130,200 new addresses are being created on the Ethereum network each day in December ‚Äì the highest ever since April. This rise in new wallets suggests an influx of retail and institutional investors as evidenced by multiple developments including Ethereum‚Äôs price performance in Q4 2024, a booming DeFi ecosystem as well as the recent bullish performance of the spot Ethereum ETFs. In terms of implications, this rapid network growth can boost network activity, transaction volume, and ETH demand thereby resulting in a further price increase. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3,885 with a decline of 0.99% in the past day. Albeit, this loss only underscores the turbulent past trading week where Ethereum dipped by a cumulative 2.75%.

However, experts say that both ADA and NEIRO will bounce back. On the other hand, FXGuys ($FXG) has been doing really well. This new crypto trading platform is still in its public presale. It didn‚Äôt suffer during the recent dip. Instead, many invested in the FXGuys presale. With that in mind, experts say that FXGuys will outperform NEIRO and Cardano soon! >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE NEIRO‚Äôs Price Is Down Amid a Market-Wide Sell-Off NEIRO also got swept up by the market-wide dip. A month ago, NEIRO‚Äôs price was nearly at $0.003. Now, NEIRO‚Äôs price is at $0.0016 . So, the decrease that NEIRO had in price was quite steep. At first, the dip in NEIRO‚Äôs price happened because of investors taking profits. However, NEIRO‚Äôs price dip got bigger due to the recent market-wide sell-offs. That‚Äôs why NEIRO‚Äôs price is at these levels now. Luckily, experts say that this isn‚Äôt that bad. They say that it‚Äôs normal for decreases to happen after large rallies. So, NEIRO and other coins are just balancing out after the recent post-US elections run. With that in mind, experts say that NEIRO will bounce back soon. They say this because NEIRO is still very popular. Also, it has a strong community. So, they say that NEIRO‚Äôs price can go back to $0.003 soon! ADA‚Äôs Price Dropped Below $1 During the Bearish Wave Cardano was another victim of the market-wide dip. During it, ADA‚Äôs price went below $1. Namely, ADA‚Äôs price dropped to around $0.90. However, it recovered quickly. Right now, Cardano‚Äôs price is at $1.08 . This is a great sign for Cardano. It shows that there‚Äôs a lot of interest in it right now. It also shows that Cardano investors are confident. A popular analyst agrees with this statement. Namely, Ali Martinez recently stated that ADA will bounce back soon. He said that Cardano is doing the same as it was in 2020. So, he sees ADA‚Äôs price going to $4-$6 in 2025! This would be an increase of up to 455% for ADA.

Table of Contents Institutional buying drives Bitcoin off exchanges PCHAIN: A real estate altcoin gearing for 40,000% gains Bitcoin vs PCHAIN: Conclusion Bitcoin is comfortably trading above $100K. BTC could surge higher as President-elect Donald Trump says the U.S. will do something great with crypto. This has prompted investors to flock to a new, promising real estate altcoin. PropiChain (PCHAIN) is a real estate tokenization platform. PropiChain is regarded as an undervalued gem with massive upside potential. This is because it has a price of $0.011 in the second round of its token presale . This is very close to its lowest-ever price. Currently priced at just $0.004 during its ongoing token presale, PCHAIN is seen as an undervalued gem. PropiChain uses blockchain, AI, and the metaverse to transform the real estate sector. Experts predict that PCHAIN could see an extraordinary 40,000% increase in value. Will PropiChain be the next altcoin to explode, or will Bitcoin continue to dominate the market? You might also like: XRP price to rally 24,544% as PropiChain doubles these gains, expert forecasts Institutional buying drives Bitcoin off exchanges Data reveals a significant surge in Bitcoin transactions exceeding $10 million. This has the hallmarks of strong institutional buying. A large portion of these transactions has been traced to Coinbase. Since the U.S. elections, around 200,000 BTC have exited exchanges, leaving just 2.8 million BTC on platforms. This marks the lowest amount in seven years, signaling increased long-term Bitcoin holding by investors. Bitcoin is comfortably trading at $101.509. After an explosive rally, Bitcoin gained 16.3% in the past 30 days. BTC is predicted to reach $180,000 by the end of 2025, signaling the cycle top. PCHAIN: A real estate altcoin gearing for 40,000% gains PropiChain is primed for substantial growth, with experts predicting a 40,000% increase. The altcoin‚Äôs potential during its presale is equally remarkable, possibly rising by 800%. So far, the real estate altcoin has raided more than $1 million in its presale. The presale has progressed from the first round to the second, earning early investors 200% gains. At just $0.011, PCHAIN offers an ideal entry point for investors looking for life-changing gains in 2025. The real estate altcoin has a compelling value proposition. It uses AI-powered tools to offer deep market analysis . These actionable insights give investors a competitive edge when making data-driven decisions. Additionally, PropiChain features smart contract automation . This automatically helps real estate altcoin handle lease renewals and payments. This reduces manual processes and accelerates efficiency. Property investors, owners, and tenants benefit from this feature. PCHAIN has AI-driven automated valuation models (AVMs) to ensure accurate property appraisals. With precise pricing, users can make smarter buys and sales. It also reduces negotiation time as the price is data-driven. PropiChain‚Äôs use of the metaverse offers immersive virtual property tours, allowing investors to explore properties remotely. This boosts market access and investment potential. Bitcoin vs PCHAIN: Bitcoin is currently trading at around $100K. Analysts are predicting it could rise to $180,000 at the peak of this cycle. However, its potential for substantial gains may be limited compared to PropiChain, a real estate altcoin. Early investors in PropiChain are positioned to benefit greatly. Some Bitcoin holders are diversifying into the real estate altcoin to maximize future gains. Conclusion PropiChain has solidified its position as a leading real estate altcoin to hold. It is predicted to surge by 40,000% in 2025. The RWA altcoin has gained investors‚Äô trust after its listing on CoinMarketCap. Moreover, it was exposed to a wider audience. The real estate altcoin raised more than $1 million during its presale after attracting new investors. Additionally, PropiChain‚Äôs smart contract has been independently verified by BlockAudit, enhancing its credibility and appeal. At only $0.011, a Bitcoin whale is investing in PCHAIN for substantial future gains. Take advantage of what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve (TRUMPRES), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRES is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve could become the next viral memecoin. Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve by entering its contract address ‚Äì 2GxwMgJnqbDuDec9gMVNfN2n8eVf7ks1EUv1RZSCLNm1 ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRES.

The influx of new crypto users and growing adoption has spurred the market to new levels. Like other assets, stablecoins soared based on utility to institutional and retail investors this year. A new market report shows the USDT transfer volume on Tron reached new highs in the last 30 days. The network recorded $587.2 billion in USDT transfer volumes last month. This jump added to the growth seen in previous months following the wider market rebound. Before this month, October and September tapped $489.3 billion and $424.4 billion, respectively. ‚Äú Stablecoins have seen remarkable growth, driven by strong interest in cryptocurrencies over recent months. TRON has emerged as the leading blockchain for stablecoin transfers. This chart highlights the monthly USDT transfer volumes. In November 2024, USDT transfers hit an all-time high of $587.2B, marking a significant increase compared to previous months. The growth of stablecoins continues to rise.‚Äù Stablecoin Adoption Soars The last 12 months have seen increased stablecoin adoption globally, with users pushing toward cross-border payments. While settlement and global transactions were key factors in the growth of stablecoins, institutional investors boosted all metrics. Most stablecoins are pegged to the US dollar, giving investors confidence, unlike other volatile crypto assets. As gateway assets, stablecoins help onboard new entrants to the market, offering stability. Most platforms offer withdrawals and other benefits in stablecoins. The market benefited from the huge inflows, and stablecoins have become integrated into decentralized applications and as a way for investors to measure gains. Macroeconomic trends have pushed several consumers to web3, with users holders converting assets to stablecoins, adding to the growing volume. This month, the market cap of stablecoins moved past the $200 billion mark for the first time on the back of yield generation and payment factors. Tron (TRX) Records Sharp Growth Users traded stablecoin across Tron due to cost efficiency compared to other popular networks. These inflows have positively affected TRX‚Äôs general market performance. The asset gained over 160% in the last 12 months, notching huge gains after the U.S. elections in November. The asset‚Äôs market cap inched close to $39 billion due to the price rally that followed Justin Sun‚Äôs investment in Donald Trump‚Äôs World Liberty Finance.",Cryptocurrency|News|Tron News|USDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|TRX|USDT,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-15 08:49:06

Table of Contents Imminent Avalanche upgrade drives record trade volume Tron‚Äôs price action begins to settle after week of volatile trading Rollblock: top altcoins with next generation crypto gambling and unique tokenomics Avalanche (AVAX) and Tron (TRX) are two of the most widely traded tokens right now. However, experts are focusing on the top altcoin in the crypto gambling sector for the biggest possible gains. Crypto casino Rollblock (RBLK) has incorporated innovative tokenomics that could lead to growth in excess of 1,000x in 2025. With only a few weeks remaining in Rollblock‚Äôs crypto presale, experts are warning that there is little time left to get in before it explodes higher. Imminent Avalanche upgrade drives record trade volume The rapid rise in the Avalanche price comes as this top altcoin is dominating the headlines. Avalanche is up 5% today on its imminent upgrade and recent private funding. The highly anticipated Avalanche 9000 upgrade will launch on the 16th of December. Avalanche also recently announced $250 million in private funding from Galaxy Digital and Dragonfly to support this upgrade. However, expert forecasts only see another 10% to 20% increase for the Avalanche price in 2025. You might also like: Cardano reaches $1 but experts believe Pepe Unchained and Rollblock have more potential Tron‚Äôs price action begins to settle after week of volatile trading Tron continues to see a flurry of trading activity after a week of highly volatile price action. Tron‚Äôs price saw over 3% losses so far today as traders tried to time the bottom of its week-long round trip. This volatile Tron price action started last week when a declaration of martial law in South Korea sent investors fleeing from its exchanges. Tron‚Äôs numerous DEXs were the obvious destination, which sent its price soaring 100% in a matter of hours. Experts are noting that this volatile price action for Tron is mostly over now, with the price settling about 50% above its position before the initial surge. Rollblock: top altcoins with next generation crypto gambling and unique tokenomics With Tron‚Äôs and Avalanche‚Äôs rallies already nearing their peaks, experts are recommending Rollblock‚Äôs crypto presale instead. Rollblock is now the unchallenged top altcoin in the crypto gambling sector, which means that it is set to take a lion‚Äôs share of the $500 billion in revenue generated by this industry each year. The key to Rollblock ‚Äôs success is its unique take on tokenomics. Rollblock‚Äôs tokenomics is designed to drive massive player growth by generating value and income through its gambling tokens. This system is powered by weekly buybacks that employ a share of the casino‚Äôs own revenue. Weekly burn events are used to generate value for RBLK. Income is also generated by using the remaining buybacks as high-APY rewards for staking on Rollblock‚Äôs platform. This approach to driving player growth through unique tokenomics is built on a foundation of next-generation crypto gambling. Rollblock already has tens of thousands of players enjoying its platform of 7,000 casino games and global sports betting. RBLK‚Äôs current price of $0.041 is set to increase at least another three times through the remaining stages of its crypto presale. However, the real prize is the forecast for more than 1,000x growth once this top altcoin hits the open market in early 2025.

Experts believe this is the start of the mega bull run, which usually lasts 1.5-2 years and presents opportunities in the market to create positions that can make six-figure returns. Ripple (XRP) is one of the large coins that has delivered tremendous returns; even in this bull market, it has performed exceptionally well. Even though the XRP price had significant momentum last month, it has already seen its largest upswing. To capitalize on this bull run, emerging opportunities like DTX Exchange (DTX) are better investment options than large-caps like Ripple. Ripple (XRP) Trades In Pennant Pattern, Eyes ATH Recent political events in the US have boosted the XRP price, sending it near its all-time high of 2018. Still, the regulatory challenges from the SEC have not been entirely resolved, but the resignation of SEC chairman Gary Gensler is positive news for Ripple investors. The XRP price has surged 262% in the last 30 days, which shows its high demand amid the bull market. Currently, the XRP price is trading in a triangle pennant pattern, which is generally the continuation pattern of the previous trend. This pattern‚Äôs upper resistance is at $2.50, the local major barrier. A breakout from this pattern could push the XRP price to uncharted territory. The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) recently approved Ripple‚Äôs RLUSD stablecoin for listing, bringing more positive news for the XRP price. This decision boosts Ripple‚Äôs role in the digital payments sector and marks an important step forward for the XRP Ledger (XRPL) Ripple ecosystem. For the XRP price to reach the much-anticipated ATH price breakout, consistent spikes in trading volume with price increases are important. DTX Exchange Presale Outpacing Crypto Giants DTX Exchange, a solid player in the DeFi market, has dominated the crypto market since the launch of its presale. Last week, with the $10 million milestone, it became the fastest presale to achieve the feat.

According to the firm, this optimism could pave the way for a market decline that could provide a better entry point for new investments. Alphractal noted the historical correlation between market sentiment and Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements. ‚ÄúNegative sentiment on Twitter and news sites has often coincided with local price bottoms, particularly for Bitcoin,‚Äù the firm said. Sentiment analysis algorithms track and classify public sentiment as negative, neutral, or positive. When negative sentiment prevails, Bitcoin‚Äôs price often buck the trend and hit a local bottom before recovering, Alphractal explained. ‚ÄúThis shift leaves many traders anxious and skeptical as prices begin to rise again,‚Äù the company added. Related News: Former Thai Prime Minister Announces Bitcoin Price Prediction, Calls for BTC in His Country The report also highlighted SUI, a layer-1 blockchain token, as it faces high risk in both the short and long term. Alphractal suggested that a correction, potentially driven by liquidation patterns, is the most likely outcome. According to the firm‚Äôs analysis of 7-day aggregated liquidation levels, the price of SUI could rise to $5 to liquidate remaining bear positions. Furthermore, the 30-day liquidation levels are weighing on the asset, indicating an increasing probability of a long liquidation in the near future. *This is not investment advice.

Cardano (ADA) whales accumulate more coins and buy the dip to increase their holdings. These whales, whose wallets contain between 100 million and one billion ADA coins, bought more than 100 million ADA worth $110 million over the past few days, based on the data of Santiment shared by analyst Ali Martinez. Their cumulative holdings now stand at 3.26 billion ADA, suggesting a bullish outlook for the asset despite recent price corrections. ADA is trading at $1.06, down 4.16% in the last 24 hours. Whales Buying Big During ADA Dips Recent trends indicate that there is a deliberate plan among ADA whales. When Cardano temporarily pulled back from the $1 mark again, the whales took advantage of the situation to purchase even more. This pattern is similar to their action in November when ADA traded between $0.50 and $0.60. Whales bought tokens aggressively, followed by a cutback once the price spiked to $0.70 and $0.80. While the selling during pumps is notable, their net holdings continue to grow, reflecting an overall bullish stance. Over the past month, these investors have significantly increased their positions, capitalizing on market fluctuations. Whale holdings increased from October 18th to November 18th by 145%, reaching $12.11 Billion. ADA holders with more than $10 million increased this figure, while wallets with a $1-10 million balance increased 83% to $3.9 billion. Wallets with ADA ranging between $100,000 to $1 million also increased by 106% to $4.36 billion. On the other hand, the impact was less severe among retail investors who cut down their exposure by 39%, with only $285,490 invested. ADA holders with $10K ‚Äì $100K also sold assets while reducing their holdings by 7.65%. Signals for a Potential Rally Whales‚Äô buying activity often signals potential price momentum. The current accumulation trend hints at a possible continuation of ADA‚Äôs bullish rally in the coming days. Cardano may see increased market confidence as their holdings expand, driving prices higher before another correction. Cardano‚Äôs price movements and whale activity underscore a clear strategy: buy the dips and profit from the pumps. With whales dominating accumulation and retail investors stepping back, ADA‚Äôs market dynamics could favor further upward momentum. For now, the eyes are on Cardano as it navigates its next move.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-15 09:05:42

Addressing an audience at the Intercontinental Hotel in Hua Hin, Shinawatra underscored the growing prominence of digital assets in the international economic landscape. ‚ÄúThere are already many cryptocurrencies. Some people say that in the future, we will have more currencies than countries. Today, Thai people must think and understand this,‚Äù Shinawatra stated, urging the nation to view cryptocurrencies as a crucial part of the evolving global economy. Shinawatra also highlighted geopolitical shifts, pointing to the potential implications of the Trump administration‚Äôs trade tariffs and discussions about using Bitcoin to manage national debt. While not advocating for Thailand to purchase cryptocurrencies, he stressed the importance of proactive exploration and regulatory experimentation in this domain. Thailand Already Advancing Crypto Adoption Thailand‚Äôs Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has already taken significant steps toward fostering digital asset innovation. In August 2024, the SEC introduced a crypto regulatory sandbox, allowing selected service providers to test financial technologies in a controlled and supportive environment. This initiative reflects the nation‚Äôs willingness to experiment with blockchain and crypto applications. The Pheu Thai political party has also utilized digital cash distribution as an economic stimulus strategy. In July 2024, 45 million Thai residents received 10,000 baht (approximately $280) each as part of a campaign promise. This initiative demonstrated the potential of integrating digital solutions into national economic policy. Kasikornbank, the country‚Äôs second-largest bank, further became Thailand‚Äôs first licensed crypto custodian in September 2024. Its services are aimed at enabling digital asset businesses to manage their holdings securely, signaling an institutional shift toward crypto adoption. Building Bridges with Global Crypto Leaders In October 2024, Thailand‚Äôs Bank of Thailand partnered with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Project Ensemble to test tokenized cross-border settlements. This collaboration underscores Thailand‚Äôs intention to position itself as a leader in digital finance by leveraging global partnerships. As the Thai SEC explores new regulations to grant mutual and private funds access to cryptocurrencies, the nation is edging closer to institutional crypto adoption. With calls for deeper exploration and strategic regulatory moves, Thailand seems poised to balance innovation with security, shaping its role in the global digital economy.

Five emerging altcoins are predicted to surge by 8,000% by December 2024. This article explores these potential game-changers poised for explosive growth. Discover which digital currencies could redefine the landscape and why they might be the next big opportunity in the world of cryptocurrency. $CYBRO Targets 1000% Growth Post-Listing With $7 Million Raised CYBRO, an AI-powered multichain earn marketplace, is about to hit a major milestone with its Token Generation Event (TGE).

During the presale, $CYBRO‚Äôs price surged 450% from $0.01 to $0.055 in its final stage. Now, with the token set to list at $0.06 on major exchanges, demand is through the roof. Many are predicting a 100x price surge once it hits the open market, thanks to the strong momentum and solid fundamentals backing the project.

During its short presale CYBRO has already gone a long way in achieving crucial milestones: CYBRO App Launched: Users can now explore around 30 vaults offering competitive annual percentage yields (APY) to match their investment strategies perfectly First One-Click Strategy Introduced: The Blast Index, available in the Vaults list and on the One-Click page, simplifies investing by integrating with lending protocols Rapid Development Progress: CYBRO‚Äôs platform has laid the groundwork for seamless DeFi experiences, setting the stage for future growth and innovation.

With the listing just around the corner, $CYBRO is about to make its mark on major exchanges with all the momentum it‚Äôs built so far, this token looks ready to take off. Seize the Chance to Get in Early Before Demand for $CYBRO Skyrockets Cardano (ADA): A Sustainable and Scalable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a blockchain platform built for smart contracts. It enables developers to create decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, allows users to store value, make payments, and stake on the network. Cardano uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is more energy-efficient than the proof-of-work model. The blockchain is divided into two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contracts. This design enhances its ability to process transactions, potentially handling up to 1 million transactions per second. Cardano‚Äôs native tokens offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts, improving blockchain efficiency and scalability. Kaspa Explores GHOSTDAG in Proof-of-Work Cryptocurrency Kaspa is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that uses the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains, it allows parallel blocks to coexist and orders them in consensus. This means more blocks can be processed at the same time. Kaspa‚Äôs blockchain is a blockDAG, which helps maintain high block rates. Currently, it processes 1 block per second and aims for higher. The confirmation times are very short, mainly limited by internet speed. Kaspa has features like Reachability to check the network‚Äôs structure, Block data pruning to save space, and SPV proofs. Sui: A New Layer-1 Blockchain Focused on Scalability and User Experience Sui is a new layer-1 blockchain platform designed to meet global adoption needs. It offers a secure, powerful, and scalable development platform. Sui uses an object-centric data model and the Move programming language to address inefficiencies in existing blockchains. It prioritizes user experience by removing common barriers in blockchain interactions. Through features like zkLogin, sponsored transactions, and programmable transaction blocks, Sui aims to make Web3 applications more accessible and user-friendly. Stellar Lumens (XLM): Connecting the World‚Äôs Financial Systems Stellar Lumens (XLM) is a cryptocurrency that powers the Stellar network, a decentralized platform for global payments. It allows users to transfer funds quickly and at low cost, regardless of the currency. Stellar supports transfers of any type of currency, including digital versions of national currencies and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The network aims to improve existing financial systems by connecting them on a single platform. Individuals can send money worldwide using Stellar applications. Businesses can build blockchain apps or use the network for payments and currency exchanges. Backed by the Stellar Development Foundation, which maintains the network and fosters community engagement, Stellar offers a way to enhance how money moves across the globe. Conclusion While ADA, KAS, SUI, and XLM show promise for significant growth by December 2024, their short-term potential is limited. In contrast, CYBRO offers immediate opportunities for investors to maximize earnings. As a technologically advanced DeFi platform on the Blast blockchain, CYBRO provides AI-powered yield aggregation. Investors benefit from lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. The platform ensures a superior user experience with seamless deposits and withdrawals. With a strong focus on transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO stands out as a promising project. Its appeal is evident in the strong interest from crypto whales and influencers.

Musk Loves USA (MUSKUSA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Loves USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves USA could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.

If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKUSA.

While Filecoin focuses on decentralised storage and ZIGnaly transforms investment strategies with social trading, Qubetics is tackling multiple supply chain challenges with one smart, scalable solution. With its presale gaining traction, Qubetics isn‚Äôt just a crypto‚Äîit‚Äôs a complete ecosystem designed to revolutionise how businesses operate. Qubetics ($TICS): Transforming Supply Chains with Blockchain Qubetics is leading the charge in modernising supply chains, combining blockchain‚Äôs best features with practical solutions for businesses. A cornerstone of Qubetics‚Äô innovation is its application of real-world asset tokenisation (RWAT). This allows assets to be digitised and tracked seamlessly on the blockchain, from raw materials to finished goods. Imagine a local farmer in Iowa supplying organic produce to markets nationwide. With Qubetics, they can tokenise their shipments, ensuring that buyers know the exact origin, quality, and route of their products. On the flip side, multinational corporations can use Qubetics to streamline logistics, reducing fraud and inefficiencies while boosting consumer trust. Qubetics‚Äô multi-chain wallet takes blockchain usability to the next level. Whether you‚Äôre in New York or Nairobi, it lets you make payments in crypto with the simplicity of Apple Pay or Google Pay. A small manufacturer in Vietnam could pay overseas suppliers in stablecoins, avoiding currency conversion fees and delays. Additionally, Qubetics‚Äô smart contract conversion mechanism protects users from market volatility, converting crypto to fiat instantly at the point of sale. Currently in its presale phase, Qubetics is priced at just $0.0311 per $TICS token. With over $6M raised and 325M tokens sold, the project has already attracted 8,700+ investors. Analysts predict its value will soar to $0.25 post-presale, offering an eye-watering 900% ROI. For businesses looking to integrate blockchain into supply chains, Qubetics isn‚Äôt just an option‚Äîit‚Äôs a necessity. Why did this coin make it to this list? Qubetics stands out for its real-world applications and transformative potential, making it the best crypto to buy in December 2024 for those ready to invest in the future of supply chains. Filecoin (FIL): Decentralised Storage for Smarter Supply Chains Filecoin is carving a niche as the decentralised solution for data storage, addressing a key challenge in supply chains: secure and transparent data management. By incentivising users to rent out unused storage space, Filecoin creates a distributed network where supply chain data‚Äîsuch as inventory levels, shipping documents, and quality certifications‚Äîcan be stored securely and accessed globally. For instance, a pharmaceutical company in Boston could use Filecoin to store and track temperature logs for vaccine shipments. This ensures compliance with regulations while providing full transparency to stakeholders. Similarly, small businesses in emerging markets can leverage Filecoin‚Äôs cost-effective storage solutions to compete with larger players. Filecoin‚Äôs appeal extends beyond storage. Its robust ecosystem supports integrations with other blockchain networks, making it a valuable tool for creating end-to-end supply chain solutions. Analysts are optimistic about FIL‚Äôs growth, with predictions of strong adoption across industries in the coming years. Why did this coin make it to this list? Filecoin‚Äôs focus on decentralised storage and data transparency makes it one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 for businesses aiming to modernise their supply chains. ZIGnaly (ZIG): Empowering Supply Chain Investments with Social Trading ZIGnaly may not be the first name you associate with supply chains, but its innovative approach to social trading has major implications for this sector. The platform allows users to mirror the trades of successful investors, making crypto trading more accessible and efficient. For supply chain businesses, ZIGnaly offers a unique opportunity to grow their investment portfolios without requiring deep trading expertise. Consider a logistics startup in Austin looking to diversify its earnings. By leveraging ZIGnaly‚Äôs social trading features, the company can allocate a portion of its revenue to passive crypto investments, creating an additional income stream. On the individual level, supply chain professionals can use ZIGnaly to grow their personal wealth, reinvesting profits back into their operations. ZIGnaly‚Äôs transparent fee structure and risk management tools make it particularly attractive for cautious investors. With its growing user base and expanding integrations, the platform is poised to play a larger role in the crypto ecosystem moving forward. Why did this coin make it to this list? ZIGnaly‚Äôs ability to combine investment accessibility with growth opportunities makes it one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 for supply chain professionals and businesses alike. Conclusion: Qubetics vs. Filecoin vs. ZIGnaly‚ÄîWhich One Wins? Each of these projects offers something unique, catering to different facets of supply chain innovation. Filecoin excels in secure, decentralised storage, making it a go-to solution for transparent data management. ZIGnaly empowers businesses and individuals to grow their wealth through accessible social trading. But Qubetics is in a league of its own. By combining real-world asset tokenisation with user-friendly payment solutions, it‚Äôs addressing core challenges in supply chain management while offering unmatched growth potential for investors. For those looking to balance their portfolios, the smartest move is diversification. Filecoin brings reliability, ZIGnaly offers financial empowerment, and Qubetics delivers groundbreaking innovation. Together, they form a powerhouse lineup for 2025 . Based on the latest research, we recommend investing in Qubetics ($TICS), Filecoin (FIL), and ZIGnaly (ZIG) this December. Don‚Äôt miss out‚Äîsecure your financial future and be part of the next wave in blockchain innovation.

Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, who go by the handle Negentropic on the social media platform X, tell their 63,300 followers that altcoins could be on the verge of outperforming Bitcoin ( BTC ) in the next two weeks. The Glassnode co-founders are looking at the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart, which tracks the percentage of the total crypto market cap that belongs to Bitcoin. The duo shares a chart suggesting that BTC.D has flipped bearish, opening the doors for altcoins to rise faster in value than Bitcoin. ‚ÄúBitcoin dominance has been rejected at the upward trendline ‚Äì is this the setup for a Christmas rally in altcoins? For this to happen: Bitcoin needs to consolidate above $100,000. A period of sideways movement could allow altcoins to gear up for a breakout. The second half of December and year-end could bring fireworks to the altcoin market. Are you ready?‚Äù Source: Negentropic/X At time of writing, BTC.D is hovering at 56.94%, still below the duo‚Äôs trendline. Looking at Bitcoin itself, Negentropic says BTC has so far failed to launch a massive surge above $100,000 due to the selling pressure coming from long-term holders, entities that have held their BTC stacks for more than 155 days. The Glassnode executives believe that long-term holders are almost out of coins to unload, putting Bitcoin in a position to ascend at the start of 2025. ‚ÄúLong-Term Holders Selling Pressure Continues. Key Insight: Long-Term Holders (LTHs) have hit their lowest holdings of the year, marking the largest outflow in 2024. Triggers: Back-to-back liquidations contributed to significant selling, alongside the year-end profit-taking season. Looking Ahead: The start of the new year may signal the end of this selling streak, setting the stage for a potential shift in market dynamics.

These wallets, holding less than 1 BTC, are projected to grow by approximately 9%, reflecting a robust retail interest in the leading cryptocurrency. CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler highlighted this trend in a Dec. 14 post, noting the resilience of shrimp holders in the face of high prices. ‚ÄúDespite being labeled as ‚Äòshrimps,‚Äô these holders are showing strong confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs growth, continuing to accumulate coins even at current price levels,‚Äù he stated. Currently, shrimp wallets amount to 323,000 addresses. Adler forecasts this number to climb to 351,000 shortly, marking an 8.67% increase. This growth momentum traces back to when Bitcoin traded at $61,000, during which the number of shrimp wallets stood at 265,000 ‚Äî a 21.9% rise since that price level. Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Adopt a Contrasting Strategy While shrimp wallets are growing, long-term holders ‚Äî those retaining Bitcoin for over 155 days ‚Äî have been offloading their assets. Data reveals that these investors sold 827,783 BTC over the past month , raising concerns about a potential market top. Some analysts warn that the sell-off could trigger bearish conditions, especially if buy-side demand diminishes. However, market indicators suggest the extent of any future corrections may not match the severity of Bitcoin‚Äôs recent 10% dip in early December. A Bitfinex report from Dec. 9 pointed to reduced sell-side pressure and declining realized profit-taking. ‚ÄúWith such a decline in realized profit and sell-side pressure, we can expect future declines to be less abrupt than the one experienced last week,‚Äù the report stated. Resilient Retail Interest The expansion of shrimp wallets highlights the confidence of retail investors in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term value. This metric serves as a barometer for understanding grassroots adoption of the cryptocurrency. As Bitcoin hovers at $101,549, according to CoinMarketCap, the diverging behaviors of shrimp investors and long-term holders underscore a complex market dynamic. While some are cashing out, smaller investors are capitalizing on opportunities to accumulate, suggesting a bullish sentiment persists at the retail level despite broader market fluctuations. Whether Bitcoin‚Äôs price will maintain its upward trajectory or face further corrections remains uncertain. However, the unwavering faith of shrimp wallets hints at a steadfast belief in Bitcoin‚Äôs potential among smaller investors.

Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao, founder and former CEO of Binance, did exactly that. He posted a screenshot, showing an article about Binance throwing in $500 million to help Elon Musk buy Twitter (now X), and captioned it with a confident, ‚ÄúHappy to have contributed to the cause.‚Äù The response from Elon was: ‚ÄúThanks!‚Äù The $44 billion journey: From shareholder to owner Elon‚Äôs road to owning Twitter was anything but smooth. It started in April 2022, when Elon became Twitter‚Äôs largest shareholder by purchasing a 9.1% stake. Shortly after, he made an unsolicited offer to buy the entire company for $44 billion, pricing the stock at $54.20 per share. The reasoning? Elon claims he wanted to transform Twitter into a haven for free speech, claiming the platform had fallen victim to excessive censorship. But things got bad fast. Elon tried to back out of the deal, citing concerns over spam accounts. Twitter‚Äôs board wasn‚Äôt having it and dragged Elon into court. After months of legal drama, Elon gave in and finalized the acquisition on October 27, 2022. The price tag? $44 billion. And let‚Äôs be clear, many thought it was an insane overpayment for a platform struggling to stay relevant. But not CZ, evidently. Chaos reigns at Twitter (or X, if you prefer) The moment Elon walked into Twitter‚Äôs headquarters carrying a sink, it was clear this wasn‚Äôt going to be business as usual. One of his first moves was to fire half the workforce, including entire departments like content moderation and advertising sales. Critics accused him of gutting the company‚Äôs infrastructure. Supporters called it necessary streamlining. Elon also rolled out major changes to the platform‚Äôs content policies. He promised a freer, more open platform. What many users got instead was an increase in hate speech and misinformation . Advertisers, the lifeblood of Twitter‚Äôs revenue model, started fleeing. A survey revealed only 4% of advertisers felt X (the rebranded Twitter) was a safe place for their brands. The result? A massive dip in ad revenue. Financially, things went from bad to worse. By late 2024, X‚Äôs valuation had plummeted to around $15 billion‚Äîdown nearly 80% from the $44 billion Elon shelled out. Fidelity analysts argued that Elon had overpaid from the start, estimating Twitter‚Äôs actual value at the time of purchase closer to $30 billion. Add to that over $1 billion in annual interest payments on loans taken to finance the deal, and Elon‚Äôs acquisition was shaping up to be a financial nightmare. Who all bankrolled Elon‚Äôs X gamble? Elon didn‚Äôt pull $44 billion out of thin air. He relied on a mix of his own wealth, bank loans, and backing from high-profile investors. Binance‚Äôs $500 million was just one piece of the puzzle. Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison was another major contributor, as was Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who retained his stake in Twitter. Former CEO Jack Dorsey also joined the list of backers, investing through a private entity. Big-name venture capital firms jumped in too. Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, and Gigafund all pitched in significant sums. Even alleged pedophile and sex offender Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs made the list, investing through Sean Combs Capital, something Elon is constantly criticized for. The eccentric billionaire also sold billions worth of Tesla stock to finance the deal, a move that didn‚Äôt sit well with Tesla investors. He secured roughly $12.5 billion in loans from banks, including senior secured loans and subordinated debt. This financing structure left X with massive debt obligations that continue to weigh heavily on its finances. Elon‚Äôs goal now is to turn X into an ‚Äúeverything app,‚Äù similar to China‚Äôs WeChat . But executing that vision has proven to be anything but smooth. And he keeps adding on to his responsibilities with his recent involvement in the incoming US presidential administration. User engagement has been a mixed bag. Some metrics show resilience, while others indicate declining activity due to policy changes and a rise in toxic content. Elon himself acknowledged the challenges, admitting the purchase brought him ‚Äúmega pain‚Äù but insisting it was necessary for humanity to take the ‚Äúgood fork in the road.‚Äù Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",News|Binance|Twitter|X,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|BNB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-15 10:17:18

She sees artificial intelligence as an exceptionally huge. Naturally, therefore, stocks are unlikely to be the only asset class that gets to benefit from such tailwinds. AI-facing meme coins like iDEGEN could rally on the back of AI mania as well. iDEGEN to benefit as AI use cases expand Lisa Thomas expects the artificial intelligence debate to expand from computing to a lot of other use cases in the coming years, including autonomous vehicles. So, it‚Äôs conceivable that investors will remain focused on gaining exposure to AI plays as artificial intelligence continues to expand and disrupt a whole bunch of industries. This will likely create a fertile environment for the native iDEGEN coin to increase in price as it‚Äôs a project that relies entirely on artificial intelligence to grow its knowledge base.

As capital continues to flow in iDEGEN, its price will likely hit several new milestones in 2025. iDEGEN has a mechanism in place that bumps up its price during presale as well, but the real and recognizable increase in its price will likely materialise once it goes live on a crypto exchange after the presale. A meme coin is typically more accessible after a listing and the related ease of investing in it tends to drive new money into it that pushes the price up.

Introduced by Bitcoin advocate John Carvalho, the proposal eliminates decimals by redefining 1 BTC as the smallest unit‚Äîcurrently known as 1 Satoshi. This change would turn what is now 0.00010000 BTC into 10,000 BTCs, fundamentally shifting how Bitcoin‚Äôs value is represented. Carvalho argues that this proposal simplifies Bitcoin‚Äôs usage and makes the system easier to understand, particularly for new users. Under the current structure, 1 BTC equals 100 million Satoshis, requiring users to interpret figures with up to eight decimal places. Today, I submitted a new BIP proposal for public review: Redefinition of the Bitcoin Unit to the Base Denomination Abstract This BIP proposes redefining the commonly recognized ""bitcoin"" unit so that what was previously known as the smallest indivisible unit becomes the primary‚Ä¶ ‚Äî John Carvalho (@BitcoinErrorLog) December 13, 2024 ‚ÄúThe decimal system is a human-imposed abstraction that creates unnecessary confusion,‚Äù Carvalho explained. By eliminating decimals, Bitcoin would align more closely with its underlying protocol, which represents value as integers, not fractions. Supporters: Simplicity Can Drive Wider Adoption Proponents see the proposal as a solution to Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äúunit bias‚Äù‚Äîa psychological hurdle where potential investors perceive BTC as expensive due to its large price per coin. By redefining the smallest unit as Bitcoin itself, the currency could become more accessible to smaller investors. Mauricio Di Bartolomeo , co-founder of Ledn, believes the change would positively influence Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption: Smaller whole numbers would reduce intimidation for first-time buyers. Investors could more easily grasp and communicate BTC values. Simplified units would align with rising market demand and price growth. Give it 5 to 10 years and we won‚Äôt use Sats anymore. Wallets are already implementing bitcoin, plenty of bitcoiners are advocating for the change and as the price soars higher and higher we will naturally gravitate to using the term bitcoin. Sorry if you‚Äôre married to the‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Joe Nakamoto (@JoeNakamoto) December 14, 2024 Joe Nakamoto , another advocate, highlighted that wallets are already shifting toward Satoshi-based displays, signaling that change is inevitable. He noted, ‚ÄúAs Bitcoin‚Äôs value climbs, the preference for smaller, whole numbers will become more natural.‚Äù Opposition: Risks to Bitcoin‚Äôs Scarcity Narrative Not everyone agrees with the proposal. Critics like Clara Bitcoin caution that redefining Bitcoin‚Äôs units could disrupt its foundational narrative‚Äî scarcity . The current 21 million BTC cap is central to Bitcoin‚Äôs identity as a scarce asset. Redefining the unit to 21 quadrillion ‚ÄúBitcoins‚Äù risks confusing users and making Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply less compelling. ‚ÄúThe 21 million limit is critical to Bitcoin‚Äôs value. Reframing it in smaller units risks diluting this message,‚Äù Clara argued. Opponents also emphasize that shifting terminology could create inconsistency across educational materials, wallets, and exchanges. Conclusion: Simplicity vs. Narrative Preservation Carvalho‚Äôs proposal brings forward an essential question: Should Bitcoin prioritize simplicity for broader adoption or preserve its established identity? While proponents see this as a logical step toward usability, critics argue that it risks undermining Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity-driven value. Key Points : The proposal eliminates decimals by redefining 1 BTC as 1 Satoshi. Supporters believe it reduces psychological barriers for new investors. Critics warn it could weaken Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity narrative and create confusion. As Bitcoin adoption grows, the community faces a choice‚Äîmodernize its unit system or maintain the status quo.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana surges 47.2% to $210.20 amid ETF buzz, while smart money eyes Rexas Finance at $0.15 for bull run potential. Table of Contents Solana‚Äôs bullish moment encounters opposition Rexas Finance: The smart money choice Quick acceptance and presale performance Large upside potential Managing the market timing Conclusion With a 47.2% price increase over the past month to reach its present level of $210.20, Solana has been a star player in the crypto market lately. Given Grayscale Investments‚Äô Solana ETF registration, this positive momentum has spurred debates about its possible double in value. Although these developments create a lot of buzz, crypto investors ‚Äî also known as ‚Äúsmart money investors‚Äù ‚Äî are searching past Solana to find new prospects on the market. One such chance is Rexas Finance (RXS) , a $0.15 coin with great promise for the approaching bull run. You might also like: Rexas Finance poised to be future of RWA tokenization: Fourth presale stage ends earlier than predicted Solana‚Äôs bullish moment encounters opposition To make significant progress toward the $500 mark, SOL has to overcome a big obstacle represented by the crucial resistance range between $274 and $300. Given Solana‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is almost overbought territory at 54.81, market dynamics point to profit-taking, perhaps intensifying at these levels. This technical indication suggests Solana might lose momentum since buying pressure could fade. Solana indeed has excellent foundations and a vibrant ecosystem, but these challenges make its short-term price path unknown. This uncertainty has driven many smart-money investors to investigate alternative assets with more upside potential, like Rexas Finance. Below are four reasons why Smart Money prefers Rexas Finance to Solana. Rexas Finance: The smart money choice Drawing attention for their original value proposition in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, Rexas Finance has become a major candidate for the 2025 bull run. This creative blockchain platform is meant to close the distance between traditional banking and distributed technology by allowing users to tokenize actual assets like real estate, art, and goods. Smart-money investors will find it interesting, given its modest entrance fee of $0.15 and unique methodology. Rexas Finance stands out for stressing the democratizing of asset ownership. Unlike Solana, which primarily targets decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT applications, Rexas Finance wants to transform how tangible assets are held and sold. This emphasis makes Rexas Finance unique in a crowded industry since it corresponds with the increasing demand for blockchain applications with pragmatic, real-world use cases. Quick acceptance and presale performance Rexas Finance‚Äôs presale has been an apparent hit, with each stage selling out faster than expected. At stage 10, the project has attracted more than $26,579,764 of its $33,125,000 target, demonstrating strong investor trust. This excitement reflects the increasing awareness of Rexas Finance‚Äôs ability to lead the unexplored RWA tokenizing industry, which experts estimate might become one of blockchain technology‚Äôs most important development directions. Moreover, the project team has obtained audits from Certik, one of the most reliable names in blockchain security. At this stage, openness and investor confidence are guaranteed key elements for every enterprise looking for long-term success. The anticipated IPO of Rexas Finance on three top-tier markets in 2025 at an estimated $0.20 also emphasizes its remarkable expansion path. Large upside potential Solana‚Äôs road to $500 shows a 138% rise from its present price, but Rexas Finance offers even more upside potential. With an astounding 19,900% increase from its price of $0.15, analysts predict that the RXS token may soar to $30 by the end of 2025. Because of its amazing expansion capacity, Rexas Finance appeals to investors looking for explosive gains during the next bull cycle. As the platform gains momentum in the RWA market, demand for RXS coins is also projected to surge. The platform‚Äôs user-friendly design, strong infrastructure, and dedication to creativity ‚Äî all of which help Rexas Finance be a leader in its niche‚Äîwill probably drive this demand. Managing the market timing Solana is still a fierce competitor with a proven ecosystem, but given its present price, it has less potential than newly proposed projects like Rexas Finance. Furthermore, the timing of the market is quite essential. Projects like Rexas Finance are ideally positioned to profit from the momentum as Bitcoin lately enters a bullish phase and prepares the ground for a more significant market rise. During bull markets, smart money investors prioritize assets with more growth potential. Rexas Finance is an excellent prospect for explosive gains because of its unique location in the RWA tokenization field; for investors searching outside the RWA tokenization field, well-known projects like Solana, with their low entry price, excellent presale performance, and ambitious roadmap, offer a convincing argument. Conclusion Solana‚Äôs recent performance and institutional changes make the 2025 bull run an intriguing possibility, but Rexas Finance ‚Äòs projected profits far outweigh Solana‚Äôs. With its creative approach to asset tokenization, fast adoption, and enormous development possibilities, Rexas Finance is fast rising to be the chosen alternative for smart money investors. The decision between Solana and Rexas Finance reduces risk against reward as the crypto market prepares for its next bull phase. Rexas Finance could be a convincing substitute for Solana for people looking for exponential returns and an opportunity to participate in a groundbreaking project.

The prediction came in response to MARA Holdings‚Äô chairman and CEO, Fred Thiel, who congratulated Saylor on MicroStrategy‚Äôs recent inclusion in the index. ‚ÄúThanks Fred. I expect $MARA will be the next,‚Äù Saylor stated in a Dec. 14 post on X . MicroStrategy Enters Nasdaq 100 The comment followed Thiel‚Äôs message celebrating MicroStrategy‚Äôs addition to the Nasdaq 100, set to take effect before the start of trading on Dec. 23. Being part of the Nasdaq 100 is a significant milestone, as it signifies membership among the top 100 non-financial companies on the Nasdaq exchange by market capitalization. MicroStrategy‚Äôs market cap reached $94.77 billion as of Dec. 13, while MARA‚Äôs stood at $7.32 billion, according to Financecharts data. Fred Thiel acknowledged Saylor‚Äôs remark, highlighting MARA‚Äôs ambition to reach this goal. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working hard to get there,‚Äù he stated. MARA‚Äôs recent financial moves underline this determination. The firm invested over $600 million in Bitcoin within the past two months, according to a Dec. 2 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Thanks Fred. I expect $MARA will be the next. ‚Äî Michael Saylor (@saylor) December 14, 2024 MARA‚Äôs stock has also experienced positive momentum. It closed at $22.73 on Dec. 13, reflecting a 16.74% increase over the past six months. MicroStrategy, meanwhile, ended the day at $408.67, up a remarkable 173.27% over the same period, according to Google Finance data. The addition of MicroStrategy to the Nasdaq 100 comes alongside two other companies, while Illumina, Super Micro Computer, and Moderna are being removed. The reshuffling of the index reflects its dynamic nature and the growing influence of Bitcoin-focused firms. MARA‚Äôs ambitions extend beyond stock market performance. On Nov. 26, the company called for stronger U.S. action to ‚Äúsecure dominant positions in Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining,‚Äù framing it as a national security issue. MARA Acquires Nearly 12K Bitcoin MARA Holdings (MARA) bought 11,774 BTC in the latest acquisition, the company announced on X on Dec. 10. The mining firm purchased Bitcoin using proceeds from its zero-coupon convertible notes offerings, paying approximately $1.1 billion at an average price of $96,000 per Bitcoin. This brings MARA‚Äôs total Bitcoin holdings to 40,435 BTC as of Dec. 9, valued at $3.9 billion based on the current Bitcoin price. MARA has also reported a 12.3% yield on its Bitcoin holdings quarter-to-date and a 47.6% yield year-to-date. Riot Platforms, a Bitcoin mining company, also announced plans to raise $500 million through a private bond offering to bolster its Bitcoin reserves further. Additionally, MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm and known Bitcoin advocate, further expanded its already substantial Bitcoin holdings. According to an official filing from Dec., 9, MicroStrategy acquired 21,550 BTC for approximately $2.1 billion between Dec. 2 and 8. This purchase, executed at an average price of $98,783 per Bitcoin, brings MicroStrategy‚Äôs total Bitcoin holdings to 423,650 BTC, valued at around $41.5 billion.

Everyone from Wall Street brokers to regional fund managers is scrambling to reposition portfolios for what‚Äôs shaping up to be a rollercoaster year for Asia. Global funds are playing it smart. They‚Äôre blending old-school strategies with the new economy. The goal? To shield Asian assets from the fallout of America‚Äôs unpredictable policies. Dollar-denominated debt has become the darling of the moment, delivering stable returns despite the greenback‚Äôs rampage through 2024. Meanwhile, gold refuses to go out of style, holding tight to its reputation as the ultimate safety net for jittery investors. China: Stimulus-fueled bets and a tariff-shaped battlefield China is throwing money at its economic problems, and investors are paying attention. Beijing‚Äôs top brass pledged to pump even more fiscal stimulus into the system, ramping up government spending to counter the impact of looming U.S. tariffs. The Central Economic Work Conference set the stage, and the Politburo wasted no time committing to boosting consumption as a defense against export risks. For investors, the game plan is clear. Fidelity suggests betting on Chinese onshore equities, which are more tied to domestic policy than export risks. UBS strategists are all about bank shares. Why? They‚Äôre dirt cheap and pay solid dividends, making them a rare shelter in a stormy macroeconomic climate. But it‚Äôs not just stocks. Debt is back in the spotlight. Morgan Stanley likes Chinese debt swaps to dodge currency risks, while Goldman Sachs is calling dibs on mid-range sovereign bonds. These picks reflect expectations that China‚Äôs stimulus spree could flood the market with longer-term debt, creating opportunities in the belly of the curve. India: Manufacturing shift and strong growth vibes While China fights off slowing growth, India is becoming an alternative manufacturing hub. With its economy largely shielded from global risks, India‚Äôs domestic market is looking better than ever. Analysts at Eastspring Investments are betting big on large-cap stocks, particularly in healthcare, telecom, and financials. But they‚Äôre not ignoring the risks. High valuations and a recent earnings slowdown are casting a shadow over the optimism. Local bonds are the golden child here, thanks to low external debt and India‚Äôs inclusion in global bond indices. But the real kicker is the long-term game. Rising urbanization, ongoing reforms, and supply chain shifts are fueling optimism. India‚Äôs demographics and steady growth are doing the heavy lifting, even as short-term challenges linger. Crypto‚Äôs electric rise Now let‚Äôs talk crypto, the true wild card in Asia‚Äôs 2025 playbook. Central and Southern Asia, along with Oceania, have taken the global lead in crypto adoption just as king Bitcoin smashed past $100,000 for the first time ever. Seven of the top 20 nations for centralized and decentralized finance activity hail from this corner of the world. Indonesia is leading the charge. Between January and October this year, it racked up $30 billion in crypto transactions. That‚Äôs a jaw-dropping 350% increase over the same period in 2023. It‚Äôs not just about retail traders either. Institutional adoption is gaining traction, with ZA Bank in Hong Kong now offering direct crypto trading to retail clients. Meanwhile, Japan‚Äôs AEON is rolling out crypto QR payment systems on Binance‚Äôs BNB Chain. Southeast Asia: The quiet powerhouse Meanwhile, Southeast Asia is quietly stealing the show, thanks to its manufacturing boom and stable economies. Indonesia is the poster child here, with a strong domestic market, a resilient commodities sector, and a central bank laser-focused on keeping the currency stable. Sovereign bonds, particularly dollar-denominated ones, are getting love from big players like Amundi and Fidelity. Vietnam isn‚Äôt far behind. It‚Äôs carving out its spot as a global export powerhouse, and its potential inclusion in the FTSE Emerging Market Index is making investors sit up and take notice. This is a region where smart money sees long-term growth, even as global headwinds threaten to disrupt supply chains. High-yield bonds are the name of the game for risk-tolerant investors. Markets like Sri Lanka and Pakistan are drawing interest for their insulation from trade wars. UBS Asset Management says it‚Äôs all about finding credits that dodge tariff headlines, making frontier markets an unexpected haven. The dollar and the yen: A battle of currencies Let‚Äôs circle back to the dollar, Asia‚Äôs persistent headache. For the fifth year running, the greenback is dominating regional currencies, shaving off three percentage points from local currency bond returns in 2024 alone. The Bank of Japan‚Äôs divergence from G-10 peers has made the yen a standout trade for 2025. Portfolio managers like Carol Lye of Brandywine Global are betting big on this divergence, seeing it as a hedge against Trump-induced volatility. For other regional currencies, the picture is bleak. With limited room for further monetary easing, central banks in Asia are stuck between a rock and a hard place. It‚Äôs a problem with no easy fix, and investors are bracing for more pain as the dollar refuses to back down.

This comes just as Bitcoin‚Äôs price exploded past $100,000, riding the wave of optimism following his re-election. Meanwhile, Russia, led by Trump‚Äôs frenemy President Vladimir Putin, is exploring its own Bitcoin reserve strategy, raising fears of an impending ‚Äúcrypto cold war.‚Äù The stakes? Global economic dominance and the future of money itself. Speaking at the NYSE last week, Trump said : ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna do something great with crypto because we don‚Äôt want China, or anybody else‚Ä¶ but others are embracing it, and we want to be ahead.‚Äù When asked directly whether this meant creating a reserve similar to the US oil stockpile, Trump responded, ‚ÄúYes, I think so. That‚Äôs still on my mind.‚Äù Russia‚Äôs crypto ambitions heat up Russia has wasted no time signaling its intent to join the Bitcoin reserve race. After facing economic sanctions from the West and seeing its foreign currency reserves frozen, Putin publicly praised Bitcoin as a strong alternative to traditional financial systems. The reasoning is clear: Bitcoin offers a way to sidestep the global financial order dominated by the US dollar. If Russia succeeds, it could upend the current economic balance, creating new challenges for the US and its allies. Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced the Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness Through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act to Congress. The bill proposes the US acquire 1 million Bitcoins over the next five years to tackle the ballooning $35 trillion national debt. Right now, the US holds about 200,000 confiscated Bitcoins, worth approximately $20 billion. These coins were seized in criminal cases and could form the foundation of the reserve. But Lummis‚Äôs bill takes things to another level, mandating the government to buy and hold Bitcoins for at least 20 years. The potential cost of this decision is chilling. With Bitcoin trading at over $100,000, acquiring 1 million tokens would cost around $100 billion at current prices. Critics argue this is an enormous gamble for a speculative asset with no industrial use or guaranteed returns. Yet, Trump‚Äôs supporters believe the idea is perfect. Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply and decentralized nature make it a hedge against inflation and government mismanagement‚Äîqualities increasingly appealing as the dollar faces mounting pressure from national debt and global skepticism. Critics sound the alarm Not everyone is cheering. Skeptics argue that using taxpayer money to buy Bitcoin is reckless. They point out that Bitcoin generates no income and relies entirely on speculative value. ‚ÄúThe government would be playing the greater fool,‚Äù one critic noted. The cost of creating a reserve could run into hundreds of billions, either by borrowing or printing more money. Both options could worsen inflation and further weaken the dollar. And it‚Äôs not just the cost. A Bitcoin reserve could make the asset more attractive to banks, allowing them to use it as collateral for loans. If Bitcoin‚Äôs value plummets, the fallout could plunge the financial system, leading to yet another bailout ‚Äî this time for crypto.

Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve (TRUMPRES), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRES is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve could become the next viral memecoin. Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve by entering its contract address ‚Äì 2GxwMgJnqbDuDec9gMVNfN2n8eVf7ks1EUv1RZSCLNm1 ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRES. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|FIAT|SHIB,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-15 11:27:19

Palihapitiya",https://finbold.com/we-are-in-a-2-5-year-shot-clock-to-crack-bitcoin-warns-billionaire-c-palihapitiya/,"Chamath Palihapitiya, the founder and CEO of venture capital firm Social Capital, has offered a possible timeline for when the Bitcoin ( BTC ) encryption might finally be cracked, given the ongoing advancements in quantum computing. This projection follows Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Google‚Äôs parent company, announcing the introduction of Willow, a quantum computing chip with 105 qubits. Palihapitiya believes that the encryption framework underpinning Bitcoin‚ÄîSHA-256‚Äîcould be cracked in the next two to five years due to progress in quantum computing, he said during the All-In Podcast , published on December 13. ‚ÄúI had to figure out how long it will take us to crack the encryption standards we use for Bitcoin. We need about 8000 chips to break SHA-256. We‚Äôre in the 2-5 year shot clock for chains reimplementing new hashing algorithms,‚Äù Palihapitiya said. Willow, which Palihapitiya claims could accelerate the timeline for breaking the cryptographic standards that secure Bitcoin and other digital currencies, is a key development in this area. While the technology to achieve this quantum computing level is still in its early stages, Palihapitiya suggested that the chip is a significant step toward achieving this capability. However, Palihapitiya acknowledged substantial challenges, particularly in scaling the technology, are still ahead. The investor noted that Bitcoin and other blockchain networks must adapt rapidly, potentially reimplementing core cryptographic frameworks at a foundational level. At the same time, Palihapitiya expressed optimism about the future of the cryptocurrency space, noting that advances in quantum computing could lead to the development of new encryption methods resistant to quantum attacks. Debate on cracking Bitcoin Interestingly, not all crypto sector players believe that quantum computing threatens Bitcoin. In an X post on December 14, Ki Young Ju, founder of onchain cryptocurrency analysis platform CryptoQuant , stated that Bitcoin is unlikely to be compromised within this decade. #Bitcoin won‚Äôt be broken by quantum computers this decade‚Äîor likely even the next. Don‚Äôt fall for baseless FUD from people who don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about. FYI, Adam Back is a legendary cryptographer and the inventor of Proof-of-Work(PoW) algorithm used in Bitcoin. https://t.co/DilYOc4GNe ‚Äî Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) December 14, 2024 If Bitcoin‚Äôs encryption is cracked, a blueprint from its anonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, could provide a potential solution. Notably, in a June 2010 BitcoinTalk post , Satoshi suggested that if SHA-256 were ever compromised, the community could agree on the last valid blockchain snapshot and continue using a new hash function. ‚ÄúIf SHA-256 became completely broken, I think we could come to some agreement about what the honest blockchain was before the trouble started, lock that in and continue from there with a new hash function,‚Äù Satoshi said. Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs sentiments of cracking Bitcoin. Source: BitcoinTalk On the other hand, some players view Satoshi‚Äôs early-mined Bitcoin as a possible vulnerability. To this end, computer scientist and Avalanche founder Emin G√ºn Sirer warned that the coins used the outdated Pay-To-Public-Key (P2PK) format, exposing the public key and giving attackers time to exploit it. ‚ÄúAs quantum computing becomes a threat, the Bitcoin community may need to consider freezing Satoshi‚Äôs coins or setting a sunset date to freeze all P2PK UTXOs,‚Äù Sirer warned . Bitcoin‚Äôs reaction to quantum computing advancements The Google development briefly spooked the market , with fear, uncertainty, and doubt ( FUD ) hitting the cryptocurrency community. This led to the liquidation of about $1.6 billion within 24 hours. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has since recovered, reclaiming the $100,000 resistance level. As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $102,203, gaining almost 0.7% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, BTC is up over 4.6%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

The coin, dubbed ‚Äú$ANITA,‚Äù purportedly ties to Drake‚Äôs cartoon alter ego, Anita Max Wynn , and exploited his association with Stake, a popular crypto gambling platform he frequently endorses. The hack, targeting Drake‚Äôs 39 million followers, falsely claimed that $ANITA was launched in partnership with Stake and tied to his Anita Max Wynn Tour, which is set to bring him to Australia and New Zealand after a six-year hiatus. According to blockchain analytics platform DexScreener, the fraudulent coin recorded $5 million in trading volume before investors realized the scheme was a scam. The misleading posts have since been removed from Drake‚Äôs account. Rising Wave of High-Profile Hacks Drake‚Äôs compromised account is part of a troubling trend of celebrity-targeted hacks on X . Just a week earlier, the Cardano Foundation‚Äôs X account fell victim to a similar scam, promoting another fraudulent memecoin that garnered a fraction of $ANITA‚Äôs trading volume. Other celebrities, including Cardi B, Doja Cat, Metallica, and Wiz Khalifa, have also been targeted. Notably, Wiz Khalifa‚Äôs account, with its 35.7 million followers, was hijacked in early November to promote a bogus cryptocurrency token called ‚Äú$WIZ‚Äù in what appeared to be a pump-and-dump scheme leveraging his brand recognition. These scams not only exploit the public‚Äôs trust in high-profile figures but also tarnish the already precarious reputation of cryptocurrency projects, making it harder for legitimate ventures to gain investor confidence. Crypto Investors Urged to Stay Vigilant The Drake hack highlights the urgent need for heightened security protocols for celebrity social media accounts and more rigorous scrutiny from investors when engaging with crypto promotions. Hackers are increasingly leveraging the trust and influence of well-known figures to propagate scams, luring unsuspecting individuals into pump-and-dump schemes. While the fraudulent $ANITA coin‚Äôs trading activity ceased relatively quickly, the incident underscores the risks of jumping into investments based solely on celebrity endorsements, especially when promoted on compromised platforms. As the cryptocurrency space continues to grow, protecting its integrity will require a concerted effort from both social media platforms and the broader crypto community.

Meta is taking the side of Tesla billionaire Elon Musk, as Silicon Valley‚Äôs top artificial intelligence players drag it out in court. In the letter sent to the attorney general, Meta emphasized that a favorable verdict for OpenAI would set a dangerous precedent in the industry. According to the company, if OpenAI gets a favorable verdict, startups will assume a non-profit status and change to a for-profit venture anytime they want. In its letter, Meta highlighted what the precedent would do to Silicon Valley, calling it a ‚Äúseismic effect.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf OpenAI‚Äôs new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government,‚Äù Meta wrote. Meta backs Musk‚Äôs lawsuit to stop OpenAI‚Äôs conversion Meta is not the only firm worried about the effects of a favorable ruling on the industry, as other industry players and investors have made their voices heard. Meanwhile, OpenAI Chairman Bret Taylor has revealed that the company will continue to have a non-profit arm. He said the company will undergo a restructuring that will provide real value for its ownership in the for-profit stake while ensuring the company does not depart from its goal of benefiting humans. Meta is a major stakeholder in the artificial intelligence industry, pooling in millions of dollars to match up to or even surpass other players like OpenAI. OpenAI is also in bed with Meta‚Äôs big rivals. Its biggest investor, Microsoft invested about $13 billion in the firm. Apple also recently announced the integration of ChatGPT into its product. This is Meta‚Äôs first comment on the issue, taking the side of Elon Musk, who founded the company alongside current CEO Sam Altman. Elon Musk left the company in 2018, after a power struggle with Altman, the present OpenAI CEO. Musk also owns an artificial intelligence company xAI, whose Grok chatbot is easily accessible via his microblogging platform X or as a standalone application. The Tesla CEO filed a series of lawsuits against OpenAI, claiming that the platform is planning to abandon its non-profit vision. In one of the lawsuits, Musk claimed that the platform created a for-profit arm and is colluding with Microsoft to dominate AI development. Musk and Zuckerberg in an unlikely alliance In its letter to California‚Äôs attorney general, Meta claims it supports efforts made by Elon Musk and business associate Shivon Zilis, to represent the people of California. ‚ÄúAlthough we ask your office to take direct action, we believe that Mr. Musk and Ms. Zilis are qualified and well-positioned to represent the interests of Californians in this matter,‚Äù Meta said. Notably, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been at loggerheads with Musk over the last few years. Some years back, the two billionaires agreed to settle their beef in a cage fight, an event that did not later take place. Meanwhile, OpenAI published a series of documents to block an injunction filed by Musk to block its for-profit conversion. Musk said the firm manipulated him by making him believe that it would remain non-profit when he invested. However, OpenAI countered him, noting that he brought up and backed the idea in the past. ‚ÄúWhen he didn‚Äôt get majority equity and full control, he walked away and told us we would fail,‚Äù the firm said. OpenAI recently finalized a $6.6 billion funding round, taking its value to $157 billion. The company, however, assured the investors that it would return every cent should the for-profit move fail to happen in two years.

With its bold kaiju-inspired persona, the project aims to challenge the norms of the crypto world and restore the decentralized, community-first spirit of meme coins. Shiba Inu: An Ethereum-based meme coin with growing utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme coin inspired by Dogecoin but runs on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous Ryoshi, SHIB started with a supply of one quadrillion tokens. Half were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin, who donated a large portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, boosting SHIB‚Äôs profile. SHIB‚Äôs Ethereum integration allows for applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Plans include a future NFT platform and a DAO-based governance system. Its compatibility within the Ethereum ecosystem enhances its utility. These developments may impact its attractiveness in the current market cycle. Dogecoin: From meme to major cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) is a cryptocurrency that was launched in 2013 as a fun alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies. It features the Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin is designed to be abundant, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no maximum supply. Initially considered a ‚Äúmeme coin,‚Äù Dogecoin gained significant value in 2021, becoming one of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This rise was influenced by social media, especially tweets from Elon Musk. Dogecoin‚Äôs community-driven approach and viral nature demonstrate its potential in the crypto market. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin continues to attract attention due to its strong community and social media presence. PEPE: A deflationary meme coin inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary meme coin launched on Ethereum as a tribute to the Pepe the Frog internet meme created by Matt Furie. It aims to capitalize on the popularity of meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. PEPE has a no-tax policy and openly embraces its lack of utility, focusing purely on its status as a meme coin. In late April to May 2023, PEPE experienced an explosive surge, with its market cap reaching a high of $1.6 billion, creating millionaires among early holders. The roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and a ‚Äúmeme takeover.‚Äù The coin‚Äôs potential lies in its strong community appeal and market momentum. Its attractiveness in the current market cycle depends on continued interest in meme coins. Conclusion As SHIB, DOGE, and PEPE face growing competition in the meme coin market, Catzilla emerges as a powerful new player aiming to reshape the space with creativity, transparency, and community focus. With a fiery presale structure and projections of monumental growth, Catzilla promises not just financial rewards but a return to the playful, decentralized ethos that made meme coins iconic. For crypto enthusiasts, gamers, and meme lovers alike, Catzilla offers more than just a token ‚Äî it‚Äôs an invitation to be part of a movement challenging the status quo.

Its established presence and robust infrastructure position it as a key player in the event of a broader DeFi resurgence. Should the sector heat up in the coming weeks, Aave is likely to attract significant attention from investors and traders. Price Targets Fresh Supply Levels Aave (AAVE) is currently trading at $366, following a surge to a multi-year high of $396 just hours ago. The altcoin continues its upward momentum as it approaches the critical $420 resistance level, a threshold last held in September 2021. This mark is seen as a pivotal area for AAVE‚Äôs next phase of price action, with many analysts expecting a significant reaction once tested. If AAVE manages to hold its current levels and sustain the bullish momentum, the next logical target would be the $420 resistance zone. Breaking above this level could signal a continuation of its multi-month rally, setting the stage for even higher price targets as investor confidence builds. On the downside, failure to maintain support above the $320‚Äì$340 range could lead to a broader correction. A move below this zone might push the price lower, erasing some of its recent gains and dampening bullish sentiment in the short term. Related Reading: Dogecoin Will See New ATH Soon ‚Äì Top Trader Sets $2 Target AAVE remains in a strong position for now, but traders are closely monitoring its price action near these key levels. Whether it can sustain its upward trajectory or faces a pullback will depend on its ability to break and hold above significant resistance zones.

He was particularly astounded by the confusing criteria for winning the GOTY award. In the translated version of his statement on Weibo, he said, ‚ÄúThis year‚Äôs nominated games are all outstanding, but I really couldn‚Äôt understand the criteria for selecting the Game of the Year this time. I came here for nothing!‚Äù Black Myth: Wukong won two awards in the Player‚Äôs Choice and Best Action categories out of the four categories it was nominated for. The remaining three nominations were Best Art Direction, Best Game Direction, and the Game of the Year. Also, Wukong was the lowest-rated game on Metacritic ever to be nominated for Game of the Year. The game‚Äôs producer, Feng Ji, expressed his gratitude for Black Myth: Wukong being the first game from China to receive four nominations and win two of them. However, he also shared his disappointment and confusion about the GOTY award‚Äôs criteria. The CEO also listed all of the efforts that went into creating the game in a long seven-point post. Black Myth: Wukong was a trendsetter for Chinese games Feng Ji addressed concerns from some who believed the team‚Äôs extraordinary success with its first single-player game was a fluke and that it was unlikely to repeat itself. He disagreed that it was just one-time luck. Rather, it was a product of several important factors coming together. He said the game‚Äôs success was the combination of Chinese interests, the country‚Äôs culture, the capability of its people, and the favorable business environment. He credited all these factors for the growth of the Chinese gaming industry. ‚ÄúI believe there will be more peers in the future, bringing better, more interesting, and more confident Chinese stories to the world.‚Äù ‚Äì Feng Ji He said Black Myth: Wukong is the trendsetter for the Chinese games that will follow in the future. The CEO also noted that Game Science valued being part of this movement deeply, as it positioned the team at the forefront of a significant shift in the industry. Feng Ji shared the importance of games like Black Myth: Wukong According to Feng Ji, many people in the world are not lucky enough to play AAA games. These may include those who have never used consoles or computers, don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on emotionally or physiologically, are confused and in pain, are desperate about the current world, and are victims of injustice. Therefore, ‚ÄúWe need to create better games and content that allow more people to experience truth, goodness, and beauty,‚Äù shared Feng Ji. Feng Ji told Wukong fans that their dissatisfaction with the results comes from a place of confidence rather than anger. He added that he was even more confident than them that he had prepared a winning speech two years ago. However, it did not happen. ‚ÄúToday we lost, tomorrow we might lose again, but so what?‚Äù the CEO of Game Science added. He concluded, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be confident only when you‚Äôve already won. That‚Äôs not confidence; it‚Äôs repeating the result.‚Äù He also said that factors for winning are always uncertain. He told his fans that confidence should come from, ‚ÄúDoing difficult things, doing things we believe in.‚Äù From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",Gaming News & Industry Insights|Black Myth: Wukong|Game Science,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-15 12:00:05

Elizabeth Sample and Brenda Powers with Sotheby‚Äôs International Realty in NYC told me in an interview that ‚Äúin 2022, the global real estate market was valued at around $379.7 trillion. This makes it one of the largest markets in the world.‚Äù And they continued: ‚Äú We are all connected to the residential or commercial real estate world by owning or renting, etc. By using blockchain technology to create digital tokens for property rights, the buying, selling, and transferring of real estate can be automated. This approach allows investors to invest in real estate more efficiently and increases liquidity in this huge asset class .‚Äù You might also like: Tokenizing real estate is a gateway to affordable home ownership | Opinion Already, there is a rapidly growing market for tokenized real-world assets representing one of the largest market opportunities in the blockchain industry, with a potential market size‚Äîaccording to a joint study by 21.co, BCG, and ADDX‚Äî projected to reach between $10 trillion and $16 trillion by 2030. According to Statista, by 2030, real estate is predicted to account for around one-third of the tokenized asset market, making it the most prevalent category. Adding fuel to this growth is the US Federal Reserve‚Äôs continued efforts to restrain inflation through higher interest rates, which many experts believe will stay for a while. This has investors increasing their allocations in collateral-based cash flows backed by real estate assets that offer a compelling risk-adjusted yield that serves as a stabilizing income source in an investor‚Äôs diversified portfolio. Historically, real estate has been a reliable hedge against inflation, allowing investors to invest in traditional real estate investment trusts, or REITs, and maybe even real estate tokens. Recent reports state that pro-digital asset President-elect real estate tycoon Donald Trump and his son, Donald Trump Jr., are developing a new real estate token project tentatively called ‚ÄúWorld Liberty‚Äù to integrate real estate investments with decentralized finance using blockchain technology. Botto ‚Äî Mist Over Mechanized Monoliths, AI Art at Sotheby‚Äôs Auction House NYC, Collection: Synthetic Histories; Origin Round: 142 How can blockchain be used in real estate transactions? Blockchain technology could serve as a transparent, reliable record-keeping system for real estate ownership and transfers at the city registry level. Smart contracts, programs that run on the blockchain, could be integrated with existing legal processes which govern property ownership, which could automate and record these transfers and ownership changes while the underlying legal processes for property ownership remain in place. This could lower transaction costs by removing dependency on intermediaries and automating many steps. For example, the Office of the City Register uses a software system called ACRIS to record and maintain New York City real property and certain personal property transfer records, such as mortgage documents for property in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens. However, ACRIS is not a blockchain system; it is a software platform primarily used for managing and automating regulatory compliance processes that are not designed to operate on a decentralized blockchain network. Blockchain technology can also be used in the tokenization of real estate assets to digitally represent a form of proof of fractional ownership of these assets, which also manages transferability and provides a medium of exchange. The Digital Asset Tokenization System designed by the UDPN team ‚Äúsimplifies the investment process by creating virtual tokens representing rights to assets and providing comprehensive lifecycle services from ideation to trading to asset servicing,‚Äù explained Tim Bailey, the vice president of global business and operations for Red Date Technology. The primary services offered by an asset tokenization platform include the creation and management of digital tokens that represent ownership of physical assets. Other services include token creation tools, a storage wallet, and an exchange and payment gateway. With tokenization, one real estate asset/investment may be represented by 1,000 or more tokens minted on a blockchain platform, each representing a fraction of the overall real estate asset/investment. A real estate token can represent a variety of different fractional real estate interests‚Äîfrom a portion of a real estate deed, which could be in the form of a coop or a condo, or a standalone home or an office building built on land subject to a long term lease etc.; to an equity interest in a legal entity (such as an LLC or Trust as in the case of REITs); or ownership of collateralized debt that could be located in different geographic locations or subject to a variety of different laws and taxes. A token for real estate could be the equivalent of a nonfungible token (a specific unique identifier). Still, it could also be considered a fungible token or a security token as well. Through smart contracts (computer code that automatically implements and enforces agreements on a blockchain), these tokens can be programmed to make rent distributions to token holders. They can also be programmed to enforce legal compliance requirements, such as one-year lock-up periods in lease provisions, etc. Other advantages of tokenizing real estate property on a blockchain ledger could include faster processing times for token buy-sell transactions that could be validated and recorded almost instantly without the need for lengthy manual back office processes. While tokenization of real estate would not directly modify the legal concept of property ownership or make real estate cheaper to invest in, it could make real estate more accessible to a wider range of investors, thereby increasing liquidity in the real estate market by fractionalizing property ownership into tradable tokens, opening the doors to a wider pool of participants to participate in property ownership including small-scale, young retail investors who face record-high home prices, lack of inventory, inflation and high debt that serve as challenging barriers to homeownership globally. In the United States, an owner-occupied fractional equity residential real estate tokenization transaction has already been undertaken. As Scott Thiel, CEO and founder of Tokinvest, explained: ‚Äú The home was purchased for $740,000 in Longmont, Colorado, and was financed with third-party investors directly supplying 97% of the purchase capital as alternative financing to mortgage credit. This residential tokenization project represented tradable investment securities backed by the largest and most stable asset class on earth‚Äîowner-occupied homes. Real estate token investors will have the option to buy, trade, and sell tiny, passive positions of homes as an alternative to active, whole home investment. At Tokinvest, we are tokenizing commercial and residential; existing and planned global real estate projects .‚Äù In the Netherlands, Bart de Bruijn, co-founder of EstateX, is building a dedicated RWA blockchain real estate tokenization platform that is expected to launch in Q3 2025. He believes that PROPX security tokens could revolutionize the global real estate industry by transforming a traditionally illiquid and exclusive asset class into one that is accessible, flexible, and liquid, allowing investors worldwide to own small shares in specific real estate properties, invest with minimal capital, and trade these tokenized assets easily on a secondary exchange. Because EstateX will operate on the RWA blockchain, transactions (like buying or selling tokens) would incur gas fees in the range of 20-35% paid for via token ESX as it is the platform‚Äôs primary medium for transactions, governance, and staking, which would cover the computational cost of processing transactions. A comparison of real estate tokens and REITs The expected high interest rate environment will likely render REITs an established desirable investment product, while real estate tokens might pave the way for a more dynamic, accessible, and investor-friendly future. For your consideration, here is a comparison of how real estate tokens stand out in comparison to REITs. REAL ESTATE TOKEN REITs LIQUIDITY Tokens are traded on secondary digital asset exchanges frequently, subject to digital asset market valuations. REIT shares are traded on major stock exchanges subject to stock market valuations. DIVERSIFICATION Tokenization lowers investment entry barriers, making real estate investment accessible to everyone by allowing fractional investments in a variety of real estate properties across different regions and sectors. REITs often require significant capital investment by investors on commercial property. OWNERSHIP & CONTROL Tokens provide direct fractional ownership of real estate properties, granting investors more transparency and a sense of control over their investments. REIT shares represent ownership in the trust holding the real estate assets or real estate debt rather than the actual properties, resulting in no direct control over property management decisions. REGULATORY & TAX Tokens are subject to a more dynamic and evolving regulatory and tax landscape around the world. In the US, absent specific guidance from the SEC, real estate tokens are generally treated as securities subject to registration with the SEC. REITs benefit from well-established regulatory and tax-efficient frameworks that provide stability and robust investor protections. For instance, the offshore LP structures available in some private REITs can help clients reduce their tax burden significantly as they offer investors a 20% tax deduction on the income they generate, thus enhancing after-tax returns TRANSACTION COSTS & DIVIDENDS Tokens can charge a fee in the range of 20-35% of generated revenue in the form of blockchain gas fees that reduce returns. However, it could be structured to issue daily dividends and settlement fees to an otherwise illiquid asset class. REITS provide for quarterly dividend distributions and may carry management and transaction fees that reduce returns, as detailed in the investment offering document. REAL ESTATE TOKENIZATION PLATFORM Tokens are issued on a real estate platform. The technology risks and cybersecurity concerns associated with the platform should be considered to ensure asset safety. REITs are not issued on a blockchain platform. Because of the complexity and evolving nature of real estate tokenization, it would be prudent to consult with an experienced securities attorney, tax attorney and blockchain specialist before proceeding with a real estate token investment.

Table of Contents Dogecoin meme power and community strength Ripple institutional backing and cross-border payment dominance Lightchain AI unique features and long-term potential Head-to-head analysis utility, growth potential, and investor sentiment Why Lightchain AI stands out as the strongest contender Making the right choice for December investments As December brings a renewed focus on the crypto market , investors are carefully evaluating their options for profitable investments. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) have long been favorites among traders, each offering unique appeals Dogecoin thrives on community support and memetic culture, while Ripple stands out for its institutional partnerships and dominance in cross-border payments. However, a new player, Lightchain AI , is emerging as a compelling alternative. Priced at just $0.003 during its presale phase , Lightchain AI is attracting attention for its unique approach to merging artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. This article explores how these three projects compare in terms of utility, growth potential, and investment viability, helping you make an informed choice for December. You might also like: Forecasts show SOL and Lightchain AI could explode: Here‚Äôs why Dogecoin meme power and community strength Dogecoin ‚Äôs rise to fame is a testament to the power of memes and community-driven momentum. Initially launched as a joke, Dogecoin has evolved into a mainstream cryptocurrency with a loyal following. Its popularity surged after endorsements from high-profile figures and its use for tipping and small transactions within its ecosystem. While Dogecoin‚Äôs appeal lies in its simplicity and vibrant community, it lacks substantial utility or technological features. The token‚Äôs reliance on market sentiment makes it highly volatile, with price movements often dictated by social media trends. For short-term traders, Dogecoin offers opportunities during bullish phases, but its lack of intrinsic value raises concerns about its long-term sustainability. Ripple institutional backing and cross-border payment dominance Ripple (XRP) is widely regarded as one of the most utility-driven cryptocurrencies in the market. Its primary focus is on solving inefficiencies in the global payment system, enabling faster and cheaper cross-border transactions. Ripple‚Äôs partnerships with financial institutions and banks underscore its credibility and relevance in traditional finance. The ongoing legal battle with the SEC has introduced some uncertainty, but Ripple‚Äôs resilience and its potential for regulatory clarity make it an attractive choice for long-term investors. Unlike Dogecoin, Ripple‚Äôs value is tied to its real-world applications, particularly in facilitating seamless international transactions. However, Ripple‚Äôs centralized approach has been criticized for deviating from blockchain‚Äôs decentralized ethos, which may impact its appeal among crypto purists. Lightchain AI unique features and long-term potential Lightchain AI distinguishes itself from both Dogecoin and Ripple by integrating artificial intelligence into blockchain, creating a platform with unparalleled utility and creativity. At its core, Lightchain AI features the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which rewards nodes for performing AI-specific tasks such as model training and optimization. This revolutionary approach ensures network security while contributing to advancements in AI. The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) further enhances Lightchain AI‚Äôs capabilities, enabling developers to execute AI tasks seamlessly within a decentralized framework. These features position Lightchain AI as a versatile solution for industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics, offering real-world applications beyond the speculative nature of many cryptocurrencies. Priced at just $0.003 during its presale, Lightchain AI is not only accessible to early investors but also supported by a robust roadmap that includes a testnet launch in January 2025 and a mainnet activation in March 2025. Its focus on scalability, transparency, and utility ensures long-term relevance in the blockchain space. Head-to-head analysis utility, growth potential, and investor sentiment There is no denying that Dogecoin and Ripple have established a significant presence in the crypto market, but their appeal is primarily based on speculation and community sentiment. In contrast, Lightchain AI distinguishes itself with its focus on real-world solutions and technological creativity. When it comes to utility, Dogecoin falls short compared to Ripple and Lightchain AI. While it has found niche uses within its community, there are limited opportunities for mass adoption or use in practical applications. Ripple‚Äôs dominance in cross-border payments gives it a clear advantage, but Lightchain AI‚Äôs integration of artificial intelligence offers unparalleled potential for disruption in multiple industries. In terms of growth potential, all three projects have seen significant gains this year. However, Dogecoin‚Äôs lack of intrinsic value and reliance on market sentiment make it the riskiest option for long-term investment. Ripple‚Äôs ongoing legal battle may impact its trajectory, but its institutional partnerships and real-world applications offer a strong foundation for growth. Lightchain AI‚Äôs unique approach to merging blockchain with artificial intelligence makes it a compelling choice for long-term investors seeking innovative solutions. Investor sentiment also plays a crucial role in the success of these projects. Dogecoin and Ripple have strong, albeit different, communities backing them, while Lightchain AI‚Äôs presale phase has already garnered significant interest from early investors. As with any investment, thorough research and risk assessment should be conducted before making a decision. Why Lightchain AI stands out as the strongest contender While Dogecoin and Ripple each have their strengths, Lightchain AI emerges as the most compelling investment option for December. Its ability to integrate artificial intelligence into blockchain addresses pressing challenges in scalability, privacy, and real-world applications. The Proof of Intelligence consensus mechanism and AIVM ensure that Lightchain AI remains adaptable to industry needs, setting it apart from competitors. Furthermore, the ongoing Lightchain AI Presale, priced at just $0.003, provides a unique opportunity for early investors to engage with a project poised for significant growth. Its roadmap milestones, such as the mainnet launch and ecosystem expansion, demonstrate a commitment to continuous innovation and adoption. For those seeking a balance of utility, scalability, and long-term potential, Lightchain AI offers a more sustainable investment choice compared to Dogecoin‚Äôs speculative nature or Ripple‚Äôs centralized focus. Making the right choice for December investments In a rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market, choosing the right investment requires a careful evaluation of utility, growth potential, and market sentiment. Dogecoin thrives on community-driven momentum but lacks the technological foundation for sustained growth. Ripple offers utility and credibility in cross-border payments but faces challenges from its centralized structure and regulatory issues. Lightchain AI , with its unique features, scalable infrastructure, and focus on real-world applications, represents the next wave of blockchain innovation. Its presale price of just $0.003 makes it an accessible and attractive option for investors looking to capitalize on a project with transformative potential. As December unfolds, Lightchain AI stands out as a forward-thinking platform that combines utility, scalability, and creativity, making it the strongest contender for both short-term gains and long-term success.

Smart traders look for inexpensive assets with explosive potential, while investors seek high-priced tokens. This post will reveal five cryptocurrencies that are cheaper than your favorite fast food yet will provide massive rewards as the bull market takes steam. Regardless of your experience with cryptocurrencies or your inexperience, these affordable coins have the potential to lead you to financial prosperity. Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance (RXS) is a promising crypto asset for investors seeking low-cost tokens with high growth potential. In its presale, RXS provides a pioneering platform for real-world asset tokenization at $0.15 per token. It allows users to fractionalize ownership of high-value assets, including real estate, gold, and collectibles. Rexas Finance brings blockchain and smart contracts to physical and digital markets, simplifying global asset transactions and opening avenues for investors. Asia investors can easily acquire a piece of a luxury property in Europe and generate passive income, overcoming geographical and financial constraints. RXS allows users to easily tokenize and exchange assets using tools like the Rexas Token Builder and Launchpad and advanced automation features like the QuickMint Bot and GenAI. CertiK-audited smart contracts maintain security and transparency, building trust in the platform's growing community. RXS is attracting knowledgeable investors expecting big profits after raising $26.9 million in presale. Early adopters will profit tremendously from top-tier exchange listings and double-digit price estimates by 2025. Without startup money, the platform allows public engagement and rewards its community with a $1 million award. Ahead of the bull market, Rexas Finance's unique tokenization of real-world assets could turn small investments into large portfolios. TRON (TRX) TRON (TRX) has emerged as a cryptocurrency powerhouse, attracting attention from savvy investors because of its spectacular increase. On December 3, 2024, TRON's price rose 107.57% monthly to $0.4407. TRON trades at $0.2967, demonstrating its blockchain ecosystem's resilience despite price volatility. Beyond price action, TRON's strong network activity suggests a game-changing investment. TRON possesses all the characteristics of a portfolio multiplier and is a cost-effective cryptocurrency that has the potential to generate substantial profits by the conclusion of the bull market. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) is a promising cryptocurrency that and has risen 258%, consolidating its status as an altcoin leader. It trades between $0.96 and $1.25, slightly below the $1.35 barrier. Analysts expect breaking this mark to spark a rapid rebound to higher prices, making it an excellent portfolio growth alternative. Technical indications support this optimism‚ÄîADA's 10-day moving average has surpassed the 100-day average, indicating strong upward momentum. A Russell's relative strength index (RSI) of 47 allows the currency to rise without becoming overbought. Cardano's capacity to surmount challenges and instill confidence in the market could transform the landscape during the peak altcoin season. ADA is an unmissable chance for investors seeking million-dollar returns from modest assets before the bull market takes off. Stellar (XLM) Stellar (XLM) is set to disrupt the cryptocurrency industry through its different partnerships and robust technical structure, which makes it ready for substantial growth during the next bull run. Stellar's breakthrough partnership with F√©lix and Bitso to revolutionize remittances for U.S.-based Latino immigrants is notable. This partnership addresses a fundamental financial need by using blockchain technology and the USDC stablecoin to move money to Latin America faster, cheaper, and more securely. XLM's recent rise is due to this initiative's increased utility and investor interest. Positive technical patterns like a symmetrical triangle and a descending wedge suggest a price surge to $0.90. After recent falls, purchase volume increased and $0.43 support strengthened XLM's rising prospects. Stellar's novel use cases and growing adoption provide investors with a compelling chance to turn a small investment into a $1 million portfolio before the bull market ends. Kas (KAS) Kaspa (KAS) trades at $0.1567, making it a strong contender for exponential growth in the bull market. The coin peaked above $0.19 before settling back to $0.16, indicating increased demand and volatility, typical of cryptocurrencies preparing for a large breakthrough. Kaspa's technical indicators are promising: a broadening wedge pattern breakout and a 64.84 RSI indicate bullish momentum. Kaspa's journey to $1, which would value roughly $25 billion, is ambitious but doable with a market size of $3.97 billion. Developers and investors are interested in its Proof-of-Work consensus process and fast transactions. Kaspa's ability to break its all-time high of $0.2075 and soar toward $1 offers early adopters a rare opportunity to multiply investments, making it a crypto gem that might turn a small position into a million-dollar portfolio before the bull market ends. Conclusion These five cryptocurrencies are leading the crypto market in turning little investments into big rewards. From Rexas Finance's groundbreaking asset tokenization platform to TRON's developer-friendly ecosystem, Cardano's bullish momentum, Stellar's transformative remittance solutions, and Kaspa's innovative consensus mechanism, each coin has a unique value proposition with exponential returns. Their low cost and disruptive potential make them must-watch assets for anybody looking to create a $1 million portfolio without breaking the bank as the bull market heats up. Take advantage of these hidden treasures before their value soars.

Several analysts have pointed to patterns that show DOGE could soon join the $1 circle. Amidst this optimism, DOGE whales are accumulating a new token: Rexas Finance (RXS). This new entrant entered the scene in September and has since stolen the spotlight. Rounded Bottom Pattern Indicates a Rally A TradeView analyst, CobraVanguard, recently noted that Dogecoin‚Äôs weekly price chart has formed a rounded bottom pattern. The pattern follows an initial gradual decline, then stabilization, before recovery. The recovery often leads to significant upward movement. CobraVanguard expects the price movement to be powerful. Once the pattern is completed, he expects a surge toward $1 with a high target of $1.5. Elon Musk‚Äôs Influence and Whale Activity Elon Musk, the CEO of X and Tesla, remains a prominent figure in Dogecoin‚Äôs success. His support has historically boosted the coin‚Äôs price. CobraVanguard and many others believe that Musk‚Äôs influence is crucial in pushing Dogecoin to $1. Meanwhile, major cryptocurrency investors, known as whales, are actively accumulating DOGE tokens. In December alone, whales performed over $100,000 to $1 million worth of transactions, acquiring more than 240 million tokens in total. This significant accumulation indicates strong confidence in Dogecoin‚Äôs future growth. Bullish Indicators and Market Sentiment Other analysts have strengthened DOGE‚Äôs bullish outlook with their predictions. One analyst suggested that DOGE has created a rising wedge pattern, another bullish signal. Another independent analyst fueled optimism by saying Dogecoin is about to pull another god candle, which could directly push DOGE to $1. Popular analyst Trader Tardigrade pointed out a historical pattern that could lead DOGE to $1. He says Dogecoin‚Äôs price often experiences a parabolic rally after confirming a breakout above resistance. If history repeats itself, Dogecoin could achieve new highs soon. Rexas Finance (RXS): An Alternative on DOGE Whales Radar As investors anticipate DOGE movement to $1, whale investors have also diversified to another promising altcoin‚ÄìRexas Finance. Rexas Finance has captured these large investors with its promising outlook. Rising as a clear leader in the altcoin space, Rexas Finance attracts both institutional and retail investors. Its innovative approach to tokenizing real-world assets (RWA) has positioned Rexas Finance as a pioneer in the financial sector. Tokenization turns RWAs like real estate and intellectual property into digital tokens, providing liquidity and global access into an industry valued at over $400 trillion. Blockchain technology lets these real-world assets split into smaller, tradable portions, facilitating more involvement in markets usually controlled by high-net-worth investors and institutions. Presale Success and Whale Interest The RXS presale has been a resounding success, underscoring the strong interest in its innovative model. Since its public presale launch in September, Rexas Finance has raised over $33 million across nine sold-out stages. It has already begun Stage 10 after successfully ending Stage 9. At this stage, RXS tokens are priced at $0.150, with the next stage set to increase to $0.175 before finally launching at $0.20. This progression promises early investors impressive returns of up to 566%. Boosting Investors‚Äô Confidence Security has been a top priority for Rexas Finance, further solidifying investor confidence. The project has completed a rigorous Certik Audit that checks the reliability and safety of its code. This Certik Audit has given investors confidence in the project‚Äôs long-term viability. Rexas Finance has also been listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, allowing investors to track its progress in real time. Moreover, the project‚Äôs powerful vision and robust tokenomics fit the rising need for creative solutions in the financial industry. By tapping into the RWA market and leveraging blockchain technology, Rexas Finance creates a bridge between traditional finance and the decentralized economy. As RXS approaches its official launch, its unique value proposition and proven success in presale stages make it a promising choice for investors. Experts believe it could rise sharply, surpassing $10 in the first few months. This makes it a lucrative investment to join. Conclusion Dogecoin‚Äôs rise to $1 is imminent, as analysts have pointed out several patterns supporting this. Meanwhile, DOGE whales are also accumulating another token, RXS. Rexas Finance‚Äôs captivating mission and presale success have attracted them. This has boosted investors‚Äô confidence, marking Rexas Finance as one of the best projects to invest in right now.

The Ethereum counterparts have also enjoyed the momentum by attracting almost a billion dollars within the past week. BTC ETFs Keep the Momentum Going The initial 11 and now 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs have already broken several records in terms of massive net inflows in their first year. This is particularly true for BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT, which quickly became the largest of the bunch and continues to be the favorite among investors. The past five trading days solidified the recent trend that started even before the elections. On Monday, December 9, the funds attracted $489.1 million in net inflows, followed by $438.5 million on Tuesday, $223.1 million on Wednesday, $597.5 million on Thursday, and $428.9 million on Friday, finishing the week strong. Overall, the total numbers for this period shot up to $2,167.1 billion. Although it is lower than last week‚Äôs, it still means that more than $2 billion has been poured into the ETFs within just several days. IBIT led the charge during four of the trading days, with $394.1 million on Monday, $295.6 million on Tuesday, $431.6 million on Thursday, and $393 million on Friday. It saw no reportable flows on Wednesday, while Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC stood out with $121.9 million on that day. These substantial net inflows have positively impacted BTC‚Äôs price as the asset is up by 3% on a weekly scale and sits close to a new all-time high. ETH ETFs Are Doing Well, too The Ethereum ETFs have also enjoyed the past several weeks following their sluggish start. Their streak began even further back‚Äîon November 22‚Äîand they have yet to see a day in the red since. Once again, they recorded impressive numbers in the past week, attracting $149.8 million on Monday, $305.7 million on Tuesday, $102 million on Wednesday, $273.7 million on Thursday, and a more modest $23.6 million on Friday. The total now stands at $854.8 million. Interestingly, ETH‚Äôs price is actually down on a weekly scale by 2.5%. The asset jumped above $4,000 during the previous Friday but has been unable to maintain its momentum and now sits below $3,900 following a turbulent week.

However, its price tag can make it inaccessible to those seeking budget-friendly opportunities with similar growth potential. The hunt for alternatives that offer comparable performance at a more affordable price is on the rise. Emerging projects like Lightchain AI , Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA), and Fantom (FTM) are making waves as cost-effective options poised for significant growth. Among them, Lightchain AI stands out with its presale price of just $0.003, offering investors an unprecedented entry point into a revolutionary blockchain platform that integrates artificial intelligence for unparalleled innovation.

The platform‚Äôs scalability and developer-friendly ecosystem have solidified its position as a leader in blockchain technology. However, challenges like periodic outages and rising costs highlight the need for newer projects that can deliver similar capabilities without these drawbacks. This is where alternatives like Lightchain AI and others come into play, offering investors similar benefits with unique enhancements. Lightchain AI Affordable Powerhouse with Advanced Technology Lightchain AI is redefining blockchain innovation with its integration of artificial intelligence and decentralized technology.

These advancements position Lightchain AI as a game-changer in industries such as healthcare, logistics, and decentralized finance (DeFi). For investors, Lightchain AI represents an affordable yet powerful alternative to Solana, with the added advantage of being at the forefront of blockchain-AI convergence. Avalanche (AVAX) High-Performance Blockchain with Growth Potential Avalanche (AVAX) is a prominent contender for those searching for Solana-like cryptocurrencies. Renowned for its impressive transaction speeds and sub-second finality, Avalanche has carved a niche as a reliable platform catering to DeFi, gaming, and a variety of enterprise applications. Its innovative Avalanche Consensus protocol ensures scalability without sacrificing decentralization, making it highly attractive to both developers and users. What sets Avalanche apart is its ability to handle a high transaction throughput while maintaining reliability across its ecosystem. This unique combination of speed, scalability, and decentralization has made it a go-to choice for projects requiring robust and efficient blockchain infrastructure. Although AVAX is priced higher than Lightchain AI, its strong technical foundation and versatile use cases make it an appealing option for those looking to strike the right balance between cost and performance. Cardano (ADA) Strong Development Focus Cardano (ADA) has established itself as a favorite among investors seeking a robust, innovative, and affordable blockchain platform. Known for its strong focus on sustainability, scalability, and interoperability, Cardano continues to solidify its position as a key player in the ever-evolving crypto space. At the heart of Cardano‚Äôs success is its Ouroboros Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which combines energy efficiency with high-level security, addressing two of the most pressing concerns in the blockchain industry. This approach not only ensures a more sustainable network but also allows for faster transactions without compromising on safety or reliability. What sets Cardano apart is its continuous evolution. Backed by a dedicated team of researchers, developers, and engineers, the platform is designed to adapt to the rapidly changing demands of the market. Its methodical and research-driven approach ensures that it remains relevant in an increasingly competitive industry. Fantom (FTM) Speed and Efficiency at a Lower Price Point Fantom (FTM) is rapidly gaining attention for its fast, efficient, and highly cost-effective blockchain solutions. At the heart of Fantom‚Äôs technology is its innovative Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture, which enables high throughput and near-instant transaction finality. This unique design makes Fantom ideal for a wide variety of applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to supply chain management and beyond. What sets Fantom apart is its Lachesis consensus algorithm, designed to enhance security, scalability, and performance. By addressing key limitations of earlier blockchain systems, Fantom offers a robust and reliable foundation for developers and users alike. Its affordability, coupled with a focus on real-world use cases, positions Fantom as a strong competitor to Solana, particularly for budget-conscious investors seeking an efficient yet versatile blockchain platform. Whether you're a developer, investor, or user, Fantom is proving to be a compelling choice in the evolving blockchain landscape.

Beginning in 2020, it spent most of its first year varying around $1.50 before closing 2020 at $1.70, which was a dismal start by any measure for what would culminate in a stratospheric rise. Over four years, Solana's price jolted to an astounding $223.76, up an unheard-of 13,062%. Although this increase is impressive, Rexas Finance (RXS), priced at $0.15 during its presale, is expected to rise in a fraction of the time‚Äîjust eight weeks‚Äîin the same proportion. Rexas Finance (RXS): A New Contender with Even a Lesser Timeframe Although Solana's development is an interesting narrative, Rexas Finance (RXS) is fast rising as a token ready to copy‚Äîif not surpass‚Äîthat achievement. Unlike Solana, which took years to reach its present price, Rexas Finance (RXS) is predicted to rise a similar 13,062% in just eight weeks. Rexas Finance (RXS) sets itself apart by democratizing and simplifying the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). The platform's users can quickly tokenize intellectual property, art, products, and real estate. By accomplishing this, Rexas Finance (RXS) closes the gap between conventional finance and blockchain, providing countless asset management and ownership opportunities. Rexas Finance (RXS) Performance in Presale Rexas Finance's (RXS) presale performance has already shown its market potential. The project's presale has raised over $27.36 million and is currently in stage 10. Priced at $0.15 as of writing, the coin has drawn much interest because of its creative use and investor-friendly strategy.

Unlike Solana, which needed years of consistent development and market adoption to reach its gains, Rexas Finance uses its innovative RWA tokenizing approach to quicken expansion. Rexas Finance (RXS) is positioned to reach quick acceptance by tackling a rising market demand for accessible and distributed asset tokenization. Rexas Finance (RXS) promises a paradigm change in asset ownership and management, not only about expected returns. A few clicks on its easy-to-use platform allows investors to tokenize and trade almost any real-world asset. Rexas Finance allows anyone to acquire fractional ownership of high-value real estate or tokenize intellectual property from anywhere globally. Furthermore, the project has attracted a devoted following by stressing security and openness.

Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve (TRUMPRES), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRES is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve could become the next viral memecoin. Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve by entering its contract address ‚Äì 2GxwMgJnqbDuDec9gMVNfN2n8eVf7ks1EUv1RZSCLNm1 ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRES.

Why It Could Happen This Cycle,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/solana-sol-to-hit-1200-why-it-could-happen-this-cycle,"Both analysts and crypto buffs still find Solana (SOL) fascinating. Solana has shown grit and optimistic momentum while the more significant market negotiates waves of turmoil. Several technical and market signals support analysts' prediction of a likely surge in the current cycle to be $1,200. Three White Soldiers Pattern Suggests Reversal of Bullish Nature Prominent technical analyst Altcoin Archive has noted the unusual Three White Soldiers pattern on Solana's monthly chart. Often, before significant price rises, this candlestick pattern is generally considered a powerful bullish reversal indicator. Should this trend continue, Solana might be about to have a substantial breakthrough. Historical patterns confirm this study. Following U.S. election cycles, the cryptocurrency market has tended to surge, and analysts predict that Solana would gain even more positive momentum in such times. Macroeconomist Seth, who observed a bull flag development on Solana's daily chart, also shows great optimism. This pattern, marked by a brief consolidation period before starting the previous upswing, points to SOL perhaps breaking away from its present range. Should validation be confirmed, this might send the token near the $1,200 price point, indicating a dramatic change from its present value. Seasoned market analyst Joji compares Solana's present market structure with its bull run until 2021. Back then, SOL shot 884% from the same location. Joji claims that the present accumulation phase in Solana's chart could indicate yet another large-scale movement. Based on a 452.53% rise from its existing price, the analyst projects Solana might hit the $1,200 level in the next cycle. This study supports the more general view that Solana's creative technology, great scalability, and active community might drive its expansion in the approaching bull market. Technical indicators, historical data, and market conditions highlight the hope surrounding Solana's potential. Why Prospective Investors Should Think About Rexas Finance (RXS) Although Solana's bright future is appealing, Rexas Finance (RXS) is another cryptocurrency that could pique interest. This initiative has attracted interest because of its innovative approach to real-world asset tokenization‚Äîoffering a safe, quick, open platform for digitizing assets. Rexas Finance aims to democratize asset ownership so that people and companies may effortlessly tokenize bonds, real estate, artwork, and other physical objects. Its strong infrastructure and easy-to-use interface allow new and experienced users to access asset tokenization, broadening the audience for this technology. The project's presale events mirror its continuous success since they all sold out ahead of time. With tokens valued at $0.15, Rexas Finance has already raised $26,579,764 out of its $33,125,000 target in stage 10 of its presale. The fast token acceptance indicates that investors have great faith in the enterprise's ideas and possibilities. Rexas Finance is slated to sell its coins on three top-tier exchanges in early 2025 at an initial price of $0.20. The listing should increase demand for RXS tokens, hence raising their value. Rising from its present presale price of $0.15, analysts estimate that the token might soar to $44 by the end of 2025, a startling 29,233% rise. A recent Certik audit strengthens the platform's trustworthiness even more, guaranteeing that its security and operations satisfy the best industry criteria. Furthermore, the new listings of RXS tokens on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko give investors openness and accessibility, enabling them to instantly track the project's development. Rexas Finance is positioned as a leader in the developing industry of real-world asset tokenization as the cryptocurrency market enters what many predict to be a positive cycle. Rexas Finance is led by its creative platform and dedicated community since this new industry presents excellent development possibilities. Conclusion Although strong technical and market indications support Solana's chances of hitting $1,200 this cycle, investors should also take note of prospects in the developing tokenizing industry. Based on its emphasis on democratizing asset ownership and proven track record of investor confidence, Rexas Finance presents a remarkable value proposition. Both ventures show the transforming possibilities of blockchain technology in their respective domains, while Solana and Rexas Finance chart convincing paths forward. Whether your attraction is Solana's existing ecosystem or Rexas Finance's innovative ideas, the next market cycle offers great opportunities for discriminating investors.

This also follows a rise in generative AI particularly the spread of meme culture, which, although humorous, has been found to play a big role in shaping cultural ideas. Beijing argues that AI‚Äôs adaptations from its Chinese classic television dramas and literature are ‚Äúhighly deceptive.‚Äù Some parents also agree and are concerned that AI-made jokes might lead to a loss of respect for traditional classics. China calls for a clean-up of AI-made jokes According to SCMP , memes have been cited as one of the ‚Äúkey culprits‚Äù the Chinese authorities have cited recognized as risks to its ideologies and culture. Like memes, edited video clips primarily made for humor and social media traction have also proven to be part of China‚Äôs challenges in regulating AI. The SCMP revealed that the agency that oversees state broadcasting ‚Äì the National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA) last week issued a notice calling on its supervisory bodies to ‚Äúclean up‚Äù all such videos that use AI to make caricatures of Chinese culture . The broadcast watchdog noted the increasing trend of altering video clips from shows including Dream of the Red Chamber and Journey to the West. These shows are based on novels that have been hailed as some of the greatest works of Chinese literature. The NRTA added these AI-generated jokes ‚Äúseek to gain traffic without boundaries and disrespect classic intellectual properties.‚Äù It added that these videos also go against the spirit of original works and might constitute copyright infringement. According to the broadcast watchdog, the videos also challenge traditional cultural perceptions. The country‚Äôs top internet watchdog ‚Äì Cyberspace Administration of China, has also repeatedly made calls to clean up video content that could be harmful to the young. These calls also align with China‚Äôs ongoing campaigns to control online misinformation as well as clean up information not suitable or contrary to traditional values. Social media platforms in China still carry the implicated videos Largely characterized by humor and sarcastic tone, the AI-remastered videos can still be found on Chinese social media platforms. Some of the videos are clearly labelled as AI-generated while others are not. In one of the said videos, characters from the show, Journey to the West are featured happily riding motorcycles on their arduous journey. The show is based on a 16th-century novel about a Buddhist monk on a journey to India in the seventh century. Beijing-based lawyer Gu Yu said that while these videos did not cause much harm to the public, they could also influence people unfamiliar with the original works. ‚ÄúWhile new technologies should be approached with a degree of tolerance to encourage public innovation, it is also crucial to take action against works that distort basic values.‚Äù ‚Äì Yu However, Yu highlighted that China‚Äôs AI regulation is still in an ‚Äúexploratory phase,‚Äù with regulation and lawmaking lagging behind technological advances. Yu also maintains that without sufficient legal precedents, it might be challenging to create comprehensive laws. Measures are, therefore, introduced when problems arise. Policing AI content might be a challenge for China According to SCMP, the NRTA notice is a clear indication of one of the latest challenges the Asian economy faces in AI governance. The country is in a fix trying to strike a balance between using the technology to optimize operations and boost the economy while also trying to tackle the adverse impacts of AI, such as the spread of deepfakes and misinformation. It also has to deal with handling its potential impact on public perception. In China, traditional culture is critical to the Communist Party‚Äôs governance philosophy. It sees this as part of its cultural reconstruction campaign. The country has made several efforts to regulate AI technology including its ‚Äú Administrative Provisions on Deep Synthesis in internet-based Information Services ,‚Äù which was implemented in January last year. This requires labeling content that might mislead or confuse the public. Last year, China also took some measures to regulate generative AI services and issued guidelines for multimedia content labeling standards. Some Chinese nationals support regulating the sector and cleaning up AI videos from state broadcasters. The NRTA‚Äôs request to clean up AI-remastered videos was a trending topic over the past week and ignited discussions on the social media platform Weibo microblog, attracting more than 43.4 million views and over 14,000 discussions. Some argued that without oversight, such content could lead to serious ‚Äúinformation pollution.‚Äù They argued that young children in junior school who have not yet read the Four Great Chinese Classical Novels are already exposed to funny videos of the Monkey King fighting with Jia Baoyu. Monkey King and Jia Baoyu are the protagonists in Journey to the West and Dream of the Red Chamber respectively. Other online commentators have different opinions, arguing officials are ‚Äúoverseeing too much‚Äù limiting people‚Äôs freedom to enjoy ‚Äúentertaining videos.‚Äù From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",AI|CCP|CNY|NRTA,EN,0,0,ASIA|REGULATION|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-15 13:32:51

Its dominance has solidified its place as a market leader, driving countless innovations in the crypto space. However, the emergence of Lightchain AI ($LCAI) is sparking conversations about what the next chapter of blockchain evolution might look like. Lightchain AI , with its groundbreaking Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), offers a fresh perspective on how blockchain can integrate real-world utility with advanced computational capabilities. As Ethereum battles its scalability challenges and rising competition, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a revolutionary alternative with the potential to redefine the industry. Ethereum‚Äôs Market Dominance Power of First-Mover Advantage Since its launch in 2015, Ethereum has established itself as the go-to blockchain for developers and enterprises. Its smart contract capabilities revolutionized the creation of decentralized applications (dApps), paving the way for entire ecosystems in DeFi, gaming, and NFTs. Ethereum‚Äôs dominance can be attributed to several factors. Its massive developer ecosystem continuously improves and builds on the platform, while its early start created strong network effects, giving it a significant user base and liquidity advantage. Additionally, enterprises and institutions have widely adopted Ethereum for its reliability and established utility. However, Ethereum‚Äôs first-mover advantage also comes with challenges. The platform faces issues such as high gas fees, network congestion, and slower transaction speeds. These limitations have opened the door for newer platforms, like Lightchain AI, to disrupt the market with more efficient and scalable solutions. Lightchain AI New Paradigm in Blockchain Technology While Ethereum‚Äôs dominance stems from its smart contract capabilities, **Lightchain AI** is redefining blockchain innovation by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with decentralized technology. This powerful combination opens up new possibilities, including intelligent decision-making and improved computational efficiency. Lightchain AI introduces several groundbreaking features. Its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism rewards nodes for performing AI tasks like model training and optimization, ensuring computational power directly contributes to real-world advancements, unlike Ethereum‚Äôs Proof of Stake (PoS). The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) is a specialized virtual machine designed for AI-specific tasks, allowing developers to execute complex AI operations effortlessly. Additionally, Lightchain AI‚Äôs scalable architecture tackles scalability issues from the outset, delivering high-speed transactions without the bottlenecks often experienced on Ethereum‚Äôs network. With a presale price of just $0.003 per token, Lightchain AI is quickly gaining attention as a high-potential project that blends cutting-edge innovation with practical utility. Comparing Core Features: Smart Contracts vs. Proof of Intelligence Ethereum‚Äôs standout feature is its smart contract functionality, which powers decentralized applications and services. These self-executing contracts have become essential to industries ranging from finance to gaming. However, beyond this innovation, Ethereum‚Äôs consensus mechanisms and transaction processing have seen little change. In contrast, Lightchain AI introduces Proof of Intelligence (PoI), a revolutionary approach that redefines the role of blockchain nodes by prioritizing meaningful computations. While Ethereum‚Äôs smart contracts enable automation, they come with high gas fees and lack specialized AI capabilities. Lightchain AI‚Äôs PoI, on the other hand, rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations, combining network security with real-world utility. By integrating AI into its blockchain infrastructure, Lightchain AI pushes blockchain technology to meet the demands of modern computation. How Lightchain AI Challenges Ethereum Scalability continues to be Ethereum‚Äôs Achilles‚Äô heel. Despite the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade and its transition to Proof of Stake, issues like network congestion and high transaction fees persist, limiting its growth. With a processing capacity of about 15 transactions per second (TPS), Ethereum falls significantly behind faster competitors like Solana and Polygon. Lightchain AI, however, is designed to address these limitations. Its efficient consensus mechanism, PoI, directs computational power toward AI-specific tasks, ensuring high throughput. The platform‚Äôs AIVM architecture enables dynamic scalability, allowing it to handle intensive workloads and support real-time applications. Additionally, its cost-effective structure ensures lower fees, removing many of the barriers Ethereum faces in adoption. These advancements position Lightchain AI as a forward-looking blockchain platform, ready to meet the growing demands of decentralized ecosystems. Established Utility vs. Emerging Potential Ethereum‚Äôs widespread adoption across various sectors has established it as a reliable blockchain for numerous use cases. In the realm of DeFi, it powers over 70% of platforms, including major players like Uniswap and Aave. It also dominates the NFT space, hosting the largest marketplaces such as OpenSea. Beyond this, Ethereum is widely used for enterprise solutions, including supply chain tracking, tokenization, and more. However, Lightchain AI brings a unique advantage with its focus on AI integration to tackle modern challenges. It enables decentralized AI workloads, supporting industries like healthcare and logistics through AI training and inference. Lightchain AI also facilitates the creation of intelligent decentralized applications (smart dApps) that can adapt and learn in real time. Additionally, its scalable solutions provide a robust platform for high-performance AI models, unlocking new opportunities across various sectors. As industries increasingly prioritize AI-driven solutions, Lightchain AI‚Äôs innovative use cases position it as a strong competitor to Ethereum‚Äôs established legacy. Why Lightchain AI Could Redefine Market Leadership in the Long Term The blockchain industry is evolving rapidly, and platforms that address scalability, sustainability, and utility will define its future. Lightchain AI is uniquely positioned to lead this transformation through: Technological Innovation: PoI and AIVM introduce capabilities that Ethereum and other blockchains lack. Market Timing: With its presale priced at $0.003, early adopters have an opportunity for substantial returns. Real-World Impact: By aligning blockchain with AI, Lightchain AI delivers solutions that directly address global challenges.

Ethena ( ENA ) token jumped to a high of $1.20, its highest level since April 14, and 525% above its lowest level this year. This rally has pushed its market cap to over $3.36 billion. Ethena soared after World Liberty Financial accumulated 509,955 ENA tokens valued at over $589,000.¬†The company, which raised over $72 million in a token sale, also owns Ethereum ( ETH ), CBBTC, Tether, USD Coin Chainlink, and AAVE (per Nansen data). WLFI is backed by Justin Sun, the founder of Tron (TRX).

According to DeFi Llama, its total value locked jumped to over $5.84 billion. This growth has made USDe, its yield-earning stablecoin the third-biggest one after Tether and USDC. Its valuation has jumped by over 83% in the last 30 days. ENA price has also rallied as odds that the USDe stablecoin will de-peg in 2024 fell. According to Polymarket , there is just a 2% chance that the token will drop below 90 cents as Terra USD did in 2022. There have been concerns about USDe since, like UST, it is not backed by any fiat currencies. Instead, it is an algorithmic coin that pays a 27% yield, while its peg is maintained by hedging the delta of spot assets during mining. Ethena price analysis: can it hit an all-time high? Ethena price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the ENA price has been in a strong bullish trend in the past few months. It has rallied from a low of $0.20 in September to $1.2, its highest level since April. The coin has remained above the 50-day and 25-day Exponential Moving Averages, a sign that bulls are in control. Ethena is also forming what looks like a cup and handle chart pattern whose upper side is at $1.5210. A C&H is a popular continuation sign. Therefore, the coin will likely continue rising as bulls target $1.5210, which is about 33% above the current level. A drop below the support at $0.90 will invalidate the bullish view.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $16.21 by the end of 2027. By 2030, WIF‚Äôs price may surge to $23.65. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the ‚Äúdog wif a hat‚Äù project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance, and the popular ‚ÄúSphere Wif Hat‚Äù campaign that led to a crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins expected to hit the market soon. Having closed in on the $5 mark on March 31, 2024, and also recaptured $4 post-U.S. elections in November, can WIF reach $10 soon? Let‚Äôs explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $2.83 Market cap $2,855,021,274.3 Trading volume $307,633,187.89 Circulating supply 998,844,836.7 WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.0677 on January 8, 2024 24-hour high $2.88 24-hour low $2.71 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $9.21 (231.68%) Volatility (30-day Variation) 7.49% 50-day SMA $2.98 14-Day RSI 46.47 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 80 (Extreme Greed) Green days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $2.34 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis: Buyer strength weakens as WIF falls below $3 TL;DR Breakdown WIF‚Äôs price analysis shows consolidation with tightening Bollinger Bands. Dogwifhat (WIF) resistance is present at around $3. WIF‚Äôs support level is present at $2.734. The Dogwifhat price analysis for December 15 shows a pullback from recent highs and price consolidation, with the coin now trading below $3. WIF has lost 23.56% in 7 days and 22% in the past 30 days. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: Will buyers reclaim WIF‚Äôs SMA at $3.125? The 1-day WIF/USDT shows the token trading below the Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $3.125, indicating bearish momentum in the short term. Recent declines in December reflect weakening buyer strength after the November spike. WIF‚Äôs support level appears near the $2.50 mark, while critical resistance is present at $3.00. If buyers cannot reclaim the SMA, bearish continuation may push WIF towards $2.50. However, a bullish recovery above $3.125 could validate a trend reversal. Will buyers reclaim WIF ‚Äòs SMA at $3.125? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 43.92 highlights neutral-to-weak momentum, suggesting sellers are in control but not yet at oversold conditions. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows bearish signs. The MACD line is below the signal line, and the histogram reflects negative momentum. The lack of bullish divergence suggests sellers have yet to lose steam. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: WIF faces reduced volatility, possible upside next? The 4-hour chart for Dogwifhat shows the price trading at $2.833, slightly below the basis line of the Bollinger Band ($2.901), signaling mild bearish pressure. As seen on the chart, the Bollinger Bands are tightening, indicating a reduction in volatility, which often precedes a significant breakout in either direction. WIF faces reduced volatility, possible upside next? If the price breaks below $2.734, further downside is likely, whereas a sustained move above $2.901 could open a path toward $3.069. The MACD indicator further highlights weak momentum, with the MACD line just below the signal line. However, the histogram shows a slight positive value of 0.003, hinting at an early but weak reversal attempt. The Balance of Power (BOP) at -0.03 reflects seller dominance, though its fluctuations indicate indecision and a lack of strong directional control among market participants. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 3.35 SELL SMA 5 3.20 SELL SMA 10 3.25 SELL SMA 21 3.22 SELL SMA 50 2.98 SELL SMA 100 2.55 BUY SMA 200 2.34 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 3.17 SELL EMA 5 3.26 SELL EMA 10 3.30 SELL EMA 21 3.26 SELL EMA 50 3.02 SELL EMA 100 2.71 BUY EMA 200 2.45 BUY What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF‚Äôs price shows consolidation with tightening Bollinger Bands, signaling a breakout soon. A drop below $2.734 could trigger further declines, while a move above $2.901 may drive a recovery above $3. Weak MACD momentum and seller dominance suggest cautious trading until a clear breakout confirms direction. Is Dogwifhat a good investment? Dogwifhat has experienced notable price fluctuations, particularly with a substantial increase in value in March, July, and October/November of 2024. While analysts hold diverse opinions on the future of this meme coin, the prevailing sentiment is optimistic. Projections indicate that by 2030, the price could rise to between $15 and $20. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank and several others. Why is $WIF down? After rebounding at $4.0013 due to price corrections, WIF is currently trading between $2.7 and $2.9. The current decline suggests that WIF is experiencing bearish momentum. Will WIF reach $10? Having touched $4.67 in November 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Analyst predictions suggest the token could surpass $10 as soon as 2026. Will WIF reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and would require exceptional growth, widespread adoption, and wild market speculation. Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $7 by 2025 and $20 by 2030. However, as with all meme coins, WIF‚Äôs future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

However, as the crypto market evolves, new opportunities are emerging, offering innovative features and higher growth potential. For investors seeking alternatives to Bitcoin, projects like Lightchain AI , Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) are leading the charge with unique technologies and expanding ecosystems. Among these, Lightchain AI stands out as a revolutionary platform that integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain, making it an exciting option for forward-thinking investors. Currently in its Presale phase at an accessible price of $0.003, Lightchain AI offers an unparalleled entry point into the future of decentralized intelligence. This article explores why these three cryptocurrencies are excellent alternatives to Bitcoin and how they excel in growth potential and utility. Why Bitcoin May Not Be the Best Choice for Growth-Oriented Investors Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance in the cryptocurrency market has made it a go-to asset for many investors, but its limitations are becoming increasingly apparent. As a store of value, Bitcoin excels, but its utility is limited compared to newer blockchain projects. High transaction fees, slow processing times, and lack of scalability hinder its ability to compete with platforms designed for smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and advanced computations. For growth-oriented investors, Bitcoin‚Äôs maturity means lower potential for exponential gains. Emerging projects like Lightchain AI, Ethereum, and Solana, with their focus on innovation and real-world applications, offer far greater opportunities for significant returns. These cryptocurrencies not only address Bitcoin‚Äôs limitations but also bring unique value propositions that make them more adaptable to the evolving demands of the blockchain ecosystem. Lightchain AI High-Potential Crypto with Revolutionary Features Lightchain AI is redefining blockchain technology by merging it with artificial intelligence to create a decentralized ecosystem capable of addressing real-world challenges. At the core of its innovation is the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations. This ensures that computational resources are utilized for meaningful purposes, setting it apart from traditional consensus methods like Bitcoin‚Äôs energy-intensive Proof of Work (PoW). The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) is another groundbreaking feature of Lightchain AI, enabling scalable, privacy-preserving AI applications. Industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics are already recognizing the potential of integrating blockchain and AI, making Lightchain AI a leader in this emerging space. With its Presale phase offering tokens at $0.003, it provides a rare opportunity to invest early in a project poised for transformative impact. Ethereum (ETH) The Pioneer of Smart Contract Technology Ethereum (ETH) is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and a pioneer in blockchain innovation. Its introduction of smart contracts revolutionized the industry, enabling the development of dApps and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Unlike Bitcoin, which functions primarily as a store of value, Ethereum serves as the foundation for a wide range of applications, from NFTs to DeFi protocols. Ethereum‚Äôs ongoing transition to Ethereum 2.0, which includes a shift from PoW to Proof of Stake (PoS), addresses scalability and energy efficiency issues, further strengthening its position as a top blockchain platform. While Ethereum has matured significantly, its continuous innovation ensures it remains a compelling choice for investors seeking utility and long-term growth potential. Solana (SOL) Speed, Scalability, and Growing Adoption Solana (SOL) has emerged as one of the fastest-growing blockchain platforms, known for its unparalleled transaction speed and low fees. With a high throughput of up to 65,000 transactions per second, Solana has become a preferred choice for developers building DeFi applications, NFT marketplaces, and other dApps. Its focus on scalability and energy efficiency allows it to compete directly with Ethereum while offering unique advantages. Solana‚Äôs rapidly expanding ecosystem and adoption by major projects make it a strong contender in the cryptocurrency market. Its innovative architecture addresses some of the critical limitations of both Bitcoin and Ethereum, making it an attractive alternative for investors seeking high-performance blockchain solutions. How These Cryptos Outperform Bitcoin in Utility and Growth Potential Utility and Adaptability: Lightchain AI, Ethereum, and Solana excel over Bitcoin due to their broader functionality. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as a store of value, these platforms enable developers, enterprises, and industries to create and run decentralized applications (dApps). AI Integration: Lightchain AI stands out by incorporating artificial intelligence, addressing the growing need for intelligent and scalable blockchain solutions. Smart Contracts (Ethereum): Ethereum‚Äôs smart contract capabilities make it a popular choice for building dApps, attracting a large number of developers and users. Speed and Scalability (Solana): Solana‚Äôs focus on high-speed transactions and scalability gives it a strong appeal, particularly for projects that require fast, efficient solutions. Dynamic Investments: The advanced features and adaptability of these platforms drive higher adoption rates, increasing their long-term value. In contrast, Bitcoin remains limited to its static role as digital gold. Why Lightchain AI Leads the Pack as the Top Choice Over Bitcoin Among the three, Lightchain AI stands out as the most innovative and high-potential project. Its integration of AI with blockchain through features like the PoI mechanism and AIVM addresses critical challenges such as scalability, privacy, and meaningful network utilization. Lightchain AI‚Äôs commitment to democratizing AI development and fostering inclusivity ensures it aligns with the future of decentralized technology. Additionally, Lightchain AI‚Äôs Presale phase at $0.003 offers a unique entry point for investors looking to get in early on a transformative project. Unlike Bitcoin, which has limited room for growth, Lightchain AI is just beginning its journey, with a roadmap that includes ecosystem expansion, cross-chain integration, and global adoption. These attributes make it a top choice for investors seeking exponential returns. Diversifying Your Portfolio with the Right Alternatives As the cryptocurrency market evolves, it‚Äôs clear that projects like Lightchain AI, Ethereum, and Solana offer far greater growth potential and utility than Bitcoin. While Bitcoin remains a solid store of value, these innovative platforms address critical challenges and open new possibilities for blockchain technology. Among them, Lightchain AI leads the way with its revolutionary integration of AI and blockchain, making it a compelling choice for forward-thinking investors. By diversifying your portfolio with these high-potential cryptocurrencies, you position yourself to capitalize on the future of decentralized technology.

Helium ( HNT ) jumped to the crucial resistance level at $9.520 on Sunday, Dec. 15 as the recent rally gained steam. It has soared by 228% from its August lows, pushing its valuation to $1.6 billion. Helium‚Äôs rally happened as data from the futures market showed that open interest was in a strong uptrend. According to CoinGlass , the interest rose to over $11 million on Sunday, up from last week‚Äôs low of $9.35 million. Most of this interest was in Bitget and OKX. You might also like: Dogecoin vs Ripple: December‚Äôs best buy, and how each compares to Lightchain AI Helium open interest Open interest is an important metric that looks at the number of unfilled call and put orders in the futures market. The metric often rises when an asset is seeing strong demand. Another likely catalyst for the token is that the number of burned HNT tokens has continued rising in the past few months. A recent report by Messari showed that the number of HNT burned in November stood at over $250,000. HNT is usually burned to access data credits to use the network. DePIN demand is accelerating.

After that, Nova Labs will assist CBRS transition by re-flashing their equipment to stock firmware. The decision affected about 4,000 CBRS holders. Helium price analysis HNT price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the HNT price has done well as it jumped from $5.22 earlier this month to $9.52 today. This was an important price since it failed to move above it on Dec. 2 and Dec. 7. It is also slightly above the key support at $8.667, its highest level in September. Helium has remained above the 50-day and 25-day moving averages. It has also moved slightly above the middle line of the Andrew‚Äôs pitchfork tool. Therefore, a clear break above the resistance level at $9.52 will invalidate the triple-top pattern and point to more gains. If this happens, the next point to watch will be at $11, the year-to-date high, which is about 18% above the current level. A break above that level could see it rally to $20. Helium was co-founded in 2013 by CEO Amir Haleem, Napster founder Shawn Fanning, and CTO Sean Carey.

Experts Predict Massive Price Gains Just Like Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) Saw,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/dtx-exchange-dtx-the-next-5x-crypto-star-experts-predict-massive-price-gains/,"The post DTX Exchange (DTX): The Next 5x Crypto Star? Experts Predict Massive Price Gains Just Like Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) Saw appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto space is heating up, with many cryptos like Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) seeing big price gains recently. But now, a new name is making headlines‚Äî DTX Exchange (DTX) . Many experts believe that this phase six presale star, which has already given early buyers a 500% return, could see the same growth potential as these top crypto coins. They foresee a potential 5x surge for DTX in 2025, which could make it one of the best tokens to watch for fast but explosive returns. DTX Exchange (DTX) Seen as an Altcoin Not To Miss Out On Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) offered something few had tried before: Ethereum opened the doors for DeFi with smart contracts, while Shiba Inu took advantage of the meme culture. Similarly, DTX Exchange (DTX) is making its path by combining the best of CEX and DEX, thus providing a one-stop-shop solution for traders. On it, people will be able to trade over 120K asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, crypto coins, etc. This will be made possible thanks to the VulcanX blockchain. The testnet for this blockchain was recently launched, making headlines with its TPS of over 100,000. The hype is intense for DTX Exchange, which has now raised over $10.1M in its crypto ICO event. During this event, traders can buy its native token DTX for a discount. Those holding DTX can give input on future DTX Exchange products and more. Currently, it is worth $0.12, which is a 500% rise from its starting price of $0.02. But a Tier-1 CEX listing is expected to push this altcoin price to $0.20 ‚Äì a 66% return for all who buy DTX. Poseidon: The Price of Ethereum (ETH) Could Reach $10K Ethereum (ETH) is a top 5 cryptocurrency showing green price charts. CoinMarketCap shows that the Ethereum price increased around 20% in the past month alone, moving between nearly $3,200 and close to $4,000. Crypto analyst Poseidon also excited traders with his Ethereum price prediction. In a recent X post, he told his followers that once this altcoin breaks past $4,000, nothing could stop it from reaching $10,000. Nevertheless, while Ethereum looks to be in a good spot right now, DTX Exchange clearly has some advantages. For instance, Ethereum has a TPS of 12-15, while DTX Exchange surpasses that by a long shot with a TPS of over 100K. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Could Break Out Soon, Bullish Indicators Show Shiba Inu (SHIB) is another token rising on the price charts. When it comes to Shiba Inu price movement, it has jumped nearly 15% on the one-month chart. Not only that, CoinMarketCap shows that its market cap grew from $14B to $16B in that period. According to crypto analyst Whales HQ, this meme coin is on the cusp of a big breakout. This Shiba Inu price prediction is backed by its technical analysis. TradingView shows that this meme coin is valued above its 30-day EMA ($0.000027) and its 50-day EMA ($0.000025). But, it is worth noting that the Shiba Inu coin has a market cap in the billions. In other words, although it may see a price surge, it may not be as big as people expect. On the other hand, DTX boasts a smaller market cap which means faster price growth with less money needed. Can DTX Exchange Be a Crypto Star Like Ethereum (ETH) & Shiba Inu (SHIB)? Traders have learned from Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) that being an early buyer can yield life-changing returns. Since DTX Exchange (DTX) will have a fair launch where everyone may benefit, and it has over 300K wallet addresses so far, it could be the next big thing in the crypto market. Some experts even hint at a potential 5x surge for this altcoin in 2025.

This initiative advances the country‚Äôs Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) development through Project Garuda. Bank Indonesia Governor Perry Warjiyo announced that the central bank has completed the ‚ÄúImmediate State,‚Äù representing the first phase of the Rupiah Digital exploration journey. The development aligns with the bank‚Äôs mandate as Indonesia‚Äôs sole currency issuer and responds to the rapid growth of the digital financial economy. ‚ÄúThis achievement is a manifestation of Bank Indonesia‚Äôs commitment to the development of the Rupiah Digital in response to the rapid growth of the digital financial economy,‚Äù Warjiyo stated in the official report. According to Bank Indonesia economist Fransiskus Xaverius Tyas Prasaja , the PoC validated the required technical capabilities using distributed ledger technology (DLT). The testing phase showed that DLT-based solutions could effectively meet the requirements of the Rupiah Digital business model. You might also like: Bitcoin to $180k? Expect a 30% correction, warns VanEck The technical implementation involved testing across two DLT platforms: Corda, developed by R3, and Hyperledger Besu, developed by Kaleido. Both platforms were tested through 55 scenarios, focusing on three core business processes: issuance, redemption, and fund transfer. The PoC revealed that the DLT platforms successfully integrated with conventional systems using existing standards and the ISO 20022 standard. Smart contracts showed better transaction efficiency and flexibility for future Rupiah Digital development. The central bank‚Äôs whitepaper , ‚ÄúProject Garuda: Navigating the Rupiah Digital Architecture,‚Äù states two remaining phases ‚Äì the Intermediate State and End State ‚Äì in Indonesia‚Äôs CBDC development roadmap. The successful completion of this initial phase positions Indonesia among the growing number of nations actively advancing their digital currency initiatives. Bank Indonesia emphasizes that the Rupiah Digital will be integrated with existing payment systems and financial market infrastructure, supporting both domestic and cross-border transactions. The PoC results have identified key areas for further exploration, including privacy mechanisms, liquidity management protocols, and multi-validator deployment strategies.

Before the meeting, there was little optimism for a Bitcoin victory. The board of directors had already decided against adding the asset to the company‚Äôs balance sheet. If the proposal had been approved, it would have immediately sparked another wave of momentum for the asset. Aside from the asset seeing a likely surge in price, it would have also started another buying spree, one led by corporations this time. The surge would have also BTC, which is still sustaining a Trump-fuelled run to greater heights, creating a batch of new millionaires among the elites and retail traders alike. A new Bitcoin buying spree is on the horizon All indications point to a renewed Bitcoin buying spree in the crypto industry. With Microsoft deciding against the asset, firms and retailers are stepping up. According to the think tank in charge of Microsoft‚Äôs proposal The National Center for Public Policy Research, the next company that is thinking about adding BTC to its balance sheet is Amazon. Amazon shareholders have scheduled an April meeting to vote on a Bitcoin proposal. The shareholders will vote on a proposal similar to Microsoft‚Äôs, requesting the company to consider BTC as a treasury asset. With BTC above the $100,000 mark and the regulatory clarity the Trump administration promised the crypto industry, other companies might be looking to follow in this direction. With more shareholders also seeing the potential of the asset, they might be forced to call for a consensus to vote on their firms adopting Bitcoin. If the firms refuse, it could lead to backlash from shareholders and the public. It would be a case of shareholders urging the companies to invest in an asset that they approve. This will mean more firms may gravitate toward Bitcoin to boost shareholder value, a win for the cryptocurrency. Presently, the largest publicly traded companies holding Bitcoin have some affiliation with Bitcoin, including Coinbase Global and Microstrategy. Although there is an exception like in the case of Tesla. Most of them are buying Bitcoin because they need to, with Coinbase Global a typical example. The firm has an exchange where people buy and sell the asset. Effect on investors and BTC‚Äôs broader outlook While Microsoft‚Äôs decision is a setback in the wider adoption push, investors are hoping for a new set of corporations to push Bitcoin forward. For that to happen, the people outside the crypto industry need to see the asset as secure and worthy of long-term investment. In terms of profit, investors need a renewed surge of shareholder activism for Bitcoin adoption to recoup huge profits from the asset. In a recent talk held by the National Center for Public Policy Research, the think tank chose Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor to give a talk on why Microsoft needs to buy Bitcoin. In his speech, Saylor said that if Microsoft could purchase $100 million in BTC every year, it would push the market cap of the company to trillions. Meanwhile, there is a stronger argument for holding Bitcoin, as individual investors are still supporting the asset.¬†With support from Wall Street and, very soon, the White House, hope is on the horizon. A notable purchase by one of the tech titans in Silicon Valley could set off another buying spree. While Microsoft may have dashed investors‚Äô hopes by refusing to make a statement by voting for Bitcoin, Amazon will have its opportunity soon.

A break near or above $0.010 will require a more robust push but isn‚Äôt impossible, as the coin achieved this level on March 12, 2024. Will AMP reach $1? Amp has never spiked above the $0.12 level. Even this price mark was observed only once at the start of the token‚Äôs launch, and AMP has never seen this level. It seems highly unlikely for AMP to achieve $1 soon. Will AMP reach $10? According to Cryptopolitan‚Äôs price prediction, AMP will not achieve this level in the next 10 years until something unusual happens. Considering AMP‚Äôs current market cap of only $204 million, the scenario seems almost impossible. Does AMP have a good long-term Future? Amp is trading near its average price level if observed over the longest price period levels. It can be a good long-term investment, as its price will double in 2025 and reach $0.068 by 2030.

AMP historic price sentiment The AMP token was officially launched on September 11, 2020, with an initial price of $0.009. In its early months, AMP experienced a downward trend, hitting an all-time low of roughly $0.0007 on November 17 of the same year. AMP price history However, the token reversed its fortunes entering 2021. It surpassed its launch price, reaching a notable high of about $0.046 on February 14, 2021. The momentum continued, and by April 18, AMP‚Äôs price peaked at $0.064. AMP set new records, reaching a high of $0.077 on May 7, 2021, and then $0.12 on June 16, following its listing on the prominent cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase. Despite these spikes, the overall trend for the rest of the year was bearish. By September 2021, AMP had fallen below the $0.05 mark as per crypto market data. In January 2022, AMP declined further to $0.02. The bear market proved challenging, and by June of that year, AMP‚Äôs price had fallen below its initial launch price. On September 7, it hit a 52-week low of $0.0054. In 2023, AMP attained a maximum price of $0.00642 and a minimum price of about $0.00146. Near the end of the year, AMP was trading at $0.0035. At the start of 2024, AMP gradually started its bullish cycle and reached $0.0056. On March 13, it peaked at $0.0129 before reversing. For May, June, and July, the AMP token continued its slow descent from the $0.0081 level to reach $0.0040, almost losing 40% of its value in three months. At the start of August 2024, AMP continued following the downtrend, reaching $0.0031, but made high spikes, leveling back to $0.00342 on August 25. In September 2024, the AMP token spiked as high as $0.00446 briefly, but in October AMP price dipped to the $0.00362 level. In November AMP touched $0.00800 mark, and is trading near $0.00734 at the start of December.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|OTHER,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-15 14:23:00

The new data showcases just how Trump‚Äôs victory has impacted crypto deal-making. Defillama data shows that VC funding for crypto startups in November was $796.41 million, while December is already at $511.48 million. Thus, the amount of funds raised by crypto startups in Q4 has already crossed $2 billion, more than the $1.7 billion that startups raised in Q3. VCs crypto investments since 2019. Source: Pitchbook While this marks a resurgence in crypto fundraising per quarter, it remains to be seen whether Trump‚Äôs momentum will be enough to make Q4 the biggest quarter for crypto startups in 2024. So far, Q1 has seen the biggest fundraising at $2.85 billion. Whether Q4 will beat that mark remains uncertain, but it looks to be on track. Nevertheless, VC interest in crypto remains low compared to the peak in 2022. Crypto startup fundraising peaked at $11.22 billion in Q1 of 2022. Since then, interest has declined due to the crypto industry‚Äôs struggles, including regulatory challenges. VCs bullish in expectation of regulatory clarity The rise in crypto funding is not completely surprising. It started in October and mirrors the general reaction of the crypto industry, first to the likelihood of Trump winning and, after the election, to his victory. With prices pumping and Bitcoin crossing $100,000, VCs are bullish on the crypto industry again and look forward to investing. This positive sentiment is fueled by the expected regulatory clarity that many believe the Trump administration will bring to the industry. With Trump already replacing the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler with a pro-crypto nominee and several pro-crypto people expected to join his cabinet, many believe the administration will allow the industry to thrive. Even crypto founders, including Solana‚Äôs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, have called on crypto startups to move to the US for the upside. Coinfund managing partner Chris Perkins also noted that regulatory overhaul will increase the number of startup deals. Perkins said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be a lot of cleanup. ‚Ä¶ People don‚Äôt realize how big a deal regulatory derisking is. It‚Äôs the biggest impediment to institutional adoption.‚Äù VCs are interested in other high-potential crypto sectors, such as tokenization, DeFi, stablecoins, infrastructure, and AI, which they consider the most attractive. Meanwhile, a few concerns remain about the Trump administration and whether he could achieve all his promises. This is not the first time that VCs and traditional finance have shown strong interest in the crypto sector, but many believe this episode will be different. For one, Trump appears very committed to achieving his pro-crypto plans and has a willing Congress backing him. Still, there are concerns that reality could fall below expectations. Avalanche and OG Foundation‚Äôs $250M raises lead Q4 deals Meanwhile, Layer-1 blockchain Avalanche is still the biggest raiser of Q4, receiving $250 million in a private, locked token sale led by Galaxy Digital, ParaFi Capital, and Dragonfly. Over 40 firms were involved in the token sale. Crypto-AI startup OG Foundation also raised $250 million in November in a token presale, while the affiliated developer OG Labs also raised $40 million in seed funding led by Hack VC, Delphi Digital, OKX Ventures, and Samsung Next. Beyond these two, most of the fundraising in this quarter has been for below $40 million, with Trump-backed World Liberty Financial raising $30 million, Klickl with $25 million, USDX Money with $45 million, and StakeStone with $22 million. Projects attracting investment fall into AI-crypto, real-world assets (RWA), DeFi, L1 and L2 networks, DePIN, and payments.

Musk Loves USA (MUSKUSA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Loves USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves USA could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves USA by entering its contract address ‚Äì DdmquVnPoj7RrjCiZ1yAc8p3b6bmCagcRUedBH6c572h ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKUSA.

In an interview , he highlighted its use-case as the future of money to drive massive investment. This will increase the asset‚Äôs price as well as the wider crypto sentiment. Zhao hinted at more strategic Bitcoin reserves for countries to flip negative macro realities. Talks around a Bitcoin reserve in the United States gained momentum in the run-up to the U.S. Elections. With a rising national debt, crypto enthusiasts tip the asset to offset debt and promote finance and cross-border payments. A possible US backing could influence other jurisdictions to adopt the top crypto for payments and a reserve. After the U.S. election, the price of Bitcoin hit new milestones, shaking off previous corrections and setting the tone for positive projections. Trading above $100K, bulls set sights on a higher rally on the back of increased institutional adoption. These inflows to the asset could spike growth coupled with government adoption in the coming decade. Bitcoin‚Äôs Utility Over Gold Zhao highlighted the advantages Bitcoin (BTC) has over gold amid recent adoption. Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory backed by heavy institutional buys , with bulls projected over-the-top surges for the crypto leader in five years. Gold and Bitcoin are popular as a store of value for varying groups of investors with a decade-long debate on utilities. In a recent interview, Zhao noted that Bitcoin is more scarce, coupled with new use cases that could fuel its price. Bitcoin is termed digital gold because of its portability and access to a wider adoption net, which users say helps its case against precious metals. According to him, the scarcity of the asset will drive more investment in the coming years. On the other hand, the world doesn‚Äôt know the total supply of gold despite its availability for centuries. ‚ÄúI think it should be way more than that (a 16 trillion market cap), as you said it has many advantages over gold and gold is not a limited asset, people control the supply of gold by not mining and we don‚Äôt know how much they are.

The altcoin leader continues its sideways trading despite glimpses of a forward run through multiple resistance. Lower market sentiments have affected bulls significantly, as shown in recent whale movements out of the ecosystem. New market data released by the firm shows dwindling confidence for a $5K resistance level break. Currently, traders believe it only has an 8% chance of hitting the market despite increasing inflows to spot Ethereum ETFs . Steve Dawson, Derive‚Äôs head of research, noted a 17% chance of tapping the mark at its peak. Frequent price grips and corrections lowered Ethereum‚Äôs chances of hitting $5K. ETH stands at $3,702 at press time, 35% away from the much-anticipated target. Unlike Bitcoin and other altcoins like Solana , institutional flows didn‚Äôt help ETH this year. Ethereum Bulls May Defy Odds Although the price target is far up for most users, Ethereum Bulls projects a massive uptrend based on swinging macro factors. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), ETH contributor Eric Conner flagged the increasing inflow into ETH ETFs, tipping a supply-side crisis. Similarly, a crypto trader, Pentosh, noted that the network is changing in terms of inflow with little resistance to a new all-time high. ‚Äú Much like this thread with BTC, $ETH is having structural changes as well as the beginning of consistent and large ETF flows. It just put in a HH, and had it‚Äôs highest weekly close of the year. There is a not much resistance from here to ath, which should act as a magnet. Above that is clear skies,‚Äù he added. Investors Can Drive Optimism Although Ethereum has traded below expectations compared to standings with other altcoins , recent inflows could be a catalyst for growth in 2025. Last week, the asset‚Äôs funds saw the largest institutional flows, beating July‚Äôs high when spot ETH ETFs were approved. Data from CoinShares show products picked up $1.2 billion in inflows, a wide margin from other altcoins. A key point for institutional traders remains its staking capability and DeFi numbers.

Analyst Shows That $3, $7, $14 Do Not Look Far",https://timestabloid.com/cardano-ada-for-500b-market-cap-analyst-shows-that-3-7-14-do-not-look-far/,"Dan Gambardello, a prominent cryptocurrency market analyst, has unveiled an optimistic forecast for Cardano (ADA) in the upcoming bull cycle. Gambardello believes that Cardano could achieve significant price milestones, including a $7 valuation and even a $14 peak, which would bring its market capitalization to an impressive $500 billion. This ambitious projection suggests an 11-fold increase from current levels, reflecting the analyst‚Äôs confidence in the unfolding supercycle. While bold, these predictions are grounded in Cardano‚Äôs historical performance and expanding ecosystem. The Cardano milestones of $3, $7, and $14 do not look far at all when you open up a daily chart. Super. Cycle. pic.twitter.com/NvSw0p7z4o ‚Äî Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) December 13, 2024 Recent Price Trends and Milestones At press time, Cardano (ADA) is trading at $1.12, marking a 0.24% drop in the past 24 hours. ADA needs to rise 177% from its current price to reach the $3.10 all-time high. Recent trends, however, demonstrate the asset‚Äôs capability for rapid growth. In November, the asset surged by 257%, climbing from $0.3214 to a two-year high of $1.1471. This performance suggests that reclaiming the $3 level may not be an overly ambitious goal for the cryptocurrency. To reach $7, the token would need a 525% price increase, resulting in a market capitalization of approximately $245 billion. On the other hand, achieving a $14 price target would necessitate a 1,150% gain, pushing the market cap to the half-trillion-dollar mark. Historical Performance Supports Optimism While a 1,150% increase may seem daunting, some Cardano supporters argue it is achievable based on the asset‚Äôs historical trends. For example, during the last bull market, ADA experienced a remarkable 17,364% increase from its cycle low to its all-time high. The token‚Äôs lowest point during the last cycle was $0.01913 in March 2020. By September 2021, ADA had surged to $3.161, marking a 164-fold increase in value. Proponents believe that the $14 target for this cycle may even be conservative, compared to its previous performance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Factors Driving Optimism Beyond historical trends, the asset has made significant strides in development and partnerships, positioning itself for long-term growth. The network has recently formed alliances with major blockchain projects such as Bitcoin, Ripple, Stellar, and Dogecoin. Additionally, influential industry leaders, including Ripple‚Äôs Brad Garlinghouse and Stellar‚Äôs Jed McCaleb , have expressed support for Cardano (ADA). These partnerships and endorsements add credibility to its growth potential. Founder Charles Hoskinson has also announced plans to build a dedicated team to establish the asset as the leading platform for Bitcoin DeFi applications. Furthermore, the network is actively working with universities and governments, including initiatives in Argentina, to expand its influence and adoption. Potential to Surpass Ethereum With its expanding ecosystem, technological advancements, and growing support, analysts like Gambardello believe the digital asset could challenge Ethereum‚Äôs dominance in the blockchain space. While Ethereum has long been viewed as the market leader, Cardano‚Äôs supporters argue that its undervaluation presents significant upside potential. As the cryptocurrency market gears up for its next bull run, the token‚Äôs path to $7 and beyond will depend on market dynamics, adoption, and technological innovation. While the $14 projection remains ambitious, proponents view it as a realistic goal for the next cycle. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve (TRUMPRES), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRES is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve could become the next viral memecoin. Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve by entering its contract address ‚Äì 2GxwMgJnqbDuDec9gMVNfN2n8eVf7ks1EUv1RZSCLNm1 ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

The registration, which was revealed in a post on X, has led users to anticipate a potential token launch, which would mean a marketplace airdrop. Earlier this year, the Cayman Islands announced new amendments to its Virtual Assets Act, providing licensing for virtual asset platforms while updating its anti-money laundering act. The new update established the region as the go-to place for friendly crypto-policy and a prime location for business. Cayman Island general registry showing OPENSEA‚Äôs Foundation registration | Waleswoosh via X Is OpenSea making its comeback? Some months ago, OpenSea CEO and co-founder Devin Finzer hinted at a resurgence of the platform, noting that the marketplace is planning to make a comeback. In his post on X, Finzer said the platform needs to take a step back to come back the right way. ‚ÄúTo really innovate, sometimes you have to take a step back and reimagine everything. So we built a new OpenSea from the ground up,‚Äù Finzer said.

Furthermore, the OpenSea handle on X shared a link that led to a waiting list page that asked users to connect their wallets. A DappRadar-affiliated handle mentioned that there is serious hype about the new platform, hinting that the platform could launch a token. While OpenSea has yet to provide any detailed explanation or statement, users are going off with a theory of a likely token airdrop. When the first announcement came months ago, there was no likelihood of an airdrop happening because of OpenSea‚Äôs United States-based operations. However, this new development has sparked renewed optimism that the platform may reward its users. Matter Labs‚Äô Golem also took to his X handle to drop his opinion , drumming up hopes that the platform rewards early users. ‚ÄúOpensea officially registers a foundation in the Cayman Islands. This means that an OpenSea token is coming. I pray that they reward their OG users, myself & many others who came up on NFTs & OpenSea in 2021. They have the chance to turn everything around,‚Äù he said. Users anticipate OpenSea‚Äôs attempt to win back loyalists The consensus is how OpenSea intends to win back its loyalists, seeing other platforms already snatching them up. A user mentioned that OpenSea might decide to follow marketplaces like Blur and Magic Eden, to issue tokens and incentivize its loyalists. This is not the first time that OpenSea will attempt to reinsert itself in the NFT conversation, with the platform announcing zero fees in an attempt to retake the lead from Blur. Blur, on the other hand, continues to hold on steady in front, dominating the NFT marketplace in trading volume. OpenSea is second, while OKX is not too far behind in third place. The company¬†made a statement when it entered the market, incentivizing users with token airdrops at the end of every trading season. Blur gave a user $11 million in Blur tokens after the marketplace concluded its second trading season in 2023. Magic Eden also followed in the same direction, promising its users airdrops for their activities on the platform. The platform‚Äôs native token, ME, rose to $13.10 before falling by about 70%, much to the discontent of its users.

This bullish momentum aligns with a wider market recovery, signaling potential for further gains. Analysts suggest that Solana may be gearing up for a breakout, as its current consolidation phase hints at new all-time highs on the horizon. Analyst Predicts Solana Price Next ATH Surge Crypto analyst recently tweeted an insightful prediction regarding Solana‚Äôs price trajectory. Based on technical analysis, the analyst forecasts a potential surge toward new all-time highs (ATH). The current price movement reflects consolidation within a descending channel, which may signify a bullish continuation pattern. Solana price has experienced impressive gains over the past months, recovering from its previous lows. Now trading around $223, the analyst highlights the next significant resistance zone at $420.68. This level remains crucial as it marks Solana‚Äôs previous all-time high. The chart analysis shows SOL forming higher lows, a strong bullish signal for further upward momentum. Breaking out of the current channel could lead to a powerful rally toward the target price. Source- X Will SOL Price Reclaim Its ATH Soon? At the time of writing, the SOL price has seen a slight decline, trading at $220.08. This marks a 0.85% drop within the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency touched a low of $215.34 and reached a high of $223.01 during this period. However, it still sits 16.43% below its all-time high of $263.83, achieved on November 23, 2024. With the surge in crypto market like BTC hovering above $100k may fuel the bullish optimism. If the bullish pressure regains control, the SOL price prediction could hit $263, approaching its previous all-time high (ATH). Should buyers sustain momentum, Solana‚Äôs price might surge further to $300, with a possibility of testing the $420 resistance zone. However, if bears take charge, the price could fall back to $200. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator reflects a bearish outlook as the MACD line currently trends below the signal line. The histogram also shows declining green bars, signaling reduced bullish strength. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), SOL remains in a neutral zone with a reading of 46.44. This level suggests a balance between buyers and sellers but highlights a lack of immediate bullish momentum. Solana Price chart: TradingView According to Coinglass Data, (SOL) derivatives market has shown a notable uptick in performance. Trading volume surged by 3.12%, reaching a total of $5.74 billion. Open interest, another key market indicator, climbed by 4% to $5.34 billion. These figures reflect growing investor activity and interest in Solana‚Äôs derivatives segment.

POPCAT: A potential revival in the cryptocurrency market POPCAT is a new cryptocurrency aiming to breathe life into a market affected by dead wallets, pump and dumps, and rug pulls.

It seeks to restore confidence by introducing innovative technology and engaging the community to revitalize the market. In the current market cycle, where investors are cautious yet eager for credible prospects, POPCAT‚Äôs potential to deliver meaningful growth makes it an attractive consideration for those exploring new opportunities in the crypto space.

As of mid-December 2023, BONK became the third-largest meme coin by market cap, with a year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Despite challenges like a high total supply and the volatile nature of memecoins, BONK‚Äôs integration into the growing Solana ecosystem, including the launch of the decentralized exchange BonkSwap, positions it as a notable player. The coin looks attractive in the current market cycle. Conclusion While MEW, POPCAT, WIF, and BONK show limited short-term potential, DOGEN stands out.

The proposal proposes replacing the current system, where one Bitcoin (BTC) is equal to 100 million satoshis (sats), with a simpler structure that makes the satoshi the new base unit. Under Carvalho‚Äôs plan, ‚Äúone Bitcoin‚Äù will no longer represent the larger BTC unit we know today. Instead, it will refer to the smallest indivisible Bitcoin unit, currently called a satoshi, which is equivalent to one hundred-millionth of a Bitcoin. This redefinition will eliminate the need for decimal points in Bitcoin transactions, making values easier to read and understand. For example, a transaction currently displayed as 0.00010000 BTC will appear as 10,000 BTC under the proposed system. Related News: Onchain Data Shows Whale, Who Once Had $240 Million in Assets, Bought This Altcoin Carvalho argues that this change will reduce confusion, bring Bitcoin‚Äôs appearance into line with its integrated protocol, and make the cryptocurrency system more user-friendly for newcomers. ‚ÄúThe decimal point is just a human-imposed abstraction,‚Äù Carvalho says, suggesting that Bitcoin‚Äôs technical framework supports this change. Carvalho‚Äôs proposal is not the first to address Bitcoin‚Äôs unit structure. In 2017, leading Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song introduced BIP 176, which advocated using ‚Äúbits‚Äù as a standard value. This would allow users to avoid confusing fractional BTC displays when dealing with smaller transactions. However, the idea never gained widespread adoption. Critics warn that redefining Bitcoin‚Äôs currency structure could present challenges for wallets, exchanges and other platforms already built around the current system. Such changes could also confuse existing users and increase the risk of transaction errors during the transition period. *This is not investment advice.

33767162,[object Object],1734278403,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin CME Options Data Signals Big Move Ahead ‚Äì Details,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-cme-options-data-signals-big-move-ahead-details/,"Bitcoin has experienced a calm weekend, maintaining its momentum above the $100,000 mark after breaking this milestone on Wednesday and setting new highs. The crypto market is buzzing with anticipation as BTC consolidates near its historic levels, with traders and investors eagerly awaiting its next move. Adding to the excitement, CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn recently highlighted compelling data on CME Options Open Interest (USD) ‚Äì Stacked by Position. This data points to growing activity among institutional traders, suggesting that a significant price movement could be on the horizon. Historically, similar spikes in open interest have preceded major volatility in Bitcoin‚Äôs price, making this metric one to watch closely. While Bitcoin‚Äôs quiet weekend offers a moment of respite for market participants, the underlying signals suggest that this calm may not last long. As the crypto king hovers near its all-time highs, many are speculating whether it will continue its upward trajectory or face a temporary pullback. Either way, the stage is set for an intriguing week ahead, with key market metrics hinting at heightened activity and potential fireworks in the coming days. Stay tuned as Bitcoin‚Äôs next move could define the narrative for the broader cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin Open Interest: Calls Stacking Up Bitcoin has been in an uptrending range since late November, consistently making higher highs but failing to set a massive breakout. The price action has remained steady, with Bitcoin continuing to climb toward new levels. Despite the positive momentum, the market is waiting for a decisive move to push the price higher, and many traders are closely monitoring Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to break above its all-time highs (ATH). CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn recently shared key insights on X , highlighting an interesting development in Bitcoin‚Äôs market structure. According to Maartunn, BTC stacked put positions have reached multi-year highs, which could signal a brewing storm. In his analysis, he presents a chart showing the rising activity in put options, often reflecting a build-up of high-leverage positions. This type of market behavior tends to precede massive price movements, especially when leveraged positions are liquidated. While Bitcoin continues its upward push, the market is walking a fine line. If Bitcoin fails to break above its ATH and continues to trade within the current range, there is a significant risk of a retrace. A correction could follow, especially if high-leverage positions start to unwind. With the growing open interest in put options, this adds to the uncertainty. BTC Testing Liquidity In Price Discovery Bitcoin is trading at $101,750 after days of being stuck below the $102,000 mark. While the price has remained resilient, it has struggled to break through key resistance levels. For the bulls to maintain their momentum, the price needs to decisively break above $103,600. A strong push past this level would signal a continuation of the uptrend and potentially lead to new highs. However, if BTC fails to break above $103,600, there is a strong likelihood that it will retest lower demand levels. The next significant support zone to watch is around $95,500. A failure to clear $103,600 would indicate that the bears are starting to gain control, and BTC could face a deeper correction as traders begin to sell into weakness. In the coming days, traders will be closely watching for any signs of a breakout or breakdown. A decisive move above $103,600 could trigger a rally, but if BTC falters and falls back toward $95,500, the market could experience increased volatility, and further downside may follow.

Despite its strong fundamentals, doubts linger in the market regarding Ethereum‚Äôs performance this cycle, with some expecting it to underperform amid stiff competition from other blockchain ecosystems. However, Ethereum‚Äôs recent price action suggests that it is building momentum, keeping investors on edge for a potential breakout. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck Between $99K And $102K ‚Äì Analyst Explains Macro Situation Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis, noting that Ethereum has encountered strong resistance near the $4,000 mark and is now consolidating within a symmetrical triangle on the hourly chart. This pattern often precedes a decisive move, leaving traders speculating whether ETH will break out to new highs or face a temporary pullback. Ethereum‚Äôs performance at this key level will likely shape market sentiment in the coming weeks. A breakout above $4,000 could pave the way for a rally toward its all-time high, reigniting investor confidence. On the other hand, failure to clear this resistance might validate bearish concerns and lead to a retrace. As ETH remains at a critical juncture, all eyes are on its ability to navigate this pivotal zone and deliver the next major move. Ethereum Preparing To Move Ethereum has been grappling with significant resistance above the $4,100 level, leaving the market in suspense as traders anticipate its next move. With the price consolidating and showing signs of tension, Ethereum appears ready to make a decisive move in the coming days. The critical question remains: will it break higher, or is a pullback imminent? Runefelt shared his insights on X, pointing out that Ethereum is currently trading within a symmetrical triangle on the hourly chart‚Äîa pattern known for signaling potential breakouts or breakdowns. According to Runefelt, Ethereum‚Äôs immediate future hinges on two key levels. A breakout above $4,100 would confirm a bullish trajectory, likely propelling ETH toward new highs. Conversely, a breakdown below $3,675 would signal bearish sentiment, opening the door for a deeper correction. Related Reading: Solana To New ATH Before Christmas ‚Äì Analyst Expects $300 Soon Runefelt emphasizes the importance of these levels, noting that the symmetrical triangle suggests mounting pressure that could soon lead to significant volatility. As Ethereum holds its position near critical resistance, the next few days are shaping up to be pivotal for determining its market direction. Technical Levels To Watch Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $3,840 after failing to break above the critical $4,000 resistance level. While the price remains strong and within range of this key level, it needs to clear $4,000 to confirm the continuation of its uptrend. Without a decisive breakout, ETH risks losing momentum, leaving traders and investors cautious about the next move. The $4,000 level has proven to be a significant psychological and technical barrier for Ethereum, with multiple attempts to break it being met with selling pressure. A successful breach of this resistance would likely pave the way for ETH to target higher levels, potentially pushing toward the yearly high of $4,100 and beyond. Related Reading: Dogecoin Will See New ATH Soon ‚Äì Top Trader Sets $2 Target However, if Ethereum fails to overcome this hurdle, the market could see a retrace to lower demand zones. The $3,500 area is emerging as a critical support level that traders are closely monitoring. A dip to this level could provide a strong foundation for a bounce, but losing this support might signal a shift toward bearish sentiment.

Inspired by Dogecoin, it uses the same cute dog mascot. But SHIB is different because it runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work with many Ethereum applications. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous person named Ryoshi, SHIB had a huge supply of one quadrillion tokens. To gain trust, Ryoshi sent half of these tokens to Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum. Buterin made headlines by donating a large amount of SHIB to help India fight COVID-19. He also ‚Äúburned‚Äù 40% of the tokens, reducing the supply forever. SHIB‚Äôs connection with Ethereum opens up many possibilities. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB can be used in decentralized apps. There‚Äôs already ShibaSwap, a platform where users can trade tokens without a middleman. Plans for a future NFT platform and a system where holders can vote on changes make SHIB even more interesting. In today‚Äôs market, SHIB shows potential because it combines the fun of memecoins with the power of Ethereum. While it‚Äôs still a risky investment, some see SHIB as more than just a joke, possibly offering real utility in the crypto world.

The Ripple-linked token reclaimed its early 2018 highs amid speculation that regulatory clarity is coming and that it will open the door to U.S.-listed spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). A widely-followed analyst recently commented about XRP‚Äôs price action, arguing that its rally is just getting started. The analyst pseudonymously known as CryptoWZRD compared XRP‚Äôs current performance to its parabolic rally in 2017, forecasting a repeat of the surge in the near future. Could XRP Mirror 2017 Rally? CryptoWZRD took to X to share a chart that shows XRP‚Äôs trend of forming long-term symmetrical triangle patterns, where resistance levels are flipped into robust support. This pattern can be seen in the historical price performance from 2017, which is similar to the present setup. The accompanying chart shows that XRP witnessed an explosive breakout from a multi-year consolidation phase. The crypto then saw a 40% pullback in the first week of April 2017 after surging by over 280% in March of that year. Notably, the downtrend continued until late April, with XRP recouping all losses and skyrocketing in May of the same year. The asset continued rising until it hit its current all-time high of $3.40 in January 2018. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry if you think it‚Äôs over, it‚Äôs barely begun. It cannot get any simpler.. a 2017 style big boom is coming for $XRP,‚Äù CryptoWZRD wrote in his post. Market Developments Spark Bullish Market Sentiment A flurry of market participants anticipates a major market rally ahead for XRP, given a series of bullish developments in the Ripple ecosystem. For context, the market expects a more lenient regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies after Donald Trump‚Äôs election victory. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple for alleged securities violations, leaving XRP with an uncertain future in the United States. However, the forthcoming regime change has bolstered investors‚Äô confidence that XRP will encounter fewer challenges ahead, and could be adopted for spot ETFs. Moreover, some crypto commentators have said that Ripple‚Äôs upcoming RLUSD stablecoin launch will create several tailwinds for XRP, mainly because it will provide the San Francisco-based blockchain payments firm with a less volatile asset to deepen its remittance and settlement services. At press time, XRP remains about 28.2% down from its $3.40 record high, but again, it‚Äôs closer than it has been in roughly seven years.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-15 16:07:40
