Saifedean Ammous explains,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/why-bitcoin-is-superior-to-gold-in-every-way/,"American economist Saifedean Ammous argues that Bitcoin is superior to gold because it has a fixed supply, is digital, and is not controlled by governments, making it a better store of value and a solution to inflation and debt issues in today‚Äôs financial systems. Ammous, author of The Bitcoin Standard , argues in a recent interview that Bitcoin is superior to gold. He believes Bitcoin is a revolutionary form of money. Its fixed supply and decentralized nature make it more reliable than gold. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what #Bitcoin fixes. If we go back to having a HARD money where money is no longer debt, we no longer need to be monetizing debt. We no longer need to get everyone to become a debt slave in order for us to have a form of money.‚Äù ‚Äì @saifedean w/ @JoeSquawk üéØ pic.twitter.com/Tb3HLT2n4o ‚Äî Walker‚ö°Ô∏è (@WalkerAmerica) December 13, 2024 Bitcoin vs. gold Ammous explains that while gold has historically been used as money due to its scarcity and store of value properties, Bitcoin has taken these qualities to a new level. ‚ÄúGold has been used for 4,000 years because it stores value well. But the problem with Gold is that it‚Äôs not as scarce as Bitcoin,‚Äù Ammous states. ‚ÄúThe annual increase in gold supply is around 1.5% to 2%, whereas Bitcoin‚Äôs supply is capped at 21 million, and its annual supply growth rate is even lower‚Äîabout 0.8% during its current four-year period,‚Äù he added. On e of the advantages Bitcoin has over gold is its fixed supply, which is set in stone. ‚Äú There‚Äôs only ever going to be 21 million Bitcoin. That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs a simple fact, and no other form of money can claim such a property,‚Äù Ammous continues. This scarcity makes Bitcoin a somewhat deflationary asset, unlike fiat currencies that governments can print in unlimited quantities. Am mous believes this unique property makes Bitcoin a much stronger store of value compared to gold or any government-issued currency. Another key difference is how Bitcoin operates. While gold relies on physical storage and transport, Bitcoin is purely digital, meaning it can be transferred and stored globally without needing physical handling. ‚ÄúBitcoin is just software. It doesn‚Äôt require a legal framework that is tied to government-backed currencies. It‚Äôs decentralized and automated,‚Äù Ammous points out. He contrasts this with fiat money, which is deeply intertwined with government control and monetary policy. Why Bitcoin is the future of money Ammous also highlights the importance of Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to prevent inflation. Unlike fiat currencies, which lose value over time as central banks print more money, Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply makes it impervious to inflationary pressures. ‚ÄúIn the world of fiat, governments continuously increase the supply of money, which leads to a decrease in its value,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúIn the case of Bitcoin, no one can just print more. It‚Äôs a money that cannot be inflated.‚Äù Ammous stresses the issue of debt in today‚Äôs financial systems. ‚ÄúFiat money is built on the concept of debt. Every time the government needs more money, they increase the currency supply, essentially creating more debt,‚Äù he states. This creates a cycle of borrowing and inflation that benefits the government but harms everyday citizens who watch their savings lose value. In contrast, Bitcoin provides a way out of this system. ‚ÄúWith Bitcoin, you don‚Äôt need to be in debt to participate in the economy. It‚Äôs a form of money that doesn‚Äôt require borrowing or printing,‚Äù he says. The economist believes that Bitcoin‚Äôs technological advantages and fixed supply make it the ideal money for the modern age. ‚ÄúB itcoin is a form of money that is more scarce, portable, and secure than gold,‚Äù he concludes. ‚ÄúIt offers a solution to the problems caused by fiat currencies and offers a future where money is no longer tied to government debt and manipulation.‚Äù With more people realizing Bitcoin‚Äôs revolutionary potential, its value continues to rise as a monetary asset that will outlast and outperform gold in the coming years.

In a recent statement, Morehead outlined the advantages of Bitcoin over traditional reserve assets and highlighted its potential role in US economic policy. Morehead began his remarks by addressing the US‚Äôs dependence on gold as a reserve asset. ‚ÄúThe United States stores $600 billion worth of gold,‚Äù Morehead said, adding that this amount is equivalent to 11 million years of American wages. Despite its historical importance, Morehead argued that gold is becoming obsolete as a reserve asset in the digital age. Turning to Bitcoin, Morehead described it as a ‚Äúmuch better‚Äù store of value than gold. He noted that Bitcoin‚Äôs digital nature, rarity and global accessibility make it a more efficient and forward-looking reserve asset. ‚ÄúGo to digital gold, go to Bitcoin, it‚Äôs much better,‚Äù he said. Related News: Donald Trump's Altcoin Portfolio Has Major Shifts - Here's the Latest After the Volatility Morehead also explained that the US currently owns about 1% of the world‚Äôs Bitcoin supply, which he believes is both a strategic and rational position. ‚ÄúKeep it, increase it,‚Äù Morehead advised, adding that it would be a positive policy decision for the US to expand its Bitcoin holdings. He also noted that other countries have already started owning Bitcoin, indicating that the US should take the lead in adopting BTC as part of its reserve strategy. *This is not investment advice.

Homo Shiba Inu (HOMOSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address ‚Äì 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOSHIB.

This growth reflects broader market bullishness and increased institutional interest in Bitcoin as a financial asset. Key drivers include MicroStrategy‚Äôs inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 and global discussions on national Bitcoin reserves. Moreover, Japan is considering creating a national Bitcoin reserve, signaling that countries are starting to see Bitcoin as an important financial asset. This recognition could increase demand for Bitcoin and strengthen its role in global financial strategies, further supporting its price growth. National BTC Reserves: A Global Push Underpin Bitcoin Price A notable development comes from Japan, where lawmaker Satoshi Hamada has proposed establishing a national Bitcoin reserve. Submitted to Japan‚Äôs National Diet on December 11, this initiative aims to position Bitcoin as a strategic financial asset.

Tamaki has previously advocated for crypto-friendly tax reforms and regulatory improvements, signaling a potential shift in Japan‚Äôs stance on Bitcoin. #„É°„Çø„Éó„É©„Éç„ÉÉ„Éà #metaplanet @Metaplanet_JP #BTC Japanese lawmaker asks government yo create national bitcoin reserve pic.twitter.com/YfTHp1eJgt ‚Äî meow (@foorpfokrow) December 13, 2024 Globally, other nations are also exploring similar initiatives.

Brazil and Poland have introduced similar legislative efforts. These moves signal Bitcoin‚Äôs growing recognition as a strategic asset, driving demand and enhancing investor confidence. MicroStrategy‚Äôs Nasdaq-100 Inclusion and Implications MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, will join the Nasdaq-100 on December 23, becoming the first Bitcoin-focused company in this elite index. This milestone aligns MicroStrategy with major firms like Apple and Tesla, increasing Bitcoin‚Äôs visibility among institutional investors.

MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin strategy, led by Michael Saylor, has positioned the company as a key advocate for Bitcoin adoption. The firm holds $42 billion worth of Bitcoin, and its Nasdaq-100 inclusion is seen as a validation of its approach. However, experts caution that MicroStrategy‚Äôs heavy Bitcoin exposure could lead to a reclassification as a financial firm, potentially disqualifying it from the index. Despite this risk, the move has already pushed Bitcoin price above $102,000 and MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock past $400. Broader Implications for Bitcoin The growing adoption of Bitcoin as a national reserve and increased exposure through institutional channels like the Nasdaq-100 highlight its evolution into a mainstream financial asset. These developments are driving demand and reinforcing Bitcoin‚Äôs role in global financial strategies, making it a central figure in the cryptocurrency market‚Äôs ongoing growth. As nations and corporations deepen their engagement with Bitcoin, its trajectory as a valuable and strategic asset appears increasingly solidified. Bitcoin Price Holds Key Support Near $100,860; Rising Channel Pattern Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $100,860, showing a minor decline of 0.46% in the last session. The chart reveals a rising channel pattern, with Bitcoin testing key support near $100,800. A break below this level could lead to further downside toward $99,736 and $99,000, with stronger support seen at $97,349. On the upside, immediate resistance lies at $101,404, followed by $102,617 and $103,661. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 53.13 indicates neutral momentum, though a dip below 50 could signal increased bearish pressure. Meanwhile, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) around $99,689 is acting as a dynamic support level, reinforcing the ongoing trend. For now, Bitcoin‚Äôs technical outlook suggests cautious optimism, as it remains within its ascending channel. ‚Äì You might also like Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 ‚Äì 2034 $STARS Presale Surges Past $16.8M: Final Days to Participate Crypto All-Stars ($STARS) is redefining staking for meme coin holders with its innovative MemeVault platform.

In another X post, Trader Tardigrade stated that a possible Dogecoin scenario has come up with a double-bottom chart pattern. He added that DOGE had formed two equal lows with a resistance at the neckline, which is at around $0.46. Meanwhile, the crypto analyst also recently stated that the Dogecoin price has gained more buying power with a bullish crossover on the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD). His analysis suggested that Dogecoin could break this resistance at $0.46 and rally to around $0.5 on the next leg of the DOGE bull run. This rally to $0.5 could just be the start of the projected rally to $2.15 based on the bull flag on the Dogecoin price chart. It is worth mentioning that Trader Tardigrade has before now provided more bullish predictions for Dogecoin in this market cycle. The analyst predicted that DOGE could reach as high as $30 in this cycle while advising market participants to start taking profits around $10. What The Next Move Could Look Like Crypto analyst KrissPax provided insights into what the next move up for the Dogecoin price could look like. He stated that following the double-bottom pattern on DOGE‚Äôs chart, a fractal from past price action shows a possible move up through Monday, followed by an upward trend until Christmas.

With the ADA price jumping to a three-year high over the past month, Gambardello said the coin‚Äôs growth has woken up many people. Cardano Price Helped Prove Peer Dominance As Dan Gambardello noted, ADA price jumped from $0.32 to a high of $1.3 over the past month. Gambardello insinuated that this growth, which amounts to 306%, has made Cardano too big to ignore, even for major influencers. The top analyst said major influencers could no longer continue negative coverage of the asset. This, he claims is because these critics now know how silly they will look with sustained negative coverage as ADA prices continue to soar. The sudden Cardano move from .32 to $1.30 woke a lot of people up. Major influencers quickly realized they can‚Äôt continue negative $ADA coverage. They know they‚Äôd look silly through the bull market as $ADA keeps pumping. Now they‚Äôre bullish because they‚Äôve fallen in line. ‚Äî Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) December 14, 2024 The statement from Dan Gambardello hinges on the broad backlash Cardano has received over the past few years. As a media personality in crypto, he has used his platform to promote the coin. Gambardello largely supports major price growth for Cardano. Meanwhile, this is in line with previous ADA price analysis that tips a surge to $2. As of writing, the coin has pared off some of its gains over the past day. It is now down by 6.05% to $1.05 as of writing. The coin has dropped to this lowest level after soaring as high as $1.13 in the past 24 hours. Prospects and Hurdles Despite the massive accolades for Cardano, the underlying protocol has a number of hurdles to cross in the near future. Recently, a Cardano Foundation whistleblower flagged gross incompetence at the organization, sparking community speculation. With the foundation allegedly disaligned with Input Output Global (IOG) and other founding bodies, the prospect of its decentralized endeavors are now in doubt. However, the protocol has continued to innovate in its technological push. With advanced Hydra test and scalability upgrades, analysts like Dan Gambardello are optimistic the future of ADA remains bright.

Qubetics‚Äô commitment to simplifying blockchain adoption has garnered strong market support. During its presale, Qubetics raised over $6 million , distributed more than 324 million $TICS tokens , and attracted a growing community of over 9,400 holders . The current price of $TICS is $0.0311 , with projections indicating significant growth as the QubeQode platform gains traction. Analysts predict that as QubeQode adoption grows, Qubetics will emerge as one of the best cryptos for massive return potential , offering unparalleled growth opportunities for early investors. Hedera: The Leader in Enterprise-Grade Blockchain Hedera Hashgraph has positioned itself as a leader in enterprise-grade blockchain solutions, offering unmatched speed, security, and scalability. Its unique consensus mechanism, known as Hashgraph, sets it apart from traditional blockchains by providing high throughput and low latency.

This surprising turn of event was after the government outlawed the use of crypto in the country in 2017. The decision was part of a global trend in which many countries were skeptical about crypto‚Äôs volatile and unregulated nature. The nation is now laying the groundwork to embrace crypto assets and regulate the sector. Morocco Shift in Strategy: From Crypto Ban to Regulation Back then, the government cited financial instability, terrorism financing, and money laundering as the reasons for banning crypto in the country. The decision seemed like the best way to protect the country‚Äôs economy. In 2024, Morocco‚Äôs financial landscape is now undergoing a profound transformation. The announcement by Bank Al-Maghrib, Morocco‚Äôs central bank, to draft crypto regulations marks a pivotal moment. Central bank governor Abdellatif Jouahri has confirmed that the draft is under review, signaling a commitment to bringing crypto into the formal economy. This change aligns Morocco with a global trend of evolving digital asset regulations. Countries that were once critical of crypto, including China and Bolivia are now developing frameworks to harness its potential . Interestingly, over 130 nations are exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Morocco‚Äôs shift to crypto aims to boost financial inclusion. This is because 42% of the population are still unbanked. Crypto and a future CBDC can bridge this gap. Also smartphones, crypto wallets can enable savings, investments, and cross-border payments. Crypto‚Äôs Underground Rise in Morocco Despite the 2017 ban, cryptocurrencies found fertile ground in Morocco‚Äôs informal economy. In 2023, the country was ranked among the top 20 globally for crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis. It was also listed 13th in Bitcoin usage by Insider Monkey. Ownership of cryptocurrencies steadily climbed, rising from 2.4% of the population in 2021 to 3.1% in 2022. The ban didn‚Äôt stop crypto but pushed it into unregulated underground markets without protections. This exposed the need for formal rules to manage risks and unlock its potential. Challenges on the Road Ahead While Morocco‚Äôs embrace of crypto holds promise, it comes with significant challenges. The government must establish clear regulations to govern transactions and exchanges. This includes efficient Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) measures to prevent misuse. Many citizens remain unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies. This makes public education essential to promote understanding and responsible use. To support adoption, Morocco needs reliable technological infrastructure. This includes securing platforms for transactions and better internet access in rural areas. The authorities need to integrate crypto with traditional banking systems to ensure stability and consumer protection. Additionally, stringent cybersecurity measures need to be in place to protect users against fraud and hacking. Also, international collaboration will help Morocco align its policies with global standards and maintain financial integrity.

This month, the spotlight is shining on three heavy hitters: BTFD Coin, Dogs, and Bone ShibaSwap. These projects are stirring up FOMO across the crypto space faster than a Tim Hortons queue on a Monday morning. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned trader or just looking to park your loonies somewhere promising, you‚Äôll want to stick around for this. Let‚Äôs start with a quick hat tip to BTFD Coin , the absolute headliner of meme coin presales this month. Sitting pretty in its 10th presale stage, this rising star has already raked in over $3.8 million, sold 54 billion tokens, and amassed a loyal community of over 5,100 Bulls. When a project hits a cool million in under ten days, you know it‚Äôs not just riding the hype‚Äîit‚Äôs making waves. BTFD Coin: A Movement Wrapped in Memes If there‚Äôs one word to describe BTFD Coin, it‚Äôs ‚Äúmomentum.‚Äù Short for ‚ÄúBuy The Dip,‚Äù this Ethereum-based gem champions a fearless approach to market downturns, rallying a community ready to seize the dips like a Canuck hitting the slopes. The Bulls Squad‚Äîfour vibrant mascots, including Baby Bull and Nerdy Bull‚Äîaren‚Äôt just cute branding; they‚Äôre symbols of a strong community that‚Äôs already carved out its space in the meme coin cosmos. Add to that a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game where players earn BTFD tokens and a staking APY of 90%, and you‚Äôre looking at utility far beyond the average meme coin. But let‚Äôs talk tokenomics, because this isn‚Äôt some fly-by-night operation. With nearly half its supply allocated to presale and a long-term liquidity lock of three years, BTFD Coin is structured for sustainability. And the best part? The presale isn‚Äôt slowing down. With every stage bringing fresh buzz, the FOMO here is as real as watching your favourite poutine joint run out of gravy. Dogs: Barking Up the Right Tree Ah, Dogs, a meme coin that‚Äôs all about man‚Äôs best friend‚Äîbut with a crypto twist. While Dogs hasn‚Äôt reached the mainstream heights of some of its canine counterparts (looking at you, Dogecoin), it‚Äôs carving its niche by sticking close to its community. Dogs boasts a decentralised governance model that gives its holders a real say in the project‚Äôs future. It‚Äôs like having your hockey team consult you on the line-up‚Äîpretty unheard of, but definitely appreciated. Plus, its meme-worthy charm is backed by utility, including partnerships with animal welfare organisations. Now, isn‚Äôt that a tail-wagging bonus? Its roadmap hints at future integrations and even NFT opportunities, which could set it apart in the crowded field of dog-themed cryptos. If you‚Äôre looking for a coin with heart, Dogs is worth a shot. Bone ShibaSwap: The Utility Powerhouse If Bone ShibaSwap were a weather forecast, it‚Äôd be calling for a blizzard of utility. As part of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, Bone plays a pivotal role in ShibaSwap, the ecosystem‚Äôs decentralised exchange (DEX). This isn‚Äôt just another meme coin‚Äîit‚Äôs the backbone of a project that already commands a cult-like following. Bone isn‚Äôt just about trading on ShibaSwap; it‚Äôs also a governance token, giving holders voting power on ecosystem proposals. Talk about putting your money where your mouth is. And with the upcoming launch of Shibarium, a Layer 2 blockchain solution, Bone‚Äôs role is set to expand even further. The presale might be over, but the buzz around Bone hasn‚Äôt cooled off. Its steady climb in utility and demand makes it a standout in a market full of flash-in-the-pan meme coins. For those who believe in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, Bone is the kind of token that feels more like an investment than a gamble. What‚Äôs the Best Move This Month? When it comes to the best new meme coin presales to invest in this month, each of these contenders brings its own flavour to the table. Dogs offers charm and philanthropy, while Bone ShibaSwap is all about utility and governance. But if we‚Äôre talking about all-around potential‚Äîcommunity, momentum, and unique features‚ÄîBTFD Coin takes the crown. This is a presale that‚Äôs already proving its worth, with strong tokenomics, a thriving community, and features that promise long-term engagement. Whether it‚Äôs staking, gaming, or just vibing with the Bulls Squad, BTFD Coin has positioned itself as the meme coin to beat. The clock‚Äôs ticking, and the BTFD Coin presale won‚Äôt last forever. So, grab your chance to ride the wave while the price is still low‚Äîbecause when it takes off, you‚Äôll want to be on board. Don‚Äôt miss the boat, eh?

The complaint names Pinillo and his associated businesses, Solanofi, Solano Partners Ltd., and Solano Capital Investments, collectively known as the Solanofi entities, as the defendants. Details of The Lawsuit According to a December 10 release from the CFTC, Pinillo targeted at least 1,515 individuals in the United States, including members of his Spanish-speaking congregation. The complaint alleges that he misused his position as a trusted church pastor to promote his deceptive scheme. He claimed to be the CEO of Solanofi, an automated trading platform that offered risk-free profits through high-performance trading of crypto assets. Pinillo falsely advertised guaranteed monthly returns of up to 34.9% and assured participants that the platform was secure and reliable. The pastor gave participants access to an online dashboard showing fake account balances and profits to make the scheme appear legitimate. He also encouraged customers to involve friends and family by offering a 15% referral fee for recruiting new people. However, the document states that there was no trading platform, no trades occurred, and no profits were generated. Instead, Pinillo allegedly misappropriated all funds provided by customers. The lawsuit further claims that the accused failed to disclose critical information when seeking clients. Among the omissions, he did not inform customers that the Solanofi entities were shams, the trading platform was non-existent, and the online account statements were falsified. Additionally, he used the funds from new participants to pay earlier ones in what the CFTC described as a classic Ponzi scheme. Restitution and Similar Cases Following the enforcement action, the regulator is seeking restitution for defrauded participants, the return of misappropriated funds, civil monetary penalties, trading bans, and a permanent injunction to prevent further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and related rules. The case against Pinillo is the latest in a growing number of such schemes in the crypto industry. In March, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged that 17 individuals were responsible for a $300 million Ponzi scheme that targeted more than 40,000 Latino investors through a program called CryptoFX. In August, the financial watchdog also brought complaints against two Georgia brothers accused of defrauding over 80 investors in a $60 million bogus multilevel plan. The same month, NovaTech Ltd. was charged with operating a fake operation that raised over $650 million from more than 200,000 investors, including many in the Haitian-American community.

This follows similar efforts by legislators in the United States, Russia, Argentina, and other jurisdictions. As a finite asset, a strategic Bitcoin reserve is key for consumers‚Äô economic benefits and utility in cross-border payments. According to the House of Councilors document, Satoshi Hamada moved towards a Bitcoin Reserve for the government. He described the importance of the country having the top crypto as its national asset. Hamada proposed converting foreign reserves to crypto assets like Bitcoin, pointing to global jurisdictions. The lawmaker cited neutrality and its decentralized nature to prevent any form of control within a particular country. Global trade with Bitcoin is possible without the influence of specific countries. Crypto enthusiasts argue that it creates a fair financial environment for participants. The initial reaction from the crypto community was positive, as holders lauded the recent push by governments toward digital asset adoption. This could spur institutional investment, raising asset prices and driving market innovation. Although Hamada‚Äôs party holds only two seats in parliament, there is growing optimism of other lawmakers supporting his views. Japan has taken a mixed approach toward digital asset regulation. Last month, the country proposed a lightweight regulation for crypto intermediaries. As global regulations ramp up, crypto enthusiasts believe the country will be more positive to virtual assets. The United States Effect Recent moves by US lawmakers inspired Hamada to pitch a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Ahead of the US elections, Donald Trump backed the crypto industry, pledging positive regulations and ending the present administration‚Äôs ‚Äú war‚Äù on the market. Amongst others, Trump noted that his administration would stop the sale of the nation‚Äôs Bitcoin, creating a reserve. US Senator Cynthia Lummis rolled out a bill for a strategic Bitcoin reserve in a related effort. The bill seeks to make the country a Bitcoin power nation as it will acquire 1 million BTC for five years and hold for 20 years. This will offset the growing national debt, which continues to hinder macro conditions in the market. Sen Lummis proposed selling gold reserves to acquire more Bitcoin, sparking an upward trend among bulls. This has led to several jurisdictions setting sights on a strategic BTC reserve to boost fair competition.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Japan,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-14 21:57:49

Peter Schiff doubts,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-pay-off-u-s-debt-peter-schiff/,"Peter Schiff doubts that 1 million Bitcoins could ever pay off the U.S. national debt, as Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap would need to increase by over 20,000%, which is unrealistic. He also questions Bitcoin‚Äôs global adoption and sees its value increased more by speculation than real demand. Some Bitcoin fans believe that if the U.S. government buys 1 million Bitcoins, it could eventually pay off the massive $36 trillion national debt. However, Peter Schiff doubts this idea, in a recent X post he questioned whether Bitcoin could eventually pay off the $36.25 trillion national debt. For this to happen, Bitcoin‚Äôs total value would have to increase significantly. Currently, Bitcoin is priced at around $100,000. So, 1 million Bitcoin at $100,000 per Bitcoin would be worth $100 billion in total, not enough to pay off the U.S. national debt, which is around $36.25 trillion. Peter Schiff doubts Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to pay off U.S. National debt Schiff says this isn‚Äôt possible, as Bitcoin would have to increase in value by over 20,000%, which is unrealistic. Even if Bitcoin‚Äôs value increases, the U.S. debt keeps growing. The U.S. government borrows money yearly, so the debt is expected to continue rising. This makes the idea of Bitcoin paying off the debt even harder to believe. Plus, by then the National Debt will be much more than $36.25 trillion, requiring a much higher Bitcoin price to pay it off. ‚Äî Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 13, 2024 Peter Schiff has long criticized Bitcoin, saying it lacks value and won‚Äôt replace traditional money or assets like gold. He points out Bitcoin‚Äôs extreme price swings, making it unreliable for saving or buying everyday things. He believes most Bitcoin buyers are speculating, not using it as money. Schiff also doubts Bitcoin will ever be widely adopted. While its price has grown, Bitcoin still needs to be used as a global currency. Only some countries have accepted it as official money, and most governments resist replacing their currencies with Bitcoin. Schiff believes Bitcoin will always remain the world‚Äôs main currency. Some Bitcoin supporters think the cryptocurrency will keep increasing in value as more people adopt it. They believe it could even reach $1 million per coin, making it an alternative to traditional money. However, Schiff sees the idea of Bitcoin paying off the U.S. national debt as highly unlikely. The market cap required for such a scenario is too large, and the growing national debt makes it even less possible. As Peter Schiff says, ‚Äú Bitcoin is a speculative asset, and its value is driven by hope, not real demand.‚Äù While Bitcoin might continue to grow for some, Schiff believes that paying off the U.S. national debt is just an unrealistic dream.

The company‚Äôs inclusion follows an eventful year that saw its stock value increase more than sixfold. The Nasdaq-100 index is up 29.4% in 2024. You might also like: Saylor‚Äôs MicroStrategy added $2.1b in Bitcoin What does it mean? Joining the Nasdaq-100 index ranks MicroStrategy, the software company turned Bitcoin ( BTC ) treasury, among some of the biggest corporations, including Apple Inc., with a market cap exceeding $3 trillion; Microsoft Corporation, valued at over $2 trillion; NVIDIA Corporation, boasting a market cap surpassing $1 trillion; Amazon.com Inc., with its market cap of around $1.5 trillion; and Alphabet Inc., which has a market cap nearing $1.8 trillion. Other newcomers to the index this year include Palantir Technologies and Axon Enterprise. This inclusion typically leads to increased stock purchases as exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, tracking the index adjust their holdings to reflect the changes. To be included in the Nasdaq-100, a company must meet specific criteria and maintain a position of prominence in the stock market. For MicroStrategy, it‚Äôs among the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange based on market capitalization. Inclusion also signifies that the company is among the most valuable and must maintain its stock performance to stay included. Poor performance or a drop in market cap can lead to exclusion, as was the case this year with Illumina, Super Micro Computer, and Moderna. MicroStrategy‚Äôs transformation The firm began acquiring Bitcoin in 2020 as a treasury reserve asset amid declining software business revenue. The strategy has proven remarkably successful, with the company‚Äôs market capitalization now approaching $97.94 billion. The firm recently expanded its Bitcoin holdings further, with Executive Chairman Michael Saylor announcing the acquisition of 21,550 Bitcoin for approximately $2.1 billion between December 2 and December 8, bringing their total holdings to 423,650 BTC. Bernstein analysts view the Nasdaq-100 inclusion as a stepping stone toward potential S&P 500 inclusion in 2025, suggesting further upside for the company‚Äôs stock. The analysts anticipate improved visibility and recognition beyond fresh ETF inflows as a result of the index inclusion.MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock performance has closely tracked Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements, benefiting from the cryptocurrency‚Äôs recent surge past $100,000. This rally has been partially attributed to optimism surrounding President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs victory and expectations of more favorable regulatory conditions for the crypto sector. The company‚Äôs success has redefined corporate treasury management strategies, showcasing the potential benefits of Bitcoin as a reserve asset.

In a tweet accompanied by a detailed technical chart, XRP Captain stated, ‚Äú#XRPHolders It‚Äôs Not Me But The Chart Is Telling Us That #XRP Is Ready To Explode Once Again.‚Äù The chart depicts a series of corrective price movements that culminate in a symmetrical triangle formation, a technical indicator often associated with impending volatility. XRP Captain highlights the completion of Wave E within the triangle, suggesting a bullish move may be imminent. The key resistance level at $2.60 is critical for confirming an upward breakout, while $1.70 is a solid support level to watch in case of a downward move. #XRPHolders It's Not Me But The Chart Is Telling Us That #XRP Is Ready To Explode Once Again pic.twitter.com/GQowgoRyi0 ‚Äî XRP CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) December 13, 2024 Elliott Wave Patterns Signal Potential Breakout The 4-hour chart shared by XRP Captain employs Elliott Wave theory to analyze XRP‚Äôs recent price action. This approach categorizes market movements into repetitive wave cycles, providing insight into investor sentiment and potential future trends. The chart indicates two descending structures preceding a symmetrical triangle, a consolidation pattern that precedes a breakout. With Wave E nearing completion, the formation suggests a high likelihood of price expansion. If XRP can surpass the resistance level at $2.60, it could signal a significant rally, while a fall below $1.70 would invalidate this bullish thesis. This technical setup has drawn considerable attention from the XRP community, many of whom view the chart as confirmation of long-term bullish potential. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Debate Over XRP‚Äôs Market Dynamics XRP Captain‚Äôs analysis has sparked conversations within the cryptocurrency community about whether XRP will adhere to standard market patterns or diverge due to unique factors. James Hernandez, a prominent member of the XRP community, commented on the tweet, expressing a different view. He argued, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think standard market trends apply to XRP. I mean they did before, but XRP is about to revolutionize the global financial world. Other factors are going to determine its growth from here.‚Äù James‚Äô perspective reflects a broader belief among XRP supporters that the asset‚Äôs value is increasingly tied to fundamental developments. Ripple‚Äôs progress in securing global financial partnerships and the anticipated conclusion of its legal battle with the SEC are seen as key drivers of XRP‚Äôs price, potentially overriding traditional market indicators. What‚Äôs Next for XRP? With the start of 2024 approaching, XRP enthusiasts anticipate regulatory clarity and increased adoption to play a pivotal role in determining the asset‚Äôs trajectory. XRP Captain‚Äôs technical analysis provides a compelling case for bullish momentum. Time will reveal whether the token will adhere to these patterns or if external factors will shape its future. For now, traders and holders are advised to stay vigilant as XRP nears a decisive moment in its market cycle.

By 2027, NEAR is expected to rise to $16.90, driven by mainstream adoption. Looking ahead to 2030, NEAR Protocol could witness a significant surge, with its price potentially reaching $27 or beyond. Overall, the prevailing sentiment within NEAR Protocol‚Äôs community is one of cautious optimism, with stakeholders closely monitoring its progress and evolution. As NEAR continues to advance its technology and forge strategic partnerships, questions surrounding its price potential persist, inviting further analysis and exploration of its prospects.

NEAR price fell by over 2.5% at the time of writing. NEAR Protocol sought support and resistance at $6.50 and $7.00, respectively. Near Protocol price analysis for today, December 14, shows that the price rose to the $7.50 mark. NEAR Protocol price analysis 1-day chart: NEAR breaks past $7.50 as bulls charge The 1-day NEAR/USD price chart indicated an upward trend in the market as prices moved toward the $6.50 level. The bulls found support at $3.60 and the price rose to the $7.40 mark before falling back to the $6.50 level. NEAR price falls to $6.50 The Indicators reflect the increasing bearish price sentiment as all three major technical indicators signal rising bullish price sentiments. The MACD is bearish at -0.164 units and suggests falling bullish momentum. Moreover, the EMAs are above the mean position, and the indicator shows a steady momentum turn from bullish to bearish. The RSI also shares this sentiment as the indicator fell to 48.43 from above the 70.00 index level. The converging Bollinger Bands suggest decreasing volatility, indicating that the $7.00 resistance may hold for the week. NEAR price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour price chart of NEAR shows a sudden spike in NEAR price as the asset broke past $6.0. The price movement was followed by a short return to $5.70 before crossing back above the $6.00 mark as the bulls sought to go past the $7.50 resistance. NEAR price breaks down below the $7.00 resistance The RSI is at 37.92, suggesting that the asset is at the bottom of the neutral zone, which indicates that the bears have room for more upward movement in the short term. However, the downward slope suggests increasing selling pressure on the asset, suggesting further gains. The MACD is bearish, with the MACD line at -0.016 showing slight bearish dominance across the 4-hour charts, which has been increasing in recent candles. These indicators collectively issue a steady bullish trend that suggests a consolidation below $7.00.

The strong trade volume suggests increasing activity, indicating a robust force behind the recent fall. As such, the price rose rapidly to the $7.600 mark before stumbling below the $7.50 mark again. Traders should expect NEAR to continue its bullish rally as the bulls chase the $8.00 mark. Currently, the closest support level is $6.50 and below at $6.00, while NEAR Protocol faces difficulty establishing a foothold above the $7.00 level. Is Near Protocol a good investment? NEAR Protocol distinguishes itself in the cryptocurrency market, emphasizing scalability, usability, and developer-friendliness. It aims to facilitate the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, catering to developers and end-users. NEAR‚Äôs innovative technology and user-centric approach make it attractive for mainstream adoption of blockchain applications. With a focus on user experience and developer tools, NEAR Protocol is positioned to drive significant growth in the decentralized application ecosystem. Its potential to disrupt traditional industries and capture market share in the blockchain space makes it an intriguing investment opportunity for those interested in innovative technology solutions. Why is NEAR up? NEAR price rose rapidly after falling to the $4.50 support as the bulls crushed bearish resistances till $6.00 mark. Despite finding short-term resistance at the level, the bulls managed to rise to the $6.50 mark where they hover currently. Will NEAR reach $10? NEAR is experiencing a volatile market movement that may see it reach the $10 mark before the year closes. Will NEAR reach $20? NEAR is expected to cross the $20 threshold by 2027 as the industry continues to see increasing adoption across the mainstream. The bullish rally will be supported by NEAR‚Äôs vision of a scalable future and user and developer-friendly architecture that sets it apart from other blockchains. Will NEAR reach $50? The chance of NEAR reaching the $50 mark depends on various circumstances, such as future network development, market regulations, and the broader cryptocurrency market growth. If NEAR continues its current trajectory, it can reach $50 in the next decade. Does NEAR have a good long term future? Yes, NEAR has a good long-term future due to its innovative technology, focus on scalability, and strong ecosystem development. However, the project needs to keep up with sector developments to maintain its edge in the digital ecosystem. Recent news/opinions on Near Protocol NEAR recently conducted an AMA with fraxfinance founder Sam Kazemian sitting down with NEAR Co-Founder to discuss AI, PMF, DeFi, cross-chain interoperability, and more.

NEAR Protocol historic price sentiment NEAR price history The Near Protocol (NEAR) began its journey in August 2020, aiming to create a scalable and permissionless blockchain. The first recorded trade value in October 2020 was $1.072, closing the year at $1.459 after a recovery. In 2021, NEAR showed an uptrend, starting at $1.305 and reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $7.572 by March 13. A market downturn pushed the price down to $1.537 by July 19, but it rebounded to $11.776 on September 9 and further to $13.168 on October 26. By 2022, NEAR‚Äôs price crashed to below $2.00, losing over 90% of its peak value. Throughout 2023, NEAR saw low volatility, with prices remaining below $2.50 for most of the year. Since the start of 2024, NEAR experienced a strong recovery, climbing to $7.80. However, after reaching the $8.00 mark in mid-May, it fell back to $5.60. In June, NEAR traded between $4.48 and $7.66. It rose from $5.20 to $6.04 in July but closed the month below $5.00. NEAR started August at $5.00, declining to $3.89 by the end of the month. In September 2024, the asset bounced back and closed the month above the $5.20 mark. In October, the price stumbled and fell to $4.850 in the first few days before closing the month below the $4.00 mark leaving a negative outlook at the start of November. November saw NEAR making remarkable strides as the bulls held strong control of markets during the month, a trend that is likely to continue into December.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|NEAR,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-14 22:20:00

Trump‚Äôs Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump‚Äôs Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump‚Äôs Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump‚Äôs Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump‚Äôs Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump‚Äôs Tariffs by entering its contract address ‚Äì 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-14 22:23:00

As the cryptocurrency stabilizes, will Toncoin break to the upside, setting the stage for a fresh rally, or will it falter and dip lower, testing crucial support levels? This consolidation phase is more than just a pause in price action; it represents a pivotal moment that could determine TON‚Äôs next major move. A breakout to the upside could signal renewed positive sentiment, attracting more buyers and fueling a strong upward trend. On the other hand, a breakdown could shift the market sentiment to bearish, with the price heading lower to retest key support zones. In this article, we will explore both scenarios in detail, analyzing the key levels to watch and what a breakout in either direction could mean for Toncoin‚Äôs future trajectory. Toncoin Current Range: Understanding The Consolidation Phase As Toncoin consolidates, current price action suggests the potential for a breakout to the upside. The price has shown signs of bullish momentum within the consolidation range, with gradual upward movements indicating increasing buying interest. Related Reading: Toncoin‚Äôs 90-Day Returns Turn Positive: Is A Massive Rally On The Horizon? Furthermore, this upward pressure within the range is often a precursor to a breakout, as market participants accumulate positions, anticipating a rise above resistance levels. If this momentum continues to build, it could signal that Toncoin is preparing for a strong move on the upside once the price breaks free from its current consolidation zone. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently trending above the 50% threshold, indicating that Toncoin is in positive territory and buying pressure is starting to outpace selling activity, which is often a sign of bullish momentum. When the RSI remains above the 50% mark, it suggests that the asset is more likely to experience upward movement as it reflects an increasing number of buyers compared to sellers. Typically, this level is often seen as a key indicator for possible future gains, showing that market sentiment is leaning toward optimism. As the RSI trends higher, the likelihood of a breakout to the upside increases, reinforcing the optimistic outlook for Toncoin. What Happens After A Breakout? Possible Price Targets And Next Steps After a breakout, TON‚Äôs direction will hinge on whether the move is upward or downward. If the price breaks higher, it could target the $7.2 resistance level, which could act as an initial hurdle. Breaking above this level successfully would indicate strong bullish momentum, potentially triggering upward movement. In this scenario, the next key resistance level to watch would be $8.3. A move past this point could set Toncoin on a path for additional gains, as it would signal that the bulls are in control and the price may continue to climb toward new highs. Related Reading: Toncoin Price Explodes With 17% Rally ‚Äî Can TON Sustain The Momentum? On the other hand, if the breakout is to the downside, the price will likely test the $6 support level. A breach of this level could lead to more declines, with subsequent support zones becoming crucial. Conclusively, increased volatility is common, so traders should watch for confirmation signals after a breakout, such as volume and momentum indicators, to gauge the sustainability of the move. The broader market sentiment also plays a significant role in determining the direction and strength of the breakout.

This partnership aims to use blockchain technology to turn real-world assets (RWAs) into digital forms, focusing mainly on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) assets. A Strategic Partnership to Provide Secured Tokenized Assets According to a release , the partnership‚Äôs first project involves creating tokenized assets called ‚Äúnotes‚Äù linked to a Chinese solar material manufacturer. These notes aim to show the value and sustainability of the company‚Äôs operations. This project offers investors a clear and efficient way to support ESG-focused initiatives. Additionally, this initiative responds to the growing demand for sustainable investments, which require transparency and accountability. Meanwhile, Ant Digital, through its blockchain brand ZAN, will play an important role in this effort. ZAN offers advanced blockchain infrastructure and tools that make tokenizing assets in many industries easy. Likewise, the partnership shows how blockchain is changing traditional asset management. By turning real-world ESG assets into digital tokens, Sui Blockchain and Ant Digital use advanced technology to promote sustainability and build trust with investors. Zodia Custody and Securitize to Boost Tokenized Asset Custody Similarly, Zodia Custody formed a strategic partnership with Securitize , a renowned tokenization platform. This partnership is a step towards providing institutional investors with secure, compliant, innovative solutions for managing tokenized assets. Zodia Custody‚Äôs CEO, Julian Sawyer, expressed his enthusiasm for the possibilities that tokenization brings to the table. He highlighted that tokenization has the potential to redefine how institutions approach investments. Securitization will play a pivotal role in the partnership, allowing institutional investors to access and trade tokenized assets. Notably, the platform is familiar with facilitating the digital transformation of traditional financial markets. In an interview, Carlos Domingo, the CEO of Securitize, emphasized the importance of bridging the gap between blockchain technology and established financial practices. Tokenized Finance: The Future of Asset Management Tokenization transforms financial markets by converting assets into digital tokens on a blockchain. This innovative process introduces higher transparency, faster transactions, and lower costs, appealing to traditional and new-age investors. The tokenized money fund is accessible on a distributed ledger, enabling institutions to conduct real-time transactions and lower settlement risks.

37651618,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52174,1734217208,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"XRP Crash Alert Drives Whales to A Hidden Altcoin With 35,000% Upside Potential",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-crash-alert-drives-whales-to-a-hidden-altcoin-with-35000/,"The recent XRP price turmoil has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, prompting investors to seek refuge in a hidden altcoin that promises extraordinary returns. As XRP struggles to maintain its market position, with its price plummeting to $2.36 after a 3% drop, many are paying attention to RCO Finance (RCOF) , a hidden altcoin in the market. With predictions of a staggering 35,000% upside potential, RCOF has become the focal point for savvy investors looking to capitalize on the market‚Äôs shifting tides. XRP Price Faces Renewed Pressure as Ripple Sells $500 Million The XRP price momentum has taken another hit as Ripple initiated the sale of 200 million XRP from its December reserves, valued at $500 million. This significant sell-off comes at a critical time, with XRP struggling to maintain its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Following a sharp correction from its brief ascent to the third spot, the XRP price now battles to regain ground behind Tether‚Äôs USDT. Ripple‚Äôs substantial selling activity introduces additional downward pressure, potentially dampening the XRP price ability to recover from its recent crash. Despite reaching an all-time high of $2.90 in late November, the token has since slipped to $2.00, driven by dismissed rumors and bearish technical indicators. As Ripple cashes in on its reserves, investors are wary of the token‚Äôs ability to rebound. Meanwhile, whales are increasingly shifting their focus to RCO Finance (RCOF), a hidden altcoin with transformative growth potential. What Makes RCO Finance (RCOF) the New Whale Favorite? RCO Finance (RCOF) is rapidly building attention in decentralized finance (DeFi), capturing investors‚Äô engagement, particularly those looking to pivot from the projected XRP price drop. The platform‚Äôs innovative approach combines cutting-edge technology with user-centric features that cater to traders. The RCOF‚Äôs AI-powered robo-advisor is arguably the crown jewel of RCO Finance. This sophisticated tool leverages historical data, live market trends, and news events to craft personalized investment strategies tailored to individual users‚Äô financial goals and risk appetites. Unlike traditional advisors, which often require significant fees and human oversight, RCOF‚Äôs robo-advisor operates autonomously. It monitors market conditions, adjusting portfolios in real time to mitigate risks. This feature democratizes access to advanced trading strategies, allowing even novice investors to make profits. RCO Finance‚Äôs automated market-making (AMM) system complements the robo-advisor. This fully decentralized trading platform utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning to execute trades without manual intervention. RCO Finance also addresses a significant gap in the crypto market through its real-world asset integration feature. This functionality allows users to invest directly in stocks, bonds, and real estate using their cryptos, bypassing fiat conversion. Through RCOF bridging the divide between digital currencies and tangible assets, the platform opens up new avenues for portfolio diversification and investment opportunities previously inaccessible to crypto holders. In addition to these standout features, RCO Finance prioritizes security and privacy. The hidden altcoin has undergone rigorous audits by SolidProof , ensuring its smart contracts adhere to industry standards. Furthermore, RCOF does not require KYC procedures, allowing investors to maintain anonymity while trading. RCO FInance (RCOF) Presale Opportunities While the future of the XRP price is currently unknown, savvy investors are excited about the possibilities of the RCOF hidden altcoin presale, which is currently underway. Currently priced at $0.077 per token during Stage 4 of the presale, RCOF offers the substantial potential of up to 700% when the token hits the anticipated $0.6 on the exchanges. Participating in this presale grants access to RCO Finance‚Äôs innovative features and positions investors favorably within a rapidly evolving market. Token holders will enjoy various benefits, such as reduced transaction fees, quarterly dividends ranging from 1% to 6%, and exclusive access to AI features. Moreover, early investors can take advantage of promotional bonuses by using codes during their purchase, an initiative to incentivize participation in this promising project. With over $9 million already raised in its presale phase and a growing community of supporters, RCO Finance is poised for explosive growth. For those seeking an opportunity that combines cutting-edge technology with significant upside potential, now is the time to consider investing in RCO Finance (RCOF). As the XRP price faces challenges, RCOF stands ready to deliver unmatched ROI for every investor in the market.

Elon‚Äôs Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon‚Äôs Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon‚Äôs Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon‚Äôs Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon‚Äôs Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon‚Äôs Gold by entering its contract address ‚Äì 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|FIAT|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-14 23:47:00

With over 60% month-long profit, the Dogecoin price is also showing bullish strength as many expect the token to meet higher price targets this year. On the other hand, ETFSwap (ETFS) is taking full advantage of its fresh Uniswap listing to rival Dogecoin and deliver 12,000% more profits to its investors, taking its value to $4. Dogecoin Price Prepares For Further Upsurge As Its Price Consolidates The Dogecoin price impressed meme coin enthusiasts and investors by rallying over 100% in the past few weeks. However, the Dogecoin price is starting to consolidate, forming a bullish flag and settling around a weekly price range of $0.3947 ‚Äì $0.4758. Although the monthly gains the Dogecoin price accumulated have dropped from over 150% to a current 60%, analysts like Ali Martinez have hinted that the Dogecoin price could hit a target of $18 if the bull cycle gets wild in 2025. As this prediction adds to the optimism around Dogecoin, confidence is starting to brew for the Dogecoin price. Although, technical analysis for Dogecoin on TradingView hints at a neutral signal. This means that Dogecoin price could either surge further or drip from here. However, the Dogecoin community remains positive as CoinMarketCap reflects an 87% bullish sentiment for the token. ETFSwap (ETFS) Readies Itself For A Further 12,000% Pump As It Gains Uniswap Listing After already securing a listing on CoinMarketCap, ETFSwap (ETFS) has now made a notable debut on Uniswap , where investors are quickly moving to seize its new opportunities. After completing over 575% pump in its presale, where it sold over 900 million of its tokens and accumulated nearly $10 million in revenue, ETFSwap (ETFS) is presenting a fresh new chance for both old and new investors to reap higher ROI. Considering its wider audience on a prominent exchange platform like Uniswap, ETFSwap (ETFS) is set to utilize this opportunity to deliver 12,000% more returns to its investors. This surge is slated to raise the value of the ETFS token to $4, potentially giving early investors ROIs in multiple folds. Beyond ETFSwap‚Äôs potential for a massive price surge now that it has listed on Uniswap, the platform offers even more lucrative opportunities, as well as unique features that could spark an unprecedented upsurge for the token. For starters, this newly listed altcoin project functions as a fully decentralized platform that allows investors to trade tokenized ETF assets from several financial markets. These include cryptocurrency, commodities, bonds and amplified-based ETFs. Aside from this, all of its ETF products have been backed by Real World Assets, with its smart contract already audited by CyberScope. With an additional KYC verification by SolidProof, ETFSwap (ETFS) not only captures investors‚Äô trust but also shows its potential for a large adoption rate due to its diverse investment options. To top it off, ETFSwap‚Äôs native token, ETFS, offers even more benefits and lucrative opportunities that investors can take advantage of. In addition to being able to buy, own and swap ETFs with cryptocurrencies, users can earn rewards up to 87% APR yield through its staking opportunities. Additionally, there‚Äôs a 36% passive income set aside for those who stake their tokens. ETFSwap (ETFS) also offers distinct AI-powered tools that help investors filter, track, and screen ETF assets so they can make smart ETF investment decisions. Conclusion Although the Dogecoin price is set to reach new price targets in this bull cycle, ETFSwap (ETFS) stands as a better investment option. The platform offers some of the best features for an ETF and crypto trading platform, including 24/7 ETF trading access and live price tracking. These capabilities enable users to make significant profits. With its recent Uniswap listing , massive adoption for the token is expected, making now the perfect time to invest in the ETFS token. According to market experts, investors stand a huge chance to earn big when the token rallies by 12,000% to $4. So, savvy investors should do well to buy now when the price is still affordable and position for ROIs up to 12,000%.

The popular index lists the top 100 largest non-financial companies, including global giants like Amazon, Apple, Nvidia, Meta, and more. This happened after the November 29, 2024, market snapshot found Michael Saylor‚Äôs company with a market cap of around $92B, making it the 40th biggest company on the Nasdaq 100. Can Bitcoin Hit a New ATH with Microstrategy‚Äôs Achievement? Michael Saylor is an active Bitcoin supporter and has sworn to buy Bitcoin despite the price. More importantly, he believes in this token‚Äôs potential, firstly about hitting the $100k mark and later reaching millions over the next few years. With such belief, Microstrategy has 234,650 BTC , worth $43 billion. With that, they have built their strong portfolio but are also building investor confidence, eventually favoring the token‚Äôs price growth. At the time of reporting, Bitcoin is at $101.5k after moving 2% from the ATH of $103.9k. Although the difference is minor, the token is struggling to accomplish the same target again for days. However, the eyes are now on Michael Saylor‚Äôs inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 to affect the Bitcoin price positively. Interestingly, the BTC price has had a minor recovery on the charts past this news, reaching $102.5k earlier in the day. Interestingly, this was the biggest recovery since earlier ATH. Additionally, the buying pressure is strongly persistent on the token. With this buying pressure, high adoption, talks of Bitcoin reserve in multiple parts of the world, Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration, and many other factors, including this firm‚Äôs new achievement, the Bitcoin is to end the year on a positive note. More importantly, the Bitcoin price might hit $108.9K , before the year ends and higher in 2025. CZ Summarised Michael Saylor Firm‚Äôs Strategy in Four Words While sharing the news of the Nasdaq 100, including the business intelligence company, a popular strategist, Jeff Park, shared a one-page executive summary of the firm. The X post conveyed a summary titled ‚ÄúTheory of MicroStrategy,‚Äù but CZ summarised it into just words, joking about the Bitcoin-obsessed company. CZ commented, ‚ÄòBuy bitcoins and hold‚Äô referencing Microstrategy‚Äôs strategies and kidding that they are all about buying this token. More importantly, he said his summary is shorter than the intro line.

Bottom Line Michael Saylor‚Äôs company began buying Bitcoin around four years ago, and in this time, it has built a wealth of $43.18 billion with one of the most promising crypto to buy . Its exponential growth has helped the demand growth persistently, leading to worldwide adoptions. With that, the Bitcoin price recently hit an ATH at $103.9k, and analysts believe the price to hit even $150k by 2025 end, in which Microstrategy might play a bigger role, especially with its inclusion in the Nasdaq 100. This milestone is likely to bring positive sentiments to the industry and the token. Additionally, there are many other factors which would contribute to this journey.

The analyst suggests that if XRP‚Äôs price movement continues to mirror its 2017 trajectory, the cryptocurrency might be on the cusp of a significant breakout. However, it may follow a brief period of consolidation. fyi, if $XRP does still continue to follow 2017, we likely continue to consolidate for another 2 weeks until Christmas time then, we make our face melting move up for about a month until late January pic.twitter.com/E9MH8ljNXG ‚Äî Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy) December 13, 2024 Analysis Overview Charting Guy highlighted that XRP might consolidate until Christmas. Following this, a dramatic upward movement, similar to the one observed in late 2017, could occur, lasting about a month until late January. This projection aligns with historical trends where XRP experienced sharp rallies after periods of accumulation and low volatility. This perspective is supported by the historical price chart included in the discussion. The chart showcases key moments in XRP‚Äôs price history, including its massive rally in late 2017 and its similar, although shorter-lived, rally in early 2021. The ongoing consolidation period in late 2024 and early 2025 appears to fit the cyclical behavior seen in previous market cycles. Community Commentary Adding to the analysis, an X user, Bassi, provided further insight into how the timing of these potential movements could align with broader narratives. Bassi speculated that a rally around December 30 could be attributed to Christmas hype or Ripple‚Äôs stable coin (RLUSD) related developments. Furthermore, they projected January 20 as a potential peak, coinciding with the U.S. Presidential Inauguration Day. This date could mark a turning point for XRP, with the community likely labeling any subsequent downturn as a ‚Äúsell the news‚Äù event. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Factors Influencing the Outlook The discussion underscores several factors that could influence XRP‚Äôs price trajectory: Historical Patterns: XRP‚Äôs past rallies have often followed long periods of consolidation, suggesting that the current phase might precede significant price action. Market Sentiment: Speculative narratives, such as the holiday season or major institutional developments, often play a role in driving short-term price movements in the cryptocurrency market. Macro Events: Broader market conditions, including regulatory developments, macroeconomic trends, and Bitcoin‚Äôs price performance, are likely to have an indirect impact on XRP‚Äôs trajectory. Ripple Developments: Any updates from Ripple, such as progress in adoption or partnerships , could also act as catalysts for price movements.

The trader Ali Martinez tells his 98,500 followers on the social media platform X that social volume and positive sentiment around Aave‚Äôs native token are skyrocketing. ‚ÄúWith the crowd‚Äôs growing focus on AAVE, a brief pullback might be on the horizon, as markets often move against popular sentiment.‚Äù Source: Ali Martinez/X AAVE, the 34th-ranked crypto asset by market cap, is trading at $384.85 at time of writing. Turning to Litecoin, Martinez says that LTC is ‚Äúirrelevant, both fundamentally and technically.‚Äù The analyst argues that Litecoin hasn‚Äôt added anything significant to the crypto industry in terms of innovation. ‚ÄúAnd let‚Äôs not forget: [Litecoin creator] Charlie Lee famously sold all his Litecoin at the top in 2017. If the creator doesn‚Äôt believe in his project enough to hold it, why should I? If the fundamentals don‚Äôt convince you, the technicals should. Litecoin is trading at the same price today as it was in 2017. That‚Äôs seven years of going nowhere. In an industry defined by innovation and growth, LTC stands out as a project stuck in time. It hasn‚Äôt made a new all-time high since its peak in 2017 and has been consolidating in the same range ever since.

Homo Shiba Inu (HOMOSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address ‚Äì 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOSHIB.

The highly anticipated ""Santa rally"" seems increasingly out of reach as macroeconomic uncertainty weighs heavily on the market. Several major cryptocurrencies are underperforming today, with notable losers including SUI ( $SUI ), down 6.5% after peaking at its all-time high of $4.89 last Friday, along with PEPE ($PEPE ), BONK ($BONK ), and Polkadot ($DOT ), all dropping roughly 6%. Adding to the downturn, Cardano ($ADA ), Fantom ($FTM ), and Hedera ($HBAR ‚Äì click for full insight) have each fallen by over 5%, reflecting a broad retreat across the altcoin market. The global crypto market cap currently sits at $3.6 trillion, marking a 1.2% decline in the past 24 hours, while trading volume has dropped sharply by 23.93% (typical for Saturday). Bitcoin 's dominance has increased slightly to 55.74%, as investors shift toward safer bets amid the growing uncertainty. Meanwhile, the Altcoin Season Index on CoinMarketCapsuggests Bitcoin remains firmly in control of the market, leaving altcoins struggling to gain traction. It‚Äôs easy to feel pessimistic in moments like these, but seasoned investors know the drill. After all, if you‚Äôve been through a few of these wild four-year cycles, the strategy remains the same: zoom out, ignore the noise, and prepare for strategic buying opportunities. Let‚Äôs break down the market leader, the king of cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin ($BTC): The Rectangle Pattern and $74K Support Let‚Äôs first address the elephant in the room: the rectangle pattern that formed back in February this year, shortly after the spot ETF approval in January 2024. This pattern broke to the upside on the election results, hitting its full target of $99,000 perfectly before becoming a strong resistance level (now flipped into main short-term support). Now, the rectangle‚Äôs upper edge at $74,000 is playing a critical support role, often considered the ‚Äúline in the sand‚Äù for many BTC investors. Adding further support to this rectangle is the 200-day moving average (green line), which currently sits at $69,000 and is gaining upside momentum. Historically, the 200-day MA serves as a strong dynamic support in bull markets. However, Bitcoin‚Äôs significant decoupling above this level also raises concerns of a potential return-to-mean scenario, which could see the price retrace to align with this long-term trend. Have a good look at 1d: If $74,000 were to break with confirmation, it could trigger a wave of exits, with the next logical stop being a test of the rectangle‚Äôs bottom around $49,000‚Äì$50,000. While such a correction doesn‚Äôt have to happen (or at least not until the next bear market), it‚Äôs worth noting that a breakdown to $74K would represent a 27-28% retracement from the ATH. Brutal as it sounds, this would be a relatively normal correction within a BTC bull market. The $107K Bull Flag: Still in Play? One of the most significant bullish macro formations for Bitcoin this year began with the SEC‚Äôs groundbreaking ETF approval. The January‚ÄìMay 2024 bull flag (green on the 1D chart) remains active, with a clear target at $107,000. This target is no joke, especially since the flag‚Äôs lower trendline extension has acted as a reversal point three times, reinforcing its significance. Interestingly, on the 4-hour chart, another bullish pennant pattern (purple) mirrors this flag‚Äôs target at $107,500. Two independent patterns aligning at the same price level give further weight to this target, making it a key projected take-profit zone. This alignment of patterns illustrates Bitcoin‚Äôs broader bullish potential, provided short-term challenges don‚Äôt derail momentum. The Rising Wedge and Current Challenges While the long-term outlook points higher, BTC is currently trapped in a rising wedge on the 4-hour chart, a bearish pattern by classical charting standards. Notably, the wedge‚Äôs bottom was formed by two significant December flash crashes, which now act as critical levels to watch. $101,000 is holding‚Äîfor now. While Bitcoin briefly broke above six figures, the breakout lacked volume confirmation and momentum, leaving the price vulnerable to a pullback. By the time you read this, the $100K+ price might already be history. If the rising wedge breaks down, the target aligns almost perfectly with the 0.382 Fibonacci level just below $87,000. A close below $90,000 would also invalidate the bullish pennant pattern, significantly weakening the bullish case. Momentum Check: RSI Signals Mixed but Worrisome The daily RSI remains relatively ‚Äòbullish‚Äô, currently holding just above 64 after cooling down from an overbought period in November. This steady position is supported by a strong RSI trendline that has been rising since August 2024 (visible in the chart as the red trendline). As long as RSI respects this trendline and continues its gradual upward movement, Bitcoin retains the momentum for further gains. However, concerns arise when we analyze the 4-hour RSI, which reveals signs of exhaustion. The RSI only reached 76 during BTC‚Äôs December 5 ATH of $103,700, forming a lower high compared to earlier overbought readings. This is an example of bearish divergence, where price makes a higher high while RSI makes a lower high. In simpler terms, this means that while the price climbed, the underlying momentum weakened‚Äîa classic red flag that often precedes corrections or consolidations. Adding to the mixed sentiment, volume during BTC‚Äôs breakout above $100,000 was lackluster, a classic red flag for sustainability in bullish price action. As of now, Bitcoin remains bullish as long as it holds above the 50-day SMA (yellow line) on the daily chart, currently sitting near $99,000, which also aligns with a key horizontal support level. For bulls to regain full control, the wedge must be invalidated by a strong daily close above $103,000, preferably with a notable volume spike. Key Ideas to Trade This Breakout Above $103K: A strong daily close above $103,000 with a clear volume spike would invalidate the wedge and signal momentum to target $107K. Watch for follow-through on the 4-hour timeframe to confirm the breakout. Trading the Wedge: Use the lower trendline of the wedge for potential long entries on price reversals. Confirmation can come from bullish candle patterns (e.g., hammers) or RSI rebounding from oversold zones. Do Nothing: The safest strategy is most likely to just wait. With the FOMC meeting looming on Wednesday, markets are likely to remain hesitant. Instead, consider scouting for entry points to capitalize on a likely retracement (Sunday to Monday night would be my guess). Summary: A Complicated Saturday Night As of Saturday night, Bitcoin remains in a delicate situation. Trading above the short-term bullish 50 SMA (yellow line) on the daily chart and holding the horizontal support at $99,000 keeps BTC in a bullish posture. However, for the king to truly stay strong on this timeframe, the rising wedge must be invalidated with a strong close above $103,000, preferably backed by a significant volume spike. Adding to the complexity, the Fear & Greed Index has returned to Extreme Greed (80) territory, following a brief dip during recent liquidations. Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/ The problem? Those liquidations failed to reset sentiment properly, leaving the market overly optimistic without clearing enough leverage. This makes the current setup even more perilous, as excessive greed often precedes sharp corrections. Meanwhile, the Altcoin Season Index currently sits at 60, signaling a phase of indecision. While the index remains above neutral territory, the sharp drop from last week's 83 confirms what we‚Äôre seeing across the market: altcoin season is suspended‚Äînot entirely called off, but certainly losing steam. Altcoins will likely continue struggling until Bitcoin (and $ETH ‚Äì link to analysis) either consolidates with strength or resolves its current patterns. Let‚Äôs be real‚Äîthis article could feel outdated by Monday if BTC does print a decisive candle soon to target the bullish patterns described. December, despite Moonvember‚Äôs fantastic run, has been tougher than expected. The crypto market is undoubtedly more complex now than last month‚Äîor even last weekend. The easy part of this bull market is over. Santa or no Santa, things are about to get wild. And when Trump takes office alongside the new, allegedly crypto-friendly leadership, we‚Äôll be in for a market environment no one‚Äôs truly prepared for.Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The analyst also suggested that XRP‚Äôs next move could happen sooner than expected. Next Major Support And Resistance Levels For The XRP Price In an X post, Dark Defender mentioned $2.42, $2.52, $2.71, and $5.85 as the next major support levels for the XRP price. Meanwhile, the crypto analyst highlighted $2.29, $2.24, $2.10, and $2.02 as the next major support levels for XRP. The analyst made these remarks while also alluding to a bull flag structure that had formed on XRP‚Äôs daily chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Dominance And Altcoin Season: What The Sudden Volatility Means For The Market Dark Defender asserted that the XRP price would make its next move by tomorrow, noting that the current bull flag had reached its limit. The crypto analyst had recently highlighted a weekly bull flag on the XRP chart, which showed that the crypto could reach double digits in this market cycle. In his most recent X post, Dark Defender also provided an update on his XRP/BTC pair analysis. He stated that what was expected from the XRP price was coming and suggested that it might have already begun. Before now, the analyst predicted that XRP would record ‚Äútremendous‚Äù gains against its Bitcoin pair. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted a bull flag forming on the XRP price‚Äôs 4-hour chart. Based on this pattern, the analyst stated that XRP could experience a brief correction, then break out above $2.46 and rally to $4, which would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for XRP. Two Possible Scenarios For The Third Wave In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades outlined two possible scenarios for the third wave of the XRP price‚Äôs move to the upside. In the first scenario, XRP could record a typical move, extending to the 2.618 Fibonacci level. This puts the price target at $3.82, the crypto‚Äôs current ATH. Related Reading: Bitcoin Daily Bollinger Bands Expand, Why BTC Price Could Rise To $120,000 As Early As Next Week Meanwhile, for the second scenario, CasiTrades stated that if this third wave doesn‚Äôt extend, the XRP price could record the extension play in the fifth wave. If the third wave doesn‚Äôt extend, the price target will be $3.23 instead of $3.82. She added that this target is near XRP‚Äôs current ATH, so the extension play might not occur. CaiTrades cautioned that these are just projections and that the XRP price could adjust with the actual highs. However, she is confident that a big move is coming, as XRP has consolidated with minimal movement over the last day. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.51, up over 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Over the past few days, while the majority of cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP, appear to be struggling to rally, HNT has gained 30% in value following a recent decline. Helium (HNT) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, HNT‚Äôs recent upside momentum has brought it to a crucial resistance level at $9.5. However, this marks the third time HNT has tested this level, and it appears to be weakening. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if HNT breaches this level and closes a daily candle above $9.85, there is a strong possibility that the asset could soar by 22% to reach the $12 level in the near future. Despite a notable rally, HNT‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 65, which is below the overbought region, suggesting that the asset has enough room to continue its upward movement in the coming days. On the positive side, the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe indicates an uptrend, as it lies below HNT‚Äôs current price. HNT‚Äôs Rising Open Interest HNT‚Äôs technical analysis is further supported by on-chain metrics. According to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass , HNT‚Äôs futures open interest has surged by 24%, reflecting traders‚Äô strong interest and confidence in the token as it approaches a crucial breakout. When combining on-chain metrics with technical analysis, it appears that bulls have entered the market and could support the altcoin in breaching the resistance level this time. Current Price Momentum Currently, HNT is trading near $9.47 and has experienced a price jump of over 13.10% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume skyrocketed by 265%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors driven by HNT‚Äôs bullish outlook.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|HNT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-15 02:14:28

Trump‚Äôs Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump‚Äôs Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump‚Äôs Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump‚Äôs Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump‚Äôs Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump‚Äôs Tariffs by entering its contract address ‚Äì 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR.

VanEck Forecasts Bitcoin Soaring To $180,000 VanEck predicts that the crypto bull market will reach a ‚Äúmedium-term peak‚Äù in the first quarter of 2025, followed by new all-time highs by the year‚Äôs end. The firm estimates Bitcoin could soar to approximately $180,000, while Ethereum (ETH) may exceed $6,000, Solana (SOL) could surpass $500, and Sui (SUI) might reach over $10. The report further suggests that the United States will begin to embrace Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, as President-elect Donald Trump promised, anticipating an increase in overall crypto adoption. Related Reading: Australia‚Äôs Biggest Pension Fund Makes Historic $17M Bitcoin Investment, A National First With anticipated changes in leadership at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), numerous spot crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) are also expected to be approved. This includes Ethereum ETPs featuring staking options, as well as in-kind transaction capabilities for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Per the report, the asset manager forecasts that the value of tokenized securities will exceed $50 billion in the coming months, following a 61% growth to $12 billion throughout this year. Most of this value currently resides on permissioned chains, but 2025 is expected to be a breakthrough year, particularly as organizations like the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) explore bridging public and private blockchains. The firm projects that stablecoins will revolutionize payment systems, with daily settlement volumes potentially tripling to reach $300 billion by the end of 2025. This growth, driven by increased adoption in global commerce, remittances, and integration with major technology and payment networks, would position stablecoins to handle transactions equivalent to 5% of DTCC‚Äôs daily volumes. DeFi To Hit All-Time Highs Another intriguing prediction is the rise of one million new AI agents, which VanEck describes as ‚Äúdigital workers‚Äù that autonomously execute tasks or make decisions. These agents are expected to generate significant on-chain activity as they expand their roles beyond decentralized finance (DeFi) into areas such as social media, gaming, and consumer applications. VanEck anticipates that Bitcoin Layer-2 solutions will accumulate a total value locked (TVL) of 100,000 BTC, building on an impressive 600% growth in 2024 that brought the TVL to 30,000 BTC. The report forecasts that Ethereum‚Äôs blob space will generate $1 billion in fees, spurred by the rapid adoption of Layer-2 solutions, rollup optimizations, and high-fee use cases such as tokenized assets and enterprise applications. VanEck predicts that decentralized finance (DeFi) will hit all-time highs, with decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes reaching $4 trillion and total value locked in DeFi rising to $200 billion. This growth will reportedly be fueled by AI-related tokens, consumer-facing decentralized applications (dApps), and the tokenization of assets that drive liquidity and user adoption. Related Reading: Solana Price On The Rise: Key Resistance At $235 Could Spark Major Breakout The non-fungible token (NFT) market is expected to rebound, with trading volumes projected to reach $30 billion in 2025. Despite recent downturns, standout projects like Pudgy Penguins and Miladys have managed to thrive by leveraging strong community ties and transitioning into consumer brands. Finally, VanEck forecasts that decentralized application (dApp) tokens will narrow the performance gap with Layer-1 tokens. In 2024, Layer-1 blockchain tokens outperformed dApp tokens by a factor of two, but innovative dApps in artificial intelligence and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) are anticipated to drive a shift in performance dynamics. At the time of writing, the market‚Äôs leading crypto has managed to reclaim the $101,820 level, recording a 2% increase in the 24-hour time frame.

Dogwifhat (WIF), a Solana-based token, recently skyrocketed by an incredible 12,000%, grabbing the attention of investors everywhere. While such explosive growth is not uncommon in the crypto space, it raises questions about the sustainability and true value of these tokens. Amidst the hype, the Lightchain AI ($LCAI) Presale stands out as a compelling opportunity, merging artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to deliver a project focused on real utility and long-term growth. This article takes a closer look at Dogwifhat‚Äôs recent success and dives into whether Lightchain AI has the potential to match‚Äîor even outperform‚Äîthis level of remarkable growth. Dogwifhat (WIF): The Rise of a Meme-Inspired Token Dogwifhat is a cryptocurrency operating on the Solana blockchain, celebrated for its meme-driven identity and community-centric growth strategy. Unlike traditional blockchain projects with clear utility or technological innovation, Dogwifhat thrives on the viral nature of its brand, leveraging social media and community engagement. Factors Behind Dogwifhat‚Äôs 12,000% Growth Community Engagement: Dogwifhat‚Äôs growth has been driven largely by its passionate community, which fuels its momentum through viral campaigns and online promotions. Low Entry Barrier: The token‚Äôs affordable price before its surge made it an attractive option for speculative investors. Speculation and Hype: Like many meme coins, Dogwifhat‚Äôs meteoric rise can be attributed to speculative trading, with investors hoping to capitalize on short-term gains. Challenges Ahead for Dogwifhat Sustainability: Meme-driven tokens often struggle to maintain their value over the long term without tangible utility. Volatility: The token‚Äôs reliance on market sentiment makes it prone to sharp declines once the hype subsides. Lightchain AI ($LCAI): Built for Long-Term Growth While Dogwifhat‚Äôs rise is a testament to the power of community-driven tokens, Lightchain AI presents a stark contrast with its focus on utility, innovation, and real-world applications. Lightchain AI integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to address key challenges such as scalability, transparency, and efficiency. Key Features of Lightchain AI Proof of Intelligence (PoI): A groundbreaking consensus mechanism that rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations, combining blockchain security with practical utility. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): A revolutionary environment designed to optimize AI-specific tasks, enabling applications in healthcare, finance, and logistics. Sustainability: By minimizing wasteful computations, Lightchain AI ensures energy efficiency, aligning with global environmental goals. Lightchain AI‚Äôs Real-World Applications Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Enhancing predictive analytics for risk management and investment strategies. Healthcare: Enabling AI-powered diagnostics and personalized medical solutions. Supply Chain Management: Improving transparency and accountability in logistics. Can Lightchain AI Replicate Dogwifhat‚Äôs 12,000% Success? Comparing Growth Drivers Hype vs Utility: Dogwifhat‚Äôs growth is fueled by social media buzz and speculative trading, whereas Lightchain AI‚Äôs value lies in its tangible applications and technological advancements. Community Engagement: Both projects benefit from strong community support, but Lightchain AI‚Äôs decentralized governance model ensures active participation in shaping its ecosystem. Scalability: While Dogwifhat relies on Solana‚Äôs infrastructure, Lightchain AI‚Äôs innovative consensus mechanism and AIVM offer unparalleled scalability and efficiency. Factors Favoring Lightchain AI Sustainable Growth: Lightchain AI‚Äôs focus on utility and innovation positions it for consistent growth, avoiding the pitfalls of speculative bubbles. Market Differentiation: By addressing real-world challenges, Lightchain AI appeals to a broader range of investors and industries. Presale Opportunity: The ongoing Lightchain AI presale offers early investors a chance to participate in a project with significant growth potential, starting at just $0.001125 per token. The Path Forward: Challenges and Opportunities For Dogwifhat (WIF): Sustaining Momentum: Maintaining its community-driven momentum will require innovative strategies to keep investors engaged. Expanding Utility: Developing tangible use cases could help Dogwifhat transition from a meme coin to a more sustainable asset. For Lightchain AI ($LCAI): Scaling Adoption: Building partnerships across industries will be crucial for demonstrating the platform‚Äôs utility. Navigating Competition: Competing with established blockchain platforms like Ethereum and Solana will require continuous innovation. Educating Investors: Communicating the value of its technology and applications will help attract a diverse investor base. Which Is the Better Investment? Why Choose Dogwifhat (WIF)?

Bitcoin Adoption Surges Among Nations And Major Corporations Hamada‚Äôs proposal reflects a broader interest in diversifying national reserves with cryptocurrencies, particularly following recent discussions in the Japanese parliament about reserve movements in the US and other countries. This surge in interest comes on the heels of Texas‚Äôs significant legislative efforts. The Texas House of Representatives has introduced a bill aimed at creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve, spearheaded by Republican state Representative Giovanni Capriglione. Related Reading: Australia‚Äôs Biggest Pension Fund Makes Historic $17M Bitcoin Investment, A National First The proposed legislation seeks to enable the state to accept taxes, fees, and donations in Bitcoin, with a commitment to hold these assets for a minimum of five years. Capriglione, who announced the bill during an X Spaces event, emphasized the potential benefits of such a reserve in enhancing Texas‚Äôs fiscal stability and reinforcing its leadership in Bitcoin innovation. ‚ÄúProbably the biggest enemy of our investments is inflation,‚Äù he stated, highlighting that a strategic Bitcoin reserve could provide a win-win scenario for the state. The legislation, titled ‚ÄúAn Act Relating to the Establishment of a Bitcoin Reserve within the State Treasury of Texas and the Management of Cryptocurrencies by Governmental Entities,‚Äù underscores a significant trend of increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Notably, this movement is not limited to nations; following President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs proposal for a US strategic Bitcoin reserve at the National Bitcoin Conference in Nashville earlier this year, there has been a marked uptick in BTC adoption among various countries and private companies. Bitcoinist previously reported that in just the past month, nine major firms from sectors including finance, healthcare, and artificial intelligence (AI) have embraced the market‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency as a strategic reserve asset. October 2025 As Next Major BTC Market Top? As these developments unfold, BTC has recently closed the week above the $100,000 mark, fueling speculation about its future trajectory. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has pointed out that if Bitcoin adheres to historical trends observed in previous market cycles, the next market peak could occur in October 2025. The analyst noted that in the last two cycles, from market bottom to market top, it took approximately 1,065 days, while the duration from one market bottom to the next was around 1,430 days. Related Reading: Dogecoin Will See New ATH Soon ‚Äì Top Trader Sets $2 Target Martinez also identified a critical support level for Bitcoin at $96,870, where approximately 1.45 million addresses accumulated around 1.42 million BTC.

At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $101,477, up 2% on the week after a brief consolidation period and a 7% drop towards $91,000.

Elon‚Äôs Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon‚Äôs Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon‚Äôs Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon‚Äôs Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon‚Äôs Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon‚Äôs Gold by entering its contract address ‚Äì 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|FIAT|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-15 03:49:00

This development is expected to enhance Shibarium‚Äôs utility and accessibility for the broader crypto community. Integration Confirmed Bitget Wallet recently added Shibarium to its list of supported blockchains. The news came to light through a post shared on X by Shibarium Update, a channel dedicated to Shiba Inu developments. The post included a screenshot as evidence of the integration and confirmed that users can now access the blockchain‚Äôs features through the wallet. Notably, Bitget has not released an official statement regarding the integration. Furthermore, while the blockchain is supported on the Bitget Wallet, it has not yet been incorporated into the Bitget exchange. Great news for the #BoneArmy and #SHIBARMY ! Shibarium has now been integrated into the Bitget Wallet (not the exchange yet). #Shibarium #Bone #ShibEcosystem pic.twitter.com/UOdDYILmd7 ‚Äî Shibarium Updates (@Shibizens) December 11, 2024 Expanded Functionality for Users The integration allows Bitget Wallet users to interact with it in various ways, including storing, transferring, swapping, and staking assets within the ecosystem. This new functionality is expected to encourage greater participation in the blockchain network, potentially boosting transaction volumes and user engagement. Bitget Wallet, launched in May 2018, has established itself as a trusted platform for storing and managing cryptocurrency assets. Its significant user base provides an opportunity to expose Shibarium to millions of new users, further expanding the reach of the Layer-2 blockchain. Recent Milestones The Shibarium network has demonstrated consistent growth since its launch in August 2023. Recently, the blockchain surpassed two major milestones, including reaching over 2 million wallet addresses and exceeding 600 million total transactions. As of now , the transaction count has risen to approximately 645.74 million, with an average daily transaction volume of 4.58 million. These statistics highlight the growing adoption of Shibarium, underscoring its potential as a major player in the blockchain space. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Adoption Among Wallets and Exchanges Despite its progress, the integration into major crypto platforms remains limited. Only a few leading exchanges, such as Gate.io and BluBit , have incorporated Shibarium into their services. Additionally, wallets like Frontier and GroveX have integrated Shibarium into their platforms, while MetaMask users can access the blockchain via the Chainlist feature. The community continues to advocate for broader adoption of the blockchain, urging major platforms like Binance, Coinbase, and Ledger to offer support. These efforts are part of a larger push to establish Shibarium as a widely accessible and versatile Layer-2 solution. The integration of Shibarium into Bitget Wallet represents a pivotal step forward for the ecosystem. With Bitget‚Äôs extensive global user base, the move has the potential to drive significant growth and activity on the network. As the community continues to push for broader adoption across exchanges and wallets, the network‚Äôs trajectory remains promising.

This surge highlights Bitcoin‚Äôs resilience and growing institutional acceptance and casts a spotlight on emerging altcoins poised to disrupt the market. Among these is RCO Finance (RCOF) , an undervalued altcoin that investors are beginning to recognize for its potential to skyrocket by an astonishing 50,000%. As the market evolves, Bitcoin and innovative altcoins like RCOF are poised for a major market bull run that aims to push the crypto market cap to a new ATH. Bitcoin Price Targets 120,000 Amid Market-Wide Crypto Surge Bitcoin price has once again captivated the financial world, breaking the $102,000 barrier as the cryptocurrency sector reached a valuation of $3.5 trillion. This rally comes amid significant developments, including bullish comments from President-elect Donald Trump. Trump‚Äôs suggestion of adding Bitcoin to a strategic reserve and unveiling a crypto-friendly agenda spurred market optimism. The crypto market‚Äôs performance over the last 24 hours highlights the space‚Äôs sheer volatility, with $298.5 million liquidated across long and short contracts. While institutional players continue to embrace Bitcoin, this surge reflects renewed confidence in the cryptocurrency‚Äôs role as a hedge against economic instability. The Bitcoin price climb has set the stage for an altcoin boom, with innovative projects like RCO Finance (RCOF) poised to ride the wave of bullish sentiment. As the Bitcoin price builds up toward the $120,000 mark, the race for the next breakout star intensifies, and RCOF‚Äôs explosive potential cannot be overlooked. RCO Finance: The Undervalued Altcoin Set for a Meteoric Rise RCO Finance (RCOF) is not your average altcoin. While many altcoins rely on hype, RCOF is carving its niche with robust use cases and an ecosystem for long-term growth. Its decentralized services platform offers unparalleled scalability, lower transaction costs, and groundbreaking liquidity protocols. At the heart of RCO Finance‚Äôs appeal is its AI-powered Robo Advisor, a groundbreaking tool designed to tailor investment strategies to individual users. This advanced system analyzes vast amounts of historical and real-time market data, allowing it to provide personalized recommendations based on each investor‚Äôs financial goals and risk tolerance. Unlike traditional platforms that leave users to trade alone, the Robo Advisor is a trusted companion, continuously adjusting portfolios in response to market fluctuations. This feature mitigates emotional biases often associated with trading and empowers investors to make informed decisions confidently. Another key feature distinguishing RCO Finance is its Automated Market Making (AMM) mechanism. This fully automated trading platform utilizes cutting-edge AI and machine learning technologies to optimize trade execution. RCO Finance also addresses one of the major challenges in the crypto space: the disconnect between DeFi and TradFi. Through its Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, RCOF allows users to use cryptos to invest in tangible assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. This capability broadens investment opportunities and simplifies transactions by eliminating the need for fiat conversions. As a result, RCOF users can diversify their portfolios across various asset classes without facing the typical barriers associated with traditional investing. RCOF prioritizes security by conducting regular smart contract audits by SolidProof and adopting a non-KYC approach, which provides privacy while ensuring compliance with necessary regulations. With a secure no KYC debit card, investors can access their holdings for daily transactions anywhere in the world. RCO Finance Promises 500x ROI for Investors The current Bitcoin price rally, with its target of $120,000, has injected positive momentum into the altcoin and presale sectors, significantly benefiting RCO Finance (RCOF) . Sales of RCOF tokens have surged, crossing the $9 million milestone and boosting investor confidence in the project. The presale is currently in Stage 4, with each RCOF token priced at $0.0778. Users can also apply the code RCOF25 to receive an additional 25% in tokens with their purchase. With the anticipated listing price of $0.60, investors will gain over 700% ROI once the token hits the market. Analysts predict a 50,000% bull run as RCO Finance gains traction and expands its market presence. Investors participating in this presale will acquire tokens at a fraction of their anticipated future value and access exclusive benefits within the RCO Finance ecosystem. Holding RCOF altcoins grants users voting rights on key platform decisions and eligibility for community rewards exceeding $100,000. This creates an engaging environment where investors can actively participate in shaping the future of RCO Finance while reaping potential financial rewards. As the Bitcoin price aims for new heights in its rally, altcoins like RCO Finance are emerging as promising contenders ready to capture investor interest. Don‚Äôt miss your chance to be part of this exciting journey. Instead, invest in RCO Finance today and position yourself for potential generational wealth!

The altcoin is down by more than seven percent in the last seven days. XRP is still technically within a larger bull market, with no confirmed lower highs or lows on the weekly time frame. Over the last couple of weeks, XRP has experienced a short-term bearish trend within the larger bullish market. Price Prediction Currently, XRP is testing the support levels between $2.33 and $2.40. There is potential for a short-term bounce from this range, but if the price fails to hold above these levels, it may drop to the next support area between $2.00 and $2.23. If XRP manages to hold above $2.40, a break above the $2.62 level could trigger a rally toward $3.00 and possibly test the all-time highs near $3.25. Support and Resistance Levels The main resistance zone is between $2.90 and $3.00, which is the level to watch for potential price rejection. On the downside, the first key support lies between $2.33 and $2.40. If XRP drops below this level, the next support is between $2.00 and $2.23. The upper boundary of the trend channel is also acting as support. A break above this level could lead to a more aggressive breakout, but it will depend on how the price moves in the coming days. Analyst Weighs In According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, if XRP closes below $2.40, especially under $2.29, it could signal a drop toward support levels around $1.90. Strong support is found around $2, where previous resistance is now acting as new support. If XRP maintains this support, it could continue its upward movement. He said that XRP is showing possible signs of a reversal but lacks sufficient confirmation for a solid bullish breakout.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-15 04:04:43

Musk‚Äôs lawyer, Alex Spiro, recently accused the SEC of a harassment campaign against Musk and his companies, including Neuralink. The SEC has given Musk a 48-hour ultimatum to settle and has issued subpoenas. In response to the SEC‚Äôs actions, Musk has gained support from industry leaders. Vivek Ramaswamy, recently appointed to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), criticized the SEC for wasting government resources and frequently losing court cases due to their illegal and unconstitutional rule interpretations. He argued that the SEC‚Äôs actions are undermining public trust in the law. Ripple‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, also weighed in, claiming that Ripple had exposed the SEC‚Äôs lawless tactics early on. Reflecting on their own court case, he pointed out that the SEC has been using litigation to push its own agenda, rather than faithfully following the law. He added that the real issue is how to hold the SEC accountable under its current leadership. He wrote, ‚ÄúThe question isn‚Äôt whether the SEC under Gensler is rogue‚Äîit is. The question is how we hold them accountable?‚Äù Ripple‚Äôs top leaders, along with the crypto industry, celebrated SEC Chairman Gary Gensler‚Äôs upcoming departure. Gensler confirmed he will leave on January 20. Ripple‚Äôs Stuart Alderoty believes that once the regulatory issues are cleared, Ripple will become the top provider of crypto solutions for businesses in the U.S. For the unversed, the SEC has been investigating Elon Musk for delaying the disclosure of his 9.2% stake in Twitter. He only revealed his stake on April 4, 2022, about ten days after surpassing the 5% disclosure threshold required by law. According to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, anyone who acquires at least 5% of a public company must disclose it within ten days.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-15 05:07:58

Sui‚Äôs DEX volume has also surged after an announcement from the Blackpack Exchange. Meanwhile, Rollblock is leading Q4‚Äôs altseason as analysts predict up to 880% ROI for early RBLK investors. Cardano (ADA) Whales Hold Long Positions During Impressive Rally Cardano‚Äôs price was in a brief corrective phase over the last seven days after recording massive 96.48% intra-month gains. Since Cardano‚Äôs concentration indicator has climbed by 0.26% already, analysts believe Cardano whales are holding long positions on the token before an anticipated surge. Cardano‚Äôs large transactions have also increased by 0.52% which suggests high network activity. Cardano is currently trading for $1.14 after an intraday increase worth 5.06%. Cardano‚Äôs volume has decreased by 22.72% which typically suggests decreased selling activity. Since Cardano‚Äôs Momentum and Bull Bear Power indicators are already suggesting bullish dominance, Cardano‚Äôs price could surge towards the $2.5 target before the end of Q4. Sui (SUI) Trading Volume Surges by More than 100% in a Single Day Sui‚Äôs price has rallied by a modest 55.21% over the last 30 days as the broader crypto market entered Q4‚Äôs bull run. Despite this slow growth, Sui has reached a new all-time high price of $4.9 on 12 December. This massive Sui rally is fueled by an announcement from Blackpack Exchange regarding a wallet integration with Sui which triggered a massive rise in Sui‚Äôs DEX volumes. Sui is currently trading for $4.71 after an intraday increase worth 21.85%. Sui‚Äôs volume has also rallied by a massive 113.87% as traders rush to purchase Sui tokens before the price skyrockets any further. Since Sui‚Äôs RSI suggests that there is still room for more growth, analysts expect Sui to reach $7.04 by early 2025. Rollblock (RBLK) Early Investors Enjoy Massive 310% ROI Rollblock is skyrocketing through its presale stages with its viral GambleFi protocol. Not only has Rollblock raised more than $7 million in record time, but its early investors are already enjoying up to 310% ROI. If Rollblock can continue this pace until the end of Q4, analysts are expecting a total of 880% gains for the native RBLK token ahead of its official launch on DEXs and CEXs. The reason why traders are rapidly accumulating RBLK tokens is the project‚Äôs utility. Aside from powering the GambleFi ecosystem, Rollblock‚Äôs investors can also earn a weekly passive income through the platform‚Äôs attractive revenue sharing model. At the end of every week, Rollblock uses up to 30% of its gaming revenue to purchase RBLK tokens on the open market. These tokens are distributed in two categories: 40% are distributed as staking rewards while the remaining 60% are removed from the circulating supply forever. Since the scarce supply creates deflationary pressure on Rollblock, analysts expect the token‚Äôs price to keep increasing in value over time. Aside from reaping these massive rewards, Rollblock investors also get exclusive access to the platform‚Äôs massive gaming library that features 7,000+ AI-powered games. In addition, Rollblock has also announced a new upgrade to its ecosystem which features a betting option. As of last week, Rollblock users can place bets on top sports leagues such as the NBA, NFL, UFC, F1, MMA, LaLiga and more. Even with these exciting features, Rollblock is still selling tokens for a low price of just $0.0415 in stage 9 of its presale. Since analysts are already expecting another price jump before the end of this week, now is the best time to invest in Rollblock at the lowest price it will ever be.

PEPE: A Deflationary Memecoin Inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary memecoin inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme from the early 2000s. Launched on Ethereum, it follows coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. PEPE has no transaction tax and keeps its meme identity without utility. It reached a market cap of $1.6 billion in mid-2023, sparking interest in the crypto world. The roadmap aims to increase visibility through social media trends and exchange listings. It uses a burning mechanism to enhance scarcity and rewards long-term holders. As an ERC-20 token, it benefits from Ethereum‚Äôs security. PEPE is available on Uniswap and major exchanges like Binance. Its deflationary model and strong community may make it attractive in the current market. Dogwifhat (WIF): A New Meme Coin on Solana Inspired by Viral Dog Meme Dogwifhat (WIF) is a new meme coin on the Solana blockchain, inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme. It has gained popularity for its dog-themed concept and community-driven approach. Meme coins like WIF often build strong online communities and spread through viral trends. By operating on Solana, WIF benefits from fast transactions and low fees. The coin focuses on creating a fun and engaging experience for users. In the current market cycle, WIF may attract attention due to its unique theme and the growing interest in meme coins. Its potential lies in community growth and leveraging social media trends. Investors interested in meme coins might find WIF appealing. BONK: Solana‚Äôs Shiba Inu Memecoin Empowering the Community BONK is a Solana-based memecoin with a Shiba Inu mascot that aims to empower the Solana community by redistributing power from venture capital tokens. It surged over 100% after a Coinbase listing and serves as a ‚Äúcommunity coin,‚Äù airdropping 50% of its supply to Solana‚Äôs NFT and DeFi participants. As of mid-December 2023, BONK became the third-largest memecoin by market cap, with a year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Despite challenges like a high total supply and the volatile nature of memecoins, BONK‚Äôs integration into the growing Solana ecosystem, including the launch of the decentralized exchange BonkSwap, positions it as a notable player. The coin looks attractive in the current market cycle. Dogecoin: The Meme Coin Turning into a Crypto Contender Dogecoin (DOGE), launched in 2013, is a cryptocurrency inspired by the Shiba Inu meme. Unlike Bitcoin‚Äôs limited supply, Dogecoin has no maximum limit and adds 10,000 new coins every minute. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer as a lighthearted alternative, it gained massive popularity in 2021. Social media influence, particularly from Elon Musk, propelled it into the top ten cryptocurrencies, with a market value exceeding $50 billion. Dogecoin highlights the power of community and social media in shaping financial markets. Its technology allows for fast transactions, and its active community continues to drive its relevance. The coin‚Äôs potential lies in its widespread acceptance and the enthusiasm of its supporters. Conclusion While coins like PEPE, WIF, BONK, and DOGE show less short-term promise, DOGEN stands out. Tailored for those who aspire to luxury and success, DOGEN is poised for 700% growth by presale‚Äôs end, with potential for massive returns this altcoin season. It builds a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

Here‚Äôs the Bullish Chart,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-foresees-shiba-inu-shib-to-rally-150-heres-why/,"Despite a 10% dip in Shiba Inu‚Äôs (SHIB) price recently, optimism remains strong among analysts who foresee a substantial rally for the token. Predictions suggest that SHIB could rise significantly, approaching its previous all-time high. Market analyst PouyanTradeFX has identified a crucial price level for SHIB that could determine its next significant move. According to a recent analysis shared on TradingView, the token is currently testing a longstanding trendline that has influenced its price movements since 2021. The weekly chart shows that the asset has been in a persistent downtrend since reaching its all-time high of $0.00008616 in October 2021. The token briefly challenged this trendline in March 2024 when it reached $0.00004567. Currently trading at $0.00002822, the digital asset could see a remarkable 163% surge to approximately $0.000074 if it breaks through this resistance level. However, failure to breach the trendline could result in a significant 62% drop to around $0.000011, the analyst warned. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 PouyanTradeFX‚Äôs analysis is part of a broader wave of bullish predictions for the token, even as the cryptocurrency market faces broader challenges. Potential to Erase Another Zero Another analyst, Crypto ELITES, has presented an even more ambitious outlook for SHIB. On December 11, they highlighted the possibility of the token climbing nearly 1,700% to reach $0.00047905, supported by a cup-and-handle pattern observed on its weekly chart. This optimistic forecast hinges on the continued decline of Bitcoin Dominance, which reflects the share of the total market capitalization held by Bitcoin. Bitcoin Dominance has dropped from 61.5% in November to 56.5% currently, indicating a potential shift of capital from Bitcoin to altcoins and meme coins. Recent Performance and Market Sentiment Shiba Inu has experienced a notable price increase of 200% over the past year, demonstrating strong performance compared to many other cryptocurrencies. Despite the current decline, analysts remain confident that the asset is well-positioned for future growth. As market conditions evolve, the asset‚Äôs ability to overcome key resistance levels will likely determine whether these optimistic projections materialize. While substantial gains are possible, investors should also be cautious of the risks highlighted by analysts.

Homo Shiba Inu (HOMOSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address ‚Äì 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-15 06:26:24

Let‚Äôs dive into what makes these meme coins stand out and why they‚Äôre worth your attention. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Presale Powerhouse Ready to Surge If there‚Äôs one presale you can‚Äôt afford to miss, it‚Äôs BTFD Coin .

First, its robust ecosystem includes a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that rewards users while keeping them engaged. Second, its staking rewards offer an impressive 90% APY, making it a long-term income generator. For example, a $650 investment at $0.0001 will get you 6.5 million BTFD coins, which could be worth $3,900 if the price hits $0.0006 after the presale ends. BTFD‚Äôs dedicated community, the Bulls Squad, ensures continued support and market momentum. If you‚Äôre serious about finding the best meme coins for significant returns, BTFD Coin is a no-brainer. 2. Neiro (NEIRO): AI Meets Meme Coin Innovation Neiro is redefining what it means to be a meme coin by integrating artificial intelligence into its ecosystem. It‚Äôs not just about the memes‚Äîit‚Äôs about creating real-world applications that add value for investors. Neiro‚Äôs flagship feature is its AI-powered trading assistant, which provides data-driven insights to help holders make smarter investment decisions. The project is gaining traction for its innovation and the buzz around its upcoming partnerships in the tech space. Why is Neiro a standout? Its ability to blend technology and meme culture positions it as a unique contender in the crypto market, making it one of the best meme coins for significant returns in December 2024. 3. Snek (SNEK): The Meme Coin with Nostalgia and Utility For investors who love nostalgia, Snek is an irresistible choice. Built on the Cardano blockchain, this meme coin takes inspiration from the classic snake game, adding a modern twist with blockchain-based play-to-earn mechanics. Snek has gained significant attention thanks to its seamless integration with the Cardano ecosystem, offering low fees and high scalability. The launch of its play-to-earn platform has increased engagement and demand, making it a hot pick for December. What makes Snek special? Its unique gaming angle and solid blockchain foundation ensure it stands out, offering significant returns for those who get in early. 4.

With this remarkable performance, the asset is forming bullish patterns on its chart, and JD (@jaydee_757), a prominent crypto analyst, has spotted an important one. In a post on X, the analyst drew attention to a breakout from a descending flag pattern on the 4-hour chart. The chart shows that XRP is forming a classic bullish flag after a sharp rally from $1.40 to its recent peak of $2.86. #XRP (4hr) ‚Äì If full candle closes above, this gives us a higher probability of a breakout! If not, expect bottom trendline to hit! Macro view, this chart is irrelevant! ATH is coming! Dumb Money who got REKT for 7 years will DENY! Retweet for updates! TA ALL DAY! $XRP ‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/zovN6Ulv2W ‚Äî JD (@jaydee_757) December 13, 2024 The flag‚Äôs breakout point was identified around the $2.40 range, and at the time of JD‚Äôs analysis, XRP traded at $2.4298, in the early stages of the breakout. JD emphasized the significance of a full-bodied candle closing above the upper trendline of the flag. In his post, he noted, ‚ÄúThe more full body close above the trendline, the higher the breakout probability.‚Äù Such a confirmation could indicate the resumption of XRP‚Äôs upward momentum. In a follow-up post , JD confirmed that XRP closed above the trendline, suggesting a bullish breakout could be underway. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Bullish Flag Pattern and Potential Targets The bullish flag pattern depicted in the chart is a well-known continuation signal. It typically occurs when a steep upward price movement, referred to as the flagpole, is followed by a consolidation phase that trends slightly downward. When the price decisively breaks above the flag‚Äôs resistance, it often signals the start of a new rally with a target price derived by projecting the length of the flagpole from the breakout point. JD did not provide a specific target in his analysis. However, based on JD‚Äôs chart, the implied target for this breakout is well above $3.8. JD noted that a new all-time high is coming, a sentiment shared by other experts . At press time, XRP had dropped slightly, now trading at $2.93, but many experts still believe it can easily close the 37.8% gap required to reclaim its all-time high of $3.84. JD also called out dumb money investors who doubt his analysis. The analyst has previously called out these dumb money investors who missed out on the 2017 rally. Expects expects them to miss out on the current one. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Dogen is the name on everyone‚Äôs lips, hinting at potential gains as high as 15,000% in the near future. Curiosity surrounds this digital coin as investors watch closely to see if it lives up to the hype. DOGEN Rejoys Big Moment: Trump‚Äôs Victory Will Send It to the Moon Guess who is going to join Elon Musk‚Äôs moon mission soon? DOGEN, the boldest meme coin for alpha males, is gearing up for take-off as Trump‚Äôs victory in the recent US election has the entire market euphoric about the prospects of cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins. Donald and Elon are Best Buddies for Meme Coins Donald Trump‚Äôs love for crypto is no secret ‚Äî he‚Äôs promised to make the U.S. the global crypto leader in his campaign. And joining him is none other than Elon Musk , the ultimate Dogecoin (DOGE) fan who‚Äôs backed the crypto movement and even aligned with Republicans earlier this year.

DOGEN will be the Next Star with 500% Surge Following the US election results, Dogecoin (DOGE) has been on a steady rise: from $0.15 to $0.39 in just one week .

Flex Hard, Earn Big ‚Äì DOGEN is Your Power Move! Ethereum‚Äôs Role and Potential in Blockchain Technology Ethereum is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin. It enables smart contracts and a wide range of decentralized applications. The network supports decentralized finance and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon, which enhance transaction efficiency. Ethereum introduced ERC-20 tokens for governance, utility, and value storage, but Ether (ETH) is still needed for gas fees. In 2022, Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge, improving scalability and efficiency. The upcoming sharding phase aims to further boost these aspects. Ether remains central to the ecosystem, facilitating transactions and rewarding stakers. With its continuous developments and key position in the blockchain space, Ethereum holds significant potential in the current market cycle. Conclusion ETH and similar coins show less short-term potential. DOGEN, designed for those seeking luxury and success, expects 700% growth by presale‚Äôs end, with potential for massive returns this altcoin season. Following tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

What sets this coin apart is its cheeky branding and a community that rallies around being unapologetically different.

Built for those who embrace hustle culture, alpha vibes, and the mantra of being unapologetically awesome, Gigachad has created a tribe of like-minded investors who live for high stakes. The coin‚Äôs branding taps into the internet‚Äôs obsession with ‚ÄúChad‚Äù memes, celebrating confidence, dominance, and success. But Gigachad isn‚Äôt just about swagger. It‚Äôs backed by a roadmap promising innovative staking mechanisms, DAO governance for its holders, and plans for a metaverse crossover that will allow Chads everywhere to flex their digital muscles. While it may seem gimmicky to some, this coin has proven its ability to generate hype, and its fiercely loyal community ensures it‚Äôs not just a flash in the pan. If you‚Äôre drawn to big energy and even bigger ambitions, Gigachad might be your meme coin soulmate. Conclusion: Don‚Äôt Miss the Dip‚ÄîGrab the Bull So, what‚Äôs the move?

Cardano (ADA) has surpassed expectations over the past few weeks, and to see if the asset would give everyone a Christmas surprise in the form of a continued surge, we asked ChatGPT what its price would be by December 25. Current Market Performance At press time, Cardano (ADA) is trading at $1.05, marking a 4.06% decline over the past 24 hours. However, this is a minor downturn in a broader upward trend, as ADA has experienced an impressive 88% gain over the past month. This growth reflects increasing investor confidence and renewed market interest in the Cardano ecosystem. Cardano (ADA) Price By Christmas Day ChatGPT predicts that ADA could reach $3 on Christmas Day, a remarkable 185.7% increase from its current price. This would put the digital asset just below its all-time high of $3.1 and is a significant step toward a new all-time high for the digital asset. While ambitious, this prediction raises important questions about the factors driving ADA‚Äôs market performance. ChatGPT provided a detailed analysis of the factors that could help ADA reach this ambitious target. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ecosystem Development and Upgrades: Cardano continues to expand its ecosystem through regular updates and enhancements like the recently released Daedalus v.7.0.0 . ChatGPT highlighted the importance of this continued advancement, stating, ‚ÄúCardano‚Äôs focus on scalability, energy efficiency, and innovative technologies positions it well for future growth, particularly as adoption increases.‚Äù Growing Institutional Interest: Institutional interest in blockchain solutions has been growing, and Cardano‚Äôs reputation as an energy-efficient and scientifically driven platform has made it attractive to larger investors. Earlier in the year, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse listed Cardano among assets for which ETF approval is inevitable , and this puts the asset in a unique class that is highly attractive to institutional investors. Market Sentiment and Adoption: Positive market sentiment around ADA, driven by its expanding decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem and major advancements, could further fuel its rise. Broader Cryptocurrency Market Trends: Finally, broader market trends, such as Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements and increased adoption of altcoins, could also play a role. Bitcoin is currently experiencing a historic run, and the cryptocurrency market has historically seen seasonal surges in December, and credence to the belief that ADA will perform well this month.

Elon‚Äôs Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon‚Äôs Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon‚Äôs Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon‚Äôs Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon‚Äôs Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon‚Äôs Gold by entering its contract address ‚Äì 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner.

According to OneKey, this approach significantly minimizes risks by isolating crypto transactions from everyday device usage. Everyday devices like smartphones and personal laptops are vulnerable to cyberattacks because they are used for a multitude of activities that expose them to malware, such as downloading files, clicking on links, and opening PDFs. Hackers are exploiting these vulnerabilities, as seen in the $50 million Radiant Capital attack, where attackers used fake PDF malware to steal money. ‚ÄúA dedicated device is like putting your crypto in a safe instead of a drawer,‚Äù OneKey said. By using a device solely for cryptocurrency purposes, users can create a clean, focused, and secure environment away from the distractions and risks of general-purpose devices. According to OneKey's statement, the benefits of special devices can be listed as follows: Reduced Risk: Dedicated devices eliminate the installation of irrelevant software, significantly reducing the possibility of backdoor malware attacks. No Distraction: Streamline operations by only installing crypto tools, wallets, and exchange platforms. Enhanced Monitoring: Unusual activity is easier to detect on a device with minimal apps. Related News: Prominent Market Analyst Dennis Gartman Says ""I Will Not Buy Bitcoin"", Explains Why OneKey outlined a simple approach to creating a secure environment for cryptocurrency management: Start Fresh: Use a new or unused laptop or tablet. Perform a clean install of an operating system like macOS or Linux. No Extras: Restrict the device to crypto-related software only; no email, games, or random apps. Use a Hardware Wallet: Pair the device with a hardware wallet like Ledger or OneKey to keep private keys offline. Private Browser: Use a secure browser, especially for accessing decentralized applications (dApps) or exchanges. Add security extensions to block phishing sites. Private Network: Always connect to secure, private Wi-Fi. Avoid public networks and use open source VPN tools like Clash or SSR. *This is not investment advice.

Prominent cryptocurrency analyst Dark Defender (@DefendDark) recently shared an in-depth technical analysis, highlighting the significant resistance and support levels that will determine the next phase of XRP‚Äôs price movement. Hi all. We gave XRP 24 hours on 11-Dec, almost 40 hours since then. Well, $XRP will decide where to go max. by tomorrow. There is no room left on the current Bull Flag. Resistances: $2.42, $2.52, $2.72, $5.85 Supports: $2.29, $2.24, $2.10, $2.02 #XRPArmy #Ripple pic.twitter.com/lHVFKxQIMn ‚Äî Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 13, 2024 According to the analysis, the Bull Flag, a continuation pattern indicating potential upward momentum, has reached its narrowing apex. With minimal room left for price consolidation within this pattern, a breakout or breakdown appears imminent. Dark Defender noted that XRP must make its decisive move as the formation cannot persist much longer without resolution. Key Resistance and Support Levels Dark Defender identified critical resistance levels that XRP must overcome to continue its upward trajectory. These include $2.42, $2.52, $2.72, and the major long-term resistance at $5.85. These levels will likely act as barriers if bullish momentum accelerates, requiring significant buying pressure to break through. On the downside, XRP has several support levels that could prevent a bearish breakdown. These levels include $2.29, $2.24, $2.10, and $2.02. If the price falls below these levels, the current bullish outlook could shift to bearish sentiment, with traders potentially reevaluating their positions. Despite some bearish predictions , XRP has stayed above these support levels, currently trading at $2.37. The analyst noted that the asset‚Äôs closing price on December 14 could determine its direction. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other Technical Indicators and XRP‚Äôs Future The chart indicates that XRP has been consolidating within the Bull Flag since its sharp rally in November. While the Ichimoku Cloud beneath the price adds a layer of support, the narrowing consolidation signifies increasing pressure on the price to break out in one direction. The daily trading volume and overall market sentiment will likely play a pivotal role in determining whether XRP breaks upward or downward. Historically, Bull Flags tend to resolve in the direction of the preceding trend, suggesting a higher probability of an upward breakout. However, external factors could influence the outcome. XRP‚Äôs recent rally has been driven by increasing market confidence and the optimism surrounding its future under Donald Trump‚Äôs administration. If it can break above $2.72 and reclaim its recent peak of $2.86, it could trigger the price surge that Dark Defender and other analysts have predicted multiple times, and send the asset toward higher targets.

The altcoins have performed a lot worse on a 24-hour scale, resulting in a growing BTC dominance. BTC Dominance Increases Monday and Tuesday saw a few violent price rejections for the primary cryptocurrency, which was driven to $94,400 on a couple of occasions during those days. However, the bulls managed to prevail and propelled a few leg-ups that helped BTC recover all losses and were quick to challenge the six-digit entry territory by Thursday. In fact, bitcoin indeed broke through that level and spiked to $102,000 on Friday and Saturday. It was stopped there at first but the bulls drove it even further hours ago to just under $103,000. Nevertheless, it couldn‚Äôt penetrate that line and now sits beneath $102,000. Nevertheless, its market capitalization continues to see new local peaks and sits well above $2 trillion.

The asset‚Äôs on-chain factors are flipping green alongside top crypto on the back of institutional demand and Elon Musk‚Äôs influence. This scenario is similar to the 2021 bull run, which saw the asset soar to an all-time high. Data from crypto analytics from Messari shows that wallets with 1 million DOGE have amassed over 130 billion tokens. This all-time high acquisition indicates increased whale participation in the ecosystem as market confidence ticked upward. A similar situation occurred in the 2021 bull run, as whale addresses began accumulating assets, reaching as high as 110 billion tokens. Like in 2021, Elon Musk‚Äôs presence is also at the center of this rally. The billionaire‚Äôs famous appearance on Saturday Night Live was a huge development for Dogecoin at the time, with bulls projecting more adoption for the asset. After Donald Trump‚Äôs victory, the DOGE price surged alongside the wider market and Elon Musk‚Äôs participation. Musk‚Äôs nomination as joint head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) led to more inflow to Dogecoin. The assets have been up 220% since the November polls, which has attracted bullish interest. A key factor for the DOGE price rise is the possible turn to the altcoin season and meme coin swings. Recent flows into the asset could ignite a similar run in previous bull cycles. On-chain Similarities Attracts Whales Dogecoin‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI) has soared above 70 into the overbought zone, often indicating a retracement. However, in 2021, a similar metric led to continuous bull pressure. While the RSI led to an upward swing three years ago, many remain skeptical about present market conditions. Furthermore, recent price consolidations after previous highs point to the last bull phase. Growth after the US election has stalled for most meme coins, and prices have begun a consolidation phase. A series of outflows mark this as volatility continues. However, the meme coin consolidation is usually followed by a breakout, leading to a frenzy as holders look to pick up huge gains. At press time, Dogecoin trades at $0.40, a 0.2% drop in the last 24 hours, taking weekly exits to 7.2%. Meanwhile, the total meme coin market cap is down 3%, with the market cap at $132.4 billion.",Cryptocurrency|News|Doge|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-15 07:46:31

While Bitcoin (BTC) maintains its support at $100,000, many other major cryptocurrencies are underperforming, showing a retreat across the altcoin market. ‚ÄòTis the season for rallies, profits, and gains, but this weekend has failed to bring much-needed relief for retail investors. While BTC holds steady above $100,000, major altcoins, including Pepe (PEPE), Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Ripple (XRP) are facing bearish action resulting in price drops ranging between 5% and 8%. All hope is not lost as BTC maintains its position, trading around $101,700 . The upcoming weeks should result in recovery as President-elect Trump‚Äôs inauguration draws closer, along with the official resignation of current SEC chief Gary Gensler. Join us as we delve into four altcoin projects analysts predict will soon gain traction. Pepe (PEPE) Pepe (PEPE) is a notable underperformer of the past few days, losing nearly 5% in the 24-hour charts and almost 10% in the weekly charts. The much-beloved memecoin has lost almost 20% of its value since recently setting a new ATH and now trades for $0.00002299 . Pepe¬†(PEPE)¬†is a fan favourite among crypto investors, gaining a whopping 1,520%¬†in the past year. The project is currently the third largest memecoin with a market cap of $9.64 billion. This popular memecoins quickly gained infamy for being a tribute to the 2000s internet meme sensation Pepe the Frog. Pepe has continued a reward streak driven by its robust community, rapid ascent and highly optimistic future projections. Analysts predict the memecoin will potentially increase by over 2100% by 2030, positioning it as a prime opportunity for those interested in meme coins' speculative aspects. Pepe has also handsomely gained since the Trump victory, gaining over 14% in the past month. PEPE‚Äôs popularity and value surged after exchanges Robinhood and Coinbase listed the memecoin for trading, skyrocketing the memecoin to a new ATH of $0.00002748 on December 9, 2024. Floki Inu (FLOKI) Floki Inu (FLOKI) also appears to be having difficulty over the past few days, resulting in a 6.8% decline in the 24-hour charts at the time of writing. Despite releasing a no-fee crypto debit card earlier this week, FLOKI‚Äôs price dropped nearly 14% over the past week. Floki Inu (FLOKI) initially came to market as a celebration of the meme culture but quickly rose through the ranks to become a serious investment opportunity. The project owes its success to a very active community and innovative marketing campaigns, allowing it to expand its utility. Floki Inu recently became a fully functional Web 3 service provider housing a range of Web 3 features.¬†With its expansion, the Floki ecosystem now houses a range of Web 3 ventures, including TokenFi for NFT and asset tokenization, a P2E metaverse, a staking dApp, and a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) marketplace. While FLOKI‚Äôs recent underperformance is understandable, given the broader market downturn in the face of macroeconomic uncertainty, FLOKI will likely recover in the coming weeks. FLOKI‚Äôs zero-fee debit card allows users to spend Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), USD Coin (USDC), tether (USDT), BNB Chain‚Äôs BNB and FLOKI globally at merchants that accept VISA or Mastercard. There are zero transaction and exchange rate fees, and it is compatible with over eight blockchain networks. The card is currently available in 31 European countries with plans to expand the offering to other countries in future. Popcat (POPCAT) POPCAT is a recent addition to the crypto sector, aiming to revive the market still plagued by challenges such as inactive wallets and volatility. The memecoin addresses common issues like pump-and-dump schemes and rug pulls by promoting transparency and security. Utilizing innovative blockchain technology and leveraging the power of the Solana network, POPCAT seeks to provide fast and secure transactions. The project's goals are robust, and its potential to deliver significant returns makes it a coin of interest for those looking to explore new ventures in the digital asset space. POPCAT‚Äôs (POPCAT) market cap has grown to $1.05 billion, but its price has pulled back heavily following a good rally after Donald Trump‚Äôs election victory. POPCAT‚Äôs performance over the past week and month has been very bearish, resulting in a 35% drop in the 30-day chart. Despite its recent underperformance, the memecoin has been successful as the first-ever cat-themed token. POPCAT‚Äôs staggering 6,522% gain over the past year demonstrates that meme culture, backed by strong community support, can propel projects to the top of the market. Husky Inu (HINU) As BTC continues to trade around $100,000, investors must look for well-priced alternative investment opportunities to profit from the bull run, and Husky Inu is precisely that. Powering up for an epic crypto rally! #HuskyInu pic.twitter.com/biysMWXfmx ‚Äî Husky Inu (@huskyinureal) December 12, 2024 Husky Inu (HINU) is the latest Solana-based memecoin to grace the market. Husky Inu was created to bring its holders more value and utility by leveraging this robust blockchain. The project and its native token, HINU , want to make their mark on the saturated memecoin market by building a supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Husky Inu recently launched the presale for HINU, and the fundraising has attracted a fair amount of attention. Husky Inu (HINU) has exceeded its presale goals, smashing its $618,000 fundraising target. Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting. Husky Inu‚Äôs presale success sets the tone for immense gains and is expected to skyrocket following exchange listings. HINU presale tokens are available at a modest $0.00015000 with exceptional profit potential for early backers.

The hearing, about Wyoming‚Äôs stablecoin project, incorrectly claimed that Cardano is based in Wyoming and operated by Input Output Global (IOG), the company founded by Hoskinson. In his response, Hoskinson clarified that Cardano is a decentralized blockchain network, not controlled by any single entity. The Cardano ecosystem is moving toward a more robust governance system to empower its community. Hoskinson also noted that the person in the video excluded XRP, ICP, Hashgraph, Bitcoin, and more from the Wyoming stablecoin project , but included Ethereum, noting that he previously worked at Consensys and implying that ETH was receiving some favorable treatment. This is the guy who made the decision to exclude Cardano, XRP, ICP, Bitcoin, Hashgraph, etc But he did include Ethereum. He knows a lot about it, given his former employer was Consensys‚Ä¶ https://t.co/wfC2thhTB6 ‚Äî Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 14, 2024 Hoskinson and ETH Gate While many in the blockchain community supported Hoskinson‚Äôs clarification, some noted a perceived inconsistency in his stance. Critics pointed to his previous comments regarding the XRP community‚Äôs allegations of bias against XRP, known as the ‚ÄúETH Gate‚Äù conspiracy. ETH Gate is a controversy alleging Ethereum received special regulatory treatment during its 2014 ICO and later, with claims of favoritism by regulators like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The biggest sticking point for the XRP community is the SEC‚Äôs attempt to go after Ripple and XRP while ignoring Ethereum. Many in the XRP community believe that Ethereum‚Äôs creators bribed the SEC for these class actions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Hoskinson has dismissed claims that Ethereum received preferential treatment from regulatory authorities, stating that there is no proof that Ethereum bribed regulators to go after XRP. However, Hoskinson believes the regulator showed favoritism. He stated that this favoritism has extended to the Wyoming stablecoin project. Hoskinson‚Äôs recent remarks align with this belief. He suggests that Ethereum may have benefited from undue favor in the current context. He questioned why Ethereum was included in the regulatory discussion while other major blockchains were excluded but did not allege bribery or similar practices. Meanwhile, Cardano is moving forward with major upgrades of key parts of the ecosystem. The digital asset is in its Voltaire era, and gradually giving all the power to the people through governance voting. Hoskinson has expressed faith in the ecosystem, recently stating that the world will run on Cardano . Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

However, Qubetics‚Äô visionary approach to tokenisation and its dynamic presale structure make it the best altcoin to join in December 2024.

The region‚Äôs strategic economic and regulatory approach, paired with its special relationship with mainland China, has created a unique environment for both institutional investors and blockchain startups. Ivan Ivanov, global CEO of WOW Summit, attributed Hong Kong‚Äôs rise to a blend of progressive regulations and its role as a special economic region. ‚ÄúYou get the excitement and potential of crypto, but with the stability and security of a well-established financial system,‚Äù Ivanov stated. He explained that Hong Kong‚Äôs stablecoin policy , which mandates issuers to secure licenses and hold fiat reserves in local banks, fosters transparency and trust in the sector. With deep connections to the global financial market, including a gateway to mainland China, Hong Kong offers a compelling proposition: cutting-edge technological innovation backed by regulatory oversight that minimizes risk and builds investor confidence. A Trailblazer in Crypto Regulation and Innovation In October 2024, Hong Kong‚Äôs Financial Services and Treasury Bureau (FSTB) unveiled guidelines for integrating AI into financial systems, a move aimed at mitigating risks while enabling innovation. Around the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched Project Ensemble in collaboration with central banks from Brazil and Thailand, focusing on cross-border tokenized settlements. Further cementing its status, Hong Kong‚Äôs Cyberport Web3 network now hosts over 270 blockchain firms, with 120 joining in just the past 17 months. This state-sponsored digital asset hub underscores the government‚Äôs commitment to fostering Web3 and blockchain innovation. Adding to the momentum, Hong Kong‚Äôs largest digital bank ZA Bank introduced retail crypto trading for its clients in November 2024. To encourage institutional participation, the government proposed exempting institutional crypto investors from capital gains taxes, signaling its intent to become a haven for blockchain-related investments. The Road Ahead for Hong Kong Hong Kong‚Äôs robust regulatory framework and strategic initiatives have attracted global attention, creating a thriving ecosystem where financial stability meets technological advancement. With policies designed to balance innovation and investor protection, Hong Kong is positioning itself as a benchmark for crypto-friendly governance. As the region continues to pioneer initiatives in blockchain and digital finance, it is poised to remain at the forefront of the global cryptocurrency industry, shaping the future of financial innovation.

33767162,[object Object],1734249646,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Energy Crisis In Iran ‚Äî Is Bitcoin Mining To Blame?,https://bitcoinist.com/energy-crisis-in-iran-is-bitcoin-mining-to-blame/,"Bitcoin mining, while a largely profitable venture for mining companies and individuals, can cause plenty of problems. The rise of crypto mining can raise rates, weaken grids, and even cause power blackouts in certain countries like Thailand, Venezuela, and Kazakhstan. Iran‚Äôs capital and its nearby provinces are also reporting rolling power blackouts in the last two months, disrupting businesses and the locals‚Äô everyday lives. While the local authorities have floated several underlying factors for the recurring problem, they may suspect that crypto mining played a crucial role in it. Tehran‚Äôs latest problems with rolling power outages have raised concerns among local officials, calling for an inquiry into crypto miners‚Äô potential culpability. Iran Faces Increasing Demand For Power Iran has historically struggled with increasing power demands, primarily due to international sanctions over its nuclear program. It also didn‚Äôt help that its government sold some of its power reserves to augment its budget while addressing regional conflicts and even mismanagement. To help address the concern, many Iranians have stopped using their air conditioners as weather conditions improved in the fall. The country‚Äôs rolling power outages coincided with Bitcoin‚Äôs massive price surge in early November. Immediately after Republican Donald Trump‚Äôs election, Bitcoin‚Äôs price started to surge above $70,000, finally hitting the $100k mark for the first time in the first week of December. Some local Iranian authorities have suspected that Bitcoin‚Äôs surge in price and attention to crypto developments in the US may have a hand in the capital‚Äôs frequent power outages. Residents And Local Industries Suffer From Power Outages The increasing strain on the country‚Äôs power grid has caught the attention of policymakers. According to Mostafa Rajabi, CEO of the government-owned power firm, some opportunistic individuals took advantage of the country‚Äôs subsidized electricity and other resources for crypto mining activities without authorization. Power outages are common in Iran, reflecting its failure to sustain the growing demands and the aging power equipment at its plants. Last summer, industrial parks near the capital city were hit with power outages. Then, in October and November, Tehran‚Äôs neighborhoods were hit with power outages. Iran‚Äôs Pezeshkian Calls For Accountability Facing regular power outages, Iran‚Äôs President Masoud Pezeshkian has instructed some plants to stop using mazut, a high-polluting fuel popular among Soviet countries. Iran has approved the use of this fuel in the past to address the power shortage. Pezeshkian also admitted that it‚Äôs time to offer the public a fair and transparent assessment of the current situation. Currently, electricity in this country is largely subsidized, which helped spur the growth of crypto mining. These Bitcoin mining facilities need large amounts of power, which drain the country‚Äôs reserves. According to Masih Alavi, CEO of Viraminer, it‚Äôs challenging for the government to identify how much power unauthorized mining facilities consume. He added that these miners use VPNs and rent apartments to hide their rigs from public view. Alavi said that these operators distribute the rigs across several flats, making it difficult for authorities to track them.

In a new report detailing its predictions for 2025, VanEck analysts say decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes will capture a fifth of centralized exchange (CEX) spot trading volumes. ‚ÄúDespite record-high decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volumes, both in absolute terms and relative to centralized exchanges (CEXs), decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL) remains 24% below its peak. We anticipate that DEX trading volumes will surpass $4 trillion in 2025, capturing 20% of CEX spot trading volumes, driven by the proliferation of AI (artificial intelligence)-related tokens and new consumer-facing DApps (decentralized apps). Additionally, the influx of tokenized securities and high-value assets will catalyze DeFi growth, providing fresh liquidity and broader utility. As a result, we project DeFi TVL to rebound to over $200 billion by year-end, reflecting the rising demand for decentralized financial infrastructure in an evolving digital economy.‚Äù The analysts also forecast that the broader crypto bull market will persist through 2025, with a correction beginning sometime in the first quarter. Once the correction is finished, VanEck has bullish price targets for some of the top crypto assets by market cap. ‚ÄúWe believe the crypto bull market will persist through 2025, reaching its first peak in the first quarter. At the cycle‚Äôs apex, we project Bitcoin (BTC) to be valued at around $180,000, with Ethereum (ETH) trading above $6,000. Other prominent projects, such as Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI), could exceed $500 and $10, respectively. Following this first peak, we anticipate a 30% retracement in BTC, with altcoins facing sharper declines of up to 60% as the market consolidates during the summer. However, a recovery is likely in the fall, with major tokens regaining momentum and reclaiming previous all-time highs by the end of the year.‚Äù The full VanEck report can be read here .

Alongside the report release, Robinhood Crypto is celebrating the first anniversary of launching a digital asset trading division in Europe. Robinhood Releases End of Year Report According to the report , Robinhood Crypto recorded a notional trading volume of $119 billion and $38 billion in crypto assets under custody as of November 2024. The entity said 2024 was an important year for its business because of the milestones it achieved. Robinhood Crypto expanded its services in the United States by achieving full coverage in 50 states and territories, including Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The company increased the number of available cryptocurrencies in the U.S. to 20 by adding new assets like Solana (SOL), Pepe (PEPE), and dogwifhat (WIF). It also launched a new trading application programming interface for its U.S. users, offering tools to view market data, manage portfolios, and place advanced orders. In Europe, Robinhood added 14 new coins for local customers, bringing the number of supported assets to 40. The firm also launched SOL and ether (ETH) staking for its European users. Regulatory Challenges Furthermore, Robinhood‚Äôs crypto wallet saw notable developments. The crypto firm launched the wallet on Android and introduced advanced swapping features across several Ethereum-based networks, including Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and Base. The company also redesigned its token discovery tab, making it easier for users to find and manage their assets. It is worth mentioning that Robinhood‚Äôs 2024 experience was not without challenges. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) slapped the entity with a Wells Notice in May, indicating a threat of legal action over the firm‚Äôs securities law violations. While the SEC has yet to file the lawsuit, Robinhood‚Äôs crypto business has performed well for the year. Johann Kerbrat, vice president and general manager of Robinhood Crypto, said: ‚Äú2024 marked a significant year for the cryptocurrency landscape and recent developments suggest that 2025 is poised to be an even more transformative year, with broader adoption anticipated across the industry.‚Äù The post Robinhood Recorded $119B in Crypto Notional Trading Volume This Year: Report appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Robinhood|United States,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-15 08:04:58

The company focuses on its current products rather than exploring new cryptocurrency ETFs. BlackRock Prioritizes Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently shared updates, citing Jay Jacobs, the head of BlackRock‚Äôs ETF division. Jacobs clarified that the firm‚Äôs immediate focus is on expanding the reach of its Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, which are still in the early stages of adoption among their client base. As such, BlackRock has no intention of launching new ETFs for XRP or other altcoins soon. Chinese cryptocurrency journalist Colin Wu also weighed in , reminding the community of the broader regulatory context in the U.S. He noted that while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may approve ETFs for altcoins like XRP and SOL by the end of next year, BlackRock remains committed to its current offerings. Rumors and Recent Developments Earlier in November, there were rumors regarding BlackRock‚Äôs interest in an XRP ETF after a false filing surfaced. This filing, labeled as a request to establish an iShares XRP Trust, was quickly debunked by BlackRock, which confirmed it had no association with the document. In contrast, other asset managers have moved forward with legitimate filings for XRP-focused ETFs. For instance, WisdomTree applied for a spot XRP ETF in late November. Other firms, such as Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary Capital, have also filed for XRP ETFs throughout the year, signaling a growing interest in the token as an investment vehicle.

Whale Alert, a prominent cryptocurrency tracker, reported a transaction involving 99 million XRP (approximately $234 million) transferred between two anonymous wallets. Data from Bithomp revealed that the sender of this transaction was a wallet associated with Ripple, while the recipient was the U.S.-based BitGo platform, known for providing custodial services to financial institutions. These movements follow two earlier transactions reported by Bithomp, in which Ripple transferred 380 million XRP and 200 million XRP‚Äîvalued at a combined $1.5 billion in fiat. Despite these transfers, the token has shown resilience in the market. Over the past week, its value has increased by approximately 2.8%, and the token is currently trading at $2.49 While regulatory developments could pave the way for ETFs in the future, BlackRock‚Äôs decision to focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum reflects its current strategic priorities. At the same time, significant whale activity and Ripple‚Äôs involvement in large transactions suggest continued interest in the asset, which could influence its future adoption and market performance.

With countless options vying for investor interest, three cryptocurrencies are shaping up as standout contenders. While Monero and Kaspa are grabbing headlines for their unique attributes, Qukbetics ($TICS) is creating a buzz as one of the best altcoins to join in December 2024. Qubetics, with its groundbreaking Web3 vision, is catching the eye of early adopters and seasoned investors alike. The ongoing presale draws unparalleled interest, offering a rare chance to get in before its ecosystem redefines decentralised solutions. This article delves into the latest developments of all three coins: Qubetics, Monero, and Kaspa. Qubetics: Redefining Privacy with dVPN Innovation What if your internet browsing were not only secure but also truly decentralised? Qubetics ($TICS) has turned this vision into reality with its decentralised VPN (dVPN) service . Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on centralised systems, Qubetics leverages blockchain technology to offer unmatched privacy, transparency, and freedom. Imagine browsing the internet without fear of censorship or data tracking‚Äîthis is precisely what Qubetics delivers. Key to its innovation is the peer-to-peer architecture, which eliminates the vulnerabilities of centralised systems. In this ecosystem, users share bandwidth and earn $TICS tokens, creating a self-sustaining network that encourages active participation. Multi-hop routing and encryption further ensure that your online presence remains anonymous and your data is protected. Adding to the excitement, Qubetics recently hosted a live AMA session , offering its community an opportunity to connect with the team and gain insights into its ambitious roadmap. These developments position Qubetics as the best altcoin to join in December 2024, promising transformative solutions for Web3 enthusiasts. Monero: The Pioneer of Privacy Coins Monero has long been recognised as a leading privacy-focused cryptocurrency. By prioritising user anonymity through stealth addresses and ring signatures, it offers unparalleled transaction security. This makes it a favourite among those who value confidentiality in their financial dealings. With no public transaction history, Monero remains a reliable choice for privacy advocates seeking a dependable crypto asset. Kaspa: Lightning-Fast Transactions with Layer-1 Innovation Kaspa is making waves for its ultra-fast transaction capabilities. As a Layer-1 cryptocurrency, it combines security and scalability without compromising on speed. Its efficient architecture allows for near-instantaneous confirmations, catering to a growing need for seamless transactions in the crypto world. For users and developers alike, Kaspa‚Äôs focus on speed and reliability positions it as a contender worth watching in the blockchain ecosystem. The Qubetics Presale Is Live: Why It‚Äôs the Best Altcoin to Join in December 2024 The Qubetics presale is currently in Phase 12, and the numbers speak volumes about this project‚Äôs enthusiasm. With a token price of $0.031 and over $6 million already raised, the momentum is building rapidly. Each week brings a 10% price increase, culminating in a final phase that promises a 20% hike. For those contemplating their next crypto move, this is a moment not to miss. With a post-presale target of $0.25 per token, the return potential for early investors is striking. The structured phases build excitement and reward those who act promptly. If you‚Äôre searching for the best altcoin to join in December 2024 , Qubetics offers an unmissable opportunity with its impressive ROI potential. Conclusion: Why Qubetics Stands Out Among Top Altcoins As 2024 draws to a close, analysts closely watch projects like Qubetics, Monero, and Kaspa for their potential to redefine the crypto landscape. Monero remains the go-to for privacy-conscious users, while Kaspa‚Äôs speed-focused approach addresses scalability challenges. However, Qubetics ($TICS) stands apart with its innovative decentralised VPN, which aligns perfectly with the future of Web3. The ongoing presale offers a rare window of opportunity, with prices poised to soar in the final stages.

While investors continue speculating on the asset‚Äôs next movement, the recent development of a new support region hints at a continued upward trajectory.

ETH Bulls Form Strong Support At $3,700 ‚Äì $3,810 In an X post on December 14, crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed the formation of a critical support zone in the Ethereum market. Based on data from IntoTheBlock, Martinez shares that 3 million distinct wallets acquired 4.6 million ETH, valued at $17.6 billion, at prices between $3,700-$3,810 with an average market price of $3,751. Such high level of accumulation activity identifies this price range as a significant zone of investor interest. Importantly, this heightened buying pressure converts $3,700-$3,810 to a vital support zone as market bulls will be compelled to defend this price range in the case of a price decline. Furthermore, despite Ethereum‚Äôs struggle to make any meaningful breakout past $4,000 so far, investors purchasing massive amounts of ETH at high price levels indicates market confidence in the asset‚Äôs ability to move past the presented resistance and sustain its price growth. However, it is worth noting that Ethereum losing this support zone due to an overwhelming bearish sentiment will result in immediate substantial losses that can induce a further price decline. If this market scenario occurs, ETH could slide as low as $3,565, with the next available support level being $3,303.

In a recent X post, Santiment states that an average of 130,200 new addresses are being created on the Ethereum network each day in December ‚Äì the highest ever since April. This rise in new wallets suggests an influx of retail and institutional investors as evidenced by multiple developments including Ethereum‚Äôs price performance in Q4 2024, a booming DeFi ecosystem as well as the recent bullish performance of the spot Ethereum ETFs. In terms of implications, this rapid network growth can boost network activity, transaction volume, and ETH demand thereby resulting in a further price increase. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3,885 with a decline of 0.99% in the past day. Albeit, this loss only underscores the turbulent past trading week where Ethereum dipped by a cumulative 2.75%.

Namely, they lost almost $2 billion as many altcoins dipped. Cardano (ADA) also decreased in price. So, Cardano investors also lost money. NEIRO was also caught up. However, experts say that both ADA and NEIRO will bounce back. On the other hand, FXGuys ($FXG) has been doing really well. This new crypto trading platform is still in its public presale. It didn‚Äôt suffer during the recent dip. Instead, many invested in the FXGuys presale. With that in mind, experts say that FXGuys will outperform NEIRO and Cardano soon! >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE NEIRO‚Äôs Price Is Down Amid a Market-Wide Sell-Off NEIRO also got swept up by the market-wide dip. A month ago, NEIRO‚Äôs price was nearly at $0.003. Now, NEIRO‚Äôs price is at $0.0016 . So, the decrease that NEIRO had in price was quite steep. At first, the dip in NEIRO‚Äôs price happened because of investors taking profits. However, NEIRO‚Äôs price dip got bigger due to the recent market-wide sell-offs. That‚Äôs why NEIRO‚Äôs price is at these levels now. Luckily, experts say that this isn‚Äôt that bad. They say that it‚Äôs normal for decreases to happen after large rallies. So, NEIRO and other coins are just balancing out after the recent post-US elections run. With that in mind, experts say that NEIRO will bounce back soon. They say this because NEIRO is still very popular. Also, it has a strong community. So, they say that NEIRO‚Äôs price can go back to $0.003 soon! ADA‚Äôs Price Dropped Below $1 During the Bearish Wave Cardano was another victim of the market-wide dip. During it, ADA‚Äôs price went below $1. Namely, ADA‚Äôs price dropped to around $0.90. However, it recovered quickly. Right now, Cardano‚Äôs price is at $1.08 . This is a great sign for Cardano. It shows that there‚Äôs a lot of interest in it right now. It also shows that Cardano investors are confident. A popular analyst agrees with this statement. Namely, Ali Martinez recently stated that ADA will bounce back soon. He said that Cardano is doing the same as it was in 2020. So, he sees ADA‚Äôs price going to $4-$6 in 2025! This would be an increase of up to 455% for ADA. FXGuys Is the New Crypto Trading Platform Everyone Is Talking About FXGuys is a new crypto trading platform that has taken the market by storm. During the dip, FXGuys did really well.

Table of Contents Institutional buying drives Bitcoin off exchanges PCHAIN: A real estate altcoin gearing for 40,000% gains Bitcoin vs PCHAIN: Conclusion Bitcoin is comfortably trading above $100K. BTC could surge higher as President-elect Donald Trump says the U.S. will do something great with crypto. This has prompted investors to flock to a new, promising real estate altcoin. PropiChain (PCHAIN) is a real estate tokenization platform. PropiChain is regarded as an undervalued gem with massive upside potential. This is because it has a price of $0.011 in the second round of its token presale . This is very close to its lowest-ever price. Currently priced at just $0.004 during its ongoing token presale, PCHAIN is seen as an undervalued gem. PropiChain uses blockchain, AI, and the metaverse to transform the real estate sector. Experts predict that PCHAIN could see an extraordinary 40,000% increase in value. Will PropiChain be the next altcoin to explode, or will Bitcoin continue to dominate the market? You might also like: XRP price to rally 24,544% as PropiChain doubles these gains, expert forecasts Institutional buying drives Bitcoin off exchanges Data reveals a significant surge in Bitcoin transactions exceeding $10 million. This has the hallmarks of strong institutional buying. A large portion of these transactions has been traced to Coinbase. Since the U.S. elections, around 200,000 BTC have exited exchanges, leaving just 2.8 million BTC on platforms. This marks the lowest amount in seven years, signaling increased long-term Bitcoin holding by investors. Bitcoin is comfortably trading at $101.509. After an explosive rally, Bitcoin gained 16.3% in the past 30 days. BTC is predicted to reach $180,000 by the end of 2025, signaling the cycle top. PCHAIN: A real estate altcoin gearing for 40,000% gains PropiChain is primed for substantial growth, with experts predicting a 40,000% increase. The altcoin‚Äôs potential during its presale is equally remarkable, possibly rising by 800%. So far, the real estate altcoin has raided more than $1 million in its presale. The presale has progressed from the first round to the second, earning early investors 200% gains. At just $0.011, PCHAIN offers an ideal entry point for investors looking for life-changing gains in 2025. The real estate altcoin has a compelling value proposition.

It also reduces negotiation time as the price is data-driven. PropiChain‚Äôs use of the metaverse offers immersive virtual property tours, allowing investors to explore properties remotely. This boosts market access and investment potential. Bitcoin vs PCHAIN: Bitcoin is currently trading at around $100K. Analysts are predicting it could rise to $180,000 at the peak of this cycle.

Some Bitcoin holders are diversifying into the real estate altcoin to maximize future gains. Conclusion PropiChain has solidified its position as a leading real estate altcoin to hold. It is predicted to surge by 40,000% in 2025. The RWA altcoin has gained investors‚Äô trust after its listing on CoinMarketCap. Moreover, it was exposed to a wider audience.

Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve (TRUMPRES), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRES is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve could become the next viral memecoin. Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve by entering its contract address ‚Äì 2GxwMgJnqbDuDec9gMVNfN2n8eVf7ks1EUv1RZSCLNm1 ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRES.

The influx of new crypto users and growing adoption has spurred the market to new levels. Like other assets, stablecoins soared based on utility to institutional and retail investors this year. A new market report shows the USDT transfer volume on Tron reached new highs in the last 30 days. The network recorded $587.2 billion in USDT transfer volumes last month. This jump added to the growth seen in previous months following the wider market rebound. Before this month, October and September tapped $489.3 billion and $424.4 billion, respectively. ‚Äú Stablecoins have seen remarkable growth, driven by strong interest in cryptocurrencies over recent months. TRON has emerged as the leading blockchain for stablecoin transfers. This chart highlights the monthly USDT transfer volumes. In November 2024, USDT transfers hit an all-time high of $587.2B, marking a significant increase compared to previous months. The growth of stablecoins continues to rise.‚Äù Stablecoin Adoption Soars The last 12 months have seen increased stablecoin adoption globally, with users pushing toward cross-border payments. While settlement and global transactions were key factors in the growth of stablecoins, institutional investors boosted all metrics. Most stablecoins are pegged to the US dollar, giving investors confidence, unlike other volatile crypto assets. As gateway assets, stablecoins help onboard new entrants to the market, offering stability. Most platforms offer withdrawals and other benefits in stablecoins. The market benefited from the huge inflows, and stablecoins have become integrated into decentralized applications and as a way for investors to measure gains. Macroeconomic trends have pushed several consumers to web3, with users holders converting assets to stablecoins, adding to the growing volume. This month, the market cap of stablecoins moved past the $200 billion mark for the first time on the back of yield generation and payment factors. Tron (TRX) Records Sharp Growth Users traded stablecoin across Tron due to cost efficiency compared to other popular networks. These inflows have positively affected TRX‚Äôs general market performance. The asset gained over 160% in the last 12 months, notching huge gains after the U.S. elections in November. The asset‚Äôs market cap inched close to $39 billion due to the price rally that followed Justin Sun‚Äôs investment in Donald Trump‚Äôs World Liberty Finance.",Cryptocurrency|News|Tron News|USDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|TRX|USDT,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-15 08:49:06

Table of Contents Imminent Avalanche upgrade drives record trade volume Tron‚Äôs price action begins to settle after week of volatile trading Rollblock: top altcoins with next generation crypto gambling and unique tokenomics Avalanche (AVAX) and Tron (TRX) are two of the most widely traded tokens right now. However, experts are focusing on the top altcoin in the crypto gambling sector for the biggest possible gains. Crypto casino Rollblock (RBLK) has incorporated innovative tokenomics that could lead to growth in excess of 1,000x in 2025. With only a few weeks remaining in Rollblock‚Äôs crypto presale, experts are warning that there is little time left to get in before it explodes higher. Imminent Avalanche upgrade drives record trade volume The rapid rise in the Avalanche price comes as this top altcoin is dominating the headlines. Avalanche is up 5% today on its imminent upgrade and recent private funding. The highly anticipated Avalanche 9000 upgrade will launch on the 16th of December. Avalanche also recently announced $250 million in private funding from Galaxy Digital and Dragonfly to support this upgrade. However, expert forecasts only see another 10% to 20% increase for the Avalanche price in 2025. You might also like: Cardano reaches $1 but experts believe Pepe Unchained and Rollblock have more potential Tron‚Äôs price action begins to settle after week of volatile trading Tron continues to see a flurry of trading activity after a week of highly volatile price action. Tron‚Äôs price saw over 3% losses so far today as traders tried to time the bottom of its week-long round trip. This volatile Tron price action started last week when a declaration of martial law in South Korea sent investors fleeing from its exchanges. Tron‚Äôs numerous DEXs were the obvious destination, which sent its price soaring 100% in a matter of hours. Experts are noting that this volatile price action for Tron is mostly over now, with the price settling about 50% above its position before the initial surge. Rollblock: top altcoins with next generation crypto gambling and unique tokenomics With Tron‚Äôs and Avalanche‚Äôs rallies already nearing their peaks, experts are recommending Rollblock‚Äôs crypto presale instead. Rollblock is now the unchallenged top altcoin in the crypto gambling sector, which means that it is set to take a lion‚Äôs share of the $500 billion in revenue generated by this industry each year. The key to Rollblock ‚Äôs success is its unique take on tokenomics. Rollblock‚Äôs tokenomics is designed to drive massive player growth by generating value and income through its gambling tokens. This system is powered by weekly buybacks that employ a share of the casino‚Äôs own revenue. Weekly burn events are used to generate value for RBLK. Income is also generated by using the remaining buybacks as high-APY rewards for staking on Rollblock‚Äôs platform. This approach to driving player growth through unique tokenomics is built on a foundation of next-generation crypto gambling.

Experts believe this is the start of the mega bull run, which usually lasts 1.5-2 years and presents opportunities in the market to create positions that can make six-figure returns. Ripple (XRP) is one of the large coins that has delivered tremendous returns; even in this bull market, it has performed exceptionally well. Even though the XRP price had significant momentum last month, it has already seen its largest upswing. To capitalize on this bull run, emerging opportunities like DTX Exchange (DTX) are better investment options than large-caps like Ripple. Ripple (XRP) Trades In Pennant Pattern, Eyes ATH Recent political events in the US have boosted the XRP price, sending it near its all-time high of 2018. Still, the regulatory challenges from the SEC have not been entirely resolved, but the resignation of SEC chairman Gary Gensler is positive news for Ripple investors. The XRP price has surged 262% in the last 30 days, which shows its high demand amid the bull market. Currently, the XRP price is trading in a triangle pennant pattern, which is generally the continuation pattern of the previous trend. This pattern‚Äôs upper resistance is at $2.50, the local major barrier. A breakout from this pattern could push the XRP price to uncharted territory. The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) recently approved Ripple‚Äôs RLUSD stablecoin for listing, bringing more positive news for the XRP price. This decision boosts Ripple‚Äôs role in the digital payments sector and marks an important step forward for the XRP Ledger (XRPL) Ripple ecosystem. For the XRP price to reach the much-anticipated ATH price breakout, consistent spikes in trading volume with price increases are important. DTX Exchange Presale Outpacing Crypto Giants DTX Exchange, a solid player in the DeFi market, has dominated the crypto market since the launch of its presale. Last week, with the $10 million milestone, it became the fastest presale to achieve the feat. According to crypto price analysts, DTX Exchange‚Äôs growth potential parallels Ripple‚Äôs price trajectory, making it a big competitor of the top altcoins. DTX Exchange has experienced high demand from investors because of its revolutionary offerings. This trading exchange introduces the first platform that combines the features of centralized and decentralized exchanges. Investors can access 120,000 instruments along with exceptional 1,000X leverage. This diverse investment availability and the benefit of increasing profit give the DTX Exchange center stage. The VulcanX blockchain, specifically designed to bring traditional assets to the Web3 platform, enables the exchange‚Äôs hybrid nature. This blockchain is also responsible for reducing fees and increasing exchange speed. The blockchain‚Äôs testnet has already been launched, achieving a speed of 100,000 transactions per second, one of the highest in the industry. The DTX token is currently priced at $0.12, which projects a quick 300% upside potential before 2025 starts. Key Takeaways DTX Exchange presents a promising opportunity for investors eyeing transformative gains. Its innovative trading approach, hybrid blockchain, and strong growth potential position it to disrupt the market, making it a solid contender against major players like Ripple. DTX Exchange has quickly gained attention as a top choice for profit-driven investors. With its advanced technology and the buzz surrounding its listing, DTX stands out as an investment capable of delivering impressive six-figure returns.

According to the firm, this optimism could pave the way for a market decline that could provide a better entry point for new investments. Alphractal noted the historical correlation between market sentiment and Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements. ‚ÄúNegative sentiment on Twitter and news sites has often coincided with local price bottoms, particularly for Bitcoin,‚Äù the firm said. Sentiment analysis algorithms track and classify public sentiment as negative, neutral, or positive. When negative sentiment prevails, Bitcoin‚Äôs price often buck the trend and hit a local bottom before recovering, Alphractal explained. ‚ÄúThis shift leaves many traders anxious and skeptical as prices begin to rise again,‚Äù the company added. Related News: Former Thai Prime Minister Announces Bitcoin Price Prediction, Calls for BTC in His Country The report also highlighted SUI, a layer-1 blockchain token, as it faces high risk in both the short and long term. Alphractal suggested that a correction, potentially driven by liquidation patterns, is the most likely outcome. According to the firm‚Äôs analysis of 7-day aggregated liquidation levels, the price of SUI could rise to $5 to liquidate remaining bear positions. Furthermore, the 30-day liquidation levels are weighing on the asset, indicating an increasing probability of a long liquidation in the near future. *This is not investment advice.

Cardano (ADA) whales accumulate more coins and buy the dip to increase their holdings. These whales, whose wallets contain between 100 million and one billion ADA coins, bought more than 100 million ADA worth $110 million over the past few days, based on the data of Santiment shared by analyst Ali Martinez. Their cumulative holdings now stand at 3.26 billion ADA, suggesting a bullish outlook for the asset despite recent price corrections. ADA is trading at $1.06, down 4.16% in the last 24 hours. Whales Buying Big During ADA Dips Recent trends indicate that there is a deliberate plan among ADA whales. When Cardano temporarily pulled back from the $1 mark again, the whales took advantage of the situation to purchase even more. This pattern is similar to their action in November when ADA traded between $0.50 and $0.60. Whales bought tokens aggressively, followed by a cutback once the price spiked to $0.70 and $0.80. While the selling during pumps is notable, their net holdings continue to grow, reflecting an overall bullish stance. Over the past month, these investors have significantly increased their positions, capitalizing on market fluctuations. Whale holdings increased from October 18th to November 18th by 145%, reaching $12.11 Billion. ADA holders with more than $10 million increased this figure, while wallets with a $1-10 million balance increased 83% to $3.9 billion. Wallets with ADA ranging between $100,000 to $1 million also increased by 106% to $4.36 billion. On the other hand, the impact was less severe among retail investors who cut down their exposure by 39%, with only $285,490 invested. ADA holders with $10K ‚Äì $100K also sold assets while reducing their holdings by 7.65%. Signals for a Potential Rally Whales‚Äô buying activity often signals potential price momentum. The current accumulation trend hints at a possible continuation of ADA‚Äôs bullish rally in the coming days. Cardano may see increased market confidence as their holdings expand, driving prices higher before another correction. Cardano‚Äôs price movements and whale activity underscore a clear strategy: buy the dips and profit from the pumps. With whales dominating accumulation and retail investors stepping back, ADA‚Äôs market dynamics could favor further upward momentum. For now, the eyes are on Cardano as it navigates its next move.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-15 09:05:42

Addressing an audience at the Intercontinental Hotel in Hua Hin, Shinawatra underscored the growing prominence of digital assets in the international economic landscape. ‚ÄúThere are already many cryptocurrencies. Some people say that in the future, we will have more currencies than countries. Today, Thai people must think and understand this,‚Äù Shinawatra stated, urging the nation to view cryptocurrencies as a crucial part of the evolving global economy. Shinawatra also highlighted geopolitical shifts, pointing to the potential implications of the Trump administration‚Äôs trade tariffs and discussions about using Bitcoin to manage national debt. While not advocating for Thailand to purchase cryptocurrencies, he stressed the importance of proactive exploration and regulatory experimentation in this domain. Thailand Already Advancing Crypto Adoption Thailand‚Äôs Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has already taken significant steps toward fostering digital asset innovation. In August 2024, the SEC introduced a crypto regulatory sandbox, allowing selected service providers to test financial technologies in a controlled and supportive environment. This initiative reflects the nation‚Äôs willingness to experiment with blockchain and crypto applications. The Pheu Thai political party has also utilized digital cash distribution as an economic stimulus strategy. In July 2024, 45 million Thai residents received 10,000 baht (approximately $280) each as part of a campaign promise. This initiative demonstrated the potential of integrating digital solutions into national economic policy. Kasikornbank, the country‚Äôs second-largest bank, further became Thailand‚Äôs first licensed crypto custodian in September 2024. Its services are aimed at enabling digital asset businesses to manage their holdings securely, signaling an institutional shift toward crypto adoption. Building Bridges with Global Crypto Leaders In October 2024, Thailand‚Äôs Bank of Thailand partnered with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Project Ensemble to test tokenized cross-border settlements. This collaboration underscores Thailand‚Äôs intention to position itself as a leader in digital finance by leveraging global partnerships. As the Thai SEC explores new regulations to grant mutual and private funds access to cryptocurrencies, the nation is edging closer to institutional crypto adoption. With calls for deeper exploration and strategic regulatory moves, Thailand seems poised to balance innovation with security, shaping its role in the global digital economy.

After a lightning-fast presale that raised an impressive $7 million and drew in nearly 20,000 investors, CYBRO is now gearing up for its listing on Gate.io and other major exchanges ‚Äî and it‚Äôs happening on December 14th. During the presale, $CYBRO‚Äôs price surged 450% from $0.01 to $0.055 in its final stage. Now, with the token set to list at $0.06 on major exchanges, demand is through the roof. Many are predicting a 100x price surge once it hits the open market, thanks to the strong momentum and solid fundamentals backing the project.

With the listing just around the corner, $CYBRO is about to make its mark on major exchanges with all the momentum it‚Äôs built so far, this token looks ready to take off. Seize the Chance to Get in Early Before Demand for $CYBRO Skyrockets Cardano (ADA): A Sustainable and Scalable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a blockchain platform built for smart contracts. It enables developers to create decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, allows users to store value, make payments, and stake on the network. Cardano uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is more energy-efficient than the proof-of-work model. The blockchain is divided into two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contracts. This design enhances its ability to process transactions, potentially handling up to 1 million transactions per second. Cardano‚Äôs native tokens offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts, improving blockchain efficiency and scalability. Kaspa Explores GHOSTDAG in Proof-of-Work Cryptocurrency Kaspa is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that uses the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains, it allows parallel blocks to coexist and orders them in consensus. This means more blocks can be processed at the same time. Kaspa‚Äôs blockchain is a blockDAG, which helps maintain high block rates. Currently, it processes 1 block per second and aims for higher. The confirmation times are very short, mainly limited by internet speed. Kaspa has features like Reachability to check the network‚Äôs structure, Block data pruning to save space, and SPV proofs. Sui: A New Layer-1 Blockchain Focused on Scalability and User Experience Sui is a new layer-1 blockchain platform designed to meet global adoption needs. It offers a secure, powerful, and scalable development platform. Sui uses an object-centric data model and the Move programming language to address inefficiencies in existing blockchains. It prioritizes user experience by removing common barriers in blockchain interactions. Through features like zkLogin, sponsored transactions, and programmable transaction blocks, Sui aims to make Web3 applications more accessible and user-friendly. Stellar Lumens (XLM): Connecting the World‚Äôs Financial Systems Stellar Lumens (XLM) is a cryptocurrency that powers the Stellar network, a decentralized platform for global payments. It allows users to transfer funds quickly and at low cost, regardless of the currency. Stellar supports transfers of any type of currency, including digital versions of national currencies and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The network aims to improve existing financial systems by connecting them on a single platform. Individuals can send money worldwide using Stellar applications. Businesses can build blockchain apps or use the network for payments and currency exchanges. Backed by the Stellar Development Foundation, which maintains the network and fosters community engagement, Stellar offers a way to enhance how money moves across the globe. Conclusion While ADA, KAS, SUI, and XLM show promise for significant growth by December 2024, their short-term potential is limited. In contrast, CYBRO offers immediate opportunities for investors to maximize earnings. As a technologically advanced DeFi platform on the Blast blockchain, CYBRO provides AI-powered yield aggregation. Investors benefit from lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. The platform ensures a superior user experience with seamless deposits and withdrawals. With a strong focus on transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO stands out as a promising project. Its appeal is evident in the strong interest from crypto whales and influencers.

Musk Loves USA (MUSKUSA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Loves USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.

The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.
