Saifedean Ammous explains,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/why-bitcoin-is-superior-to-gold-in-every-way/,"American economist Saifedean Ammous argues that Bitcoin is superior to gold because it has a fixed supply, is digital, and is not controlled by governments, making it a better store of value and a solution to inflation and debt issues in today‚Äôs financial systems. Ammous, author of The Bitcoin Standard , argues in a recent interview that Bitcoin is superior to gold. He believes Bitcoin is a revolutionary form of money. Its fixed supply and decentralized nature make it more reliable than gold. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what #Bitcoin fixes. If we go back to having a HARD money where money is no longer debt, we no longer need to be monetizing debt. We no longer need to get everyone to become a debt slave in order for us to have a form of money.‚Äù ‚Äì @saifedean w/ @JoeSquawk üéØ pic.twitter.com/Tb3HLT2n4o ‚Äî Walker‚ö°Ô∏è (@WalkerAmerica) December 13, 2024 Bitcoin vs. gold Ammous explains that while gold has historically been used as money due to its scarcity and store of value properties, Bitcoin has taken these qualities to a new level. ‚ÄúGold has been used for 4,000 years because it stores value well. But the problem with Gold is that it‚Äôs not as scarce as Bitcoin,‚Äù Ammous states. ‚ÄúThe annual increase in gold supply is around 1.5% to 2%, whereas Bitcoin‚Äôs supply is capped at 21 million, and its annual supply growth rate is even lower‚Äîabout 0.8% during its current four-year period,‚Äù he added. On e of the advantages Bitcoin has over gold is its fixed supply, which is set in stone. ‚Äú There‚Äôs only ever going to be 21 million Bitcoin. That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs a simple fact, and no other form of money can claim such a property,‚Äù Ammous continues. This scarcity makes Bitcoin a somewhat deflationary asset, unlike fiat currencies that governments can print in unlimited quantities. Am mous believes this unique property makes Bitcoin a much stronger store of value compared to gold or any government-issued currency. Another key difference is how Bitcoin operates. While gold relies on physical storage and transport, Bitcoin is purely digital, meaning it can be transferred and stored globally without needing physical handling. ‚ÄúBitcoin is just software. It doesn‚Äôt require a legal framework that is tied to government-backed currencies. It‚Äôs decentralized and automated,‚Äù Ammous points out. He contrasts this with fiat money, which is deeply intertwined with government control and monetary policy. Why Bitcoin is the future of money Ammous also highlights the importance of Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to prevent inflation. Unlike fiat currencies, which lose value over time as central banks print more money, Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply makes it impervious to inflationary pressures. ‚ÄúIn the world of fiat, governments continuously increase the supply of money, which leads to a decrease in its value,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúIn the case of Bitcoin, no one can just print more. It‚Äôs a money that cannot be inflated.‚Äù Ammous stresses the issue of debt in today‚Äôs financial systems. ‚ÄúFiat money is built on the concept of debt. Every time the government needs more money, they increase the currency supply, essentially creating more debt,‚Äù he states. This creates a cycle of borrowing and inflation that benefits the government but harms everyday citizens who watch their savings lose value. In contrast, Bitcoin provides a way out of this system. ‚ÄúWith Bitcoin, you don‚Äôt need to be in debt to participate in the economy. It‚Äôs a form of money that doesn‚Äôt require borrowing or printing,‚Äù he says. The economist believes that Bitcoin‚Äôs technological advantages and fixed supply make it the ideal money for the modern age. ‚ÄúB itcoin is a form of money that is more scarce, portable, and secure than gold,‚Äù he concludes. ‚ÄúIt offers a solution to the problems caused by fiat currencies and offers a future where money is no longer tied to government debt and manipulation.‚Äù With more people realizing Bitcoin‚Äôs revolutionary potential, its value continues to rise as a monetary asset that will outlast and outperform gold in the coming years.

In a recent statement, Morehead outlined the advantages of Bitcoin over traditional reserve assets and highlighted its potential role in US economic policy. Morehead began his remarks by addressing the US‚Äôs dependence on gold as a reserve asset. ‚ÄúThe United States stores $600 billion worth of gold,‚Äù Morehead said, adding that this amount is equivalent to 11 million years of American wages. Despite its historical importance, Morehead argued that gold is becoming obsolete as a reserve asset in the digital age. Turning to Bitcoin, Morehead described it as a ‚Äúmuch better‚Äù store of value than gold. He noted that Bitcoin‚Äôs digital nature, rarity and global accessibility make it a more efficient and forward-looking reserve asset. ‚ÄúGo to digital gold, go to Bitcoin, it‚Äôs much better,‚Äù he said. Related News: Donald Trump's Altcoin Portfolio Has Major Shifts - Here's the Latest After the Volatility Morehead also explained that the US currently owns about 1% of the world‚Äôs Bitcoin supply, which he believes is both a strategic and rational position. ‚ÄúKeep it, increase it,‚Äù Morehead advised, adding that it would be a positive policy decision for the US to expand its Bitcoin holdings. He also noted that other countries have already started owning Bitcoin, indicating that the US should take the lead in adopting BTC as part of its reserve strategy. *This is not investment advice.

Homo Shiba Inu (HOMOSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address ‚Äì 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOSHIB.

This growth reflects broader market bullishness and increased institutional interest in Bitcoin as a financial asset. Key drivers include MicroStrategy‚Äôs inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 and global discussions on national Bitcoin reserves. Moreover, Japan is considering creating a national Bitcoin reserve, signaling that countries are starting to see Bitcoin as an important financial asset. This recognition could increase demand for Bitcoin and strengthen its role in global financial strategies, further supporting its price growth. National BTC Reserves: A Global Push Underpin Bitcoin Price A notable development comes from Japan, where lawmaker Satoshi Hamada has proposed establishing a national Bitcoin reserve. Submitted to Japan‚Äôs National Diet on December 11, this initiative aims to position Bitcoin as a strategic financial asset.

Tamaki has previously advocated for crypto-friendly tax reforms and regulatory improvements, signaling a potential shift in Japan‚Äôs stance on Bitcoin. #„É°„Çø„Éó„É©„Éç„ÉÉ„Éà #metaplanet @Metaplanet_JP #BTC Japanese lawmaker asks government yo create national bitcoin reserve pic.twitter.com/YfTHp1eJgt ‚Äî meow (@foorpfokrow) December 13, 2024 Globally, other nations are also exploring similar initiatives.

Brazil and Poland have introduced similar legislative efforts. These moves signal Bitcoin‚Äôs growing recognition as a strategic asset, driving demand and enhancing investor confidence. MicroStrategy‚Äôs Nasdaq-100 Inclusion and Implications MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, will join the Nasdaq-100 on December 23, becoming the first Bitcoin-focused company in this elite index. This milestone aligns MicroStrategy with major firms like Apple and Tesla, increasing Bitcoin‚Äôs visibility among institutional investors.

MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin strategy, led by Michael Saylor, has positioned the company as a key advocate for Bitcoin adoption. The firm holds $42 billion worth of Bitcoin, and its Nasdaq-100 inclusion is seen as a validation of its approach. However, experts caution that MicroStrategy‚Äôs heavy Bitcoin exposure could lead to a reclassification as a financial firm, potentially disqualifying it from the index. Despite this risk, the move has already pushed Bitcoin price above $102,000 and MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock past $400. Broader Implications for Bitcoin The growing adoption of Bitcoin as a national reserve and increased exposure through institutional channels like the Nasdaq-100 highlight its evolution into a mainstream financial asset. These developments are driving demand and reinforcing Bitcoin‚Äôs role in global financial strategies, making it a central figure in the cryptocurrency market‚Äôs ongoing growth. As nations and corporations deepen their engagement with Bitcoin, its trajectory as a valuable and strategic asset appears increasingly solidified. Bitcoin Price Holds Key Support Near $100,860; Rising Channel Pattern Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $100,860, showing a minor decline of 0.46% in the last session. The chart reveals a rising channel pattern, with Bitcoin testing key support near $100,800. A break below this level could lead to further downside toward $99,736 and $99,000, with stronger support seen at $97,349. On the upside, immediate resistance lies at $101,404, followed by $102,617 and $103,661. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 53.13 indicates neutral momentum, though a dip below 50 could signal increased bearish pressure. Meanwhile, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) around $99,689 is acting as a dynamic support level, reinforcing the ongoing trend. For now, Bitcoin‚Äôs technical outlook suggests cautious optimism, as it remains within its ascending channel. ‚Äì You might also like Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 ‚Äì 2034 $STARS Presale Surges Past $16.8M: Final Days to Participate Crypto All-Stars ($STARS) is redefining staking for meme coin holders with its innovative MemeVault platform.

In another X post, Trader Tardigrade stated that a possible Dogecoin scenario has come up with a double-bottom chart pattern. He added that DOGE had formed two equal lows with a resistance at the neckline, which is at around $0.46. Meanwhile, the crypto analyst also recently stated that the Dogecoin price has gained more buying power with a bullish crossover on the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD). His analysis suggested that Dogecoin could break this resistance at $0.46 and rally to around $0.5 on the next leg of the DOGE bull run. This rally to $0.5 could just be the start of the projected rally to $2.15 based on the bull flag on the Dogecoin price chart. It is worth mentioning that Trader Tardigrade has before now provided more bullish predictions for Dogecoin in this market cycle. The analyst predicted that DOGE could reach as high as $30 in this cycle while advising market participants to start taking profits around $10. What The Next Move Could Look Like Crypto analyst KrissPax provided insights into what the next move up for the Dogecoin price could look like. He stated that following the double-bottom pattern on DOGE‚Äôs chart, a fractal from past price action shows a possible move up through Monday, followed by an upward trend until Christmas.

With the ADA price jumping to a three-year high over the past month, Gambardello said the coin‚Äôs growth has woken up many people. Cardano Price Helped Prove Peer Dominance As Dan Gambardello noted, ADA price jumped from $0.32 to a high of $1.3 over the past month. Gambardello insinuated that this growth, which amounts to 306%, has made Cardano too big to ignore, even for major influencers. The top analyst said major influencers could no longer continue negative coverage of the asset. This, he claims is because these critics now know how silly they will look with sustained negative coverage as ADA prices continue to soar. The sudden Cardano move from .32 to $1.30 woke a lot of people up. Major influencers quickly realized they can‚Äôt continue negative $ADA coverage. They know they‚Äôd look silly through the bull market as $ADA keeps pumping. Now they‚Äôre bullish because they‚Äôve fallen in line. ‚Äî Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) December 14, 2024 The statement from Dan Gambardello hinges on the broad backlash Cardano has received over the past few years. As a media personality in crypto, he has used his platform to promote the coin. Gambardello largely supports major price growth for Cardano. Meanwhile, this is in line with previous ADA price analysis that tips a surge to $2. As of writing, the coin has pared off some of its gains over the past day. It is now down by 6.05% to $1.05 as of writing. The coin has dropped to this lowest level after soaring as high as $1.13 in the past 24 hours. Prospects and Hurdles Despite the massive accolades for Cardano, the underlying protocol has a number of hurdles to cross in the near future. Recently, a Cardano Foundation whistleblower flagged gross incompetence at the organization, sparking community speculation. With the foundation allegedly disaligned with Input Output Global (IOG) and other founding bodies, the prospect of its decentralized endeavors are now in doubt. However, the protocol has continued to innovate in its technological push. With advanced Hydra test and scalability upgrades, analysts like Dan Gambardello are optimistic the future of ADA remains bright.

Qubetics‚Äô commitment to simplifying blockchain adoption has garnered strong market support. During its presale, Qubetics raised over $6 million , distributed more than 324 million $TICS tokens , and attracted a growing community of over 9,400 holders . The current price of $TICS is $0.0311 , with projections indicating significant growth as the QubeQode platform gains traction. Analysts predict that as QubeQode adoption grows, Qubetics will emerge as one of the best cryptos for massive return potential , offering unparalleled growth opportunities for early investors. Hedera: The Leader in Enterprise-Grade Blockchain Hedera Hashgraph has positioned itself as a leader in enterprise-grade blockchain solutions, offering unmatched speed, security, and scalability. Its unique consensus mechanism, known as Hashgraph, sets it apart from traditional blockchains by providing high throughput and low latency.

This surprising turn of event was after the government outlawed the use of crypto in the country in 2017. The decision was part of a global trend in which many countries were skeptical about crypto‚Äôs volatile and unregulated nature. The nation is now laying the groundwork to embrace crypto assets and regulate the sector. Morocco Shift in Strategy: From Crypto Ban to Regulation Back then, the government cited financial instability, terrorism financing, and money laundering as the reasons for banning crypto in the country. The decision seemed like the best way to protect the country‚Äôs economy. In 2024, Morocco‚Äôs financial landscape is now undergoing a profound transformation. The announcement by Bank Al-Maghrib, Morocco‚Äôs central bank, to draft crypto regulations marks a pivotal moment. Central bank governor Abdellatif Jouahri has confirmed that the draft is under review, signaling a commitment to bringing crypto into the formal economy. This change aligns Morocco with a global trend of evolving digital asset regulations. Countries that were once critical of crypto, including China and Bolivia are now developing frameworks to harness its potential . Interestingly, over 130 nations are exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Morocco‚Äôs shift to crypto aims to boost financial inclusion. This is because 42% of the population are still unbanked. Crypto and a future CBDC can bridge this gap. Also smartphones, crypto wallets can enable savings, investments, and cross-border payments. Crypto‚Äôs Underground Rise in Morocco Despite the 2017 ban, cryptocurrencies found fertile ground in Morocco‚Äôs informal economy. In 2023, the country was ranked among the top 20 globally for crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis. It was also listed 13th in Bitcoin usage by Insider Monkey. Ownership of cryptocurrencies steadily climbed, rising from 2.4% of the population in 2021 to 3.1% in 2022. The ban didn‚Äôt stop crypto but pushed it into unregulated underground markets without protections. This exposed the need for formal rules to manage risks and unlock its potential. Challenges on the Road Ahead While Morocco‚Äôs embrace of crypto holds promise, it comes with significant challenges. The government must establish clear regulations to govern transactions and exchanges. This includes efficient Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) measures to prevent misuse. Many citizens remain unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies. This makes public education essential to promote understanding and responsible use. To support adoption, Morocco needs reliable technological infrastructure. This includes securing platforms for transactions and better internet access in rural areas. The authorities need to integrate crypto with traditional banking systems to ensure stability and consumer protection. Additionally, stringent cybersecurity measures need to be in place to protect users against fraud and hacking. Also, international collaboration will help Morocco align its policies with global standards and maintain financial integrity.

This month, the spotlight is shining on three heavy hitters: BTFD Coin, Dogs, and Bone ShibaSwap. These projects are stirring up FOMO across the crypto space faster than a Tim Hortons queue on a Monday morning. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned trader or just looking to park your loonies somewhere promising, you‚Äôll want to stick around for this. Let‚Äôs start with a quick hat tip to BTFD Coin , the absolute headliner of meme coin presales this month. Sitting pretty in its 10th presale stage, this rising star has already raked in over $3.8 million, sold 54 billion tokens, and amassed a loyal community of over 5,100 Bulls. When a project hits a cool million in under ten days, you know it‚Äôs not just riding the hype‚Äîit‚Äôs making waves. BTFD Coin: A Movement Wrapped in Memes If there‚Äôs one word to describe BTFD Coin, it‚Äôs ‚Äúmomentum.‚Äù Short for ‚ÄúBuy The Dip,‚Äù this Ethereum-based gem champions a fearless approach to market downturns, rallying a community ready to seize the dips like a Canuck hitting the slopes. The Bulls Squad‚Äîfour vibrant mascots, including Baby Bull and Nerdy Bull‚Äîaren‚Äôt just cute branding; they‚Äôre symbols of a strong community that‚Äôs already carved out its space in the meme coin cosmos. Add to that a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game where players earn BTFD tokens and a staking APY of 90%, and you‚Äôre looking at utility far beyond the average meme coin. But let‚Äôs talk tokenomics, because this isn‚Äôt some fly-by-night operation. With nearly half its supply allocated to presale and a long-term liquidity lock of three years, BTFD Coin is structured for sustainability. And the best part? The presale isn‚Äôt slowing down. With every stage bringing fresh buzz, the FOMO here is as real as watching your favourite poutine joint run out of gravy. Dogs: Barking Up the Right Tree Ah, Dogs, a meme coin that‚Äôs all about man‚Äôs best friend‚Äîbut with a crypto twist. While Dogs hasn‚Äôt reached the mainstream heights of some of its canine counterparts (looking at you, Dogecoin), it‚Äôs carving its niche by sticking close to its community. Dogs boasts a decentralised governance model that gives its holders a real say in the project‚Äôs future. It‚Äôs like having your hockey team consult you on the line-up‚Äîpretty unheard of, but definitely appreciated. Plus, its meme-worthy charm is backed by utility, including partnerships with animal welfare organisations. Now, isn‚Äôt that a tail-wagging bonus? Its roadmap hints at future integrations and even NFT opportunities, which could set it apart in the crowded field of dog-themed cryptos. If you‚Äôre looking for a coin with heart, Dogs is worth a shot. Bone ShibaSwap: The Utility Powerhouse If Bone ShibaSwap were a weather forecast, it‚Äôd be calling for a blizzard of utility. As part of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, Bone plays a pivotal role in ShibaSwap, the ecosystem‚Äôs decentralised exchange (DEX). This isn‚Äôt just another meme coin‚Äîit‚Äôs the backbone of a project that already commands a cult-like following. Bone isn‚Äôt just about trading on ShibaSwap; it‚Äôs also a governance token, giving holders voting power on ecosystem proposals. Talk about putting your money where your mouth is. And with the upcoming launch of Shibarium, a Layer 2 blockchain solution, Bone‚Äôs role is set to expand even further. The presale might be over, but the buzz around Bone hasn‚Äôt cooled off. Its steady climb in utility and demand makes it a standout in a market full of flash-in-the-pan meme coins. For those who believe in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, Bone is the kind of token that feels more like an investment than a gamble. What‚Äôs the Best Move This Month? When it comes to the best new meme coin presales to invest in this month, each of these contenders brings its own flavour to the table. Dogs offers charm and philanthropy, while Bone ShibaSwap is all about utility and governance. But if we‚Äôre talking about all-around potential‚Äîcommunity, momentum, and unique features‚ÄîBTFD Coin takes the crown. This is a presale that‚Äôs already proving its worth, with strong tokenomics, a thriving community, and features that promise long-term engagement. Whether it‚Äôs staking, gaming, or just vibing with the Bulls Squad, BTFD Coin has positioned itself as the meme coin to beat. The clock‚Äôs ticking, and the BTFD Coin presale won‚Äôt last forever. So, grab your chance to ride the wave while the price is still low‚Äîbecause when it takes off, you‚Äôll want to be on board. Don‚Äôt miss the boat, eh?

The complaint names Pinillo and his associated businesses, Solanofi, Solano Partners Ltd., and Solano Capital Investments, collectively known as the Solanofi entities, as the defendants. Details of The Lawsuit According to a December 10 release from the CFTC, Pinillo targeted at least 1,515 individuals in the United States, including members of his Spanish-speaking congregation. The complaint alleges that he misused his position as a trusted church pastor to promote his deceptive scheme. He claimed to be the CEO of Solanofi, an automated trading platform that offered risk-free profits through high-performance trading of crypto assets. Pinillo falsely advertised guaranteed monthly returns of up to 34.9% and assured participants that the platform was secure and reliable. The pastor gave participants access to an online dashboard showing fake account balances and profits to make the scheme appear legitimate. He also encouraged customers to involve friends and family by offering a 15% referral fee for recruiting new people. However, the document states that there was no trading platform, no trades occurred, and no profits were generated. Instead, Pinillo allegedly misappropriated all funds provided by customers. The lawsuit further claims that the accused failed to disclose critical information when seeking clients. Among the omissions, he did not inform customers that the Solanofi entities were shams, the trading platform was non-existent, and the online account statements were falsified. Additionally, he used the funds from new participants to pay earlier ones in what the CFTC described as a classic Ponzi scheme. Restitution and Similar Cases Following the enforcement action, the regulator is seeking restitution for defrauded participants, the return of misappropriated funds, civil monetary penalties, trading bans, and a permanent injunction to prevent further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and related rules. The case against Pinillo is the latest in a growing number of such schemes in the crypto industry. In March, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged that 17 individuals were responsible for a $300 million Ponzi scheme that targeted more than 40,000 Latino investors through a program called CryptoFX. In August, the financial watchdog also brought complaints against two Georgia brothers accused of defrauding over 80 investors in a $60 million bogus multilevel plan. The same month, NovaTech Ltd. was charged with operating a fake operation that raised over $650 million from more than 200,000 investors, including many in the Haitian-American community.

This follows similar efforts by legislators in the United States, Russia, Argentina, and other jurisdictions. As a finite asset, a strategic Bitcoin reserve is key for consumers‚Äô economic benefits and utility in cross-border payments. According to the House of Councilors document, Satoshi Hamada moved towards a Bitcoin Reserve for the government. He described the importance of the country having the top crypto as its national asset. Hamada proposed converting foreign reserves to crypto assets like Bitcoin, pointing to global jurisdictions. The lawmaker cited neutrality and its decentralized nature to prevent any form of control within a particular country. Global trade with Bitcoin is possible without the influence of specific countries. Crypto enthusiasts argue that it creates a fair financial environment for participants. The initial reaction from the crypto community was positive, as holders lauded the recent push by governments toward digital asset adoption. This could spur institutional investment, raising asset prices and driving market innovation. Although Hamada‚Äôs party holds only two seats in parliament, there is growing optimism of other lawmakers supporting his views. Japan has taken a mixed approach toward digital asset regulation. Last month, the country proposed a lightweight regulation for crypto intermediaries. As global regulations ramp up, crypto enthusiasts believe the country will be more positive to virtual assets. The United States Effect Recent moves by US lawmakers inspired Hamada to pitch a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Ahead of the US elections, Donald Trump backed the crypto industry, pledging positive regulations and ending the present administration‚Äôs ‚Äú war‚Äù on the market. Amongst others, Trump noted that his administration would stop the sale of the nation‚Äôs Bitcoin, creating a reserve. US Senator Cynthia Lummis rolled out a bill for a strategic Bitcoin reserve in a related effort. The bill seeks to make the country a Bitcoin power nation as it will acquire 1 million BTC for five years and hold for 20 years. This will offset the growing national debt, which continues to hinder macro conditions in the market. Sen Lummis proposed selling gold reserves to acquire more Bitcoin, sparking an upward trend among bulls. This has led to several jurisdictions setting sights on a strategic BTC reserve to boost fair competition.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Japan,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-14 21:57:49

Peter Schiff doubts,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-pay-off-u-s-debt-peter-schiff/,"Peter Schiff doubts that 1 million Bitcoins could ever pay off the U.S. national debt, as Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap would need to increase by over 20,000%, which is unrealistic. He also questions Bitcoin‚Äôs global adoption and sees its value increased more by speculation than real demand. Some Bitcoin fans believe that if the U.S. government buys 1 million Bitcoins, it could eventually pay off the massive $36 trillion national debt. However, Peter Schiff doubts this idea, in a recent X post he questioned whether Bitcoin could eventually pay off the $36.25 trillion national debt. For this to happen, Bitcoin‚Äôs total value would have to increase significantly. Currently, Bitcoin is priced at around $100,000. So, 1 million Bitcoin at $100,000 per Bitcoin would be worth $100 billion in total, not enough to pay off the U.S. national debt, which is around $36.25 trillion. Peter Schiff doubts Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to pay off U.S. National debt Schiff says this isn‚Äôt possible, as Bitcoin would have to increase in value by over 20,000%, which is unrealistic. Even if Bitcoin‚Äôs value increases, the U.S. debt keeps growing. The U.S. government borrows money yearly, so the debt is expected to continue rising. This makes the idea of Bitcoin paying off the debt even harder to believe. Plus, by then the National Debt will be much more than $36.25 trillion, requiring a much higher Bitcoin price to pay it off. ‚Äî Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 13, 2024 Peter Schiff has long criticized Bitcoin, saying it lacks value and won‚Äôt replace traditional money or assets like gold. He points out Bitcoin‚Äôs extreme price swings, making it unreliable for saving or buying everyday things. He believes most Bitcoin buyers are speculating, not using it as money. Schiff also doubts Bitcoin will ever be widely adopted. While its price has grown, Bitcoin still needs to be used as a global currency. Only some countries have accepted it as official money, and most governments resist replacing their currencies with Bitcoin. Schiff believes Bitcoin will always remain the world‚Äôs main currency. Some Bitcoin supporters think the cryptocurrency will keep increasing in value as more people adopt it. They believe it could even reach $1 million per coin, making it an alternative to traditional money. However, Schiff sees the idea of Bitcoin paying off the U.S. national debt as highly unlikely. The market cap required for such a scenario is too large, and the growing national debt makes it even less possible. As Peter Schiff says, ‚Äú Bitcoin is a speculative asset, and its value is driven by hope, not real demand.‚Äù While Bitcoin might continue to grow for some, Schiff believes that paying off the U.S. national debt is just an unrealistic dream.

The company‚Äôs inclusion follows an eventful year that saw its stock value increase more than sixfold. The Nasdaq-100 index is up 29.4% in 2024. You might also like: Saylor‚Äôs MicroStrategy added $2.1b in Bitcoin What does it mean? Joining the Nasdaq-100 index ranks MicroStrategy, the software company turned Bitcoin ( BTC ) treasury, among some of the biggest corporations, including Apple Inc., with a market cap exceeding $3 trillion; Microsoft Corporation, valued at over $2 trillion; NVIDIA Corporation, boasting a market cap surpassing $1 trillion; Amazon.com Inc., with its market cap of around $1.5 trillion; and Alphabet Inc., which has a market cap nearing $1.8 trillion. Other newcomers to the index this year include Palantir Technologies and Axon Enterprise. This inclusion typically leads to increased stock purchases as exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, tracking the index adjust their holdings to reflect the changes. To be included in the Nasdaq-100, a company must meet specific criteria and maintain a position of prominence in the stock market. For MicroStrategy, it‚Äôs among the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange based on market capitalization. Inclusion also signifies that the company is among the most valuable and must maintain its stock performance to stay included. Poor performance or a drop in market cap can lead to exclusion, as was the case this year with Illumina, Super Micro Computer, and Moderna. MicroStrategy‚Äôs transformation The firm began acquiring Bitcoin in 2020 as a treasury reserve asset amid declining software business revenue. The strategy has proven remarkably successful, with the company‚Äôs market capitalization now approaching $97.94 billion. The firm recently expanded its Bitcoin holdings further, with Executive Chairman Michael Saylor announcing the acquisition of 21,550 Bitcoin for approximately $2.1 billion between December 2 and December 8, bringing their total holdings to 423,650 BTC. Bernstein analysts view the Nasdaq-100 inclusion as a stepping stone toward potential S&P 500 inclusion in 2025, suggesting further upside for the company‚Äôs stock. The analysts anticipate improved visibility and recognition beyond fresh ETF inflows as a result of the index inclusion.MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock performance has closely tracked Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements, benefiting from the cryptocurrency‚Äôs recent surge past $100,000. This rally has been partially attributed to optimism surrounding President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs victory and expectations of more favorable regulatory conditions for the crypto sector. The company‚Äôs success has redefined corporate treasury management strategies, showcasing the potential benefits of Bitcoin as a reserve asset.

In a tweet accompanied by a detailed technical chart, XRP Captain stated, ‚Äú#XRPHolders It‚Äôs Not Me But The Chart Is Telling Us That #XRP Is Ready To Explode Once Again.‚Äù The chart depicts a series of corrective price movements that culminate in a symmetrical triangle formation, a technical indicator often associated with impending volatility. XRP Captain highlights the completion of Wave E within the triangle, suggesting a bullish move may be imminent. The key resistance level at $2.60 is critical for confirming an upward breakout, while $1.70 is a solid support level to watch in case of a downward move. #XRPHolders It's Not Me But The Chart Is Telling Us That #XRP Is Ready To Explode Once Again pic.twitter.com/GQowgoRyi0 ‚Äî XRP CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) December 13, 2024 Elliott Wave Patterns Signal Potential Breakout The 4-hour chart shared by XRP Captain employs Elliott Wave theory to analyze XRP‚Äôs recent price action. This approach categorizes market movements into repetitive wave cycles, providing insight into investor sentiment and potential future trends. The chart indicates two descending structures preceding a symmetrical triangle, a consolidation pattern that precedes a breakout. With Wave E nearing completion, the formation suggests a high likelihood of price expansion. If XRP can surpass the resistance level at $2.60, it could signal a significant rally, while a fall below $1.70 would invalidate this bullish thesis. This technical setup has drawn considerable attention from the XRP community, many of whom view the chart as confirmation of long-term bullish potential. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Debate Over XRP‚Äôs Market Dynamics XRP Captain‚Äôs analysis has sparked conversations within the cryptocurrency community about whether XRP will adhere to standard market patterns or diverge due to unique factors. James Hernandez, a prominent member of the XRP community, commented on the tweet, expressing a different view. He argued, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think standard market trends apply to XRP. I mean they did before, but XRP is about to revolutionize the global financial world. Other factors are going to determine its growth from here.‚Äù James‚Äô perspective reflects a broader belief among XRP supporters that the asset‚Äôs value is increasingly tied to fundamental developments. Ripple‚Äôs progress in securing global financial partnerships and the anticipated conclusion of its legal battle with the SEC are seen as key drivers of XRP‚Äôs price, potentially overriding traditional market indicators. What‚Äôs Next for XRP? With the start of 2024 approaching, XRP enthusiasts anticipate regulatory clarity and increased adoption to play a pivotal role in determining the asset‚Äôs trajectory. XRP Captain‚Äôs technical analysis provides a compelling case for bullish momentum. Time will reveal whether the token will adhere to these patterns or if external factors will shape its future. For now, traders and holders are advised to stay vigilant as XRP nears a decisive moment in its market cycle.

By 2027, NEAR is expected to rise to $16.90, driven by mainstream adoption. Looking ahead to 2030, NEAR Protocol could witness a significant surge, with its price potentially reaching $27 or beyond. Overall, the prevailing sentiment within NEAR Protocol‚Äôs community is one of cautious optimism, with stakeholders closely monitoring its progress and evolution. As NEAR continues to advance its technology and forge strategic partnerships, questions surrounding its price potential persist, inviting further analysis and exploration of its prospects.

NEAR price fell by over 2.5% at the time of writing. NEAR Protocol sought support and resistance at $6.50 and $7.00, respectively. Near Protocol price analysis for today, December 14, shows that the price rose to the $7.50 mark. NEAR Protocol price analysis 1-day chart: NEAR breaks past $7.50 as bulls charge The 1-day NEAR/USD price chart indicated an upward trend in the market as prices moved toward the $6.50 level. The bulls found support at $3.60 and the price rose to the $7.40 mark before falling back to the $6.50 level. NEAR price falls to $6.50 The Indicators reflect the increasing bearish price sentiment as all three major technical indicators signal rising bullish price sentiments. The MACD is bearish at -0.164 units and suggests falling bullish momentum. Moreover, the EMAs are above the mean position, and the indicator shows a steady momentum turn from bullish to bearish. The RSI also shares this sentiment as the indicator fell to 48.43 from above the 70.00 index level. The converging Bollinger Bands suggest decreasing volatility, indicating that the $7.00 resistance may hold for the week. NEAR price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour price chart of NEAR shows a sudden spike in NEAR price as the asset broke past $6.0. The price movement was followed by a short return to $5.70 before crossing back above the $6.00 mark as the bulls sought to go past the $7.50 resistance. NEAR price breaks down below the $7.00 resistance The RSI is at 37.92, suggesting that the asset is at the bottom of the neutral zone, which indicates that the bears have room for more upward movement in the short term. However, the downward slope suggests increasing selling pressure on the asset, suggesting further gains. The MACD is bearish, with the MACD line at -0.016 showing slight bearish dominance across the 4-hour charts, which has been increasing in recent candles. These indicators collectively issue a steady bullish trend that suggests a consolidation below $7.00.

The strong trade volume suggests increasing activity, indicating a robust force behind the recent fall. As such, the price rose rapidly to the $7.600 mark before stumbling below the $7.50 mark again. Traders should expect NEAR to continue its bullish rally as the bulls chase the $8.00 mark. Currently, the closest support level is $6.50 and below at $6.00, while NEAR Protocol faces difficulty establishing a foothold above the $7.00 level. Is Near Protocol a good investment? NEAR Protocol distinguishes itself in the cryptocurrency market, emphasizing scalability, usability, and developer-friendliness. It aims to facilitate the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, catering to developers and end-users. NEAR‚Äôs innovative technology and user-centric approach make it attractive for mainstream adoption of blockchain applications. With a focus on user experience and developer tools, NEAR Protocol is positioned to drive significant growth in the decentralized application ecosystem. Its potential to disrupt traditional industries and capture market share in the blockchain space makes it an intriguing investment opportunity for those interested in innovative technology solutions. Why is NEAR up? NEAR price rose rapidly after falling to the $4.50 support as the bulls crushed bearish resistances till $6.00 mark. Despite finding short-term resistance at the level, the bulls managed to rise to the $6.50 mark where they hover currently. Will NEAR reach $10? NEAR is experiencing a volatile market movement that may see it reach the $10 mark before the year closes. Will NEAR reach $20? NEAR is expected to cross the $20 threshold by 2027 as the industry continues to see increasing adoption across the mainstream. The bullish rally will be supported by NEAR‚Äôs vision of a scalable future and user and developer-friendly architecture that sets it apart from other blockchains. Will NEAR reach $50? The chance of NEAR reaching the $50 mark depends on various circumstances, such as future network development, market regulations, and the broader cryptocurrency market growth. If NEAR continues its current trajectory, it can reach $50 in the next decade. Does NEAR have a good long term future? Yes, NEAR has a good long-term future due to its innovative technology, focus on scalability, and strong ecosystem development. However, the project needs to keep up with sector developments to maintain its edge in the digital ecosystem. Recent news/opinions on Near Protocol NEAR recently conducted an AMA with fraxfinance founder Sam Kazemian sitting down with NEAR Co-Founder to discuss AI, PMF, DeFi, cross-chain interoperability, and more.

NEAR Protocol historic price sentiment NEAR price history The Near Protocol (NEAR) began its journey in August 2020, aiming to create a scalable and permissionless blockchain. The first recorded trade value in October 2020 was $1.072, closing the year at $1.459 after a recovery. In 2021, NEAR showed an uptrend, starting at $1.305 and reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $7.572 by March 13. A market downturn pushed the price down to $1.537 by July 19, but it rebounded to $11.776 on September 9 and further to $13.168 on October 26. By 2022, NEAR‚Äôs price crashed to below $2.00, losing over 90% of its peak value. Throughout 2023, NEAR saw low volatility, with prices remaining below $2.50 for most of the year. Since the start of 2024, NEAR experienced a strong recovery, climbing to $7.80. However, after reaching the $8.00 mark in mid-May, it fell back to $5.60. In June, NEAR traded between $4.48 and $7.66. It rose from $5.20 to $6.04 in July but closed the month below $5.00. NEAR started August at $5.00, declining to $3.89 by the end of the month. In September 2024, the asset bounced back and closed the month above the $5.20 mark. In October, the price stumbled and fell to $4.850 in the first few days before closing the month below the $4.00 mark leaving a negative outlook at the start of November. November saw NEAR making remarkable strides as the bulls held strong control of markets during the month, a trend that is likely to continue into December.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|NEAR,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-14 22:20:00

Trump‚Äôs Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump‚Äôs Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump‚Äôs Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump‚Äôs Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump‚Äôs Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump‚Äôs Tariffs by entering its contract address ‚Äì 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-14 22:23:00

As the cryptocurrency stabilizes, will Toncoin break to the upside, setting the stage for a fresh rally, or will it falter and dip lower, testing crucial support levels? This consolidation phase is more than just a pause in price action; it represents a pivotal moment that could determine TON‚Äôs next major move. A breakout to the upside could signal renewed positive sentiment, attracting more buyers and fueling a strong upward trend. On the other hand, a breakdown could shift the market sentiment to bearish, with the price heading lower to retest key support zones. In this article, we will explore both scenarios in detail, analyzing the key levels to watch and what a breakout in either direction could mean for Toncoin‚Äôs future trajectory. Toncoin Current Range: Understanding The Consolidation Phase As Toncoin consolidates, current price action suggests the potential for a breakout to the upside. The price has shown signs of bullish momentum within the consolidation range, with gradual upward movements indicating increasing buying interest. Related Reading: Toncoin‚Äôs 90-Day Returns Turn Positive: Is A Massive Rally On The Horizon? Furthermore, this upward pressure within the range is often a precursor to a breakout, as market participants accumulate positions, anticipating a rise above resistance levels. If this momentum continues to build, it could signal that Toncoin is preparing for a strong move on the upside once the price breaks free from its current consolidation zone. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently trending above the 50% threshold, indicating that Toncoin is in positive territory and buying pressure is starting to outpace selling activity, which is often a sign of bullish momentum. When the RSI remains above the 50% mark, it suggests that the asset is more likely to experience upward movement as it reflects an increasing number of buyers compared to sellers. Typically, this level is often seen as a key indicator for possible future gains, showing that market sentiment is leaning toward optimism. As the RSI trends higher, the likelihood of a breakout to the upside increases, reinforcing the optimistic outlook for Toncoin. What Happens After A Breakout? Possible Price Targets And Next Steps After a breakout, TON‚Äôs direction will hinge on whether the move is upward or downward. If the price breaks higher, it could target the $7.2 resistance level, which could act as an initial hurdle. Breaking above this level successfully would indicate strong bullish momentum, potentially triggering upward movement. In this scenario, the next key resistance level to watch would be $8.3. A move past this point could set Toncoin on a path for additional gains, as it would signal that the bulls are in control and the price may continue to climb toward new highs. Related Reading: Toncoin Price Explodes With 17% Rally ‚Äî Can TON Sustain The Momentum? On the other hand, if the breakout is to the downside, the price will likely test the $6 support level. A breach of this level could lead to more declines, with subsequent support zones becoming crucial. Conclusively, increased volatility is common, so traders should watch for confirmation signals after a breakout, such as volume and momentum indicators, to gauge the sustainability of the move. The broader market sentiment also plays a significant role in determining the direction and strength of the breakout.

This partnership aims to use blockchain technology to turn real-world assets (RWAs) into digital forms, focusing mainly on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) assets. A Strategic Partnership to Provide Secured Tokenized Assets According to a release , the partnership‚Äôs first project involves creating tokenized assets called ‚Äúnotes‚Äù linked to a Chinese solar material manufacturer. These notes aim to show the value and sustainability of the company‚Äôs operations. This project offers investors a clear and efficient way to support ESG-focused initiatives. Additionally, this initiative responds to the growing demand for sustainable investments, which require transparency and accountability. Meanwhile, Ant Digital, through its blockchain brand ZAN, will play an important role in this effort. ZAN offers advanced blockchain infrastructure and tools that make tokenizing assets in many industries easy. Likewise, the partnership shows how blockchain is changing traditional asset management. By turning real-world ESG assets into digital tokens, Sui Blockchain and Ant Digital use advanced technology to promote sustainability and build trust with investors. Zodia Custody and Securitize to Boost Tokenized Asset Custody Similarly, Zodia Custody formed a strategic partnership with Securitize , a renowned tokenization platform. This partnership is a step towards providing institutional investors with secure, compliant, innovative solutions for managing tokenized assets. Zodia Custody‚Äôs CEO, Julian Sawyer, expressed his enthusiasm for the possibilities that tokenization brings to the table. He highlighted that tokenization has the potential to redefine how institutions approach investments. Securitization will play a pivotal role in the partnership, allowing institutional investors to access and trade tokenized assets. Notably, the platform is familiar with facilitating the digital transformation of traditional financial markets. In an interview, Carlos Domingo, the CEO of Securitize, emphasized the importance of bridging the gap between blockchain technology and established financial practices. Tokenized Finance: The Future of Asset Management Tokenization transforms financial markets by converting assets into digital tokens on a blockchain. This innovative process introduces higher transparency, faster transactions, and lower costs, appealing to traditional and new-age investors. The tokenized money fund is accessible on a distributed ledger, enabling institutions to conduct real-time transactions and lower settlement risks.

37651618,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52174,1734217208,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"XRP Crash Alert Drives Whales to A Hidden Altcoin With 35,000% Upside Potential",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-crash-alert-drives-whales-to-a-hidden-altcoin-with-35000/,"The recent XRP price turmoil has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, prompting investors to seek refuge in a hidden altcoin that promises extraordinary returns. As XRP struggles to maintain its market position, with its price plummeting to $2.36 after a 3% drop, many are paying attention to RCO Finance (RCOF) , a hidden altcoin in the market. With predictions of a staggering 35,000% upside potential, RCOF has become the focal point for savvy investors looking to capitalize on the market‚Äôs shifting tides. XRP Price Faces Renewed Pressure as Ripple Sells $500 Million The XRP price momentum has taken another hit as Ripple initiated the sale of 200 million XRP from its December reserves, valued at $500 million. This significant sell-off comes at a critical time, with XRP struggling to maintain its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Following a sharp correction from its brief ascent to the third spot, the XRP price now battles to regain ground behind Tether‚Äôs USDT. Ripple‚Äôs substantial selling activity introduces additional downward pressure, potentially dampening the XRP price ability to recover from its recent crash. Despite reaching an all-time high of $2.90 in late November, the token has since slipped to $2.00, driven by dismissed rumors and bearish technical indicators. As Ripple cashes in on its reserves, investors are wary of the token‚Äôs ability to rebound. Meanwhile, whales are increasingly shifting their focus to RCO Finance (RCOF), a hidden altcoin with transformative growth potential. What Makes RCO Finance (RCOF) the New Whale Favorite? RCO Finance (RCOF) is rapidly building attention in decentralized finance (DeFi), capturing investors‚Äô engagement, particularly those looking to pivot from the projected XRP price drop. The platform‚Äôs innovative approach combines cutting-edge technology with user-centric features that cater to traders. The RCOF‚Äôs AI-powered robo-advisor is arguably the crown jewel of RCO Finance. This sophisticated tool leverages historical data, live market trends, and news events to craft personalized investment strategies tailored to individual users‚Äô financial goals and risk appetites. Unlike traditional advisors, which often require significant fees and human oversight, RCOF‚Äôs robo-advisor operates autonomously. It monitors market conditions, adjusting portfolios in real time to mitigate risks. This feature democratizes access to advanced trading strategies, allowing even novice investors to make profits. RCO Finance‚Äôs automated market-making (AMM) system complements the robo-advisor. This fully decentralized trading platform utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning to execute trades without manual intervention. RCO Finance also addresses a significant gap in the crypto market through its real-world asset integration feature. This functionality allows users to invest directly in stocks, bonds, and real estate using their cryptos, bypassing fiat conversion. Through RCOF bridging the divide between digital currencies and tangible assets, the platform opens up new avenues for portfolio diversification and investment opportunities previously inaccessible to crypto holders. In addition to these standout features, RCO Finance prioritizes security and privacy. The hidden altcoin has undergone rigorous audits by SolidProof , ensuring its smart contracts adhere to industry standards. Furthermore, RCOF does not require KYC procedures, allowing investors to maintain anonymity while trading. RCO FInance (RCOF) Presale Opportunities While the future of the XRP price is currently unknown, savvy investors are excited about the possibilities of the RCOF hidden altcoin presale, which is currently underway. Currently priced at $0.077 per token during Stage 4 of the presale, RCOF offers the substantial potential of up to 700% when the token hits the anticipated $0.6 on the exchanges. Participating in this presale grants access to RCO Finance‚Äôs innovative features and positions investors favorably within a rapidly evolving market. Token holders will enjoy various benefits, such as reduced transaction fees, quarterly dividends ranging from 1% to 6%, and exclusive access to AI features. Moreover, early investors can take advantage of promotional bonuses by using codes during their purchase, an initiative to incentivize participation in this promising project. With over $9 million already raised in its presale phase and a growing community of supporters, RCO Finance is poised for explosive growth. For those seeking an opportunity that combines cutting-edge technology with significant upside potential, now is the time to consider investing in RCO Finance (RCOF). As the XRP price faces challenges, RCOF stands ready to deliver unmatched ROI for every investor in the market.

Elon‚Äôs Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon‚Äôs Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon‚Äôs Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon‚Äôs Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon‚Äôs Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon‚Äôs Gold by entering its contract address ‚Äì 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|FIAT|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-14 23:47:00

With over 60% month-long profit, the Dogecoin price is also showing bullish strength as many expect the token to meet higher price targets this year. On the other hand, ETFSwap (ETFS) is taking full advantage of its fresh Uniswap listing to rival Dogecoin and deliver 12,000% more profits to its investors, taking its value to $4. Dogecoin Price Prepares For Further Upsurge As Its Price Consolidates The Dogecoin price impressed meme coin enthusiasts and investors by rallying over 100% in the past few weeks. However, the Dogecoin price is starting to consolidate, forming a bullish flag and settling around a weekly price range of $0.3947 ‚Äì $0.4758. Although the monthly gains the Dogecoin price accumulated have dropped from over 150% to a current 60%, analysts like Ali Martinez have hinted that the Dogecoin price could hit a target of $18 if the bull cycle gets wild in 2025. As this prediction adds to the optimism around Dogecoin, confidence is starting to brew for the Dogecoin price. Although, technical analysis for Dogecoin on TradingView hints at a neutral signal. This means that Dogecoin price could either surge further or drip from here. However, the Dogecoin community remains positive as CoinMarketCap reflects an 87% bullish sentiment for the token. ETFSwap (ETFS) Readies Itself For A Further 12,000% Pump As It Gains Uniswap Listing After already securing a listing on CoinMarketCap, ETFSwap (ETFS) has now made a notable debut on Uniswap , where investors are quickly moving to seize its new opportunities. After completing over 575% pump in its presale, where it sold over 900 million of its tokens and accumulated nearly $10 million in revenue, ETFSwap (ETFS) is presenting a fresh new chance for both old and new investors to reap higher ROI. Considering its wider audience on a prominent exchange platform like Uniswap, ETFSwap (ETFS) is set to utilize this opportunity to deliver 12,000% more returns to its investors. This surge is slated to raise the value of the ETFS token to $4, potentially giving early investors ROIs in multiple folds. Beyond ETFSwap‚Äôs potential for a massive price surge now that it has listed on Uniswap, the platform offers even more lucrative opportunities, as well as unique features that could spark an unprecedented upsurge for the token. For starters, this newly listed altcoin project functions as a fully decentralized platform that allows investors to trade tokenized ETF assets from several financial markets. These include cryptocurrency, commodities, bonds and amplified-based ETFs. Aside from this, all of its ETF products have been backed by Real World Assets, with its smart contract already audited by CyberScope. With an additional KYC verification by SolidProof, ETFSwap (ETFS) not only captures investors‚Äô trust but also shows its potential for a large adoption rate due to its diverse investment options. To top it off, ETFSwap‚Äôs native token, ETFS, offers even more benefits and lucrative opportunities that investors can take advantage of. In addition to being able to buy, own and swap ETFs with cryptocurrencies, users can earn rewards up to 87% APR yield through its staking opportunities. Additionally, there‚Äôs a 36% passive income set aside for those who stake their tokens. ETFSwap (ETFS) also offers distinct AI-powered tools that help investors filter, track, and screen ETF assets so they can make smart ETF investment decisions. Conclusion Although the Dogecoin price is set to reach new price targets in this bull cycle, ETFSwap (ETFS) stands as a better investment option. The platform offers some of the best features for an ETF and crypto trading platform, including 24/7 ETF trading access and live price tracking. These capabilities enable users to make significant profits. With its recent Uniswap listing , massive adoption for the token is expected, making now the perfect time to invest in the ETFS token. According to market experts, investors stand a huge chance to earn big when the token rallies by 12,000% to $4. So, savvy investors should do well to buy now when the price is still affordable and position for ROIs up to 12,000%.

The popular index lists the top 100 largest non-financial companies, including global giants like Amazon, Apple, Nvidia, Meta, and more. This happened after the November 29, 2024, market snapshot found Michael Saylor‚Äôs company with a market cap of around $92B, making it the 40th biggest company on the Nasdaq 100. Can Bitcoin Hit a New ATH with Microstrategy‚Äôs Achievement? Michael Saylor is an active Bitcoin supporter and has sworn to buy Bitcoin despite the price. More importantly, he believes in this token‚Äôs potential, firstly about hitting the $100k mark and later reaching millions over the next few years. With such belief, Microstrategy has 234,650 BTC , worth $43 billion. With that, they have built their strong portfolio but are also building investor confidence, eventually favoring the token‚Äôs price growth. At the time of reporting, Bitcoin is at $101.5k after moving 2% from the ATH of $103.9k. Although the difference is minor, the token is struggling to accomplish the same target again for days. However, the eyes are now on Michael Saylor‚Äôs inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 to affect the Bitcoin price positively. Interestingly, the BTC price has had a minor recovery on the charts past this news, reaching $102.5k earlier in the day. Interestingly, this was the biggest recovery since earlier ATH. Additionally, the buying pressure is strongly persistent on the token. With this buying pressure, high adoption, talks of Bitcoin reserve in multiple parts of the world, Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration, and many other factors, including this firm‚Äôs new achievement, the Bitcoin is to end the year on a positive note. More importantly, the Bitcoin price might hit $108.9K , before the year ends and higher in 2025. CZ Summarised Michael Saylor Firm‚Äôs Strategy in Four Words While sharing the news of the Nasdaq 100, including the business intelligence company, a popular strategist, Jeff Park, shared a one-page executive summary of the firm. The X post conveyed a summary titled ‚ÄúTheory of MicroStrategy,‚Äù but CZ summarised it into just words, joking about the Bitcoin-obsessed company. CZ commented, ‚ÄòBuy bitcoins and hold‚Äô referencing Microstrategy‚Äôs strategies and kidding that they are all about buying this token. More importantly, he said his summary is shorter than the intro line.

Bottom Line Michael Saylor‚Äôs company began buying Bitcoin around four years ago, and in this time, it has built a wealth of $43.18 billion with one of the most promising crypto to buy . Its exponential growth has helped the demand growth persistently, leading to worldwide adoptions. With that, the Bitcoin price recently hit an ATH at $103.9k, and analysts believe the price to hit even $150k by 2025 end, in which Microstrategy might play a bigger role, especially with its inclusion in the Nasdaq 100. This milestone is likely to bring positive sentiments to the industry and the token. Additionally, there are many other factors which would contribute to this journey.

The analyst suggests that if XRP‚Äôs price movement continues to mirror its 2017 trajectory, the cryptocurrency might be on the cusp of a significant breakout. However, it may follow a brief period of consolidation. fyi, if $XRP does still continue to follow 2017, we likely continue to consolidate for another 2 weeks until Christmas time then, we make our face melting move up for about a month until late January pic.twitter.com/E9MH8ljNXG ‚Äî Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy) December 13, 2024 Analysis Overview Charting Guy highlighted that XRP might consolidate until Christmas. Following this, a dramatic upward movement, similar to the one observed in late 2017, could occur, lasting about a month until late January. This projection aligns with historical trends where XRP experienced sharp rallies after periods of accumulation and low volatility. This perspective is supported by the historical price chart included in the discussion. The chart showcases key moments in XRP‚Äôs price history, including its massive rally in late 2017 and its similar, although shorter-lived, rally in early 2021. The ongoing consolidation period in late 2024 and early 2025 appears to fit the cyclical behavior seen in previous market cycles. Community Commentary Adding to the analysis, an X user, Bassi, provided further insight into how the timing of these potential movements could align with broader narratives. Bassi speculated that a rally around December 30 could be attributed to Christmas hype or Ripple‚Äôs stable coin (RLUSD) related developments. Furthermore, they projected January 20 as a potential peak, coinciding with the U.S. Presidential Inauguration Day. This date could mark a turning point for XRP, with the community likely labeling any subsequent downturn as a ‚Äúsell the news‚Äù event. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Factors Influencing the Outlook The discussion underscores several factors that could influence XRP‚Äôs price trajectory: Historical Patterns: XRP‚Äôs past rallies have often followed long periods of consolidation, suggesting that the current phase might precede significant price action. Market Sentiment: Speculative narratives, such as the holiday season or major institutional developments, often play a role in driving short-term price movements in the cryptocurrency market. Macro Events: Broader market conditions, including regulatory developments, macroeconomic trends, and Bitcoin‚Äôs price performance, are likely to have an indirect impact on XRP‚Äôs trajectory. Ripple Developments: Any updates from Ripple, such as progress in adoption or partnerships , could also act as catalysts for price movements.

The trader Ali Martinez tells his 98,500 followers on the social media platform X that social volume and positive sentiment around Aave‚Äôs native token are skyrocketing. ‚ÄúWith the crowd‚Äôs growing focus on AAVE, a brief pullback might be on the horizon, as markets often move against popular sentiment.‚Äù Source: Ali Martinez/X AAVE, the 34th-ranked crypto asset by market cap, is trading at $384.85 at time of writing. Turning to Litecoin, Martinez says that LTC is ‚Äúirrelevant, both fundamentally and technically.‚Äù The analyst argues that Litecoin hasn‚Äôt added anything significant to the crypto industry in terms of innovation. ‚ÄúAnd let‚Äôs not forget: [Litecoin creator] Charlie Lee famously sold all his Litecoin at the top in 2017. If the creator doesn‚Äôt believe in his project enough to hold it, why should I? If the fundamentals don‚Äôt convince you, the technicals should. Litecoin is trading at the same price today as it was in 2017. That‚Äôs seven years of going nowhere. In an industry defined by innovation and growth, LTC stands out as a project stuck in time. It hasn‚Äôt made a new all-time high since its peak in 2017 and has been consolidating in the same range ever since.

Homo Shiba Inu (HOMOSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address ‚Äì 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others.

If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

The highly anticipated ""Santa rally"" seems increasingly out of reach as macroeconomic uncertainty weighs heavily on the market. Several major cryptocurrencies are underperforming today, with notable losers including SUI ( $SUI ), down 6.5% after peaking at its all-time high of $4.89 last Friday, along with PEPE ($PEPE ), BONK ($BONK ), and Polkadot ($DOT ), all dropping roughly 6%. Adding to the downturn, Cardano ($ADA ), Fantom ($FTM ), and Hedera ($HBAR ‚Äì click for full insight) have each fallen by over 5%, reflecting a broad retreat across the altcoin market. The global crypto market cap currently sits at $3.6 trillion, marking a 1.2% decline in the past 24 hours, while trading volume has dropped sharply by 23.93% (typical for Saturday). Bitcoin 's dominance has increased slightly to 55.74%, as investors shift toward safer bets amid the growing uncertainty. Meanwhile, the Altcoin Season Index on CoinMarketCapsuggests Bitcoin remains firmly in control of the market, leaving altcoins struggling to gain traction. It‚Äôs easy to feel pessimistic in moments like these, but seasoned investors know the drill. After all, if you‚Äôve been through a few of these wild four-year cycles, the strategy remains the same: zoom out, ignore the noise, and prepare for strategic buying opportunities. Let‚Äôs break down the market leader, the king of cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin ($BTC): The Rectangle Pattern and $74K Support Let‚Äôs first address the elephant in the room: the rectangle pattern that formed back in February this year, shortly after the spot ETF approval in January 2024. This pattern broke to the upside on the election results, hitting its full target of $99,000 perfectly before becoming a strong resistance level (now flipped into main short-term support). Now, the rectangle‚Äôs upper edge at $74,000 is playing a critical support role, often considered the ‚Äúline in the sand‚Äù for many BTC investors. Adding further support to this rectangle is the 200-day moving average (green line), which currently sits at $69,000 and is gaining upside momentum. Historically, the 200-day MA serves as a strong dynamic support in bull markets. However, Bitcoin‚Äôs significant decoupling above this level also raises concerns of a potential return-to-mean scenario, which could see the price retrace to align with this long-term trend. Have a good look at 1d: If $74,000 were to break with confirmation, it could trigger a wave of exits, with the next logical stop being a test of the rectangle‚Äôs bottom around $49,000‚Äì$50,000. While such a correction doesn‚Äôt have to happen (or at least not until the next bear market), it‚Äôs worth noting that a breakdown to $74K would represent a 27-28% retracement from the ATH. Brutal as it sounds, this would be a relatively normal correction within a BTC bull market. The $107K Bull Flag: Still in Play? One of the most significant bullish macro formations for Bitcoin this year began with the SEC‚Äôs groundbreaking ETF approval. The January‚ÄìMay 2024 bull flag (green on the 1D chart) remains active, with a clear target at $107,000. This target is no joke, especially since the flag‚Äôs lower trendline extension has acted as a reversal point three times, reinforcing its significance. Interestingly, on the 4-hour chart, another bullish pennant pattern (purple) mirrors this flag‚Äôs target at $107,500. Two independent patterns aligning at the same price level give further weight to this target, making it a key projected take-profit zone. This alignment of patterns illustrates Bitcoin‚Äôs broader bullish potential, provided short-term challenges don‚Äôt derail momentum. The Rising Wedge and Current Challenges While the long-term outlook points higher, BTC is currently trapped in a rising wedge on the 4-hour chart, a bearish pattern by classical charting standards. Notably, the wedge‚Äôs bottom was formed by two significant December flash crashes, which now act as critical levels to watch. $101,000 is holding‚Äîfor now. While Bitcoin briefly broke above six figures, the breakout lacked volume confirmation and momentum, leaving the price vulnerable to a pullback. By the time you read this, the $100K+ price might already be history. If the rising wedge breaks down, the target aligns almost perfectly with the 0.382 Fibonacci level just below $87,000. A close below $90,000 would also invalidate the bullish pennant pattern, significantly weakening the bullish case. Momentum Check: RSI Signals Mixed but Worrisome The daily RSI remains relatively ‚Äòbullish‚Äô, currently holding just above 64 after cooling down from an overbought period in November. This steady position is supported by a strong RSI trendline that has been rising since August 2024 (visible in the chart as the red trendline). As long as RSI respects this trendline and continues its gradual upward movement, Bitcoin retains the momentum for further gains. However, concerns arise when we analyze the 4-hour RSI, which reveals signs of exhaustion. The RSI only reached 76 during BTC‚Äôs December 5 ATH of $103,700, forming a lower high compared to earlier overbought readings. This is an example of bearish divergence, where price makes a higher high while RSI makes a lower high. In simpler terms, this means that while the price climbed, the underlying momentum weakened‚Äîa classic red flag that often precedes corrections or consolidations. Adding to the mixed sentiment, volume during BTC‚Äôs breakout above $100,000 was lackluster, a classic red flag for sustainability in bullish price action. As of now, Bitcoin remains bullish as long as it holds above the 50-day SMA (yellow line) on the daily chart, currently sitting near $99,000, which also aligns with a key horizontal support level. For bulls to regain full control, the wedge must be invalidated by a strong daily close above $103,000, preferably with a notable volume spike. Key Ideas to Trade This Breakout Above $103K: A strong daily close above $103,000 with a clear volume spike would invalidate the wedge and signal momentum to target $107K. Watch for follow-through on the 4-hour timeframe to confirm the breakout. Trading the Wedge: Use the lower trendline of the wedge for potential long entries on price reversals. Confirmation can come from bullish candle patterns (e.g., hammers) or RSI rebounding from oversold zones. Do Nothing: The safest strategy is most likely to just wait. With the FOMC meeting looming on Wednesday, markets are likely to remain hesitant. Instead, consider scouting for entry points to capitalize on a likely retracement (Sunday to Monday night would be my guess). Summary: A Complicated Saturday Night As of Saturday night, Bitcoin remains in a delicate situation. Trading above the short-term bullish 50 SMA (yellow line) on the daily chart and holding the horizontal support at $99,000 keeps BTC in a bullish posture. However, for the king to truly stay strong on this timeframe, the rising wedge must be invalidated with a strong close above $103,000, preferably backed by a significant volume spike. Adding to the complexity, the Fear & Greed Index has returned to Extreme Greed (80) territory, following a brief dip during recent liquidations. Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/ The problem? Those liquidations failed to reset sentiment properly, leaving the market overly optimistic without clearing enough leverage. This makes the current setup even more perilous, as excessive greed often precedes sharp corrections. Meanwhile, the Altcoin Season Index currently sits at 60, signaling a phase of indecision. While the index remains above neutral territory, the sharp drop from last week's 83 confirms what we‚Äôre seeing across the market: altcoin season is suspended‚Äînot entirely called off, but certainly losing steam. Altcoins will likely continue struggling until Bitcoin (and $ETH ‚Äì link to analysis) either consolidates with strength or resolves its current patterns. Let‚Äôs be real‚Äîthis article could feel outdated by Monday if BTC does print a decisive candle soon to target the bullish patterns described. December, despite Moonvember‚Äôs fantastic run, has been tougher than expected. The crypto market is undoubtedly more complex now than last month‚Äîor even last weekend. The easy part of this bull market is over. Santa or no Santa, things are about to get wild. And when Trump takes office alongside the new, allegedly crypto-friendly leadership, we‚Äôll be in for a market environment no one‚Äôs truly prepared for.Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The analyst also suggested that XRP‚Äôs next move could happen sooner than expected. Next Major Support And Resistance Levels For The XRP Price In an X post, Dark Defender mentioned $2.42, $2.52, $2.71, and $5.85 as the next major support levels for the XRP price. Meanwhile, the crypto analyst highlighted $2.29, $2.24, $2.10, and $2.02 as the next major support levels for XRP. The analyst made these remarks while also alluding to a bull flag structure that had formed on XRP‚Äôs daily chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Dominance And Altcoin Season: What The Sudden Volatility Means For The Market Dark Defender asserted that the XRP price would make its next move by tomorrow, noting that the current bull flag had reached its limit. The crypto analyst had recently highlighted a weekly bull flag on the XRP chart, which showed that the crypto could reach double digits in this market cycle. In his most recent X post, Dark Defender also provided an update on his XRP/BTC pair analysis. He stated that what was expected from the XRP price was coming and suggested that it might have already begun. Before now, the analyst predicted that XRP would record ‚Äútremendous‚Äù gains against its Bitcoin pair. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted a bull flag forming on the XRP price‚Äôs 4-hour chart. Based on this pattern, the analyst stated that XRP could experience a brief correction, then break out above $2.46 and rally to $4, which would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for XRP. Two Possible Scenarios For The Third Wave In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades outlined two possible scenarios for the third wave of the XRP price‚Äôs move to the upside. In the first scenario, XRP could record a typical move, extending to the 2.618 Fibonacci level. This puts the price target at $3.82, the crypto‚Äôs current ATH. Related Reading: Bitcoin Daily Bollinger Bands Expand, Why BTC Price Could Rise To $120,000 As Early As Next Week Meanwhile, for the second scenario, CasiTrades stated that if this third wave doesn‚Äôt extend, the XRP price could record the extension play in the fifth wave. If the third wave doesn‚Äôt extend, the price target will be $3.23 instead of $3.82. She added that this target is near XRP‚Äôs current ATH, so the extension play might not occur. CaiTrades cautioned that these are just projections and that the XRP price could adjust with the actual highs. However, she is confident that a big move is coming, as XRP has consolidated with minimal movement over the last day. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.51, up over 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Over the past few days, while the majority of cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP, appear to be struggling to rally, HNT has gained 30% in value following a recent decline. Helium (HNT) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, HNT‚Äôs recent upside momentum has brought it to a crucial resistance level at $9.5. However, this marks the third time HNT has tested this level, and it appears to be weakening. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if HNT breaches this level and closes a daily candle above $9.85, there is a strong possibility that the asset could soar by 22% to reach the $12 level in the near future. Despite a notable rally, HNT‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 65, which is below the overbought region, suggesting that the asset has enough room to continue its upward movement in the coming days. On the positive side, the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe indicates an uptrend, as it lies below HNT‚Äôs current price. HNT‚Äôs Rising Open Interest HNT‚Äôs technical analysis is further supported by on-chain metrics. According to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass , HNT‚Äôs futures open interest has surged by 24%, reflecting traders‚Äô strong interest and confidence in the token as it approaches a crucial breakout. When combining on-chain metrics with technical analysis, it appears that bulls have entered the market and could support the altcoin in breaching the resistance level this time. Current Price Momentum Currently, HNT is trading near $9.47 and has experienced a price jump of over 13.10% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume skyrocketed by 265%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors driven by HNT‚Äôs bullish outlook.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|HNT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-15 02:14:28

Trump‚Äôs Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump‚Äôs Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump‚Äôs Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump‚Äôs Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump‚Äôs Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump‚Äôs Tariffs by entering its contract address ‚Äì 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR.

VanEck Forecasts Bitcoin Soaring To $180,000 VanEck predicts that the crypto bull market will reach a ‚Äúmedium-term peak‚Äù in the first quarter of 2025, followed by new all-time highs by the year‚Äôs end. The firm estimates Bitcoin could soar to approximately $180,000, while Ethereum (ETH) may exceed $6,000, Solana (SOL) could surpass $500, and Sui (SUI) might reach over $10. The report further suggests that the United States will begin to embrace Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, as President-elect Donald Trump promised, anticipating an increase in overall crypto adoption. Related Reading: Australia‚Äôs Biggest Pension Fund Makes Historic $17M Bitcoin Investment, A National First With anticipated changes in leadership at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), numerous spot crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) are also expected to be approved. This includes Ethereum ETPs featuring staking options, as well as in-kind transaction capabilities for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Per the report, the asset manager forecasts that the value of tokenized securities will exceed $50 billion in the coming months, following a 61% growth to $12 billion throughout this year. Most of this value currently resides on permissioned chains, but 2025 is expected to be a breakthrough year, particularly as organizations like the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) explore bridging public and private blockchains. The firm projects that stablecoins will revolutionize payment systems, with daily settlement volumes potentially tripling to reach $300 billion by the end of 2025. This growth, driven by increased adoption in global commerce, remittances, and integration with major technology and payment networks, would position stablecoins to handle transactions equivalent to 5% of DTCC‚Äôs daily volumes. DeFi To Hit All-Time Highs Another intriguing prediction is the rise of one million new AI agents, which VanEck describes as ‚Äúdigital workers‚Äù that autonomously execute tasks or make decisions. These agents are expected to generate significant on-chain activity as they expand their roles beyond decentralized finance (DeFi) into areas such as social media, gaming, and consumer applications. VanEck anticipates that Bitcoin Layer-2 solutions will accumulate a total value locked (TVL) of 100,000 BTC, building on an impressive 600% growth in 2024 that brought the TVL to 30,000 BTC. The report forecasts that Ethereum‚Äôs blob space will generate $1 billion in fees, spurred by the rapid adoption of Layer-2 solutions, rollup optimizations, and high-fee use cases such as tokenized assets and enterprise applications. VanEck predicts that decentralized finance (DeFi) will hit all-time highs, with decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes reaching $4 trillion and total value locked in DeFi rising to $200 billion. This growth will reportedly be fueled by AI-related tokens, consumer-facing decentralized applications (dApps), and the tokenization of assets that drive liquidity and user adoption. Related Reading: Solana Price On The Rise: Key Resistance At $235 Could Spark Major Breakout The non-fungible token (NFT) market is expected to rebound, with trading volumes projected to reach $30 billion in 2025. Despite recent downturns, standout projects like Pudgy Penguins and Miladys have managed to thrive by leveraging strong community ties and transitioning into consumer brands. Finally, VanEck forecasts that decentralized application (dApp) tokens will narrow the performance gap with Layer-1 tokens. In 2024, Layer-1 blockchain tokens outperformed dApp tokens by a factor of two, but innovative dApps in artificial intelligence and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) are anticipated to drive a shift in performance dynamics. At the time of writing, the market‚Äôs leading crypto has managed to reclaim the $101,820 level, recording a 2% increase in the 24-hour time frame.

MicroStrategy joins Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) and Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) as new additions to the index, according to a Dec. 13 statement from Nasdaq. Meanwhile, Illumina, Inc.

MSTR Now Among Nasdaq‚Äôs Largest Companies MicroStrategy, originally a software company that pivoted into becoming a de facto Bitcoin hedge fund in 2020, is now among Nasdaq‚Äôs 100 largest stocks by market capitalization. Its inclusion also means that the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), an ETF managing $322 billion in assets, will add MSTR to its portfolio.

Dogwifhat (WIF), a Solana-based token, recently skyrocketed by an incredible 12,000%, grabbing the attention of investors everywhere. While such explosive growth is not uncommon in the crypto space, it raises questions about the sustainability and true value of these tokens. Amidst the hype, the Lightchain AI ($LCAI) Presale stands out as a compelling opportunity, merging artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to deliver a project focused on real utility and long-term growth. This article takes a closer look at Dogwifhat‚Äôs recent success and dives into whether Lightchain AI has the potential to match‚Äîor even outperform‚Äîthis level of remarkable growth. Dogwifhat (WIF): The Rise of a Meme-Inspired Token Dogwifhat is a cryptocurrency operating on the Solana blockchain, celebrated for its meme-driven identity and community-centric growth strategy. Unlike traditional blockchain projects with clear utility or technological innovation, Dogwifhat thrives on the viral nature of its brand, leveraging social media and community engagement. Factors Behind Dogwifhat‚Äôs 12,000% Growth Community Engagement: Dogwifhat‚Äôs growth has been driven largely by its passionate community, which fuels its momentum through viral campaigns and online promotions. Low Entry Barrier: The token‚Äôs affordable price before its surge made it an attractive option for speculative investors. Speculation and Hype: Like many meme coins, Dogwifhat‚Äôs meteoric rise can be attributed to speculative trading, with investors hoping to capitalize on short-term gains. Challenges Ahead for Dogwifhat Sustainability: Meme-driven tokens often struggle to maintain their value over the long term without tangible utility. Volatility: The token‚Äôs reliance on market sentiment makes it prone to sharp declines once the hype subsides. Lightchain AI ($LCAI): Built for Long-Term Growth While Dogwifhat‚Äôs rise is a testament to the power of community-driven tokens, Lightchain AI presents a stark contrast with its focus on utility, innovation, and real-world applications. Lightchain AI integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to address key challenges such as scalability, transparency, and efficiency. Key Features of Lightchain AI Proof of Intelligence (PoI): A groundbreaking consensus mechanism that rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations, combining blockchain security with practical utility. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): A revolutionary environment designed to optimize AI-specific tasks, enabling applications in healthcare, finance, and logistics. Sustainability: By minimizing wasteful computations, Lightchain AI ensures energy efficiency, aligning with global environmental goals. Lightchain AI‚Äôs Real-World Applications Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Enhancing predictive analytics for risk management and investment strategies. Healthcare: Enabling AI-powered diagnostics and personalized medical solutions. Supply Chain Management: Improving transparency and accountability in logistics. Can Lightchain AI Replicate Dogwifhat‚Äôs 12,000% Success? Comparing Growth Drivers Hype vs Utility: Dogwifhat‚Äôs growth is fueled by social media buzz and speculative trading, whereas Lightchain AI‚Äôs value lies in its tangible applications and technological advancements. Community Engagement: Both projects benefit from strong community support, but Lightchain AI‚Äôs decentralized governance model ensures active participation in shaping its ecosystem. Scalability: While Dogwifhat relies on Solana‚Äôs infrastructure, Lightchain AI‚Äôs innovative consensus mechanism and AIVM offer unparalleled scalability and efficiency. Factors Favoring Lightchain AI Sustainable Growth: Lightchain AI‚Äôs focus on utility and innovation positions it for consistent growth, avoiding the pitfalls of speculative bubbles. Market Differentiation: By addressing real-world challenges, Lightchain AI appeals to a broader range of investors and industries. Presale Opportunity: The ongoing Lightchain AI presale offers early investors a chance to participate in a project with significant growth potential, starting at just $0.001125 per token. The Path Forward: Challenges and Opportunities For Dogwifhat (WIF): Sustaining Momentum: Maintaining its community-driven momentum will require innovative strategies to keep investors engaged. Expanding Utility: Developing tangible use cases could help Dogwifhat transition from a meme coin to a more sustainable asset. For Lightchain AI ($LCAI): Scaling Adoption: Building partnerships across industries will be crucial for demonstrating the platform‚Äôs utility. Navigating Competition: Competing with established blockchain platforms like Ethereum and Solana will require continuous innovation. Educating Investors: Communicating the value of its technology and applications will help attract a diverse investor base. Which Is the Better Investment? Why Choose Dogwifhat (WIF)? Ideal for short-term investors seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Appeals to those who enjoy being part of a vibrant and active community. Why Choose Lightchain AI ($LCAI)?

Final Thoughts: The Future of Blockchain The crypto market is vast and diverse, catering to investors with varying risk appetites and priorities.

On the other hand, Lightchain AI‚Äôs focus on utility, innovation, and sustainability positions it as a frontrunner in the blockchain space. As the industry evolves, projects like Lightchain AI are likely to lead the way, offering solutions that address real-world challenges and drive meaningful change. While Dogwifhat captures the excitement of meme-driven investments, Lightchain AI offers a vision for the future of blockchain‚Äîa vision that is grounded, impactful, and built to last. üëâ Visit Lightchain AI‚Äôs Official Website üëâ Read the Lightchain Whitepaper üëâ Follow Lightchain AI on Twitter/X üëâ Join the Lightchain AI Community on Telegram",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|WIF,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-15 03:30:00
33767162,[object Object],1734233420,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Ethereum Sees 8-Month High In New Addresses‚ÄîCan It Hit $5,000?",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-sees-8-month-high-in-new-addresses-can-it-hit-5000/,"The Ethereum network has recently witnessed a resurgence in activity , with new wallet addresses hitting an eight-month high. On-chain data shows that an average of 130,200 new Ethereum addresses are being created daily in December, a level of network activity not seen since April. This resurgence in activity comes as the Ethereum price targets a break above the $4,000 price level, with the $5,000 price level also increasingly coming into view. Ethereum‚Äôs Network Activity Hits New Heights Ethereum‚Äôs uptick in new wallet addresses points to an increasing level of interest among users and investors. This interesting sentiment is revealed through the Network Growth metric from Santiment , a leading on-chain analytics platform. According to the Network Growth metric, the number of new Ethereum addresses created has been on the rise since the beginning of November. This steady growth has seen the daily new addresses double since then. As it stands, the Ethereum network is now seeing an average of 130,200 new addresses being created each day. Interestingly, the surge in Ethereum network growth is now at its highest level in eight months, rivalling the activity witnessed in March and April. Ethereum‚Äôs increase in activity is also supported by data from IntoTheBlock, another on-chain analytics company. According to IntoTheBlock, transaction activity on the Ethereum blockchain is now rivaling March 2024 levels, when the Ethereum price broke above $4,000 again. Particularly, IntoTheBlock data shows that large transactions with a value of $100,000 or greater are current at $68.23 billion in the past seven days, one of its highest weekly transaction volumes this year. Can Renewed Interest Push Ethereum Price Towards $5,000? The rekindled interest in Ethereum raises the possibility of the asset testing new highs very soon. The Ethereum price has hovered between $4,000 and $2,220 for much of the year and has yet to break into new all-time high levels like Bitcoin and Solana, its top crypto counterparts. Notably, you could argue that the Ethereum price has underperformed compared to other heavyweights like Solana and XRP, even though it has the largest share in the altcoin market. However, renewed participation on the network could act as the much-needed boost for a strong move upward. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is looking to break above resistance at $4,000, having retested it in the past 24 hours. This comes behind a streak of inflows into US-based Spot Ethereum ETFs, which witnessed an $854.85 million last week, its highest weekly inflow since launch. The first step would be a sustained break above $4,000 . If the Ethereum price can achieve this, it would open up the door to reaching $5,000 before the end of 2024 or by early 2025.

Capriglione, who announced the bill during an X Spaces event, emphasized the potential benefits of such a reserve in enhancing Texas‚Äôs fiscal stability and reinforcing its leadership in Bitcoin innovation. ‚ÄúProbably the biggest enemy of our investments is inflation,‚Äù he stated, highlighting that a strategic Bitcoin reserve could provide a win-win scenario for the state. The legislation, titled ‚ÄúAn Act Relating to the Establishment of a Bitcoin Reserve within the State Treasury of Texas and the Management of Cryptocurrencies by Governmental Entities,‚Äù underscores a significant trend of increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Notably, this movement is not limited to nations; following President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs proposal for a US strategic Bitcoin reserve at the National Bitcoin Conference in Nashville earlier this year, there has been a marked uptick in BTC adoption among various countries and private companies. Bitcoinist previously reported that in just the past month, nine major firms from sectors including finance, healthcare, and artificial intelligence (AI) have embraced the market‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency as a strategic reserve asset. October 2025 As Next Major BTC Market Top? As these developments unfold, BTC has recently closed the week above the $100,000 mark, fueling speculation about its future trajectory. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has pointed out that if Bitcoin adheres to historical trends observed in previous market cycles, the next market peak could occur in October 2025. The analyst noted that in the last two cycles, from market bottom to market top, it took approximately 1,065 days, while the duration from one market bottom to the next was around 1,430 days.

He stated that as long as this demand zone remains intact, there is a strong likelihood that Bitcoin will continue its upward momentum. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $101,477, up 2% on the week after a brief consolidation period and a 7% drop towards $91,000.

Elon‚Äôs Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon‚Äôs Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon‚Äôs Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon‚Äôs Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon‚Äôs Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon‚Äôs Gold by entering its contract address ‚Äì 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|FIAT|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-15 03:49:00

This surge highlights Bitcoin‚Äôs resilience and growing institutional acceptance and casts a spotlight on emerging altcoins poised to disrupt the market. Among these is RCO Finance (RCOF) , an undervalued altcoin that investors are beginning to recognize for its potential to skyrocket by an astonishing 50,000%. As the market evolves, Bitcoin and innovative altcoins like RCOF are poised for a major market bull run that aims to push the crypto market cap to a new ATH. Bitcoin Price Targets 120,000 Amid Market-Wide Crypto Surge Bitcoin price has once again captivated the financial world, breaking the $102,000 barrier as the cryptocurrency sector reached a valuation of $3.5 trillion. This rally comes amid significant developments, including bullish comments from President-elect Donald Trump. Trump‚Äôs suggestion of adding Bitcoin to a strategic reserve and unveiling a crypto-friendly agenda spurred market optimism. The crypto market‚Äôs performance over the last 24 hours highlights the space‚Äôs sheer volatility, with $298.5 million liquidated across long and short contracts. While institutional players continue to embrace Bitcoin, this surge reflects renewed confidence in the cryptocurrency‚Äôs role as a hedge against economic instability. The Bitcoin price climb has set the stage for an altcoin boom, with innovative projects like RCO Finance (RCOF) poised to ride the wave of bullish sentiment. As the Bitcoin price builds up toward the $120,000 mark, the race for the next breakout star intensifies, and RCOF‚Äôs explosive potential cannot be overlooked.

Sales of RCOF tokens have surged, crossing the $9 million milestone and boosting investor confidence in the project. The presale is currently in Stage 4, with each RCOF token priced at $0.0778. Users can also apply the code RCOF25 to receive an additional 25% in tokens with their purchase. With the anticipated listing price of $0.60, investors will gain over 700% ROI once the token hits the market. Analysts predict a 50,000% bull run as RCO Finance gains traction and expands its market presence. Investors participating in this presale will acquire tokens at a fraction of their anticipated future value and access exclusive benefits within the RCO Finance ecosystem. Holding RCOF altcoins grants users voting rights on key platform decisions and eligibility for community rewards exceeding $100,000. This creates an engaging environment where investors can actively participate in shaping the future of RCO Finance while reaping potential financial rewards. As the Bitcoin price aims for new heights in its rally, altcoins like RCO Finance are emerging as promising contenders ready to capture investor interest.

The altcoin is down by more than seven percent in the last seven days. XRP is still technically within a larger bull market, with no confirmed lower highs or lows on the weekly time frame. Over the last couple of weeks, XRP has experienced a short-term bearish trend within the larger bullish market. Price Prediction Currently, XRP is testing the support levels between $2.33 and $2.40. There is potential for a short-term bounce from this range, but if the price fails to hold above these levels, it may drop to the next support area between $2.00 and $2.23. If XRP manages to hold above $2.40, a break above the $2.62 level could trigger a rally toward $3.00 and possibly test the all-time highs near $3.25. Support and Resistance Levels The main resistance zone is between $2.90 and $3.00, which is the level to watch for potential price rejection. On the downside, the first key support lies between $2.33 and $2.40. If XRP drops below this level, the next support is between $2.00 and $2.23. The upper boundary of the trend channel is also acting as support. A break above this level could lead to a more aggressive breakout, but it will depend on how the price moves in the coming days. Analyst Weighs In According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, if XRP closes below $2.40, especially under $2.29, it could signal a drop toward support levels around $1.90. Strong support is found around $2, where previous resistance is now acting as new support. If XRP maintains this support, it could continue its upward movement. He said that XRP is showing possible signs of a reversal but lacks sufficient confirmation for a solid bullish breakout.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-15 04:04:43
