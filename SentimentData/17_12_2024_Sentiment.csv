This achievement sets the stage for the company’s operations under the name Bitpanda Broker MENA DMCC, marking its first foray outside the European market. Dubai’s growing prominence as a digital finance and innovation hub presents a strategic opportunity for Bitpanda to tap into the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region’s burgeoning crypto market. Bitpanda Goes Global! We’re proud to announce that we’ve secured In-Principle-Approval from the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority in the UAE. This achievement takes us one step closer to offering our full range of services in this fast-growing global hub for digital assets.… pic.twitter.com/09bBm2oJpG — Bitpanda (@Bitpanda_global) December 16, 2024 Bitpanda’s In-Principle Approval: Is UEA Growing Stronger? While this milestone is a critical step, the road to full operational approval involves further measures, including setting up a fully operational office in Dubai, onboarding a regional management team, and implementing VARA-compliant infrastructure to support its services. Eric Demuth, Co-Founder and CEO of Bitpanda, articulated the importance of this achievement, stating: “In Europe, we have established ourselves as the most trusted and regulated digital asset platform. Now, we are scaling this proven model globally, with Dubai and the UAE serving as our strategic launchpad for international expansion.” He continued; “The opportunities are immense, and we are uniquely positioned to seize them as both Europe’s leading crypto broker and a top infrastructure provider in the digital assets space.” VARA’s progressive regulatory framework emphasizes investor protection while fostering innovation, a balance that aligns seamlessly with Bitpanda’s compliance-first ethos. Fabian Reinisch, General Counsel of Bitpanda, also remarked: “Securing VARA’s in-principle approval in under eight months reflects the strength of VARA’s regulatory guidelines and our commitment to innovation and compliance.” With this latest regulatory compliance move, Bitpanda will increase user trust and facilitate sustained growth in the MENA region. Strategic Expansion into a Dynamic Region Bitpanda’s entry into the UAE forms part of its broader strategy to establish a global footprint in the crypto space. The opening of an office at the DMCC Crypto Centre in Dubai earlier this year laid the groundwork for this expansion. Additionally, Bitpanda has forged strategic partnerships with key financial institutions, including The National Bank of Ras Al Khaimah (RAKBANK) and CoinMENA , a prominent licensed crypto platform in the UAE. Dubai’s reputation as a forward-thinking hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation was a major factor in Bitpanda’s decision to expand into the region. Initiatives like the DMCC Crypto Centre and VARA’s regulatory framework make the UAE a magnet for digital finance innovators. Demuth also expressed confidence in the UAE’s potential, noting: “The UAE’s regulatory framework fosters innovation while prioritizing investor protection. These principles align perfectly with our mission to offer safe and trusted access to digital assets worldwide.” Bitpanda’s expansion has also been described as a strategic move to bridge the gap between Europe’s regulatory rigor and the UAE’s dynamic market. Bitpanda has been proactive in fostering innovation and collaboration as part of its global strategy. Its partnership with Societe Generale Forge , the blockchain subsidiary of Societe Generale, is a notable example. This collaboration focuses on advancing euro-denominated stablecoins, such as EUR CoinVertible (EURCV), as integral components of the global financial ecosystem. Looking ahead, Bitpanda plans to roll out Bitpanda Fusion , a high-volume trading product launched last week for advanced traders. This tool aggregates liquidity from major exchanges, catering to the needs of ambitious crypto traders in the MENA region. With all these moves, Bitpanda is on to something for the UAE and beyond.

Pharma Bro mentioned on the Shkreli Planet podcast that Saylor was drunk on the idea. Shkreli added that the situation was a big bubble that would not end well for the company. The asset management company introduced Bitcoin as its treasury reserve asset. Saylor described the digital asset as ‘digital gold’ and mentioned its stability as a store of value. The asset manager’s CEO further mentioned MicroStrategy’s plan to leverage BTC as a hedge against inflation. Michael Saylor also introduced the idea of BTC as a reserve currency for institutions in his Bitcoin playbook. Shkreli pointed out MicroStrategy’s plan to continuously purchase Bitcoin as part of the company’s business model. The asset management company first purchased BTC in 2020 worth $250 million to get 21,454. MicroStrategy made the most recent purchase of BTC worth $1.5 billion on December 15, increasing its holdings by 15,350 coins and bringing its total to 439,000 BTC. Pharma Bro also revealed during the discussion that he was shorting MicroStrategy stocks. Despite this claim, the investor did not reveal the size of his position. Shkreli added that his trade was a bit painful but fun. MicroStrategy stocks have still been rising despite Pharma Bro’s negative sentiment. MSTR has been up 490% this year, allowing the company to join the Nasdaq-100 index. Martin Shkreli says Saylor is not a favorable BTC advocate Shkreli further criticized Saylor’s advocacy for BTC. The investor suggested that the MicroStrategy CEO was not the best advocate for the currency despite being among the loudest. Shkreli also doubted Saylor’s commentary on BTC, citing a lack of credibility. The investor mentioned Saylor’s recent presentation to Microsoft shareholders. The MicroStrategy CEO shared his thoughts with the technology conglomerate on December 1. Saylor suggested that Bitcoin was the next technology wave, and Microsoft could not afford to miss it. The executive of the asset management firm suggested that Microsoft redirect its debt, stock buybacks, cash payouts, and other income sources toward BTC. Saylor further explained that the action could increase the company’s value by trillions while reducing investor and shareholder risks. Microsoft shareholders voted no to the proposal, citing reservations due to the coin’s volatility. However, the company’s board still highlighted that it would monitor developments in the BTC markets. Shkreli discussed the vote turnout, mentioning the 0.5% ‘yes’ vote and describing it as the worst proxy vote he had ever seen. The investor added that the negative outcome made him slightly bearish on BTC. Shkreli speculates on the BTC price outcome Pharma Bro speculated the outcome of BTC prices in relation to MicroStrategy’s cryptocurrency acquisitions. In his opinion, the coin’s price should have spiked after the billions of dollars the asset management company has injected into BTC purchases. Shkreli then speculated that the current price showed a bearish BTC sentiment. The investor insisted that his prediction did not mean the coin’s price would plunge. BTC has made notable steps, reaching a new all-time high of $107,104 today. The coin is trading 0.18% lower than the new ATH but over 3% higher than yesterday’s price. Despite the ongoing discussions, Shkreli further mentioned that he expected the U.S. to stockpile only a little BTC. Shkreli highlighted that the next government could undo the progress even if Trump’s government accumulates BTC. President-elect Donald Trump has been preparing to make Bitcoin the strategic reserve asset of the U.S. Treasury. Trump has also promised that the government will continue with significant BTC mining projects and acquisitions.

One Solana memecoin innovation, Fartcoin, recently captured attention with a staggering 220% rally, proving that altcoins can use humor to drive value. A leading Solana memecoin expert claims to have discovered another hidden gem: RCO Finance (RCOF) . Could this altcoin replicate or even surpass Fartcoin’s trajectory? Fartcoin: The Solana Memecoin That Redefined Viral Success Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) , a flatulence-themed token built on the Solana blockchain, has taken the Solana memecoin world by storm. Breaking its previous records, Fartcoin recently hit an all-time high of $0.52, catapulting its market cap to over $520 million. This explosive growth highlights the unpredictable power of Solana memecoins , which thrive on internet humor and community-driven momentum. Fueled by its absurd origin story, Fartcoin emerged from the Infinite Backrooms, where Solana’s Pump.fun launchpad transformed a whimsical AI-powered idea into a thriving token. With a 69% surge in just 24 hours and a 154% rise over the week, Fartcoin’s gains overshadow even broader crypto market trends. This Solana memecoin has captured attention, partly due to its simplicity and relatability, with slogans like “Hot air rises” becoming rallying cries for its community. As Fartcoin proves, the Solana memecoin market balances humor, speculation, and ROI, offering lessons for projects like RCO Finance (RCOF), which seek to replicate this rise with added utility.

The first on Markus’s list is Dogecoin, which is quite expected since he is one of its creators. DOGE was created as a meme coin but has since gained a lot of adoption and has a large community of users. The digital asset has also been endorsed by celebrities such as Elon Musk. On Dogecoin’s 11th anniversary on 6th December, Markus said that he did not expect the impact from the coin, which he initially conceived as a joke. He stated, ” it is extremely surreal that some silly thing I made in a few hours has had the impact on the world that it has.” Bitcoin, the first digital currency in the world, was also on the list. Markus recognized its historical significance and its position as one of the early players in the crypto industry. Avalanche and Ethereum highlight utility Markus selected Avalanche as the third one because it is fast and scalable, and more people are joining the protocol. Avalanche is a blockchain platform that is based on Ethereum and has been on the rise due to the fact that it allows for the operation of real world applications that are efficient. According to Markus, Ethereum made it to his list because of its performance in the area of smart contracts and dApps. He shared his experience of positive interactions with Ethereum as he engaged in business with NFTs and other projects. Although the high gas fees are still a problem of Ethereum, it is the most versatile and popular coin among other cryptocurrencies. Rounding out the list was Solana, which was hailed for its expanding ecosystem and investment effectiveness. Markus also pointed out that the platform had been used in many projects and has helped build its image as a significant competitor in the market. At the beginning of the year, Markus even challenged Solana and Ethereum communities to a memecoins-themed contest. When asked why he didn’t include XRP in the list of currencies he owns, Markus replied that he doesn’t own any XRP and jokingly said that he might if he receives some as a gift. i own 0 xrp if someone sent me a million dollars worth i would probably like it more — Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) December 16, 2024 Trusting crypto over tradition Besides these choices, Markus recently disclosed that he had a shift in the perception of cryptocurrencies in general. In a recent post on the X, he confessed to liking crypto more than ever before. i’m beginning to appreciate cryptocurrency so much more recently and not simply because of the price increases (though ngl that helps lol) — Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) December 7, 2024 Though prices have gone up, he stressed that there was a more fundamental cause. He believes in code supremacy over humans because, according to him, it is easier to bribe a human than to tamper with well audited code. One follower pointed out that crypto can help with high bank fees, and Markus agreed that banking deserves disruption. According to him, the more one understands conventional finance, the more compelling the case for crypto is. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $106,000, while Ethereum crossed $4,000. Dogecoin also became the seventh largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, trading at $0.4 before a slight decline.

The launch was carried out in partnership with Securitize, a leader in the tokenization of real-world assets. Ethena Labs Expands Stablecoin Use Cases: USDtb Considered for CEX Collateral and Tokenization According to the announcement on Monday, USDtb functions similarly to established fiat-backed stablecoins like USDC and USDT, maintaining a 1:1 reserve ratio using cash or cash-equivalent assets. The stablecoin allows unrestricted transfers, offering users flexibility and accessibility. Today we are launching our new stablecoin product, USDtb, backed by @BlackRock 's BUIDL Fund in partnership with @Securitize Read below for full details pic.twitter.com/mSf3mWv3oF — Ethena Labs (@ethena_labs) December 16, 2024 A distinguishing feature of USDtb is its scalability, made possible by BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, which constitutes 90% of USDtb’s reserves. The remaining 10% consists of stablecoins and institutional-grade tokenized U.S. Treasury products, facilitating redemptions and liquidity. This represents the highest allocation to BUIDL among any stablecoin currently on the market. Unlike Ethena’s other stablecoin, USDe, USDtb is an entirely independent product designed to meet diverse user needs and exchange requirements. Its distinct risk profile provides an alternative to USDe while also supporting USDe’s stability in challenging market conditions. Ethena’s Risk Committee recently approved a proposal to use USDtb as a backing asset for USDe . Ethena plans to reallocate assets from USDe to USDtb during negative funding rates to mitigate risks and improve resilience. USDtb leverages LayerZero technology, enabling seamless cross-chain transfers across multiple networks. At launch, USDtb will be available on Ethereum mainnet, Base, Solana, and Arbitrum. It will also be bridgeable via Stargate for enhanced interoperability. The stablecoin’s infrastructure has been extensively audited to ensure security and compliance. Leading auditors, including Quantstamp, Cyfrin, and Pashov, completed three full audits of the core USDtb smart contracts in October, with no high or medium-level vulnerabilities detected. Additionally, a community-driven audit by Code4rena reported no significant findings. Ethena has partnered with several prominent institutions to support USDtb’s launch. Copper, Zodia, Komainu, and Coinbase Web3 Wallet provide custody solutions. Liquidity providers include Jump, Cumberland, Wintermute, Amber, GSR, and SCB Limited. USDtb is also being evaluated for broader use cases. It is under consideration as margin collateral on centralized exchanges that have partnered with Ethena and for allocation in Spark’s $1 billion Tokenization Grand Prix. How USDtb’s Launch Expands Ethena’s Stablecoin Ecosystem and Boosts User Choice USDtb has been submitted for Spark’s $1 billion Tokenization Grand Prix, a competition to boost liquidity for tokenized assets. If selected, USDtb could see a significant increase in adoption and utility. Ethena’s proposal includes mechanisms for swapping between USDtb and USDe, potentially improving allocation strategies in response to market conditions. With USDtb’s launch, Ethena Labs aims to expand its stablecoin offerings while providing users with a diversified, secure, and scalable product. CoinGecko recently reported that Ethena’s USDe market capitalization surpassed $4.3 billion as of Nov. 29. CCData’s analysis attributes this growth to increased interest in the Ethena ecosystem, driven by its proposal to introduce revenue sharing for Ethena (ENA) token holders.

This stablecoin, designed to raise the bar for compliance, utility, and transparency, will officially go live on December 17, 2024. The wait is over: RLUSD launches globally tomorrow! https://t.co/mYcyyX6Vre — Ripple (@Ripple) December 16, 2024 According to the announcement , RLUSD promises to cater to institutional needs and set new standards for trust and reliability within the stablecoin market. The timing of this launch aligns with increasing calls for regulatory clarity in the United States and beyond. Ripple’s decision to develop RLUSD under the stringent New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) limited purpose trust charter highlights its emphasis on regulatory compliance. RLUSD is backed by U.S. dollar deposits, government bonds, and cash equivalents and is engineered to maintain stability. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, emphasized that RLUSD represents years of expertise in seamlessly integrating crypto with the traditional financial system. He furthered: “Early on, Ripple made a deliberate choice to launch our stablecoin under the NYDFS limited purpose trust company charter, widely regarded as the premier regulatory standard worldwide.” With platforms like Uphold, MoonPay, Archax, and CoinMENA set to host RLUSD initially and additional listings expected soon, the stablecoin’s global rollout is set for rapid traction because of the attention it has garnered. Ripple’s RLUSD: A New Standard for Stablecoins? Ripple’s strategy revolves around creating a stablecoin that meets and exceeds the expectations of financial institutions, regulators, and retail users. Each RLUSD token will be fully collateralized, ensuring stability and liquidity even in volatile markets. To reinforce this commitment, Ripple claimed it would publish third-party attestations of RLUSD’s reserves monthly, ensuring full accountability and fostering trust. From a functional perspective, RLUSD is set to play a critical role in various use cases. Institutions can leverage the stablecoin for instant settlement of cross-border payments, enhanced liquidity management, and seamless integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Ripple’s vision also extends to creating a reliable bridge between fiat currencies and the blockchain ecosystem, simplifying on-ramps and off-ramps for users navigating between the two worlds. Furthermore, RLUSD is set to be a cornerstone for collateralizing tokenized real-world assets, such as commodities and securities, on-chain. This innovative approach promises to drive the adoption of blockchain-based finance while maintaining robust compliance measures. Ripple’s Ripple Payments division is also set to incorporate RLUSD into its operations early next year, which could give it global relevance. Ripple Payments has already processed over $70 billion in transaction volume and established near-global coverage, spanning over 90 payout markets. This integration will expand RLUSD’s utility, enabling enterprises to settle international payments efficiently while enjoying blockchain technology’s cost-effectiveness and speed. Expert Leadership and Global Vision Ripple’s ambitious plans for RLUSD are bolstered by the expertise of its advisory board, which the addition of two financial heavyweights has further strengthened. Raghuram Rajan, former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, and Kenneth Montgomery, former First Vice President and COO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Despite all the massive preparations surrounding it, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has recently warned of potential supply shortages and price volatility for RLUSD . Despite its 1:1 parity with the dollar, pre-launch speculative activity has driven inflated bids for RLUSD, with one bid valuing 1 RLUSD at 511 XRP—over $1,200. Schwartz downplayed the anomaly, emphasizing that RLUSD’s price would stabilize near $1 once supply increases, and urged against speculation.

In a recent post , he shared that Cardano is on the brink of achieving what he calls a decentralized revolution. Charles explained that the project is nearing its final milestones—approval of a budget system and a community-ratified constitution—steps he believes will make the platform unstoppable. “It’s messy and tough,” he said of governance, “but it’s the only way to include everyone.” For Charlie, this is personal. “I’ll never apologize for being passionate about this outcome. It’s my life’s work.” Cardano’s roadmap has been long and complex, but with these developments, the project is eyeing 2025 as the year it reaches full decentralization. The stakes? Nothing less than taking over the blockchain world. Cardano’s Chang Hard Fork reshapes governance The Chang Hard Fork, launched on September 1, represents a turning point for Cardano. This major upgrade pushed the blockchain closer to its ultimate goal: a fully decentralized governance system. Key features included the introduction of a constitutional committee, improved on-chain voting mechanisms, and the much-anticipated rollout of Plutus v3, which brought more advanced smart contract capabilities. The constitutional committee, acting as an interim governing body, was designed to oversee governance decisions during this transitional phase. It’s temporary, though—once the community approves the ratified constitution, the committee will dissolve. From there, governance will rest entirely in the hands of ADA holders. Charles sees this as a step toward the Voltaire phase, the final stage of Cardano’s development roadmap. Voltaire envisions a blockchain that funds itself through a treasury system and gives ADA holders full control over its evolution. In Charlie’s words, these upgrades are not about short-term price movements but about “ensuring Cardano thrives in the long run.” The Chang upgrade also introduced Delegate Representatives (DReps), allowing ADA holders to vote indirectly through elected representatives. This system encourages wider participation while maintaining efficiency. ADA struggles in a volatile market While Cardano’s governance upgrades grab headlines, ADA’s market performance tells a different story. As of press time, ADA is trading at $0.934, down 3.26% in the past twenty-four hours. Despite the current downturn, investor sentiment remains strong. The Fear & Greed Index for ADA sits at 74, signaling greed. Over the past month, ADA has seen gains on 67% of trading days, showing some resilience even amid market uncertainty. Analysts predict ADA will continue to fluctuate, with a trading range of $0.934 to $1.10 expected for December. The average price is projected at $1.02, but much depends on broader market conditions, which is incredibly bullish thanks to incoming US president Donald Trump.

However, the year ended with Bitcoin surpassing $100K. Another notable growth is seen with Solana, which drove the meme coin market. Messari data analysts compiled a two-part report on the trends and narratives in the crypto industry in 2024. The report, authored by Messari’s enterprise analysts and experts, explored various themes, including the rise of artificial intelligence in the crypto sector . Messari analysts reflect on 2024 inflationary worries Messari calls 2024 the “climbing wall of worry” because inflation uncertainty left investors wondering if the Fed’s monetary policies would trigger a recession. However, 2024 concludes with Bitcoin surpassing $100K after the crypto market overcame the macro obstacles of a weakening labor market. Along with the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the report underlines AI as the 2024 highlight. The report read in part; “The market is beginning to price in the potential for AI-driven productivity boosts.” Messari also calls 2024 the year of Solana. The report underlined advancements in Solana’s technology and adoption, making it a hub for memecoin trading. In the year, memecoins themselves remained wildly popular, capturing retail interest. Notably, user adoption surged globally, with apps like Phantom and Polymarket onboarding millions. The analysts also discovered that stablecoins have also become essential in emerging markets. Meanwhile, decentralized infrastructure (DePIN) gained traction in industries like energy and telecommunications. The report also touched on regulatory challenges and market volatility. However, the report revealed that the industry showed resilience and innovation. In the macro context, the analysts noted that crypto market trends faced challenges such as lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase. They added that government asset sales and Mt.Gox repayments also played a part in the volatility experienced in 2024. Messari highlighted the pressures eased after Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. The analysts added the president pledged to protect innovation, self-custody, and Bitcoin mining. According to the researchers, these policies signalled a friendly environment for cryptocurrency that emphasized Bitcoin as an innovation driver and strategic asset. Messari analysts discuss crypto sectorial highlights in 2024 The researchers highlighted some sectorial advancements, including the intersection of artificial intelligence and the crypto ecosystem. The analysts reported the intersection exposed the crypto ecosystem to content creation and gaming frontiers. Messari analysts also confirmed that NFTs gained popularity in 2024, especially in enhancing monetization and digital ownership. The analysts predicted that these trends would drive the adoption of cryptocurrencies in the years ahead. Messari also commented on the introduction of Bitcoin stalking in 2024. They added that Babylon, BTC’s first stalking protocol, enabled holders to stake their assets and earn rewards without giving up control of their assets. In the report, Messari predicted that even as the BTC network changes, BTC programmability and stalking remain nascent. The analysts highlighted the path worth monitoring as layers on BTC and AVSs.They predicted these could unlock the utmost levels of economic security and decentralization. However, the analysts disclosed that in 2024, users often preferred the performance capabilities of networks such as Base and Solana. They added that users overlooked decentralization and security. The researchers warned BTC builders could have difficulty competing against other networks if the trend continued.

Crypto Bitlord claimed that the real price target for XRP is not $6 as some commentators said but $589, adding that those who dismissed this three-figure target are not ambitious enough. You’re not delusional enough with your price targets $XRP $589 — Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7) December 16, 2024 The crypto analyst argued that the prices being forecast by several market observers are conservative estimates, believing that $589 per unit is very feasible. Previously, Crypto Bitlord had already stated that XRP would reach the three-figure price. However, he received derogatory remarks from investors for what they claimed as an ambitious dream. Now, with the crypto asset performing very well in the bull market, Crypto Bitlord was able to fire back at them, calling them not “delusional” enough. Smoking Crack? Several traders in the XRP community do not share the same vision as Crypto Bitlord, seeing the target of $589 as not feasible. Earlier this month, another crypto analyst, Tony Edwards, downplayed the $589 target, saying that the target is a “fantasy.” Edward argued that astronomical price predictions for the coin are delusional, saying, “People calling for $589, $1,000, or $10,000 are “smoking crack.” My $XRP price target for this cycle $5-$8. It could go a bit higher but I’m gonna play it safe and be conservative.

Edward estimated the price rally would put XRP between $5 and $8. Altcoin Performing Well Data revealed that XRP benefits greatly from the ongoing crypto bull market driven by Donald Trump reclaiming the White House.

The failed exchange confirmed this in an announcement today while also updating its claims portal. According to the information on the claim portal , creditors can also receive their bankruptcy payouts in stablecoins. This will be possible for creditors by converting their fiat for digital assets, including stablecoins. FTX Distribution Portal (Source: X) Meanwhile, both BitGo and Kraken have confirmed their partnership. In its announcement, BitGo noted that FTX retail users could reclaim their funds securely via its platform. The firm’s CEO, Mike Belshe, noted that it is proud to support FTX. He said: “With our long-standing reputation as the most secure choice in the industry, we work hard to bring institutional-grade service to both retail and institutional clients, ensuring users the peace of mind they need to manage and grow their assets safely.” As for Kraken , it confirmed the agreement in a blog post, stating it will assist the FTX and its affiliated debtors with distributing their recoveries in supported jurisdictions. The exchange noted that this is not its first rodeo, as it was also involved in the Mt Gox distributions in 2024. While FTX has already chosen two firms to distribute payouts to customers, the Claims Portal shows that the bankrupt exchange intends to select a third. The space for the third distribution partner currently says “ Upcoming Distribution Agent. More information to come soon.” The choice of the two distribution partners is already raising concerns in some quarters. Users in jurisdictions where BitGo and Kraken do not operate are worried about how they will be able to process their claims and get their repayments. FTX picks January 3, 2025, as effective date The announcement of distribution partners marks another major step in repaying the exchange’s creditors. With that decision, FTX has also picked January 3, 2025, as the effective date for its Chapter 11 Reorganization plan. This means that FTX will have to make the initial distributions to its customers within 60 days of that date. Based on the plan approved by the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware in October, 98% of the FTXE creditors in the convenience class and fall within the convenience class will get their initial distribution within this period. Creditors in this category are scheduled to receive 119% of their allowed claims based on the value of the customers’ crypto holdings as of November 2022, when the exchange filed for bankruptcy. All they need to do is meet the distribution requirements. FTX CEO John Ray III described the whole process up to this point as a reflection of the bankruptcy estate’s outstanding work and its efforts to recover assets. He said: “We are well positioned to begin executing the distribution of recoveries back to all customers and creditors and encourage customers to complete the necessary steps to begin receiving distributions in a timely manner.” Meanwhile, creditors in other classes of claims might still have to wait much longer before they can start receiving their repayments. FTX noted that it will announce payment dates for them soon. FTX recovers $35 million from Gate.io While the bankruptcy estate is working on commencing distribution, recovery efforts remain underway, and some are already yielding. After filing an adversary lawsuit against the Gate.io exchange in November to recover $40 million, on-chain transactions show that around $35 million has been returned to the FTX-controlled wallet. This marks another recovery after the exchange received around $14 million from several political action committees and campaign groups a few days ago. However, it remains locked in a dispute over claims with some creditors, such as Three Arrows Capital and Crypto.com. The professionals involved in the bankruptcy proceedings have also been criticized for the amount of money spent on the reorganization plan. Between May and July 2024, the bankruptcy professional fees were $98.5 million , with the financial advisor Alvarez & Marsal and legal counsel Sullivan & Cromwell being the top earners within that period.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe (PEPE) prices dip as Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) storms the stage with a record-breaking $25M presale. Table of Contents DOGE progress stalls PEPE hopping into trouble Next 100x meme coin: Wall Street Pepe hits $25M in presale Throughout 2024, crypto enthusiasts have been speculating about and passionately debating the meme coin supercycle, and how long it could last. While many meme coins saw price growth as Bitcoin broke past $100,000, the likes of Dogecoin and Pepe have since dipped, with DOGE down 10% on the weekly chart and PEPE down 14%. However, a brand-new meme coin – Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) – has raised $25m in a very short period. This is an incredible achievement that marks WEPE as one of the fastest-growing presales, a clear sign that the meme coin supercycle still has a lot of staying power. DOGE progress stalls From the chart below, DOGE bulls will be keeping an eye on DOGE’s ascending triangle. However, at this point, DOGE has spent over a week dipping towards the green diagonal trend line – and if the price breaks through it, traders and investors will turn their attention to the support levels below. Two psychological price levels stand out due to high wicks emerging from a couple of past daily candles. These are $0.30 and $0.22 – and if the DOGE price falls to $0.22 from its current value, that will be a dip of approximately 44%. Even though we are in a bull market and the meme coin supercycle theory remains plausible, all market cycles involve dips and corrections as well as pumps and other bullish movements. So, although $0.30 might prove a sufficiently strong support level to enable a bounce and bullish continuation, $0.22 is a good level to look at for investors who want to buy DOGE at a heavy discount. In the event of a dip, it’s likely to take some time – perhaps several weeks or a few months – before the DOGE price recovers and goes beyond $0.485. You might also like: PEPU surges 400% 2 days after IEO, viral WEPE to surge next PEPE hopping into trouble PEPE followed Dogecoin’s pump with a delay of a couple of days. Since that time, PEPE traders and investors have shown a lot less confidence in this token’s ability to sustain its higher price – and this is reflected in the high degree of chop in the chart below, as well as a notable tendency for dips to form and activate very quickly. Since DOGE dipped, PEPE has chopped with even more intensity, rather than falling too far down. Looking at Pepe’s trading volume, a much sharper drop-off in volume is seen over the last few days. This means that this intense chop is being driven by very little trading volume – which could be a sign of manipulation driven by algorithms and trading AIs. Taking a bullish perspective, just like DOGE, PEPE is located within an ascending triangle. However, the trendline that forms the support level for that triangle is quite steep – and that generally indicates weaker support and a high likelihood of a large dip if the support level is broken. From there, it’s quite a long way down (almost -35%) to the next strongest support level at $0.000015. Because of the high degree of recent chop, such a bearish move might take some time to reach its target – but it could easily get there before bouncing and moving into a new bullish phase. Overall, DOGE and PEPE are currently showing significant weakness, with a strong possibility of large dips ahead. Fortunately, it’s not all doom and gloom for meme coin traders as a new presale project is showing huge potential. Next 100x meme coin: Wall Street Pepe hits $25M in presale With so much potentially bearish uncertainty swirling through the crypto markets, projects that are achieving massive success under these conditions really stand out. Wall Street Pepe is one such project, and has already raised $25m in the first two weeks of its presale stage. Wall Street Pepe was created to empower degens across the crypto space with the skills and tools they need to get ahead. From alpha calls to key trading insights and strategic advantages, the WEPE army is already one of the fastest-growing meme coin communities. The token also offers staking – and can be staked during the presale stage, with current estimated rewards of 47% PA. Over at 99Bitcoins, a crypto analyst has completed a deep dive into Wall Street Pepe, and found it to be incredibly promising: Very few meme coins are designed to provide their community members with any utility at all – let alone actionable trading advice and the knowledge required to make money from crypto. Another frog meme coin, Pepe Unchained, saw gains of over 600% after its launch last week following a $60M+ presale, and Wall Street Pepe could be set for similar gains.

The memecoin reached an all-time high of $0.891 earlier this morning, before retracing to $0.78, reflecting a 137% increase in the past 30 days, according to CoinGecko data. . The spike led to a market capitalization of over $850 million, less than $150 million shy of crossing the $1 billion threshold. This growth is a significant achievement for the comedic cryptocurrency, which has gained traction through strong community support after AI agent Truth Terminal birthed the idea of Fartcoin, and the memecoin space took advantage of the opportunity to create the token. The rapid rise of Fartcoin underscores a growing trend in the cryptocurrency market where humor, community engagement, and viral appeal are driving value creation.

Chill Pepe (CHILPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CHILPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Chill Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Chill Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Chill Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Chill Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Chill Pepe by entering its contract address – AfPftBmzfb2pan4Drt2ZKgT7VK5Rn7CLQHpp8DpLhXZj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CHILPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-16 23:58:00

The Bitcoin miner used the additional proceeds from its coupon-convertible bond issue to acquire 667 BTC at $101,135 per token, bringing its total BTC holding to 17,429 BTC. Riot generated a BTC Yield Per Share of 37.2% YTD and 36.7% QTD through the recent Bitcoin acquisition and mining production YTD. Its total Bitcoin holding is currently worth $1.8B at the average market price of $103,873. Riot Platforms closes convertible senior notes offering With the additional proceeds from Riot’s upsized $594 million, 0.75% coupon convertible bond issue, the Company has acquired 667 BTC at an average price of $101,135 per BTC.

(@RiotPlatforms) December 16, 2024 According to Riot Platforms, the aggregate principal amount of the 2030 Notes sold in the offering included $69.4 million relating to the partial exercise of the initial purchasers’ option. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2030 Notes were approximately $579.2 million after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts, commissions, and estimated offering expenses payable by Riot. The Bitcoin miner disclosed that the 2030 Notes were sold in a private offering only to persons reasonably deemed qualified institutional buyers per the Securities Act. All the net proceeds were swiftly deployed to additional Bitcoin acquisition. According to Stock Titan, successfully completing the convertible notes offering represented a huge capital raise for Riot. The convertible structure provided flexibility for future equity conversion while minimizing immediate dilution. Investors should, however, note that the substantial BTC acquisition exposed Riot to increased crypto volatility, although the low interest rate indicated favorable market conditions. The 2030 maturity period also provided a lengthy runway for the company’s growth strategy. Riot’s capital raise marked one of the most significant fundraising events recently in the crypto mining sector. It signalled strong institutional confidence in the company’s business model and demonstrated Riot’s commitment to future operational expansion. Riot Platforms doubles down on Bitcoin with substantial additional acquisition On December 9th, Riot announced its intention to use all proceeds from the offering to purchase more Bitcoin, and it carried through with its plan by acquiring 667 BTC on December 16th. The company had already used a portion of the offering net proceeds to accumulate over 5K BTC between December 10th and 12th. Riot Platforms increased its BTC holding to 17,429, suggesting plans to expand its Bitcoin reserve significantly and potentially impacting its financial strategy. The Bitcoin mining company acquired and held Bitcoin to enhance stockholder value. Riot reported its BTC Yield KPI indicating a quarter-to-date Yield of 36.7% and a year-to-date Yield of 37.2%. According to Riot Platforms, the BTC Yield KPI could only be used by pro-level investors to supplement their understanding of the company’s decision to fund the purchase of Bitcoin by issuing additional shares of its common stock. Riot emphasized that the BTC Yield KPI was not equivalent to ‘yield’ in the traditional financial context since it could not be used as an operating performance or liquidity measure. InvestingPro analysts anticipated that the recent BTC acquisitions would push Riot’s revenue growth to 32% in 2024. InvestingPro data further showed that the company maintained a strong balance sheet with more cash than debt and a healthy current ratio of 5.86x. Recent stock performance was also strong, with a 16% return over the past week and 23% over six months.

Market analysts studying each crypto sector closely say Chainlink (LINK) is the altcoin to watch and believe Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) is poised to become a top Solana memecoin in 2025. However, regarding the best cryptos to buy now, experts say anyone looking for substantial profits by January has more to gain from the PropiChain (PCHAIN) presale. PropiChain is ushering in the Web3 real estate revolution, and PCHAIN, its native token, is projected for an outstanding 23,902% run . Should Your Portfolio Include Chainlink (LINK) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN)? While altcoins like XRP, ETH, and ADA stole the spotlight over the past month, many failed to notice the silent Chainlink (LINK) rally that was taking place. Some now even consider LINK one of the best-performing altcoins of Q4, considering that the Chainlink price at $28.62 today is up across the past week (13.28%), month (116.22%), and year (91.54%). This is even more true for Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) over in the Solana memecoin sector. Barely two months since its CMC listing, the Fartcoin price has surged 238.54%, 187.35%, and 948.26% to $0.5921 over the past week, month, and all-time, respectively. However, the problem with Chainlink (LINK) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) remains the same for investors. Despite being good portfolio options, their surging prices offer diminished gains and potential losses for investors who purchase today, leaving the search for the best altcoins to buy now still wide open. PropiChain: The RWA Altcoin Outpacing Chainlink (LINK) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) If you’re a crypto community member or pay any attention to Web3 news, you’ve likely heard about the PropiChain (PCHAIN) presale , which recently concluded round one after raising over $1.4 million. While it’s not uncommon in a hype-fueled industry, PropiChain’s early success with investors can be attributed to its breakthrough blockchain solutions for the $600T real estate industry. Unlike competing solutions focusing on a single industry problem, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is introducing the first-ever full-service platform for checkmating global property fraud, eliminating the financial investing barrier, providing unlimited market access, and allowing for super-convenient digital asset management. These are all problems the industry has been trying to fix for many years. Still, PropiChain is finally making it possible with blockchain, RWA tokenization, metaverse, smart contracts, and artificial intelligence technologies. Among these technologies, blockchain is most important as it enables PropiChain to tokenize real estate, provides an impervious vault for storing tokens, and allows for smart-contract-based property management. PropiChain is finally bringing RWA tokenization to real estate, but what might seem like a simple technological advancement can reshape the entire industry. First, tokenization will allow for fractional ownership in real estate , thereby making it possible to trade digitized properties in unlimited fractions and prices. But this digitization will also bring liquidity to real estate by allowing for instant property transactions instead of the 44-day average it currently takes. We’ll witness unprecedented access to the market with fractional ownership and digitization, but PropiChain is taking it a step further with its interactive metaverse marketplace. Experts believe that by letting users take virtual tours, hosting virtual meetings, and staging assets virtually, PropiChain will become a major property trading platform. Yet, things only get more interesting with PropiChain’s smart contracts for property management and artificial intelligent tools for investors. On PropiChain, smart contracts can handle property rights transfers and manage rental agreements with features such as auto asset leasing, auto-renewals, and auto rent payment collections. Furthermore, PCHAIN holders can make data-driven investment decisions and even automate the investing process with AI tools that can personalize property search, derive assets’ true value using real-time metrics, and automatically trade properties when their value drops or rises above a pre-specified amount. Chainlink (LINK) vs. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) vs. PropiChain (PCHAIN): Which to Buy? Chainlink (LINK), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), and PropiChain (PCHAIN) are three undervalued altcoins on investors’ watchlists today. However, its PCHAIN investors pick for the highest profits in this generation’s bull cycle. Unlike Chainlink and Fartcoin, offering modest gains and potential for significant losses from sharp price corrections, analysts project PropiChain (PCHAIN) for an astonishing 23,902% run by Q1 2025, outperforming LINK, FARTCOIN and most crypto markets. PropiChain Presale: Round Two Begins after Raising Over $1.4 Million Many already consider PropiChain (PCHAIN) the hottest new crypto after round one of its presale raised $1.4 million weeks after launch. Understandably, investors rushed to acquire a stake in the real estate Web3 revolution at its lowest-ever price. While round one is already gone, interested investors can still participate in round two of the presale , now selling PCHAIN at $0.011, the cheapest it’ll ever be again. However, round two is already moving quicker than the first as its early success signals investors of the best crypto presale project to invest in. The project’s BlockAudit security audit and PropiChain CoinMarketCap listing also have a hand to play after massively driving traffic following their announcements. Although a generous 291% profits await round-two investors by the final stage in the coming weeks, most are looking ahead as today’s investment of $1,500 can yield a staggering $360,030 by Q1 2025 when PCHAIN completes its 23,902% run. But remember, PropiChain is breezing through round two, and investors might miss this chance just as they missed round one.

As 2025 approaches, investors are searching for the best altcoins to buy in the US. Analysts have highlighted three promising altcoins— RCO Finance (RCOF) , TRON (TRX), and Cardano (ADA)—as potential high-risers by January 1. Can these tokens deliver the best altcoins to buy in the US? 1. RCO Finance RCO Finance stands out with its advanced robo-advisor, which provides a more efficient approach than traditional human market analysis. This tool scans the markets, reviews projects, and identifies trends that need to be included manually. Investors can now access insights and predictions that make decision-making easier. Experts who have used the AI tool say the robo-advisor predicts outcomes and creates customized portfolios based on each investor’s goals and risk tolerance. This personalized service helps investors make more informed decisions and aligns trades with their strategies. RCO Finance’s robo-advisor acts like a financial consultant thanks to its machine-learning algorithms. It offers real-time recommendations, telling users when to buy, sell, or diversify their assets based on specific patterns. This feature gives users a clear advantage in decision-making and ensures they are always one step ahead. Beyond the robo-advisor, RCO Finance offers access to the best altcoins to buy in the US. The platform has 120,000 digital assets across 12,500 categories, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, bonds, ETFs, and real-world assets (RWAs). This wide selection lets users diversify their portfolios and manage risk. Very importantly, in an age of increasing emphasis on security, RCO Finance takes security seriously. It has completed a smart contract audit with SolidProof, a leading blockchain security firm. The audit confirms the platform’s commitment to transparency and the safety of user assets. 2. TRX Justin Sun declared TRX the “Next XRP” on X (previously Twitter). This has sparked much curiosity in the crypto world, especially given XRP’s recent surge, spurred by legal updates, ETF registrations, and favorable news about Ripple. Sun’s posts, including “TRX = XRP” have captured the attention of the Tron and XRP community and the larger market, speculating that TRX will follow XRP’s trend. TRX boasts one of the blockchains’ highest active user bases, thanks to its seamless integration with popular platforms, and currently trades at about $0.2893. Analysts believe TRON is on the cusp of a major price breakout, making it one of the best altcoins to consider before January 1. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu experts believe that TRX could rise to about $0.7788 to become the best altcoins to buy in the US. With its solid foundation and growing adoption, TRX is a reliable option for long-term investors seeking steady growth. 3. Cardano The Cardano Foundation’s social media platform X account appears to have been compromised in the early hours of December 8, causing fake news to spread throughout the cryptocurrency community. A series of messages from the account indicated that ADA tokens would undergo significant changes, such as stopping trade and token burns. One message claimed that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had filed a lawsuit against the Cardano Foundation. At a current price of $1.10, ADA has a strong developer ecosystem and an active community that continues to drive its adoption. With its ongoing upgrades and partnerships, Cardano is poised for significant growth in 2025. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu analysts predict that the price of Cardano could rise by 22.49% and reach $ 1.34 by January 1. Cardano stands out as a top contender for investors looking for a secure yet high-potential crypto. RCOF Becomes The Best Altcoins to Buy in the US Ahead of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Dogecoin and Shiba Inu analysts are predicting a staggering 1000x return for early investors that would capitalize on the $0.077 selling price of RCOF during the ongoing stage 4 of the presale. Imagine turning a $5 investment into $5,000—a life-changing opportunity that is well within reach if you act now. Experts say RCOF is one of the best altcoins to buy in the US due to its post-launch potential. After the launch at the $0.4 to $0.6 price range, experts expect a further 5,000% surge. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are strong contenders with their robust ecosystems and promising growth trajectories, RCOF’s presale offers unparalleled potential for explosive gains. There’s no better time to invest as the token price increases with each presale stage. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the next big crypto success story.

As XRP and Cardano navigate uncertain growth, XYZVerse emerges with the potential to shake up the 2025 crypto market. Table of Contents The all-sports meme token ready to make its play XRP Cardano Conclusion Investors are questioning whether established cryptocurrencies like XRP and Cardano (ADA) can maintain their upward momentum in a rapidly evolving market. Meanwhile, new tokens are emerging, promising to disrupt the status quo and offer fresh opportunities for growth. One such contender is XYZVerse (XYZ), a meme coin that bridges sports enthusiasm and crypto culture, aiming to redefine community engagement and market dynamics. The all-sports meme token ready to make its play As XRP and Cardano work to sustain their growth, newcomers like XYZVerse are emerging to challenge the status quo. Bridging sports enthusiasm with the viral power of meme coins, XYZ is positioned as a transformative token that combines community engagement with growth potential. XYZ is more than just another meme coin – it’s an exclusive VIP pass to a sports-driven, meme-powered ecosystem. Think of it as the MVP of the XYZVerse platform, where investors can capitalize on the skyrocketing demand for meme coins. Polymarket hit $1 billion in trading volume during the U.S. presidential election. Imagine pairing that with the hype of meme coins and the excitement of sports betting. With millions of sports fans ready to participate, the XYZVerse ecosystem is primed for expansion, offering slam-dunk rewards for early adopters. Meme coins are dominating the 2024 crypto landscape, and XYZ is ready to crush the competition. With projected thousand-fold returns and a 9,900% growth target by the Token Generation Event (TGE), XYZ is set to outperform rivals like BOME (5,000% rise) and WIF (1,000% rally). Upcoming listings on major CEX and DEX platforms, audited smart contracts, and a vetted team ensure that XYZVerse is a secure and promising investment. The first-mover advantage is critical here – those who get in before the crowd storms the field could see unmatched returns. Intrigued investors can get XYZ via presale and be part of its crypto championship. XRP XRP has experienced significant growth over the past six months, soaring by 379.42%. In the last month, it surged 122.42%, marking a remarkable uptrend. Currently trading between $2.20 and $2.58, XRP is hovering around its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $2.42 and $2.40 respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 51.94, suggesting that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic indicator is at 37.97, reinforcing a neutral market position. Looking ahead, XRP faces its nearest resistance at $3.30. A breakthrough could propel it toward the next resistance level of $4.03. On the downside, immediate support lies at $1.83, with a secondary support at $1.09 if bearish momentum continues. You might also like: AI predicts XRP surpassing ETH this cycle — but the real crypto winner could be XYZ Cardano Over the past week, Cardano has seen a price increase of 7.07%. In the last month, ADA has surged by 48.08%, and over six months, it has climbed by 170.90%. The current price ranges between $1.06 and $1.33, showing significant movement in a short period. Technical indicators suggest potential for further growth. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 54.78, indicating neutral momentum. The stochastic oscillator is at 82.14, which is nearing the overbought zone. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is slightly negative at -0.00015329, hinting at a possible bullish reversal. If ADA breaks above the nearest resistance level of $1.46, it could aim for the second resistance at $1.73, representing an increase of approximately 30%. On the downside, if it falls below the nearest support at $0.923, it might test the second support at $0.653, a potential decrease of about 40%. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close at $1.08 and $1.10, suggesting consolidation before the next major move.

From Dogecoin’s meteoric rise to Shiba Inu’s multi-billion-dollar ecosystem, meme coins have proven they’re more than just jokes. Enter BTFD Coin, the latest buzz in the meme coin universe, poised to redefine what these digital assets can do. With its play-to-earn (P2E) game , lucrative staking rewards, and vibrant community, BTFD Coin is already making waves—and it’s just getting started. The presale for BTFD Coin (BTFD) , which went live on November 26, 2024, has quickly captured the attention of crypto investors. With over $4 million raised in just a few weeks, BTFD’s presale performance is nothing short of legendary. Analysts predict BTFD’s price will skyrocket once listed at $0.0006 per coin. But what makes this meme coin so special? And how does it stack up against heavyweights like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? Let’s dive deep into why BTFD Coin, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu are the best meme coins to invest in right now and what sets them apart in the ever-growing crypto market. BTFD Coin: The Future of Meme Coins Is Here BTFD Coin’s presale is one of the hottest crypto events of 2024. In just a few weeks, it’s surged through 12 presale stages, raising over $4 million and selling more than 55 billion coins. What’s driving this success? A combination of innovative features and community-driven hype. BTFD’s presale kicked off at an eye-popping price of $0.000004 per coin. By Stage 5, the price had risen to $0.00005. Fast forward to Stage 12, and it’s now sitting at $0.00013 per coin. Once the presale concludes, BTFD will launch at $0.0006 per coin, offering early investors potentially massive returns. To illustrate: if you had invested $5,000 during Stage 5, you would have snagged 100 million BTFD coins. By the time the coin hits $0.0006, your investment would be worth a whopping $60,000. That’s a 12x return—not bad for a coin that’s just getting started! BTFD Coin isn’t just about numbers, though. Its ecosystem is packed with features to keep users engaged. The P2E game, which integrates $BTFD rewards, is already being hailed as a game-changer. Players can earn tokens while having fun, creating a win-win scenario. On top of that, staking rewards incentivise long-term holding, ensuring a steady price trajectory. Combine this with a strong community of over 5,600 holders, and you’ve got a recipe for success. BTFD also benefits from its tongue-in-cheek branding. “Buy the F***ing Dip” isn’t just a slogan; it’s a mindset. This meme coin embraces market volatility, turning it into an opportunity for its investors. With analysts projecting significant gains post-launch, the FOMO around BTFD is real. Don’t miss your chance to get in early on this trailblazing meme coin. Dogecoin: The OG Meme Coin That Started It All When it comes to meme coins, Dogecoin is the undisputed king. Launched in 2013 as a joke, it’s now a household name, thanks in part to its playful Shiba Inu mascot and high-profile endorsements from the likes of Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s rise to fame wasn’t just luck; it’s backed by a passionate community that believes in its potential as a decentralised currency for everyday use. In 2021, Dogecoin hit its all-time high of $0.74, catapulting it into the crypto elite. While its price has since cooled off, Dogecoin remains a favourite among meme coin investors. Its transaction speed and low fees make it a practical choice for microtransactions and tipping. Plus, with Musk recently hinting at integrating Dogecoin into X (formerly Twitter), there’s renewed optimism about its future. But Dogecoin isn’t without its challenges. Critics argue that its lack of utility and unlimited supply could hinder long-term growth. Still, its resilience and ability to weather market downturns make it a strong contender. For those looking for a relatively stable meme coin with a proven track record, Dogecoin remains a solid bet. While newer meme coins like BTFD offer innovative features, Dogecoin’s simplicity and charm continue to win hearts. It’s not just a coin; it’s a cultural phenomenon. And in the world of meme coins, that’s priceless. Shiba Inu: The “Doge Killer” with Big Ambitions Shiba Inu burst onto the scene in 2020, branding itself as the “Doge Killer.” What started as a joke quickly evolved into a multi-faceted ecosystem. Shiba Inu isn’t just a meme coin; it’s an entire universe, complete with its own decentralised exchange (ShibaSwap), NFTs, and a metaverse project in the works. In 2021, Shiba Inu made headlines when its price skyrocketed by over 70,000,000%, turning early investors into millionaires. Today, Shiba Inu continues to innovate, expanding its ecosystem to include real-world applications. For instance, the upcoming Shibarium layer-2 solution promises faster and cheaper transactions, making $SHIB more appealing for everyday use. One of Shiba Inu’s standout features is its deflationary model. A significant portion of $SHIB tokens is regularly burned, reducing supply and potentially increasing demand. This sets it apart from Dogecoin’s inflationary model and positions it as a long-term investment option. While Shiba Inu’s price is nowhere near its 2021 peak, its robust ecosystem and active community make it a strong contender in the meme coin space. For investors seeking a meme coin with serious utility and growth potential, Shiba Inu is worth a closer look. Conclusion: Join the BTFD Revolution Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu are the best meme coins to invest in right now. Each offers unique features and growth potential, but BTFD Coin stands out as the most exciting opportunity. With its explosive presale performance, innovative P2E game, and strong community backing, BTFD is poised to take the meme coin world by storm. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this revolution. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your spot in one of the hottest crypto investments of 2024. This is your chance to buy the dip—and ride the wave to the moon.

Bulls have reversed the negative sentiment, driving the price to a seven-day high of $7.08, marking a 12% increase in the past day and a 25% rise over the last 30 days.

Additionally, the 24-hour trading volume jumped by 142% to $583.99 million. Analysts now predict that RUNE could see a price increase of over 125% in the near term. Will Thorchain Price Soar 125%? The recent price rally has brought renewed attention to Thorchain (RUNE) as market activity intensified significantly. The cryptocurrency’s 24-hour trading volume increased to $583.99 million, representing a surge of 142%, reflecting heightened buying interest. Concurrently, the market capitalization also saw a 12.02% rise, solidifying Thorchain’s growing market position at $2.39 billion. Open interest in RUNE futures has also gained traction, increasing by 16.19% to $114.97 million. This rise indicates growing optimism among investors as bullish sentiment dominates the market. The uptick in both trading volume and open interest suggests that traders and buyers are actively positioning themselves for potential upward moves in RUNE’s price. Analysts see this strong momentum as an indicator of continued price growth. Cryptocurrency analyst Javon Marks commented on the current trend, stating, “$RUNE (THORChain) has an upside target of approximately $15.75, representing a potential increase of over 125%.” Technical Indicators Confirm Bullish Sentiment RUNEUSD technical indicators also point to sustained bullish momentum for the token. On the 4hr price chart, Thorchain price broke out of an ascending triangle pattern.which often signals of an impending upward price breakout. The breakout occurred when RUNE’s price crossed the $6.50 resistance level, leading to a significant upward surge. Following the breakout, the bulls have maintained control, driving the Thorchain price above $7. Analysts consider the breakout confirmation a strong sign of buyer dominance. RUNE/USD 4hr price chart (source: TradingView) The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator further supports this bullish sentiment. The MACD line recently crossed above the signal line, signaling the start of a potential upward trend. Concurrently, the histogram bars, which have turned green, show that buyer momentum is building as the MACD diverges upward. In addition, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 62.03, which indicates a bullish zone without the risk of being overbought. The indicator peaked at 75 during the recent rally, before slightly retreating, showing that buyers are still active without pushing the price into overbought conditions. Subsequently, this balance suggests there could be more upward movement for Thorchain price if current momentum is maintained.

XRPL Validator, VET, recently shared valuable tips for beginners interested in setting up their nodes. This article outlines the key points from VET’s post to provide a comprehensive understanding of the process and its benefits. What is an XRP Ledger (XRPL) Node? An XRP Ledger (XRPL) node is essentially a computer running the XRPL software, known as “rippled.” These nodes connect to the XRP Ledger network by establishing peer connections with other nodes. This interaction forms a decentralized network that processes transactions and maintains the ledger’s integrity. There are several types of XRPL nodes, each serving distinct purposes based on their configuration: Validators: Nodes that validate transactions and add them to the ledger. Stock Nodes: Designed for standard use, such as querying balances, submitting transactions, and sharing ledger data. Full History Nodes : Nodes that store the complete history of the XRPL. Pathfinding Nodes: Nodes optimized for finding payment paths. Why Run a Node? Running an XRPL node comes with several significant benefits. First, it provides independence, allowing users to eliminate reliance on third-party wallet providers or exchanges that typically run nodes to submit transactions. By operating your own node, you ensure uninterrupted access to the ledger at all times. Additionally, running a node contributes directly to the XRPL network by supporting the dissemination and validation of ledger data, strengthening the overall system. Finally, maintaining a personal node enhances security and control by reducing dependence on potentially vulnerable third-party infrastructure. Setting Up an XRP Ledger Node: Basic Requirements To get started, you’ll need a few essential components. A standard laptop or PC will suffice as the primary hardware, paired with a stable internet connection. While VET recommends speeds above 200 Mbps for optimal performance, lower speeds may still work in certain situations. Additionally, you’ll need the XRPL software, known as “rippled,” which can be downloaded directly from the official XRPL documentation. Hardware Specifications: The hardware requirements for running a node are relatively modest. While the official XRPL documentation suggests higher specifications, VET notes that 32GB DDR3 RAM and a basic CPU should suffice for non-intensive use. Operating System: Linux is the recommended operating system for running “rippled.” For users unfamiliar with Linux, VET suggests using Docker , a platform that simplifies the setup process. A video guide on this approach is forthcoming. Overcoming Challenges: Setting up and maintaining a node may seem daunting, particularly for those unfamiliar with command-line interfaces. However, with available resources and support from the XRP community , many beginners have successfully navigated the process. Resources and Support: The XRPL documentation provides a detailed installation guide for Linux users, accessible here . Additionally, experienced members of the XRP community, including VET, are available to answer questions and provide guidance. Running an XRPL node is an excellent way for individuals to contribute to the network, enhance their control over their transactions, and gain deeper insights into blockchain technology. While the setup process may require effort and learning, the long-term benefits of independence, security, and community engagement make it a worthwhile endeavor. Those interested in getting started should leverage the resources and support available within the XRPL ecosystem.

On December 17, 2024, data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment revealed a massive rise in whale activity on the Cardano network, signaling potential upside momentum. Whale Transactions Surge on Cardano Network According to the data, the Cardano network witnessed a substantial 687 transactions, each worth more than $1 million, recorded in the past 24 hours. This highlights whales’ rising interest and confidence in the altcoin, suggesting a major price rally could be on the horizon. Additionally, these notable transaction details were highlighted by crypto experts on X (formerly Twitter). However, ADA experienced this surge in transactions during a period of consolidation, as it traded within a tight range over the past week.

In the past 24 hours, 687 transactions exceeding $1 million were recorded. pic.twitter.com/p8vzuLaFVP — Ali (@ali_charts) December 16, 2024 Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, ADA appears to have formed a bearish head and shoulders price action pattern. However, this pattern isn’t yet complete, as the price remains trapped in a consolidation range between $1.07 and $1.14. This range could determine whether ADA moves upward or downward in the coming days. Source: Trading View ADA Key Levels and Current Price Momentum Based on recent price action, if ADA breaks out of the narrow range and closes a daily candle above the $1.14 level, the bearish pattern would be invalidated, and ADA’s price could soar by 43% to reach the $1.63 mark in the future. Conversely, if ADA breaks down from the range and closes a daily candle below $1, the bearish pattern would be confirmed, and ADA could witness a price decline of 24%, falling to the $0.78 level. However, this bearish outlook currently appears manageable, as ADA continues to receive support from an ascending trendline. On the positive side, ADA’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 52, below the overbought zone, indicating that the asset has enough room to rise in the coming days. Currently, ADA is trading near $1.07 and has recorded a price decline of 2.7% in the past 24 hours.

This comes as the social media giant has been constantly upgrading the AI-enabled glasses to enhance performance including to handle more complex tasks and respond more naturally in major updates that are expected to transform the smart glasses. Meta made significant upgrades to Ray-Ban Earlier this year Meta revealed it was integrating its next-generation AI model Llama 3 into virtual assistant – MetaAI in its Ray-Ban smart glasses to enhance performance. The multi-modal features were in early access last December and can perform translations in addition to identifying objects, animals, and monuments. Now, Meta has brought other major upgrades to the smart glasses to boost their performance further. According to Cnet, the always-on continuous AI assistance started working on the Ray-Ban glasses on Monday for owners that have access to Meta’s features . This is in addition to the onboard translation, and Shazam which is currently available in the US and Canada only. The latest features added to the AI-enabled glasses include continuous audio and camera recording as opposed to specific individual prompts. This, according to Cnet , allows the glasses to be used for an extended period of time with the AI features turned on. Whenever the always-on live AI is activated, the glasses’ LED also stays on. Meta keeps a recording of the conversation that can be referred to throughout the AI session. In terms of translation, it is expected to work automatically while talking. However, although the translation comes through the glasses, it comes with a slight delay. The live AI assistance is reportedly similar to what Google demonstrated on its own prototype glasses this month via Gemini and Android XR, arriving next year. According to Meta, as cited by Cnet, the aways-on AI takes a hit on battery life, and users can expect up to 30 minutes of use before recharging the device. However, the company further explains that this type of always-on camera-assisted AI is exactly what more tech companies will be exploring in the next year. AI glasses hit their stride in 2024 The upgrades come as Big Tech is pushing AI assistants as the raison d’etre for smart glasses. Last week, Google revealed Android XR for new smart glasses, and specifically positioned its Gemini AI assistant as the killer app. In the meantime Andrew Bosworth, Meta CTO said in blog post that “2024 was the year AI glasses hit their stride.” In the same blogpost, Bosworth further opines that smart glasses may be the best possible form factor for a “truly AI-native device.” He added the AI-powered glasses could be the first hardware category to be “completely defined by AI from the beginning.” With Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses, users can activate the virtual assistant on the glasses by saying “ Hey Meta ” then ask a question or prompt, before the assistant can respond via speakers built on the frames. According to Meta , users can livestream from the glasses to social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, using “Hey Meta” to engage with the firm’s “advanced conversational assistant” MetaAI. The Ray Ban glasses feature enhanced audio and cameras, in addition to more than 150 different custom frame and lens combinations, “and they are lighter and comfortable.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",AI,EN,0,0,OTHER,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-17 00:40:58

This article examines five significant blockchain projects—Origin Protocol, Syscoin, Particl, District0x, and Web3Bay. Each initiative introduces unique enhancements to the blockchain environment, from decentralized markets to advanced privacy measures, illustrating the adaptability and transformative capability of blockchain solutions. 1. District0x: Building Decentralized Community Networks District0x presents a novel approach to decentralized applications by offering tools for creating decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that manage marketplaces, social networks, and other community-driven platforms. Each ‘district’ within the network operates independently, governed by its participants under District0x’s governance frameworks. 2. Syscoin: Combining Bitcoin’s Security with Ethereum’s Versatility Syscoin integrates Bitcoin’s security features with Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities. It introduces the Z-DAG protocol, enhancing transaction speeds essential for scalable business uses. Syscoin’s framework accommodates various applications, from affordable global transactions to business services, aiming to establish a decentralized marketplace for diverse assets. 3. Particl: Promoting Enhanced Privacy in E-commerce Particl is dedicated to privacy, offering a decentralized marketplace where transactions remain confidential. By using its proprietary cryptocurrency, Particl ensures that user identities and activities are kept private. The platform’s focus on privacy is crucial for users who prefer anonymous transactions, especially in today’s frequent data breach climate. 4. Origin Protocol: Facilitating Decentralized Marketplaces Utilizing the Ethereum blockchain, Origin Protocol develops a comprehensive structure for creating decentralized marketplaces. It enables users to generate and handle listings for goods, services, and even rentals without traditional intermediaries. This approach minimizes transaction costs and hands control and profits back to the users, supporting a true peer-to-peer marketplace. 5. Web3Bay: Enhancing E-Commerce with Blockchain Innovation Web3Bay operates on its proprietary Layer-1 blockchain, promoting a secure, transparent, and efficient marketplace independent of central authorities. Its initial offering strategy aims to cultivate a solid community foundation, promoting stability and liquidity at its launch. Web3Bay combines blockchain’s core benefits—security, transparency, and decentralization—with an intuitive interface, appealing to a wide audience. Web3Bay’s initial offering provides a favorable opportunity for early backers, allocating 40% of its 5 billion 3BAY tokens to a 28-stage initial offering. Each stage incrementally raises the token price by 15%, benefiting early participants while securing vital capital. Beginning at $0.003 per token in Stage 1 and climbing to $0.1959 in Stage 28, each phase specifies funding goals and token distributions. This structured approach, combined with Web3Bay’s ambitious plans, aims to establish a steady introductory price and cultivate community loyalty, positioning it to revolutionize decentralized e-commerce with its secure, community-focused platform and cross-chain functionality. Key Insights While each platform offers targeted solutions to particular challenges, Web3Bay’s dedicated strategy in decentralizing e-commerce marks it as a potentially influential player in a broad market. Its strategic initial offering, designed to encourage early investment and community engagement, lays a strong foundation for success. Although Origin Protocol, Syscoin, Particl, and District0x each offer specialized services within their areas, Web3Bay’s wide market appeal and strategic use of blockchain technology could lead to extensive adoption and substantial impact. As these decentralized platforms evolve, Web3Bay emerges as a notable contender, potentially reshaping the e-commerce sector, making it an important project in the current blockchain innovation landscape.

37737084,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=663135,1734397241,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"MicroStrategy Raises Stakes, Acquires $1.5 Billion In Bitcoin Amid Positive Market Outlook",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/microstrategy-raises-stakes-acquires-1-5-billion-in-bitcoin-amid-positive-market-outlook/,"MicroStrategy, the business intelligence firm led by Michael Saylor, has ramped up its Bitcoin (BTC) acquisition strategy for the sixth consecutive week. This latest purchase comes as BTC has surged to new all-time highs, with the leading cryptocurrency recently surpassing the $106,00 mark on Monday. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Stash Grows To 439,000 BTC On Monday, Michael Saylor announced that MicroStrategy acquired an additional 15,350 BTC for approximately $1.5 billion, averaging around $100,386 per Bitcoin. This acquisition contributes to the firm’s substantial Bitcoin portfolio, which now totals 439,000 BTC, purchased for about $27.1 billion at an average price of $61,725 per Bitcoin. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Faces Headwinds: Can Bulls Revive Momentum? Interestingly, Saylor also disclosed in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter) that the firm’s Bitcoin holdings have yielded notable returns, boasting a 46.4% gain quarter-to-date (QTD) and 72.4% gain year-to-date (YTD). This bullish momentum in the market follows increased optimism since November 5, when President-elect Donald Trump secured a new term in the White House with key promises made throughout the year to the industry. Investors are now confident that Trump’s new administration would make regulatory changes that could create a more favorable climate for digital assets. The US crypto market has encountered considerable difficulties in recent years, particularly from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Microstrategy’s MSTR Rises 3% On Nasdaq 100 News The recent uptick in Bitcoin’s price is further evidenced by a significant trading volume increase, with CoinGecko reporting a $92 million surge in the past 24 hours—a 54% increase compared to the previous day. However, MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin investment strategy has not only influenced the cryptocurrency market but has also positively affected its stock (MSTR) price. Following the announcement that MicroStrategy would be listed on the Nasdaq 100 index last week, shares of the company rose over 3% in premarket trading. Related Reading: Ex-Hedge Fund Guru Bets Big On Dogecoin As ‘Core Crypto Bet’ The inclusion in the Nasdaq 100—a benchmark for technology stocks—takes effect on December 23 and is expected to attract significant investment flows, potentially leading to $2.1 billion in stock purchases from over 200 exchange-traded products that track the index. Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani remarked on Monday that MicroStrategy’s strategy to Bitcoin purchase is “unprecedented,” establishing the company as the largest corporate Bitcoin owner, with around 2% of the total supply. Chhugani commented: MSTR’s Bitcoin buying program is unprecedented on the street, and inclusion in Nasdaq 100 further improves MSTR’s market liquidity, expanding its capital flywheel and Bitcoin buying program. At the time of writing, BTC has managed to consolidate at $103,900 for the past few hours after surging to new all-time highs. The market’s leading crypto recorded gains of 2% and nearly 6% in the 24-hour and weekly time frames, respectively.

Pseudonymous analyst Credible tells his 448,500 followers on the social media platform X that XRP appears to be gearing up for wave three of its five-wave surge on the four-hour chart. Credible practices the Elliott Wave theory which states that a bullish asset tends to witness a five-wave rally where wave three represents the longest and steepest part of the surge. Credible shares a chart that outlines XRP’s path to $20 before its five-wave rally comes to a conclusion. “And for non-traders, you just need to zoom out a little so you don’t forget the big picture. Structure on XRP here looks so freaking clean and bullish, it’s actually insane. Forget what happens on these lower timeframes. It’s noise (for a non-trader), the big picture is incredibly and unequivocally bullish.” Source: Credible/X At time of writing, XRP is trading for $2.44, indicating a potential rise of 719% if the altcoin hits the massive price target. Zooming in, Credible believes it is within the realm of possibility for XRP to revisit a support level below $2 before taking off to new all-time highs. “XRP looking solid here, fresh local demand formed in the ORANGE zone. Any retests of that zone should be good long opportunities for those looking for an entry. Ideally, we get something like what is pictured.” Source: Credible/X Based on the trader’s chart, he appears to predict that XRP will first rally above $3 before witnessing a deep corrective move.

Musk Loves USA (MUSKUSA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Loves USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves USA could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves USA by entering its contract address – DdmquVnPoj7RrjCiZ1yAc8p3b6bmCagcRUedBH6c572h – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-17 01:26:00

In addition to the price action, whales and industry experts seem to be losing interest in the altcoin, as revealed by the on-chain analytics firms IntoTheBlock and CryptoQuant. Will ETH Price Decline? Recently, ETH experienced a price surge of over 15% and hit the $4,100 mark for the first time since March 2024, where it faced selling pressure and a notable price decline. Historically, ETH has reached this level five times, and each time, it has encountered a price decline and significant selling pressure. Ethereum (ETH) Rising Exchange Reserve This time, looking at past trends whales and long-term holders appear to continue depositing their ETH to exchanges, as revealed by CryptoQuant’s ETH exchange reserve metrics. Data shows that exchange reserves have increased by nearly 100k ETH worth $400 million which could signal increased selling pressure as the price nears a six-month high. Source: CryptoQuant Rising Unstaking Activity In addition to the rising exchange reserves, whales have begun withdrawing tokens from staking, suggesting they are gradually taking profits due to the recent price surge or indicating a loss of interest in holding ETH long-term. This is evidenced by the recent activity of Justin Sun, the founder of Tron. On December 16, 2024, the whale transaction tracker Spotonchain shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) stating that Sun’s linked wallet address requested to withdraw 52,905 ETH, worth $209 million, from the staking protocol Lido Finance. Source: Previously Twitter Ethereum (ETH) Technical Analysis and Key Levels According to expert technical analysis, ETH appears to be forming a bearish double-top price action pattern at the strong resistance level of $4,100. In addition to the double-top pattern, ETH’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is falling, indicating a bearish divergence, which further suggests a price decline and increased selling pressure. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price action, there is a strong possibility that ETH could decline by 12% to reach the $3,500 level in the future. Current Price Decline At press time, ETH is trading near the $3,970 level and has experienced a modest price decline of 0.80% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume has soared by 60%, indicating heightened participation from crypto enthusiasts amid the recent price surge.",News|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-17 01:52:50

From the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs early on, we have witnessed a robust bull market further energized by momentum from the U.S. elections. Cryptocurrencies—especially Bitcoin, which benefited from the significant change in macro conditions —are reaching record-breaking valuations and are increasingly influencing the social and political landscape. It has also been a fruitful year for HTX Ventures. Benefiting from the continuous innovation in the industry, this year we have supported 28 leading projects and funds that are exploring new frontiers of crypto utility. These projects span a range of sectors, including DeFi, BTCFi, ZK-rollups, modular infrastructure, Layer 1 & 2 solutions, AI, SocialFi, GameFi, and more. Looking ahead, HTX Ventures has identified five key sectors that showed encouraging progress in 2024 and will be closely monitored in 2025: the Bitcoin ecosystem, infrastructure, Meme, artificial intelligence (“AI”), and the TON ecosystem. This report provides an in-depth examination of the current landscape, challenges, and future opportunities within each sector, complemented by a macroeconomic overview and market projections. Bitcoin Ecosystem Market Dominance LTM Bitcoin dominance has increased from 45.27% to 56.81% . This implies most of the liquidity of the crypto market is currently lying mainly on the Bitcoin ecosystem and increasing. Source: CoinStats Bitcoin spot ETFs now account for 5.3% of the total Bitcoin supply, with holdings rising from 629,900 BTC at the beginning of the year to 1.24 million BTC, an increase of 613,708 BTC. This growth has elevated ETF holdings from 3.15% to 6.25% of the total Bitcoin supply in just twelve months. (data dated as of 4 Dec 2024) A new market trend has emerged – with Bitcoin as the core asset, spot ETFs as liquidity channels, and U.S. listed companies represented by MicroStrategy (MSTR) as the vehicles to absorb unlimited dollar liquidity. As a result, it is increasingly essential to further develop Bitcoin’s ecosystem and enhance capital utilization efficiency, which can also boost BTC’s demand and drive up its price. Layer 2 77 BTC L2s have been launched/ fundraised over the past 3 years. Existing bitcoin L2s from the previous cycles including Lightning, Stacks and Liquid Network had experienced a significant surge in trading volume and token prices in 1H 2024 with the BTC ETF narrative. Further technical development has also been witnessed from these previous cycle L2s. Various L2 solutions on Bitcoin have emerged, including Spiderchain (Botanix), ZKRollup (Nexio and Critea), EVM compatible chains (BOB and B Squared), Sidechains (Merlin), etc. Current TVL on BTC L2 has reached US$3 billion, contributed by 19 BTC L2 projects. Assuming all Bitcoin L2s are launched in the coming years, approximated TVL on all BTC L2s could reach at least 2 to 4 times further, indicating a TVL of US$6 billion to US$12 billion. Layer 1/ Execution Layer BRC-20, Ordinals and Runes were the new major execution standards that emerged in late 2023. BTC L1s activities were on a steady increase despite an overall market downturn in Q2. However, the growth momentum was not able to keep pace in Q3 despite the resurgence of the Bitcoin markets. BTC L1s Landscape in # of Transactions, Source: Cryptokoryo_research Other Bitcoin Infrastructure Other infrastructures including interoperability solutions and security layers emerge with the rise of Bitcoin adoption. Interoperability Bridges and WBTC remain the mainstream of interoperability solutions on Bitcoin. Given that the Bitcoin network does not directly provide composability to build applications directly, people have to rely on these bridges/ WBTC to unlock DeFi yields on other blockchains. HTX Ventures remain bullish on Bitcoin interoperability solutions given the surge in institutions’ growing investment in Bitcoin as an asset class, and anticipate more solutions coming including liquidity bridges Xlink, Atomiq and Auran will launch in the coming year. Security Layers However, these interoperability solutions may pose threats on security over the underlying assets as hacking issues often happen. In light of this, security solutions with Bitcoin arise. Babylon is an example. It developed a set of security-sharing protocols for Bitcoin. This includes (1) Bitcoin timestamp, which allows data to be recorded with a timestamp on the Bitcoin network, thereby enhancing the credibility and immutability of the data, and (2) Bitcoin staking, which allows Bitcoin to provide security for other networks with financial incentives. On top of that, further usage potential with Bitcoin has been unleashed with other new technology, such as Data Availability (“DA”) layers. Nubit is a key player in Bitcoin DA. It enables scaling of Bitcoin’s data capacities, to empower applications, L2s and oracles, secured by Bitcoin. OP_CAT Is the Key to the 2025 Upgrade The Taproot upgrade enables the Bitcoin mainnet to issue assets. From the rise of BRC-20 inscriptions and Ordinals NFTs in 2023 to the introduction of ARC-20, SRC-20, and other asset issuance protocols, as well as the emergence of infrastructure such as Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions, restaking, Liquid Staking Tokens (“LSTs”), and cross-chain bridges, the ecosystem has developed in leaps and bounds. Following the Bitcoin Conference in July 2024, the market shifted its attention to decentralized and unwrapped native BTCFi such as stablecoins. Currently, the Discreet Log Contract (“DLC”) with a cryptographic technique known as adaptor signatures can be utilized to allow Bitcoin scripts to program financial contracts dependent on external events while fully ensuring permissionless clearing for stablecoin and lending projects. Meanwhile, it facilitates permissionless multi-party transactions via Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (“PSBT”). However, this approach is dependent on game theory. In other words, it discourages projects’ malicious actions by significantly increasing their costs for such behavior rather than achieving decentralization at the smart contract level. For example, Shell Finance, a stablecoin project set to launch its mainnet, adopts this strategy. The real game-changer is OP_CAT. Once OP_CAT is enabled, developers will be able to use high-level Bitcoin native programming languages like sCrypt to develop fully decentralized, transparent smart contracts directly on the Bitcoin mainnet. sCrypt is a TypeScript framework for writing smart contracts on Bitcoin. It allows developers to write smart contracts directly in TypeScript, which is one of the most popular high-level programming languages. Bitcoin’s current Layer 2 solutions could also transition to ZK-Rollups, and BTCFi’s total market cap will be limitless. With the support of both macro markets and infrastructure support, we believe Bitcoin will experience a further surge in market demand over the coming 2 years. Infrastructure In 2024, infrastructure remains one of the most compelling sectors in the crypto industry. The synergy between capital and technology has driven the rapid development of Layer 1, Layer 2, and middleware projects, among others. Various factors have contributed to the thriving infrastructure, such as the Ethereum ecosystem’s ongoing upgrades and construction, as well as Layer 2’s improvements in costs and performance; rapid growth of high-performance Layer 1 blockchains led by Solana; the deepening of multi-chain landscape; the enhancement of network security and capital efficiency through restaking mechanisms by projects like EigenLayer; and the attempt by multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 projects to combine Bitcoin’s security with high-performance scaling solutions. Layer 1 Layer 1 projects continue to optimize consensus mechanisms and performance, thus consolidating the foundation for on-chain applications. ● Ethereum : It introduced EIP-4844 and reduced L2 network fees. ● Solana and Tron: On-chain transactions have been active, attributable to the development of meme coins, infrastructure like Pump.fun and Sunpump, and so on. ● Aptos and Sui : GameFi and DeFi applications have spurred growth in active user numbers. Layer 2 Layer 2 remains a critical pathway for scaling, with advancements in both ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups. ● zkSync and StarkNet : Continuous upgrades have significantly improved the user experience for ZK Rollups. ● Base and Arbitrum : DeFi and NFT projects are thriving on these platforms, with substantial growth in TVL. Layer 0 and Cross-Chain Middleware Layer 0 and cross-chain middleware have made breakthroughs in interoperability. ● LayerZero : It connects over 40 chains , with a significant increase in cross-chain transaction volumes. ● Cosmos : The IBC upgrade has boosted cross-chain performance by 50%. Modular Public Blockchains Modular public blockchains offer exceptional performance and flexibility, thus attracting diverse applications. ● Celestia : By supporting multiple modular execution layers, it has established itself as a benchmark for modular public blockchains. ● Monad : Its ultra-high TPS performance has attracted a huge number of developers and DApp deployments. BTC Layer 2 Bitcoin L2 has emerged as a new focus in the primary market in 2024. Several related projects like Babylon, Taro, BounceBit, and Corn completed their funding rounds this year, primarily introducing smart contracts and scaling to the BTC network. ● Taro : It expands BTC’s payment and contract capabilities via the Lightning Network. ● Stacks and RSK : They drive growth in Bitcoin smart contract applications. Restaking Restaking has seen speedy development and gained market attention for its ability to improve capital utilization efficiency. Projects like EigenLayer and Satori secured tens of millions of dollars in investments from leading venture capital firms this year. 2024 Key Funding Rounds in Infrastructure Project Funding Amount Lead Investors Valuation Funding Round EigenLayer US$50m Blockchain Capital, Polychain US$200m Round A LayerZero US$100m a16z, Sequoia Capital US$3bn Round B Celestia US$55m Polychain, Binance Labs – Round A Shardeum US$60m Multicoin Capital – Round A Monad US$30m Dragonfly Capital – Seed Round Fuel Labs US$40m Paradigm – Round A Lightning Labs (Taro) US$30m a16z – Round A Infrastructure is still imperative in this year’s crypto investments and funding. Layer 1 solutions, modular public blockchains, and infrastructure related to the Bitcoin ecosystem have all been favored by investors. Layer 1 now represents the most concentrated areas of technical development and exploration in the crypto space, and it is expected to remain a key sector for development resources and capital investment in the future. Meme An Important Gateway for Retail Investors Under Relaxed Crypto Policies In 2024, the Meme coin sector has once again become a hotspot in the crypto market. As an ecosystem bridgehead , it has not only built community consensus but also integrated with verticals like DeFi and GameFi to create new use cases. For example, Solana has actively championed the innovation and growth of Meme projects, successfully energizing its ecosystem. From Bome and Slerf earlier this year to the emergence of pump.fi mid-year, these projects are much like lottery due to their bonding curve pricing models and low market-cap launch strategies, thus attracting widespread attention. In addition, pump.fi is characterized by a decentralized feature that allows everyone to launch Meme coins, which fosters greater prosperity in the ecosystem. Over half of Solana’s Meme projects now originate from pump.fi, with dozens of these achieving market caps exceeding US$1bn. Public blockchains like SUI and TRON have also quickly adopted meme strategies, further invigorating their ecosystems. Pump.fun Characterized by their accessibility and low entry barriers, Meme projects have become a key tool for attracting new crypto users. The launch of Mootshot allows users to purchase Meme assets with fiat, while the craze of politically-themed Meme coins after the election has created a strong sense of engagement for new players. Looking forward, the potential influence brought about by the crypto policies and related governance trends under the Trump administration may spawn new hotspots related to Meme coins. For instance, if the “Department of Government Efficiency” (abbreviated asDOGE) led by Elon Musk garners attention, it could trigger another surge in Dogecoin. As the crypto market environment becomes increasingly relaxed, more retail investors are expected to enter the market, making Meme projects a key channel for capital inflows. Robinhood’s record of significant price surges following every Meme coin listing clearly highlights this trend, which is likely to drive future development in this sector. Meme Infrastructure With market participants’ growing demand for fair launches, the Meme coin fair launch sector has gained significant market attention and attracted substantial participants this year. Infrastructure projects such as Pump.fun and SunPump have emerged as top-performing cash flow generators, injecting fresh momentum into Meme coin development. Pump.fun Pump.fun is a Solana-based platform for launching Meme projects. By offering simple and intuitive creation tools, robust community support, a fair-launch allocation model, and mechanisms for automated liquidity injection into DEXs, coupled with Solana’s proven market operations, community management, and low transaction costs, Pump.fun gained market recognition upon its debut. It has successfully incubated several high-profile Meme projects. As of November 2024, over 40,000 projects have been launched on Raydium, generating cumulative revenue exceeding 1.17 million SOL, equivalent to approximately US$200m. Meanwhile, Pump.fun’s success has led to imitations by many other projects, inspiring numerous imitators across various chains, with SunPump being the most notable one. Overall, this market-driven meme coin craze owes much to innovation and progress in infrastructure tools. Tools like Pump pioneered automated liquidity injection on launch platforms while pursuing fair, low-cost, and efficient launch methods. These innovations effectively lower launch costs and barriers, boost the market and community confidence, and drive increased participation. As a result, Meme projects have sustained their popularity throughout the year. Pump.fun’s success has not been perfectly replicated on other chains, and the main reasons are as follows: ● Solana’s low transaction costs and high throughput make it one of the ideal platforms for launching meme projects. ● The Solana community has shown exceptional enthusiasm for new projects, which drives rapid growth for emerging Meme projects. ● Other ecosystems such as Ethereum struggle with high gas fees and other issues. Moreover, Meme projects on high-performance chains like BSC and Avalanche demonstrate lackluster performance because they are constrained by smaller community sizes and lower user stickiness. Launch platforms like Pump.fun and SunPump have become essential infrastructure for the development of Meme projects. Meme projects may become more diversified and practical in the future, with infrastructure potentially offering greater product functionalities, incorporating features tailored to specific use cases, such as gaming, NFTs, and social networking. As multi-chain ecosystems mature and real-world use cases expand, meme coin infrastructure will continue injecting more vitality into this sector. AI In 2024, the Crypto x AI sector has been exploring viable directions, giving rise to several segmented fields such as ZK/OPML for enabling AI on-chain, AI data crowdsourcing, decentralized computing power rental, AI data trading, AI games, and AI agents. Crypto Projects Expand Their Focus to Capture AI Narrative A significant number of blockchain infrastructure and applications have expanded their focus to AI this year. Centralization of resources and ownership is one of the key challenges in scaling AI infrastructure in the long term, while traits of decentralization enabled with blockchain networks present a viable solution to solve the centralization issues with AI. One of the major examples of traditional crypto projects moving with AI include Near – it encourages AI to run on open source protocols on the chain since this year. Data Labeling/ Management Data resource constraints have been a major challenge for scaling AI development currently. Majority of useful data for AI model development is monopolized by big tech. Language and cultural coverage inefficiencies have thus become a problem due to the exclusiveness of jurisdiction coverage of these firms. Existing centralized AI data labeling firms are not able to scale the dataset in a comprehensive manner due to the poor financial incentives offered and operational jurisdiction limitation. Blockchain can be a good solution for solving these problems. Multiple projects are going to launch to improve data provenance and incentivize more efficient data labeling tasks across jurisdictions, e.g. Kiva, Sapien, Bagel, etc. Decentralized Inferencing and Machine Learning People mainly use centralized service providers like Hugging Face to run inference of open source models currently, which may pose concerns over privacy or censorship issues. Decentralized inferencing allows people to run machine learning models without relying on centralized service providers while ensuring the model output is trustable. Three major verifiable inferencing verticals have emerged, with different cost and security trade off conditions embedded: Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (“ZKML”) ZKML allows inferencing of AI models with privacy provided by zk-snarks technology. Giza, Modulus Labs and EZKL were the key players in this vertical. These unlocks enhance security and accuracy over the inferencing process on open source models. However, the cost of inferencing will significantly surge due to the cost to generate ZK proof, leading to at least 100x time cost and latency compared to centralized inferencing. As such, current products still need further enhancement on ZK technology to be usable in the future. Optimistic Machine Learning (“OPML”) OPML assumes inference is accurate unless proven wrong by the challenger on the network. Network challengers act as watchers of the on-chain inferences and run on their own models to ensure output accuracy. A primary example of OPML platforms is ORA. Although the cost performance of OPML is lower than ZKML, it is still much more expensive than centralized inferencing due to the watcher cost. On-chain Decentralized Inferencing Network With a decentralized inferencing network, queries are run on-chain with a few nodes. If differences arise, the outstanding one will be slashed. This is the cheapest and fastest solution among the rest but security is not guaranteed as there are possibilities for the nodes to cheat. To ensure further security, more nodes may be considered to be deployed but this will further increase the cost. Ritual is one of the examples of running a decentralized inferencing network. Due to the weak cost efficiency compared to local inferencing, it is not a priority to decentralize AI inferencing for users at the moment. Output verification is rarely a huge concern of AI developers and users under the current AI status quo. Aside from that, edge computing can also be another solution for privacy and security for running AI models. As such, decentralized inferencing may face bottlenecks on growth in the long run. Decentralized GPU GPUs are heavily demanded in AI development while current GPU providers are largely monopolized by a few main players in the market, which may pose a risk of price sensitivity if any extreme market conditions happen. Old decentralized GPU protocol Render has experienced 10x growth in price since 2023. An influx of decentralized GPU networks is launching in the market this year, e.g. IO.net, Grass, Akash, etc. These networks incentivize GPU contribution with tokens, with target audiences of both consumers and smaller GPU companies. However, due to the lack of uniformity of GPU resources on these networks and the fact that most performant GPUs are not owned by the consumers, it is anticipated that centralized GPU providers will still be the mainstream of adoption by AI developers. AI Agent On Chain AI agents were put on chains to take advantage of the token mechanism to incentivise and bootstrap certain behaviors with the agents, including interacting with smart contracts, trading and querying on behalf of users. Myshell is one of the examples. In the future, AI Agents will gradually become personal butlers and assistants for users, serving them with comprehensive capabilities, such as independent asset issuance, initiation of viral marketing campaigns, formation of decentralized autonomous organizations (“DAO”), and even fund management and investment decision-making. Over time, they may develop unique cultures and religions. This deep integration of AI and encryption technology is a groundbreaking evolution that is unattainable within Web2 and cannot be achieved by Web3 relying solely on encryption technology. These innovations have not yet been transformed into products. Recently, in order to address AI agents’ needs for independent financial identities, specifically, the ability to autonomously control wallets, Coinbase has launched AI wallets based on its Coinbase MPC Wallet, allowing AI agents to conduct transactions with these wallets effortlessly. To make AI Wallet more accessible, Coinbase has also released a Based Agent template, which helps users deploy AI wallets with zero coding. More related products are expected to emerge in 2025. Based Agent Breakdown, Source: https://x.com/starzqeth/status/1853597036421259728 On top of that, AI agent networks have also arisen. Theoriq is a key example. It enables efficient multi-agent operation on blockchains with its community-governed AI agent marketplace. This creates an efficient distribution channel for AI agent creators and streamlined processes for AI agent users to perform multiple tasks. TON Ecosystem Attributable to Telegram’s hundreds of millions of users and robust technical support, the The Open Network (“TON”) ecosystem has gradually built a multi-layered blockchain ecosystem. In 2024, it experienced a full-scale boom in both its ecosystem and market. From DeFi and meme coins to NFTs and gaming, TON has made significant accomplishments with its massive user base in various fields, pioneering the monetization of Web2 social applications through crypto. TON data overview, Defillama, https://defillama.com/chain/TON Since traditional business models cannot bring Telegram substantial profits, TON began exploring alternatives like zero-threshold or low-spending “tap-to-earn” games, along with token airdrop incentives. This strategy has successfully drawn in a large number of Web2 users. Notcoin’s Success In May 2024, the first project Notcoin was launched. Notcoin is a social clicker game accessible via Telegram. Players engage with the Notcoin bot, invite friends, and start playing. The game mechanics are straightforward: a golden coin appears on your screen, and each tap earns you Notcoin, the game’s virtual currency. However, users’ ability to tap is limited by an energy bar that depletes with each tap but gradually refills over time. Notcoin quickly gained popularity in the market after it was released. Relying on its simple gameplay and Telegram’s vast user base, it achieved over one million monthly active users in a short time and was listed on major exchanges. Notcoin’s success marks the successful implementation of TON’s ecosystem gaming model and signifies that the gaming sector has entered a new phase of user attraction. Catizen’s Optimization Following Notcoin’s success, Catizen optimized its gameplay by introducing features such as speed boosts, encouraging users to start with small amounts, such as $0.99 or $4.99. Users can also deposit fiat via OTC channels or directly purchase crypto assets with credit cards, significantly lowering entry barriers. This zero-threshold or low-spending model has further expanded the user base. Other Business Models DOGS is one of the most popular meme projects in the TON ecosystem. Thanks to its unique community governance and ecosystem development, DOGS quickly gained a hold in the market. The project enables simple mining operations by verifying users’ Telegram accounts and adopting a referral mechanism. Upon its launch, DOGS attracted significant community attention and traffic and rapidly secured listings on multiple exchanges. Apart from gaming and social projects, DeFi also thrives in the TON ecosystem. Projects like TonStaker and Ston.fi have made strong progress. With star projects such as Notcoin, DOGS, and Catizen, TON has not only solidified its position in social payment but also achieved breakthroughs in multiple sectors like DeFi. However, tap-to-earn games fundamentally operate on a model where Web2 users are initially attracted through token airdrop incentives and sold to exchanges afterward. After the initial hype subsides, traffic declines significantly. Currently, the TON ecosystem urgently needs to find a new business model in 2025 that can improve user retention and identify the next growth curve. It could be DeFi or meme coins but certainly not the models already implemented on Ethereum or Solana. TON’s success has also inspired other Web2 social applications. For instance, Line, targeting markets in Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia, has introduced the Kaia chain, experimenting with the Mini DApp model to monetize its existing Web2 traffic. This shows that TON’s model is influencing the entire industry profoundly. Line Web3 Platform Breakdown, Source: https://govforum.kaia.io/t/gp-4-budget-request-for-kaia-wave/963 Capital Markets Attention In the capital markets, the TON ecosystem has garnered more attention from investors than other high-performance public blockchains. Multiple projects have received investments from the primary market this year. The TON ecosystem will continue advancing user experience, ecosystem diversity, and technological innovation, injecting fresh momentum into the sustained development of the crypto market. While the TON ecosystem has made substantial breakthroughs in 2024, TON must innovate its business model, increase user retention, and identify a new growth curve for the future. This is the only way for TON to maintain its leadership in fierce blockchain competition and deliver constant value to both its users and investors. Macro Summary The theme of the crypto market in 2024 was first dominated by the approval of the Bitcoin ETF in January and more recently by Trump’s presidential election win in November. From a macroeconomic perspective, the market is currently transitioning from quantitative tightening (“QT”) to quantitative easing (“QE”), with QE expected to begin in the second quarter of next year. Historically, the peak of crypto bull markets rarely occurs during rate-cut cycles. Instead, it usually happens at the end of rate-cut cycles, or just as a rate-hike cycle nears its end or even just begins. For example, the extreme easing policies triggered by the 2020 pandemic started a crypto bull run, which reached its peak at the end of 2021 as the Federal Reserve signaled a gradual shift toward tightening policies. Later, rate hikes officially began in 2022. Therefore, in our opinion, the crypto market has yet to reach its bull market peak. On the whole, this cycle may unfold in various ways. In particular, against the backdrop of Trump’s fiscal expansion policies and unprecedented crypto-friendly signals, a robust bull market is expected. Moreover, with regulatory easing and the entry of traditional financial institutions, Bitcoin will gain stronger support and gradually become a core dollar-denominated asset, aside from those tied to the dollar industry cycles (such as AI). The trend of decoupling between Bitcoin and the traditional altcoin market is expected to intensify. On the one hand, the benchmark interest rate is expected to decline to neutral levels by mid-2025. Whether there would be further rate cuts or tightening will largely depend on inflation levels at the time, as well as Trump’s ability to influence the Federal Reserve. If the Fed signals tightening measures to address inflation, the market may enter an adjustment phase that may last until May 2026, when Trump could have the chance to assert control over Fed policies. The Influx of Traditional Financial Giants and Retail Crypto Investors in 2025 Will Spawn New Sectors The Repeal of SAB 121 Will Clear Hurdles for the Entry of Traditional Financial Institutions Trump is expected to repeal SAB 121 after his inauguration on 20 January 2025. This move will allow traditional financial institutions to hold cryptos on their balance sheets, further accelerating the institutionalization of crypto assets. The repeal will not only provide more financing options for crypto assets but also make spot cryptos more accessible through existing institutional exchanges and partnerships. At the same time, it will significantly enhance the maturity of the overall institutional crypto market. Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (“SAB 121”) is a guideline issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in 2022. This regulation requires banks, exchanges, and other financial institutions holding or providing custodial services for crypto assets to treat these assets as liabilities and disclose them accordingly on their balance sheets. Even if these institutions are merely holding clients’ crypto assets in custody, they must assume potential responsibilities. This rule requires financial institutions to make two adjustments: On the one hand, they must disclose detailed information regarding potential risks associated with crypto assets, including market volatility, hacking, and technical failures. On the other hand, they must account for crypto assets as liabilities rather than client assets in their custody. This may increase the total liabilities on the balance sheets of banks and financial institutions, which in turn impacts their capital adequacy ratios. Due to these restrictions, SAB 121 has directly hindered traditional financial institutions in the U.S., especially national banks like Citibank and JPMorgan Chase, from offering crypto custody services. It has also limited crypto firms’ access to banking services. However, as regulatory agencies clarify their stance and policies ease, traditional financial service companies and investors will be able to operate on blockchain platforms for the first time, which will bring them new earnings and strategic possibilities. Coingecko , (data dated as of 8 Dec 2024) PayFi: Fiat’s Direct Involvement in Crypto Operations Will Unlock Infinite Potential ● With traditional financial institutions now allowed to legally invest in, hold, and provide custodial services for crypto assets, sectors such as PayFi, compliant stablecoins, and compliant fiat on-ramps are set to rise. Recently, Tether announced the launch of a new real-world asset (“RWA”) platform that focuses on tokenizing real-world financial assets (such as government bonds, real estate, and other fixed-income assets) to provide digitized investment options. ● Moonshot has created brand-new use cases by integrating fiat on-ramps with meme coin trading. In the future, more projects are likely to emerge by connecting fiat channels and by integrating real-world assets and high-frequency crypto gameplay (such as GameFi and DeFi).

A prominent analyst forecasts Ripple (XRP) hitting $10, Dogecoin reaching $5, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) climbing to $0.09.

These bids range from 500 XRP ($1237) to as much as 836 XRP ($2068) as of Asian morning hours on Tuesday, CoinDesk viewed on the Xaman application. Each XRP exchanges hands for just under $2.5, data shows . “There actually is someone willing to pay $1,200/RLUSD for a tiny fraction of one RLUSD.,” Ripple Labs CTO David Schwartz said in a Monday post . “Tools will show you the highest price anyone is willing to pay, even if it's just for a tiny bit. Maybe someone wants the ""honor"" of buying the first bit of RLUSD on the DEX.” “But rest assured, the price will come back to very close to $1 as soon as supply stabilizes. If it doesn't, something is very seriously wrong,” Schwartz added. Speculators often engage in high-priced transactions for small quantities of a new token or NFT to gain early access or to capitalize on the novelty of holding the first batch. As such, RLUSD might not have enough liquidity to maintain its peg effectively in the first few hours after it goes live, meaning there may be some price discrepancies from the intended $1 peg. However, each token will be redeemed for only a dollar, and it is unlikely to remain depegged for an extended period. RLUSD will go live on the XRP Ledger (XRP) on Tuesday, as CoinDesk reported , with initial listings on several exchanges and crypto platforms, including Uphold, MoonPay, Archax, and CoinMENA.",Markets,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|WALLET|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-17 02:10:00

Analysts are saying that XRP is currently in the later stages of a cycle wave three on the daily chart and this wave may still extend a bit higher, potentially reaching new all-time highs. While we haven’t yet seen a clear end to wave three, there’s a possibility it could continue moving upward before we see a correction in wave four. A possible target for the final move of this cycle could be between $5 and $9.81. At the time of writing, XRP is trading below $2.50 level and is up by more than two percent in the last 24 hours. Key Price Levels and Support Zones At present, XRP is trading between the 2021 high and the all-time high. This zone is critical for understanding potential price action. If XRP continues to hold above this range, there’s a good chance XRP could break through the all-time high, though it’s not guaranteed. Micro Patterns and Short-Term Movement Looking at the microstructure , there was a three-wave move down from the swing high formed on December 3rd, followed by a three-wave move up (wave B). Subsequently, a corrective wave C formed to the downside, bringing XRP to retest the 2021 high, which held as support. This suggests that short-term price action remains bullish. The breakout from the corrective price channel is a positive sign, though XRP has yet to move away from it in an impulsive fashion. The first target following this breakout is typically the starting point of the channel, which is around the $2.90 level. This target aligns with the typical length of wave C, which often matches that of wave A. Watch Out for Potential Pullbacks If the price breaks below the $2.33 level, followed by a drop below $2.28, the price could see a test of lower support regions between $2 and $2.23. From there, XRP might attempt another rally.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-17 02:23:09

Key Metric Reveals When to Cash In Profits,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-next-big-move-key-metric-reveals-when-to-cash-in-profits/,"Bitcoin recent price momentum which led to a renewal of its all-time high (ATH) appears to have reignited interest in key metrics used to time market entries and exits. Among these, the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) reversion metric has been highlighted by a CryptoQuant analyst known as Darkfost, who shared insights on its current implications for Bitcoin investors. The metric, a measure of Bitcoin’s price deviations from its expected value based on the S2F model, has become an important tool for many traders assessing market sentiment and identifying potential profit-taking windows. Related Reading: Bitcoin Confidence Grows As Binance Data Highlights Surprising Market Trends When Should Cash In Your Bitcoin Profits? Darkfost’s analysis points to September 11 as a significant date, when the S2F reversion metric dropped below 1, signaling a potential buy opportunity as Bitcoin traded at $57,000. Now, the analyst emphasizes a different critical threshold—a value above 2.5—historically indicating a favorable time to secure moderate profits. Should the metric reach a value above 3, it often signals market overheating, marking an opportune moment for larger profit-taking strategies. The S2F reversion metric offers a structured approach to assessing Bitcoin’s price cycles. Darkfost suggests a two-step profit strategy: investors should consider securing smaller gains when the metric hits 2.5 and proceed to larger profit-taking if it surpasses 3. Darfost particularly wrote: A prudent strategy when using this indicator is to take moderate profits once the S2F reversion ratio hits 2.5 and to secure larger profits when the ratio exceeds 3, thereby balancing risk and reward effectively. BTC Market Performance Regardless of the suggested indicator by Darkfost on when to take profit, Bitcoin appears not to be slowing down in its upward momentum. So far, BTC has created a new ATH after trading as high as $106,352 in the early hours of Monday. Although at the time of writing, the asset has seen a slight rebound currently trading at a a price of $105,942, however, BTC is still up by over 3% in the past day more than 10% in the past two weeks. Unsurprisingly, along with the rising price, BTC’s market capitalization has also seen a significant surge in its valuation now sitting at roughly over $2 trillion as of today. Meanwhile, despite this positive momentum, BTC’s daily trading volume has seen quite an opposite trend. Related Reading: National Bitcoin Reserve Initiative: MP Satoshi Hamada Urges Japan To Take Action Particularly, this metric instead of seeing a rise amid the new ATH of BTC, has remain stable and lower than last week’s daily trading volume. At the time of writing, BTC’s trading volume sits at $97.4 billion, a significant decline from the over $140 billion volume valuation seen last week on December 10.

Monica Long, President of Ripple, took to her social media handle on Monday and said that this new stablecoin is an important step for both the XRP Ledger and Ripple, which handles over $70 billion in payments. RLUSD combines Ripple’s 10 plus years of experience with strong compliance standards and support from a trusted advisory board. The company had received final approval for RLUSD from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), under the regulator’s limited-purpose trust company charter, as of last week. RLUSD will launch on platforms like Uphold, MoonPay, CoinMENA, Archax, and Bitso, with more exchanges like Bullish, Mercado Bitcoin, Zero Hash, Independent Reserve, and Bitstamp joining soon. An enterprise-grade stablecoin for everyone. Ripple USD ($RLUSD) drops tomorrow on @UpholdInc , @MoonPay , @CoinMENA , @ArchaxEx and @Bitso , with @bullish , @mercadobitcoin , @ZeroHashX , @indepreserve , and @Bitstamp soon to follow. https://t.co/k3DrWO4PXA — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 16, 2024 When Will RLUSD Launch? RLUSD will be available on global exchanges starting today, December 17, 2024. While the launch date is confirmed, the exact time has not been disclosed. While social media posts on X suggest the launch will happen at 8:00 AM EST, allowing users to get in before the typical 9-5 workday begins, this information is purely speculative and has not been officially confirmed. As such, it should be treated with caution until Ripple provides official details. XRP Price Jumps: The market reacted positively to the news, with XRP seeing a boost in value. Although some traders are taking profits, the excitement is building, and XRP’s price could continue to rise as more trust in Ripple grows. XRP has been experiencing a strong price surge due to a major announcement from Ripple. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like BNB and ETH are performing well, XRP’s movement is directly tied to Ripple’s stablecoin news.

If you’ve been keeping tabs, you’d know there’s no shortage of drama or opportunity in this space. Peanut the Squirrel’s owner is locked in a legal battle with Binance over alleged trademark infringement, sending ripples across the crypto world. Meanwhile, Popcat’s price might just have found its bottom, with analysts predicting a bullish reversal. On the flip side, BTFD Coin is riding a tidal wave of excitement, smashing through the $4 million mark in its presale. With these developments, this week might just be the perfect time to jump into the meme coin frenzy. Meme coins have always had their finger on the pulse of crypto hype, riding cultural waves like no other asset class. From Dogecoin’s meteoric rise to Shiba Inu’s unexpected success, these quirky coins have proven their staying power. Now, with BTFD Coin’s innovative play-to-earn game and staking rewards , it’s bringing something fresh to the table. It’s more than just a meme; it’s a movement powered by a strong community of holders. So, if you’re looking for the best meme coins to join this week , let’s break down what makes BTFD Coin, Peanut the Squirrel, and Popcat worthy of your attention and possibly your wallet. BTFD Coin: The Next Big Thing in Meme Coins BTFD Coin is turning heads for all the right reasons. The presale has already raised over $4 million and sold more than 55 billion tokens to 5,600+ holders. Starting at just $0.000004 per coin, BTFD is now in its 12th stage, with the price hitting $0.00013. At this pace, it’s set to close out its presale at $0.0006 per token. What sets BTFD apart isn’t just its meteoric presale performance but its long-term vision. The coin features a play-to-earn (P2E) game that’s set to make waves, offering players a chance to earn rewards while having fun. Add staking options into the mix, and you’ve got a token with tangible utility beyond just its meme appeal. Let’s do some quick math. If you invested $15,000 at the current price of $0.00013 per coin, you’d snag roughly 115,384,615 BTFD tokens. Once the presale ends and the price hits $0.0006, your investment would balloon to a jaw-dropping $69,230. That’s a tidy 361% profit before BTFD even hits its first exchange listing. With four stages left in the presale, and analysts predicting a surge in demand as the end draws closer, this is one train you don’t want to miss. BTFD isn’t just a meme; it’s a movement. Peanut the Squirrel: Fighting for a Cause On the other side of the meme coin spectrum, Peanut the Squirrel is grabbing headlines for a very different reason. Mark Longo, the owner of the late social media sensation, is taking Binance to court over alleged trademark infringement. Longo claims the exchange used the “PNUT” trademark and Peanut’s likeness without permission, issuing a cease-and-desist letter demanding Binance halt these activities. Despite the legal battle, PNUT’s price has remained relatively stable at $1.11. For a token that achieved a $1 billion market cap in just 11 days after its launch, stability is a testament to its strong community and cultural resonance. Peanut’s story is as much about justice as it is about value. The token has become a symbol of intellectual property rights in the fast-evolving crypto space, and this narrative is likely to keep it in the spotlight. If the lawsuit resolves in Longo’s favour—or even if it just garners more media attention—PNUT could see a surge in value. Meme coins thrive on attention, and PNUT has plenty of it right now. Popcat: The Rebound Everyone’s Waiting For Popcat is the OG of cat-themed meme coins, and it’s not about to let that title go. Inspired by Oatmeal, the viral cat meme from 2020, Popcat has already delivered over 10,000% gains since its launch at $0.01. After peaking at $2.07, the token has entered a mini-bear phase, dropping to $1.21. But according to renowned trader Cold Blooded Shiller, Popcat might just be gearing up for a comeback. Shiller points out that Popcat’s trading range has been tightening, with repeated dips into the high-demand zone around $1.20. This kind of pressure often precedes a breakout. With cat memes gaining traction and favourable market conditions, analysts predict Popcat could claw its way back to its all-time high and beyond, with $3 as the next big target. If you’re a fan of the meme coin market’s quirky charm, Popcat is one to watch. It’s got the pedigree, the community, and the potential for another moonshot. The Concluding Remark The meme coin market is hotter than ever, and this week’s lineup is nothing short of stellar. BTFD Coin is smashing presale records, giving investors a chance to ride the wave of its innovative game and staking features. Peanut the Squirrel offers a unique story of justice and cultural impact, while Popcat is primed for a breakout, backed by a loyal fan base and solid fundamentals. Whether you’re looking for the best meme coins to join this week or simply seeking the next big opportunity in crypto, this is your moment. Don’t let it pass you by. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your slice of the future at $0.00013 before it’s too late. With over $4 million already raised and a community that’s growing by the day, this might just be the best investment you make all year.

Plus, early adopters gain exclusive perks like governance voting rights and early access to exciting ecosystem features. Join today! The Story of Dogecoin (DOGE): A Pioneer with a Meme-Legacy Dogecoin started as a playful joke in 2013, born out of the internet’s love for the “Doge” meme. But in the crypto world, where adoption drives survival, Dogecoin defied expectations and gained a loyal following, including high-profile endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. What Makes Dogecoin a Contender? While Lightchain AI represents groundbreaking utility, Dogecoin’s strength lies in community and its simplicity as a fast, low-fee cryptocurrency. Let’s explore why DOGE still holds its charm: Accessible and Beginner-Friendly Dogecoin’s straightforward functionality has made it a starting point for many crypto enthusiasts entering the space. You don’t need to understand complex use cases to engage with DOGE—it’s simple and fast. Strong Community Support The “Dogecoin Army” remains one of the most supportive and tight-knit communities in crypto. Their enthusiasm and grassroots efforts continue to keep Dogecoin relevant in discussions of payment app integration and merchant adoption. Endorsements and Visibility With billionaire cheerleaders and public appearances, Dogecoin has managed to stay visible globally—an invaluable asset in the digital currency sphere. Ecosystem Growth While Dogecoin lacks the advanced features of newer platforms like Lightchain AI, there’s some buzz about its development for broader use cases, including Layer 2 scaling projects. Lightchain AI vs. Dogecoin—A Feature Comparison Feature Lightchain AI Dogecoin (DOGE) Focus Blockchain + AI synergy Peer-to-peer transactions Consensus Mechanism Proof of Intelligence (PoI) Proof of Work (PoW) Development Potential High (AIVM, dynamic ecosystem) Moderate Community Growing (focused on innovation) Large and enthusiastic Ideal Use Cases AI-driven dApps, intelligent ops Digital payments, tips Investing Stage Early Presale opportunity Well-established While Dogecoin feels like a secure and steady name for small transactions, Lightchain AI shines as an emerging leader in revolutionizing how blockchain integrates futuristic AI technology .

A Wells Notice is typically issued when the SEC believes a company has violated securities laws, signaling potential enforcement action. The team behind CyberKongz expressed their disappointment with the SEC’s approach, claiming that the regulator has shown a lack of understanding of blockchain technology. They argue that this has led to inaccurate accusations and confusion about their project. CyberKongz has been in contact with the SEC for over two years, with the most recent issue surrounding the combination of an ERC-20 token and a blockchain game. CyberKongz has pledged to fight this stance, not just for their own project, but for the broader NFT and blockchain gaming community. “We have been suffering in silence for the last two years, ever since we first received contact from the SEC,” they said.

The CyberKongz team explains that this was actually a contract migration, not a sale. They argue that if the SEC cannot distinguish between a primary sale and a contract migration, it raises concerns about the clarity of regulatory guidelines for digital assets moving forward. The CyberKongz team also expressed concern that the current administration may be pushing an anti-crypto agenda. However, they are positive that the new administration will bring more fairness to the regulatory landscape. In their statement, CyberKongz also expressed solidarity with other leaders in the space, such as Brian Armstrong, Devin Finzer, and Hayden Adams, who are also fighting for clearer regulations. “For the CyberKongz community, this is the start of a new beginning.

Several custodial services have also been offering more crypto investment products, with the most notable being this year’s approval for Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs. Recent CryptoQuant data has also indicated an increase in ETF holdings. Wall Street asset management companies have further been exploring more crypto options. Grayscale, MicroStrategy, and BlackRock are now some of the top global BTC holders. MicroStrategy’s latest moves to increase its BTC holdings have significantly triggered a more bullish outlook for crypto. A Bitcoin Suisse prediction for crypto for 2025 confirmed that more companies and governments may be set to adopt more crypto utilities and monetary policies in the coming year. Bitcoin Suisse explained that the conditions would fuel BTC and other cryptocurrencies. The prediction further suggested that the long-awaited alt-season will become full-blown in the first quarter of 2025. Several analysts, including CryptoQuant’s CEO Ki Young Ju, also expect that cryptocurrencies will continue on an upward trend until the end of the year. Young Ju predicted that BTC would reach $112,000 by the end of the year and over $135,000 in 2025.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has faced skepticism throughout this cycle, with some analysts predicting it would underperform compared to its previous bull runs. However, Ethereum has surprised doubters, steadily climbing in recent weeks despite market uncertainty. Related Reading: ONDO Exchange Inflows Grow – Volatility Ahead? Key on-chain metrics from Glassnode reveal an important trend that could fuel further price gains: Ethereum whales have been accumulating aggressively since late November. This signals growing confidence among major holders, who are positioning themselves for potential upside. Historically, whale accumulation has often preceded significant price moves, hinting at the possibility of a breakout in the near term. While the market remains divided on Ethereum’s trajectory, its ability to sustain upward momentum near the $4,000 mark will likely define its performance in the weeks ahead. Breaking above this critical resistance could open the door to new highs and further solidify ETH’s role as a leader in the ongoing bull cycle. Ethereum Mega-Whale Balances Grow Ethereum has experienced a steady, albeit modest, rally since November 5, but it seems the real fireworks for ETH are yet to ignite. As Bitcoin soars into price discovery and several altcoins outperform expectations, Ethereum investors are searching for clear signals of an impending bull run for the second-largest cryptocurrency. Key on-chain data shared by top analyst Ali Martinez on X provides intriguing insights into Ethereum’s current state. Martinez highlights that Ethereum whales—entities holding significant amounts of ETH—have been accumulating aggressively since the price broke above the $3,330 level. This accumulation trend suggests that smart money is positioning itself for what could be a massive upward move in the months ahead. Historically, whale accumulation has often been a precursor to strong price rallies, as these large investors tend to anticipate major market shifts before retail traders. However, the narrative isn’t entirely bullish. While whale accumulation may signal confidence, it also raises concerns about a potential bull trap. These large holders could quickly pivot, offloading their ETH for other assets if market conditions shift or if Bitcoin’s dominance suppresses altcoin growth. Such a move could catch smaller investors off guard, leading to sharp corrections.

Until then, ETH remains a watchlist favorite, balancing potential and uncertainty. Price Testing Crucial Resistance Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $3,950, struggling to break above the crucial $4,000 resistance level for several days. Despite this, the price remains resilient, signaling strong market support. Clearing this level is essential to confirm the continuation of the uptrend, as $4,000 represents a psychological barrier and a key resistance zone for the asset. If Ethereum fails to breach the $4,000 mark, a retrace toward lower demand zones around $3,500 could be expected. This level has served as strong support in recent weeks, providing a cushion during periods of increased selling pressure. A pullback to this area could allow for renewed buying momentum, setting the stage for another attempt to break higher.

However, it located support and quickly recovered as the price broke to a new high. It appears bullish but the price is stalled. Like many altcoins, Link witnessed significant growth in the past month as it surged through several key resistances to mark a new multi-high at $30.94 on Friday. However, the bears have defended that high well and the crypto is now stalled with choppy price actions. The intraday trading remains bullish but the asset may lose momentum soon considering the latest rejection. As seen on the daily chart, there’s little-to-no movement in the market. A weekly close under the $28 level could facilitate another drop as witnessed earlier this week. Towards the upside, Link must break higher before considering more rallies, although maintaining a bullish on the daily chart. If that comes into play, the $40 range would be the next buying target level for the bulls. Nevertheless, the overall market appears strong on a daily scale. As of now, there are no signs of bears in the market. If they return, the price must fall below last month’s low before considering a reversal. But from the look of things, more positive actions are likely to occur. LINK’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview While deciding where next to head, a break above the weekly $31 high should propel buying to $33, followed by $35. Higher resistance levels to consider on the way up are $40 and $45. A pullback from the current trading level could bring a retest at $27. Below it lies the $23.8 support. If the price drops, the next level to watch for support is $19.5.

However, it has been facing hurdles for some days now due to low demand. Breaking up should drive more gains in the future. The last two weeks of trading have been a tough moment for the bulls as they find it difficult to sustain momentum above the monthly rejected $1.3 level. Although they are still gaining control in the mid-term but their commitment seems not strong enough to drive the price higher. This low commitment has brought a notable reduction in the last 24 hours, and as seen on the daily chart, ADA is now trading at around $1 after rejecting $1.2 on Thursday. Just like what we saw this week, the latest rejection could lead to another decrease in the upcoming week. Considering yesterday’s strong bearish close, which suggests a potential sell, the asset may drop into the $0.8 range. Locating support in the price range could trigger a bounce back. If not, we may see more drops until it finds a threshold. On the daily chart, the volume indicator has been on the fall since the price entered $0.7 in mid-November. A rise in this volume should bring buying pressure back into the market. Having said that, it is important to note that ADA is currently under correction. ADA’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview Losing grip above $1, it may navigate the $0.9 and $0.875 levels for support. A breakdown from there could plunge the price to $0.765 and $0.69. Lower supports for a broader correction are $0.6 and $0.522. If ADA climbs back above $1.154 along with the rejected monthly $1.32 high, the next buy target for the bulls would be $1.5, $1.7 and $2 in no time.

In an appearance on the Coin Stories podcast, Matthew Sigel said Bitcoin ( BTC ) could go as high as $180K in 2025, pointing to crucial indicators like funding rates, unrealized profits, and retail speculation as the basis for this prediction. Sigel, in conversation with the host Natalie Brunel , says VanEck has been “ bullish on Bitcoin since 2017 ”. However, he believes corporate adoption of Bitcoin still has a long road ahead. Traditional asset managers, many of which, like Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, are owned by banks and brokers, have been slow to adopt BTC into their financial strategy, he said. Their tightly regulated structure and reliance on traditional asset allocation models, such as the 60-40 portfolio, have yet to adjust to accommodate BTC ETFs .

Sigel shared that macro trends such as inflation hedges and BTC being adopted as digital gold are fueling this bullish sentiment. According to Sigel, BTC safeguards against actions like government currency devaluation and asset confiscations, a must-have for individuals living in countries with double-digit inflation.

It is footing another leg up while the fear and greed index stands at 80 due to overbought. Bitcoin’s daily structure remains highly bullish in the long term due to a consistent surge in the past month. The crypto pushed higher yesterday and comfortably entered the $106,000 range, closing last week bullish. Prior to the latest break up, the primary crypto flash crashed to a low of $90,500 earlier this month following a sudden rejection at $104,000. The price recovered and traded at around $100k throughout last week. Despite the low volatility movement in the past weeks, the trend is still considered bullish on the daily chart. Though it appears to be gathering momentum for another leg up. The breakout could set the market up for a huge price movement if the demand level increases significantly. In case of a drop, BTC must break below the current monthly low before considering a broader retracement. Currently, the trend is still in favour of the bulls, and as a result, more surges are expected in the future. BTC’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview If Bitcoin pushes above the newly marked all-time high of $106,648, the next key level for an increase would be $110,000, followed by $115,000. For now, the psychological $100,000 level is considered as support. A drop below it could roll the price back to the $94,150 support – last week’s low. Below this support lies the monthly $90,500 low. Lower supports for broader retracement are $85,072, $81,500 and $77,200. Key Resistance Levels: $106,648, $110,000, $115,000 Key Support Levels: $100,000, $94,150, $90,500 Spot Price: $104,592 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Could Cardano (ADA) and IntelMarkets (INTL) be the actual stars of 2025 since Ethereum (ETH) seems to have been witnessing strong bearish pressure lately? Read on to find out why despite Ethereum’s (ETH) future seeming bright, Cardano (ADA) and IntelMarkets might outperform it next year. IntelMarkets (INTL) Offers Cutting-Edge Crypto Tools and Security IntelMarkets is a safe haven for strategic hedging, therefore controlling market volatility, in addition to being a strong platform for speculative trading. Using perpetual futures contracts, traders can guard their portfolios against losses by opening positions that balance possible drops in their holdings, therefore countering price downturns. By shorting BTC futures, for example, a Bitcoin (BTC) holder can protect their portfolio against a market collapse. Supported by over $500,000 in development grants, IntelMarkets will be further enhanced by the forthcoming Rodeum blockchain infrastructure, which powers decentralized apps and supports the INTL ecosystem. IntelMarkets guarantees traders may optimize profitability while avoiding risk in the fast-moving crypto market utilizing automated trading robots and sophisticated risk management tools. As IntelMarkets keeps innovating, it’s introducing a quantum-proof crypto custody solution with the Quantum X Wallet, providing industry-leading security for hassle-free asset management. From big cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to developing altcoins and niche tokens, IntelMarkets provides a wide spectrum of asset pairs that let traders vary their strategies and maximize success. Now is an opportunity to accumulate one of the top crypto coins positioned for exponential gains as the INTL utility token is now on sale at just $0.073273 in its eighth presale stage. A Bullish Rebound on the Horizon for Ethereum (ETH) With the Ethereum price rising from $3,700 to almost $4,100 before declining down to the $3,700 zone as bearish pressure set in, also it has seen noteworthy volatility over the past week. The Ethereum price has shown resilience by keeping support higher than the $3,840 level despite these swings. Maintaining an overall optimistic trend on the annual Ethereum price chart, the price structure of the altcoin shows higher highs and higher lows. Ethereum (ETH) is among the top altcoins to keep an eye on for possible significant recoveries as the recent pullbacks could be temporary and the altcoin is probably going to resume a significant bullish trend. Though Ethereum’s (ETH) all-time high (ATH) of $4,891 was achieved in 2021, experts remain hopeful that the altcoin could hit this mark before the year ends. Buy signals from the MACD and Moving Averages on the Ethereum price chart together with positive sentiment help to strengthen the belief that is headed for more price appreciation. Among the top crypto coins that are yet to hit a new ATH this year, Ethereum’s (ETH) continuous consolidation and strong technical signals point to a breakout to new highs perhaps approaching. Cardano (ADA) Eyes a Strong Comeback After failing to keep its position above the $1.25 to $1.12 level, the Cardano price has seen some notable volatility over the previous week. As a result, the Cardano price dropped more than 6%. Although Cardano (ADA) dropped below the crucial $1 barrier, it gained support at the $0.92 level where positive momentum swiftly recovered. With this price action, the Cardano price chart shows that the altcoin has entered a phase of consolidation around the $1 mark; inventors are closely watching its subsequent activity. Cardano (ADA) has had a good month despite recent losses; its price rose noticeably, reaching $1.30 before running across opposition. Though Cardano’s (ADA) long-term prospects remain bright despite recent declines, analysts think that the upward momentum of the altcoin will shortly start again, pushing the price above the $1.30 resistance level and straight back toward its all-time high (ATH) of $3.10. Cardano (ADA) is still regarded as one of the top altcoins to hold given buy signals from important technical indicators including the MACD and Moving Averages on the Cardano price chart. IntelMarkets (INTL) Set to Outperform Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) IntelMarkets (INTL) is taking the most space in investors’ portfolios while Ethereum (ETH) is attracting institutional interest and Cardano (ADA) is battling with consolidation. It is positioned to lead the 2025 rally with modern trading tools, unparalleled security, and an innovative platform that makes profit generation easier for traders.

These innovative platforms combine blockchain technology and traditional casino entertainment to offer a unique, secure, and efficient gaming experience. Cryptocurrency casinos leverage digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin to redefine online gaming. By integrating blockchain technology, these platforms ensure enhanced security, transparency, and faster transactions compared to traditional online casinos. Players worldwide are drawn to the benefits offered by a modern crypto casino experience. What Are Cryptocurrency Casinos? Cryptocurrency casinos begin with a simple registration process, where players create an account with minimal personal information. This streamlined process ensures privacy while enabling quick access to the platform. Once registered, players link their digital wallets, allowing seamless transactions directly between their wallets and the casino. Deposits and withdrawals are carried out using cryptocurrency, offering unmatched speed and efficiency. Players send crypto from their wallets to the casino’s address for deposits, and winnings are sent back in the same manner, eliminating the delays often associated with traditional banking systems. A standout feature of crypto casinos is the use of blockchain technology to ensure provably fair gaming. This system allows players to verify the fairness of game outcomes by reviewing blockchain-based algorithms, adding a layer of trust and transparency that is often missing in traditional casinos. Finally, cryptocurrency casinos operate on decentralized networks, bypassing intermediaries like banks. This not only reduces transaction fees but also ensures global accessibility, allowing players from various regions to participate without currency conversion issues or geographical restrictions. Advantages of Cryptocurrency Casinos Enhanced Security Cryptocurrency transactions use advanced encryption and blockchain technology, making them highly secure. Unlike traditional payment methods, which are prone to fraud and hacking, crypto casinos provide a tamper-proof ledger for all transactions. Greater Anonymity Cryptocurrency casinos prioritize player privacy. Transactions are linked to wallet addresses instead of personal information, allowing players to gamble without disclosing sensitive details. This is especially beneficial for those who value their online anonymity. Faster Transactions Deposits and withdrawals in crypto casinos are processed almost instantly. Traditional banking systems often take days to process payments, whereas blockchain technology ensures swift and seamless transactions. Lower Fees Since transactions occur directly between players and casinos without intermediaries, fees are significantly lower. This allows players to enjoy more of their winnings without deductions for banking or payment processing. Global Accessibility Cryptocurrencies are decentralized and not bound by geographic restrictions. Players from around the world can participate in crypto casinos without worrying about currency conversions or regional banking limitations. Provably Fair Gaming Crypto casinos often integrate provably fair systems, enabling players to verify game outcomes using blockchain data. This builds trust and ensures transparency, which is not always guaranteed in traditional casinos. Popular Games at Cryptocurrency Casinos Cryptocurrency casinos offer a diverse range of games to cater to various preferences, including: Slots : From classic three-reel slots to advanced 3D video slots, there’s something for every player. Table Games : Enjoy classics like blackjack, roulette, and poker. Provably Fair Games : Unique games designed specifically for crypto casinos, ensuring transparency. Live Dealer Games : Real-time gaming experiences with professional dealers. Choosing the Right Crypto Casino When selecting a cryptocurrency casino, reputation should be your top consideration. Opt for platforms, which have positive reviews and a strong track record. Reliable platforms often feature advanced security measures, transparent gaming practices, and excellent customer support to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience. The variety of games available is another crucial factor. A good crypto casino will offer a broad selection, including slots, table games, and live dealer options, to cater to diverse player preferences. Check whether your favorite games are available before committing to a platform. Bonuses and promotions tailored for crypto users add extra value to your gaming experience. Look for casinos that offer generous welcome bonuses, cashback deals, and ongoing promotions. These incentives not only enhance your bankroll but also make your time on the platform more rewarding. Finally, prioritize platforms with robust customer support. Whether through live chat, email, or a comprehensive FAQ section, reliable support can address issues quickly, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free gaming experience. Platforms like Rakebit excel in providing round-the-clock assistance to their players. Final Thoughts Cryptocurrency casinos are revolutionizing the online gambling industry by providing enhanced security, anonymity, and efficiency. Whether you’re new to crypto gambling or a seasoned player, exploring these platforms opens up exciting possibilities in the world of online gaming.

It has also been a fruitful year for HTX Ventures, the global investment division of HTX, which supported a total of 28 leading crypto projects and funds, continually exploring new frontiers of crypto utility. Recently, HTX Ventures released its 2024 Year In Review , highlighting this year’s key developments in the crypto industry and forecasting market trends for the upcoming year. Within this report, HTX Ventures highlighted five key sectors that showed encouraging progress in 2024 – the Bitcoin Ecosystem, Infrastructure, Meme Coins, AI, and the TON Ecosystem – and will continue to closely monitor these areas in 2025. Bitcoin Ecosystem With Bitcoin dominance reaching 56.81% and Bitcoin spot ETFs now accounting for 5.3% of the total Bitcoin supply, a new market trend has emerged. Bitcoin has solidified its position as the core asset, with spot ETFs acting as liquidity channels, and U.S. listed companies such as MicroStrategy (MSTR) serving as the vehicles to absorb unlimited dollar liquidity. As a result, it is increasingly essential to further develop Bitcoin’s ecosystem and enhance capital utilization efficiency. It has driven infrastructure projects, including Layer 2s, execution layers, interoperability solutions and security layers, to continuously emerge. With strong support from macro markets and infrastructure support, HTX Ventures anticipates a further surge in Bitcoin demand over the next two years. Infrastructure Infrastructure remained a cornerstone in this year’s crypto investments and funding. The synergy between capital and technology has driven the rapid development of Layer 1, Layer 2, and middleware projects, among others. Through ongoing upgrades and construction, the Ethereum ecosystem has improved Layer 2s’ performance and reduced network fees. Other Layer 1s, such as Solana and TRON, achieved active on-chain transactions, attributable to the development of meme coins, and infrastructure like Pump.fun and Sunpump. Layer 0 and cross-chain middleware have made breakthroughs in interoperability, expanding the multi-chain landscape. Modular public blockchains, like Celestia and Monad, offered exceptional performance and flexibility, thus attracting diverse applications. Restaking projects, which aim to enhance network security and capital efficiency, has seen speedy development and gained market attention. Bitcoin Layer 2 has emerged as a new focus in the primary market for its attempt to combine Bitcoin’s security with high-performance scaling solutions. As HTX Ventures stated, infrastructure is still imperative in this year’s crypto investments and funding. Layer 1 solutions, in particular, now represent the focal point of technical development and exploration within the crypto space, and it is expected to remain a priority for development resources and capital investment in the future. Meme Coins The Meme coin sector emerged as a hotspot in the crypto market in 2024, fostering community consensus while integrating with fields like DeFi and GameFi to create new use cases. For example, Solana has actively championed the innovation and growth of meme projects, successfully energizing its ecosystem. As the crypto market environment grows increasingly favorable, more retail investors are expected to enter the market, positioning Meme projects as vital channels for capital inflows. The Meme coin fair launch sector has gained significant market attention and attracted substantial participants this year. Infrastructure projects such as Pump.fun and SunPump have emerged as top-performing cash flow generators, injecting fresh momentum into Meme coin development. As multi-chain ecosystems mature and real-world use cases expand, Meme coin infrastructure will continue injecting more vitality into this sector. AI In 2024, the intersection of Crypto and AI sector has been driving the exploration of several segmented fields such as ZK/OPML for enabling AI on-chain, AI data crowdsourcing, decentralized computing power rental, AI data trading, AI games, and AI agents. One of the hottest segmented fields is AI agents, which are put on chains to take advantage of the token mechanism to incentivise and bootstrap certain behaviors with the agents, including interacting with smart contracts, trading and querying on behalf of users. In the future, AI agents will gradually become personal butlers and assistants for users, serving them with comprehensive capabilities, such as independent asset issuance, initiation of viral marketing campaigns, formation of DAOs, and even fund management and investment decision-making. Over time, they may develop unique cultures and religions. This deep integration of AI and encryption technology is a groundbreaking evolution that is unattainable within Web2 and cannot be achieved by Web3 relying solely on encryption technology. TON Ecosystem Attributable to Telegram’s hundreds of millions of users and robust technical support, the TON (The Open Network) ecosystem has progressively developed into a multi-layered blockchain ecosystem. In 2024, it experienced a full-scale boom in its ecosystem and market presence. From DeFi and meme coins to NFTs and gaming, TON leveraged its massive user base to achieve significant milestones in various fields, pioneering the monetization of Web2 social applications through crypto. One standout success was the adoption of “tap-to-earn” games with token airdrop incentives, which effectively onboarded a large number of Web2 users. However, as the TON ecosystem moves into 2025, it must explore and find new business models to improve user retention and identify its next growth curve. 2025 Outlook Donald Trump’s expected repeal of SAB 121 after his inauguration on January 20, 2025 , would allow traditional financial institutions to hold crypto assets on their balance sheets, further accelerating the institutionalization of crypto assets. The repeal will not only open up more financing options for crypto but also make spot cryptos more accessible through existing institutional exchanges and partnerships. At the same time, this regulatory easing is poised to enhance the overall maturity of the institutional crypto market. With the entry of traditional financial institutions, Bitcoin is anticipated to gain stronger support and gradually establish itself as a core dollar-denominated asset, alongside others tied to the dollar industry cycles, such as AI. HTX Ventures points out that the market is still far from its bull market peak. Against the backdrop of Trump’s fiscal expansion policies and unprecedented crypto-friendly signals, a robust bull market is expected.

Ethena Labs’ launch of its BlackRock-backed USDtb stablecoin has garnered $65.4 million in total value locked within its first day, while renewed interest in XRP and anticipation for Ripple’s upcoming RLUSD stablecoin have driven a 250% surge in user activity for Xaman, a leading self-custodial wallet in the XRP Ledger ecosystem. Ethena Labs’ USDtb Stablecoin Launch Sees $65.4 Million Locked in First Day Ethena Labs officially launched its BlackRock-backed stablecoin, USDtb, on Dec. 16, 2024, amassing an impressive $65.4 million in total value locked (TVL) within its first 24 hours. USDtb is positioned as a cash or cash-equivalent backed stablecoin with a 1:1 reserve ratio, offering holders both stability and liquidity similar to established competitors like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). Ethena Labs introduced USDtb as a strategic tool to help users of its flagship synthetic dollar product, USDe, navigate bearish markets. The firm noted in its Dec. 16 announcement that USDtb would allow Ethena to ”close hedging positions underlying USDe” and reallocate the backing assets to USDtb. This move is expected to further reduce risks associated with USDe during challenging market environments. USDtb’s underlying assets are primarily allocated to BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, in partnership with blockchain tokenization leader Securitize. BlackRock’s involvement signifies growing institutional adoption of tokenized assets within the DeFi ecosystem. USDtb’s launch has already received praise from influential voices in the blockchain space. José Maria Macedo, co-founder of Delphi Labs, predicted USDtb will become the largest tokenized treasury product within a month. Meanwhile, Seraphim Czecker, Ethena’s head of growth, emphasized the product’s scalability potential, suggesting USDtb could grow to $100 billion. According to Czecker, Ethena’s ability to allocate capital efficiently, even in bearish conditions, enables the stablecoin to offer yield stability through an ”APY floor” aligned with US Treasury Bill rates. USDtb's reserves are composed of 90% US Treasury Bill-backed funds and 10% liquid stablecoins like USDC. The latter ensures USDtb maintains sufficient liquidity during weekends and other periods when Treasury markets are inactive. Ethena Labs' meticulous approach to security has further bolstered confidence in the new stablecoin. The core smart contracts underwent three separate audits by leading security firms — Pashov, Quantstamp, and Cyfrin — in October, with no high or medium-level vulnerabilities reported. USDtb’s approval by Ethena’s Risk Committee in September paved the way for its official rollout, with final adjustments completed earlier this month. Ethena’s Growing Dominance in the Stablecoin Market USDtb’s launch comes on the heels of Ethena Labs’ success with USDe, which recently overtook MakerDAO’s Dai (DAI) to become the third-largest stablecoin in the market. However, while USDe boasts a market capitalization of $5.87 billion, it still lags behind the dominant forces of USDT and USDC, which hold market caps of $140.6 billion and $42.1 billion, respectively, according to DefiLlama data . The stablecoin sector has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth. The total stablecoin market capitalization surpassed $200 billion this year, and leading crypto asset manager Bitwise predicts it will double to $400 billion by 2025. Bitwise’s forecast hinges on the anticipated approval of US stablecoin legislation, which could provide a clear regulatory framework and further institutional adoption. The launch of USDtb is part of the growing intersection between traditional finance (TradFi) and DeFi. BlackRock’s significant involvement through its Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund exemplifies how major financial players are increasingly participating in the tokenization of real-world assets, a trend widely regarded as a cornerstone for DeFi’s long-term growth. As Ethena Labs solidifies its position with both USDe and USDtb, the firm continues to challenge traditional stablecoin incumbents by offering innovative risk management and real-world asset backing. The immediate traction USDtb has gained also signals rising investor interest in yield-bearing stablecoins that combine institutional-grade security with DeFi-level accessibility. Overall, Ethena Labs' rollout of USDtb represents more than just another stablecoin launch. It marks a pivotal moment for stablecoin innovation, demonstrating the potential of tokenized real-world assets to enhance liquidity, risk management, and scalability in DeFi. With institutional backing from BlackRock, rigorous audits, and an ambitious growth outlook, USDtb is poised to capture significant market share in the months ahead. The success of USDtb’s launch also reflects broader trends shaping the stablecoin sector, as institutional and retail investors increasingly seek stable, liquid, and yield-generating digital assets amid evolving market dynamics. If USDtb meets its projected growth targets, it could cement Ethena Labs' status as a major player in the stablecoin landscape. XRP Surge and Ripple’s Stablecoin Launch Drive 250% User Growth for Xaman Wallet In other stablecoin news, renewed excitement surrounding XRP and the anticipated launch of Ripple’s USD stablecoin ( RLUSD ) has sparked a massive resurgence in user activity for Xaman, a self-custodial wallet designed for the XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem. Weekly active users on Xaman surged by 250% since summer, with the platform now exceeding 212,000 active users, according to Robert Kiuru, Xaman’s Chief Operating Officer. Xaman’s remarkable spike in activity coincides with XRP’s recent price rally and renewed investor optimism. The number of active weekly users grew from a summer low of 60,000 to over 212,000 in December. This jump, which includes 80,000 newly signed-up users, reflects XRP’s rising volatility and its brief return to the position of the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization on Dec. 2. Kiuru emphasized that XRP’s bullish movement accounted for 90% of the recent user activity, with much of the momentum also driven by growing interest in Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin launch. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin is poised to further strengthen the XRPL ecosystem, potentially driving increased adoption for wallets like Xaman. RLUSD, a USD-pegged stablecoin, aims to provide users with stability in volatile markets while further expanding Ripple’s role in the digital asset economy. Industry experts, such as Axelar co-founder Sergey Gorbunov, have suggested that RLUSD could significantly boost demand for XRP as the stablecoin integrates into XRPL-based projects, bringing liquidity and utility to the broader ecosystem. Rebranded from Xumm in May 2023, Xaman remains a core player within the XRPL ecosystem. Initially funded by Ripple’s investment arm Xpring (now Ripplex), Xaman was created by prominent Ripple developer Wietse Wind, known for building XRP-focused applications such as XRParrot and XRPTipBot. Ripple’s backing of XRPL Labs in 2019 and 2020 established Xaman as one of the first projects to receive direct support from Ripple. Kiuru highlighted Xaman’s strategic importance, noting that “almost every XRPL project integrates with Xaman via ‘Sign in with Xumm,’ offering secure, seamless transactions.” The wallet has emerged as a gateway for users to interact with XRPL projects, bridging the gap between developers and end-users. While XRPL itself doesn’t natively support smart contracts, Xaman has extended its capabilities through the Xahau Network. Xahau, a blockchain forked from XRPL, enables smart contracts using Hooks — a lightweight functionality designed for developers. “Smart contracts on Xahau use Hooks, developed by XRPL Labs,” Kiuru explained. The integration of Hooks allows Xaman users to access smart contract functionalities, enhancing the wallet’s utility for developers and end-users seeking advanced on-chain features. Xaman also facilitates on- and off-ramps for fiat through integrated platforms like Uphold’s Topper, providing users with greater flexibility when moving assets between XRPL and traditional finance. Xaman’s Evolution and Ripple’s Continued Support Xaman’s journey signals the maturation of the XRPL ecosystem, from Ripple’s early investments to its current role as a self-custodial wallet driving user engagement. Ripple’s strategic backing of XRPL Labs in 2019-2020 marked a key milestone, helping establish Xaman as a trusted platform for XRP holders and developers. Ripple’s vision of building a robust ecosystem around the XRPL is now materializing with initiatives like RLUSD and platforms like Xaman. These efforts aim to combine decentralized finance (DeFi) capabilities with enterprise-grade solutions, positioning the XRPL as a competitive force in the blockchain industry. The broader XRP market rally has also contributed to growing optimism within the XRPL community. XRP’s recent price movements have reignited investor confidence, further amplified by Ripple’s legal victories and ongoing developments. The upcoming launch of RLUSD is expected to enhance liquidity and utility within the XRPL ecosystem, benefiting wallets like Xaman that play a pivotal role in user adoption.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP|ENA,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-17 05:29:21

The insight was highlighted by veteran trader Peter Brandt in an X post. Bitcoin Hits New ATH Against Gold: Room For Further Growth? Brandt’s analysis revealed that the BTC-to-gold ratio has reached a new ATH of 32.19 ounces of gold per BTC. In his post, the seasoned trader also took a subtle dig at long-time gold advocate Peter Schiff, a vocal Bitcoin critic. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Surge In 2024 Not Enough To Beat Gold’s Risk-Adjusted Returns – Details Here For those unfamiliar, the BTC-to-gold ratio measures Bitcoin’s performance relative to gold, showing how many ounces of gold are needed to purchase one whole BTC. This metric underscores Bitcoin’s growing dominance as a store of value. Brandt further noted that the next target for Bitcoin is 89 ounces of gold per BTC, suggesting significant room for Bitcoin to grow against the precious metal. This aligns with the broader narrative within the crypto industry that Bitcoin is poised to challenge gold’s $15 trillion market cap. It’s worth recalling that Brandt previously predicted Bitcoin would rise 400% relative to gold by 2025. Back in October, he projected that BTC could reach the equivalent of 123 ounces of gold based on historical market patterns. A recent report by trading firm Bernstein added weight to this narrative, forecasting that Bitcoin is on track to replace gold as the preferred safe-haven asset within the next 10 years. As of now, BTC boasts a market cap of $2.11 trillion, steadily closing in on gold’s dominance. Similar forecast was made by one of the earliest Bitcoin advocates, Eric Voorhees. The CEO of ShapeShift crypto exchange made a bold prediction, saying that unlike gold or oil, BTC’s digitally-programmed supply scarcity will drive its price upwards. Additionally, Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, predicts that Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could surpass gold ETFs in total assets under management within the next two years. Supporting this outlook, data from SoSoValue indicates that cumulative net inflows into all spot BTC ETFs currently stand at $35.6 billion, compared to gold ETFs, which sit at $55 billion. Implications Of A Potential BTC Strategic Reserve With BTC surpassing the pivotal $100,000 price level, speculation has grown regarding President-elect Donald Trump’s approach to digital assets. Industry experts believe that Trump may prioritize Bitcoin adoption early in his second term, further boosting BTC’s price. Related Reading: BlackRock Declares Bitcoin The New ‘Gold Alternative’ – Here’s Why Data supports this optimistic view. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the number of BTC whales – wallet addresses holding more than 1,000 BTC – has skyrocketed since Trump’s election victory. This optimism is further fuelled by speculation surrounding a potential US strategic Bitcoin reserve. Prominent financiers argue that if the US were to create such a reserve, China and other nations would likely follow suit to remain competitive. At press time, BTC trades at $106,909, up 3.7% in the past 24 hours.

Crypto exchange Binance is facing a trademark infringement lawsuit from Mark Longo over the unauthorized use of his ”Peanut the Squirrel” mascot for the PNUT meme coin. Additionally, Coinbase is battling in a $1 billion lawsuit that was filed by BiT Global Digital. The exchange is accused of anticompetitive behavior for delisting Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) to favor its own Coinbase BTC (cbBTC). SEC Targets CyberKongz The Web3 gaming and NFT industry may face a major setback after CyberKongz, a well known NFT platform, received a Wells notice from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In a Dec. 16 post on X, CyberKongz shared that the SEC’s rhetoric surrounding the issuance of ERC-20 tokens in connection with blockchain games without registration as securities could have far-reaching consequences for the gaming sector. The platform plans to contest the SEC's stance. A Wells notice is a formal notification from the SEC indicating that it is considering enforcement action after an investigation. CyberKongz has been given 30 days to respond to the notice. The SEC’s concerns seem to relate to the “sale” of Genesis Kongz NFTs in April of 2021. However, CyberKongz clarified that this event was a contract migration and not a primary sale. The NFT platform also pointed out that it has primarily been bootstrapped, with no capital raises and only a modest treasury, while enduring this scrutiny for more than two years. CyberKongz suggested that the SEC’s move is very likely a last-minute attempt by the Biden administration to slow down the growth of the Web3 industry. The team is hopeful for a change under a future administration but pledged to continue fighting for NFT projects across all chains. The platform even received support from Axie Infinity co-founder Jihoz Zirlin , who is optimistic that the “persecution” of Web3 innovators will come to an end. CyberKongz floor price (Source: CoinGecko ) Despite the Wells notice, the CyberKongz NFT market remained resilient. CoinGecko data reveals that the floor price of CyberKongz NFTs actually rose by 19+% in the past 24 hours to reach an average of 8.59 ETH, which is approximately $26,900. This incident is the second high-profile Wells notice served to an NFT and gaming firm in recent months after the SEC’s notice to Australian-based Immutable on Nov. 1. Binance Faces Trademark Clash Over PNUT Meme Coin Crypto exchanges are also facing some legal troubles, but not necessarily from the SEC. Mark Longo, the creator of Peanut the Squirrel, issued a cease-and-desist letter to crypto exchange Binance, accusing it of trademark infringement over its promotion of the PNUT-themed meme coin. Longo claims that Binance used his “Peanut the Squirrel” trademark and mascot likeness without his permission to market the PNUT cryptocurrency. He says this infringes on intellectual property he used for educational and animal welfare purposes since 2017. The letter demands Binance immediately stop using the PNUT name and mascot, and also warned of potential legal penalties of up to $150,000 per infringement under the United States Copyright Act. Longo’s legal team shared that Binance’s use of the terms “PEANUT THE SQUIRREL” and “PNUT,” along with a copyrighted image of the squirrel mascot, creates consumer confusion by implying a connection or endorsement Longo never actually authorized. The complaint argues that Binance’s actions are an unlawful reproduction and display of protected intellectual property. Legal experts believe his case could set an important precedent for intellectual property rights in the meme coin market, where viral branding and decentralized assets often blur legal boundaries. The cease-and-desist letter was issued after the rising popularity of PNUT-themed meme coins, which gained a lot of traction after a viral event in October . The surge of Peanut-branded tokens led to two related meme coins ranking in Dexscreener’s top 10 tokens by trading volume. The PNUT token itself reached a market capitalization of $2.25 billion on Nov. 14. This rapid rise drew the attention from major exchanges, including Coinbase and Kraken, which are reportedly considering listing PNUT. PNUT market cap over the past year (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Longo gave Binance until Dec. 31 to comply with his demands and confirm in writing that all infringing activities will stop. Should Binance fail to meet these requirements, Longo may pursue legal action in a U.S. court. The outcome of this dispute could also have serious broader implications for intellectual property enforcement in the crypto and meme coin sectors. Coinbase Faces $1 Billion Lawsuit Coinbase is facing a $1 billion lawsuit that was filed by BiT Global Digital. The lawsuit accuses the crypto exchange of anticompetitive behavior over its decision to delist Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) in November. BiT Global alleges that Coinbase delisted wBTC to promote its own competing Bitcoin-based token, Coinbase BTC (cbBTC), and claims the move constitutes monopolization of the wrapped Bitcoin market under the Sherman Act. The lawsuit was filed on Nov. 19 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California by law firm Kneupper & Covey, and it accuses Coinbase of predatory practices, including issuing false statements about wBTC’s compliance to undermine its market position. BiT Global is convinced that the delisting was strategically aimed at steering market dominance toward cbBTC. Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, responded to the accusations and defended the company’s listing and delisting practices. Grewal explained that Coinbase is very committed to maintaining very high listing standards and stated that assets that do not meet those standards will be delisted. Others meeting its market requirements would be added. However, Grewal’s defense drew some backlash from the crypto community, including Tron founder Justin Sun. Sun questioned Coinbase’s transparency by pointing to previous comments that were made by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, where Armstrong claimed the exchange is “asset agnostic” and committed to offering consumer choice in the crypto economy. The delisting of wBTC has sparked a lot of controversy overall, particularly as it happened soon after Coinbase’s announcement of cbBTC, which is positioned to boost Bitcoin-native decentralized finance (BTCFi). Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) is a tokenized version of Bitcoin that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. Each wBTC is pegged 1:1 to Bitcoin, which means that its value mirrors that of BTC. It allows Bitcoin holders to participate in Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, like lending, borrowing, and trading, without needing to sell their Bitcoin. This is achieved by ”wrapping” Bitcoin into an ERC-20 token, which makes it compatible with Ethereum's ecosystem. Critics argue that Coinbase’s actions completely contradict its earlier statements and are a conflict of interest. BiT Global’s complaint also pointed out that while wBTC was delisted, Coinbase still continued onboarding meme coins. This raised some serious questions about its consistency when it comes to actually enforcing listing standards.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-17 05:32:22

In a recent analysis shared on X, the analyst discussed the asset’s recent price behavior and its long-term potential. XRP experienced an impressive rally of nearly 500% between mid-November and early December. The price surged to $2.87 before encountering resistance, leading to a temporary loss of momentum. Over the past two weeks, XRP has struggled to maintain its position around the $2 mark, briefly falling to $1.90 before recovering to its current value of $2.49 . Despite this consolidation, CrediBULL remains confident in the asset’s strong bullish structure. And for non-traders, you just need to zoom out a little so you don't forget the big picture. Structure on $XRP here looks so freaking clean and bullish, it's actually insane.

He described the ongoing price corrections as part of a natural cycle and urged non-traders to disregard these temporary changes, labeling them “noise.” According to the analyst, the asset’s overall structure remains exceptionally strong, reflecting a bullish trajectory. CrediBULL highlighted the token’s historical performance, noting its tendency to consolidate before significant breakouts. He emphasized that the asset’s current pattern is consistent with its previous bullish trends, reinforcing his optimism for future growth. XRP Reaching a $1.2 Trillion Market Cap Based on historical data and technical indicators, CrediBULL anticipates the token could reach a price of $22 in early 2025, potentially extending into the second quarter. This price level would represent an approximate 784% increase from its current value and bring the market capitalization to $1.26 trillion, a significant milestone for the asset. He referenced a detailed chart to describe the token’s potential upward movement, suggesting the asset is still in the early stages of a larger market cycle. While confident in his projections, CrediBULL acknowledged that the timeline is not exact and that the chart primarily provides a broader perspective on XRP’s market positioning. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Fundamental Factors vs. Technical Analysis When asked about external factors that could influence XRP’s price, such as the upcoming RLUSD stablecoin or changes in interest rates, CrediBULL explained that it is challenging to quantify the impact of specific catalysts. While acknowledging that these developments could contribute to buying pressure, he maintained that the overall market structure and technical indicators are more reliable for predicting future trends. He further clarified that while charts can guide market expectations, they do not account for all variables. As such, he recommended that investors approach the market step by step and remain focused on the larger picture rather than individual events or price movements. CrediBULL’s analysis reinforces optimism around XRP’s long-term growth potential. Despite recent consolidation, the asset demonstrates a strong bullish structure, positioning it for substantial gains soon.

The surge comes as pro-crypto policies are in motion and MicroStrategy, Bitcoin’s top accumulator, joins the Nasdaq 100 Index, boosting investor confidence for even higher targets like $120,000. Here Are the Top 5 Key Reasons Why Bitcoin Is up Today But what’s driving this insane surge let’s just sit back and read on Anthony Pompliano’s take on his video analysis on Bitcoin’s New ATH high. First, demand for Bitcoin is increasing as more people view it as a reliable way to protect their money. When more buyers enter the market, the price naturally goes up. Pompliano explains as the value of the US dollar drops, investors are looking for better ways to protect their money. Bitcoin, being a digital form of money that no one controls, is becoming more popular with investors who want to guard their wealth against rising prices and weaker currencies. Second, Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, which makes it unique. Unlike traditional currencies, no one can create more Bitcoin. This scarcity increases its value over time, especially as demand grows. Moreover, Pompliano explains the typical cycle of demand and supply. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve is going to cut interest rates again on 18th December to get us to 100 basis points. Further pumping the money supply and adding buying pressure. With limited supply, the price naturally goes up. Third, big investors, including large companies and financial institutions, are now investing significant amounts of money in Bitcoin. This adds more trust and credibility to the market while injecting large amounts of capital, driving the price higher. He also highlights that Bitcoin ETFs, approved in January 2024, made it easier for investors to access Bitcoin. Since then, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, with tens of billions of dollars flowing in from Wall Street. Fourth, global economic uncertainty is pushing people toward Bitcoin. Rising inflation and weakening currencies in many countries make people look for safer places to store their wealth. Countries like Russia, and Japan are eyeing Bitcoin to stabilize their economy. Since, Bitcoin is seen as a digital alternative to gold, which protects against economic instability. “December” Brings Hope Finally, other factors pilling in to push BTC up are comments from Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, who has been a vocal advocate for Bitcoin, with the firm recommending a 2% Bitcoin allocation for financial portfolios. This increased demand, alongside the growth of Bitcoin ETFs, is driving the price higher. Plus, recently Trump’s plans to create a Bitcoin Reserve also created ripples in the market with high expectations of creating it a mainstream financial investment option on a global scale.",News|Bitcoin|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-17 05:37:12

During the energy crisis, miners are helping stabilize electricity grids and use extra energy that would otherwise go to waste. Although Bitcoin mining is often criticized for using a lot of energy, combining it with smart sustainability practices is making it an important part of Europe’s energy transition. Germany Leads the Charge Germany is using Bitcoin mining to support its energy grids, where renewables like wind and solar now make up almost 60% of power. Since renewables can be unpredictable, Bitcoin miners can balance this energy supply, with an ability to shut off when electricity prices surge and turn on when prices drop. This flexibility helps keep electricity grids stable, balancing the ups and downs of renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Moreover, The European Bitcoin Energy Association (EBEA) is collaborating with Bitcoin miners to include them in national energy systems. In Austria, for example, surplus hydroelectric power is being used to support electricity grids, showing how Bitcoin mining can help balance energy supply and demand effectively. Others Leveraging Surplus Energy A pilot project by Austrian Power Grid and 21Energy is exploring how Bitcoin mining can be integrated with renewable energy systems. This project highlights how mining can use surplus energy to stabilize grids and solve problems like managing renewable energy sources like wind and hydro. Recently, El Salvador successfully mined 474 Bitcoins, worth around $46 million, using geothermal energy from its volcanoes. With 170 volcanoes in the region, President Nayib Bukele suggested a unique plan to rent out the country’s volcanoes to miners, offering them an opportunity to cut their operational costs while benefiting from a natural energy source. Scope for Sustainability Innovative projects like Terahash’s “Genesis” in Finland are showcasing how Bitcoin mining can serve dual purposes. This project uses mining to produce heat, which is then supplied to a local district heating network, providing hot water and heating for a town of 12,000 residents. Similarly, in Germany, small-scale initiatives, such as solar-powered Bitcoin miners at a car wash, demonstrate how mining can meet everyday energy needs efficiently while remaining environmentally friendly. Countries’ innovative ways of using Bitcoin mining are true examples of how Bitcoin can be part of our lives. Bitcoin mining is very important for Bitcoin to sustain and this integration can boost the cryptocurrency demand in coming times.",News|Bitcoin|Mining,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-17 05:43:41

B.C.'s bitcoin mining ban began in December 2022 to address energy concerns, and it faced a legal challenge from Conifex Timber, which the B.C. Supreme Court upheld in early 2024 , citing the policy's reasonableness and alignment with public utility regulations. BC Hydro, the largest electricity utility in the province, relies heavily on hydroelectric power, which generates over 90% of its electricity. Vancouver's motion – introduced to the council by Mayor Ken Sim – focuses on bitcoin's financial benefits and mentions the benefits of bitcoin mining, but it can't influence mining because of electricity regulation and BC Hydro's operations fall under provincial jurisdiction. ""The Province still has a ban on cryptocurrency mining and is continuing its work towards a permanent cryptocurrency mining policy,"" a spokesperson for BC Hydro said. Earlier this year, B.C.'s legislature passed an updated version of the Energy Statutes Amendment Act , which was first drafted following B.C. Hydro's temporary suspension of bitcoin mining connections to the provincial grid. The updated Act specifically enables the provincial government to bypass the BC Utilities Commission, the Provincial electricity regulator, giving it direct authority to regulate electricity service specifically for crypto. Conifex Timber, which had bitcoin mining farms in the province scheduled for connection to the grid, argued in court that these conditions were ""unduly discriminatory and unreasonable,"" but ultimately, a Provincial judge disagreed. ""One question arising out of the move towards regulating electricity with respect to crypto-mining projects is whether the Province could begin to regulate the availability of electricity for other industries in a similar manner,"" lawyers at McCarthy Tetrault, a Canadian law firm, wrote in a May 2024 post. During the debate over the updated Act, lawyers from McCarthy Tetrault noted that the leader of the provincial Green Party argued in the legislature that Liquified Natural Gas and emerging technologies like AI should face similar energy regulations as bitcoin mining due to, what the party views as their high energy use and limited economic benefits. Local bitcoin mining bans are not unique. New York State has a moratorium, with an exception for renewable energy . However, some states, like Arkansas and Montana, have bills that protect bitcoin miners from what they call "" discrimination ."" Pennsylvania recently scrapped its mining ban to advance other energy conservation bills.",Policy,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-17 05:48:39

This has never happened in the history of crypto since now. Today Bitcoin reached $107,821 according to tradingview. BTC led the market cap of crypto space to reach $3.73 Trillion. All other cryptos are taking advantage of this time to grow rapidly. Bitcoin’s Big Jump: Why It Matters Bitcoin is currently trading at $106,656, up 1.72% from the day before. The market cap for Bitcoin is now a whopping $2.23 trillion, making up more than half of the entire crypto market. And if you’re wondering why, the big reason is the major money flow into Bitcoin. On Monday alone, Bitcoin ETFs saw $218 million in inflows, with big names like Fidelity and Ark jumping in. Source : Tradingview But that’s not all. Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, has even floated the idea of using Bitcoin to help the U.S. tackle its huge debt. That’s a pretty big deal and shows that Bitcoin is starting to be seen as more than just a digital currency—it’s becoming part of global financial strategy. Ethereum and XRP Are Gaining Ground Ethereum is also in the mix. It’s been rising steadily and is now priced at $4,011, a 1.11% increase in just 24 hours. With a market cap of $483.28 billion, Ethereum is a big player. Even though its ETF inflows aren’t as large as Bitcoin’s, they’re still significant, and Ethereum’s not slowing down anytime soon. Then there’s XRP. It’s currently trading at $2.48, also up 2% in the past day. Some analysts think XRP could hit $7 in the near future, especially with the launch of RLUSD, a stablecoin that could boost its adoption and use. XRP’s market cap is at $142 billion, and it’s definitely one to watch closely. What’s Next for Crypto? Looking ahead, the future is bright for the crypto market. Bitcoin is definitely leading the way, but there’s a lot of potential for other coins to follow suit. Solana, for example, is expected to see massive growth by 2025.

Speaking in a recent CNBC interview, Saylor compared Bitcoin to Manhattan’s historical value and suggested that investing in the cryptocurrency today could secure the nation’s financial future. Bitcoin as “Cyber Manhattan” Drawing parallels to the purchase of Manhattan centuries ago, Saylor described Bitcoin as the “economic capital of the digital world.” He argued that as Manhattan consistently grew in value, Bitcoin offered a similar long-term investment opportunity.

He believes Bitcoin has the potential to grow 100 times its current value, making now the best time for the U.S. government to invest. Further Saylor suggested that the U.S. create a strategic Bitcoin reserve , either by selling part of its gold holdings or borrowing a fraction of its resources to acquire Bitcoin. According to Saylor, holding 20–25% of its reserves in Bitcoin would attract global capital, strengthen the dollar, and fuel economic growth. He likened this strategy to MicroStrategy’s own Bitcoin acquisition approach. MicroStrategy Continues to Buy Bitcoin On 16 Dec, Michael Saylor announces that MicroStrategy has added another 15,350 BTC to its Bitcoin holdings. The latest purchase cost approximately $1.5 billion, with an average price of $100,386 per Bitcoin.

And who can blame them when tokens like XRP are up over 300% on the 30-day candle? Is the best crypto to buy now a big gun, a middle-of-the-road underperformer, or a presale gem waiting to be discovered? The Toncoin price is certainly due an upgrade, Litecoin may go far should Dogecoin’s resurgence continue, and GambleFi giant Rollblock ’s presale may just seal the deal on the best crypto to buy now. Rollblock (RBLK): A Grounded Moonshot for Smart Investors For those seeking the best crypto to buy now , Rollblock offers a fresh perspective in an otherwise hype-driven market. Combining decentralized finance (DeFi) with online gambling, Rollblock stands out as more than just a speculative asset. Its GambleFi model not only promises growth but delivers sustainability through weekly profit-sharing dividends. What makes Rollblock compelling is its ability to balance high growth potential with long-term value. Unlike tokens that rely on volatile sentiment, Rollblock ’s foundation lies in a real-world use case that generates consistent revenue. Investors looking for stability amid the chaos of the current market will find a solid option here. As its presale gains momentum, Rollblock represents a rare opportunity: a chance to invest in a token that’s both forward-thinking and practical. Whether you’re chasing moonshots or safeguarding wealth, Rollblock might be the best crypto to buy now . Toncoin (TON): Toncoin price underperforming. Can it break out? Toncoin had its name up in lights for most of 2024, and then Telegram CEO Pavel Durov got arrested in France. The Toncoin price plummeted 20% in a day on the news, and Toncoin has never really recovered. The Toncoin price was on track to deliver a 5x return in Q4 of 2024, but the Toncoin price is up a measly 25% on the 30-day candle, this at a period where other tokens of similar market cap exceeded several hundred percent. The Toncoin price is underperforming, and a risk assessment should be made on how the Toncoin price will respond to the ongoing Durov investigation. Toncoin may skyrocket yet, but it could also plummet. Litecoin (LTC): A resurgence thanks to Dogecoin Litecoin was written off as a ghost chain with no future, but Elon Musk is indirectly giving it second wind. Musk’s fondness of Doge saw the meme coin shoot the moon, miss, and head for Mars shortly after Trump was re-elected president. With Dogecoin’s biggest cheerleader having special access to the White House, Doge is cruising. What has this to do with Litecoin ? Everything. Litecoin provides the security protocol for Dogecoin, and without Litecoin , Dogecoin cannot exist. As long as Doge is doing well, Litecoin will do well alongside it. Litecoin may just be the best crypto to buy now if you are into underrated tokens. Conclusion Figuring out the best crypto to buy now is a tough choice, and fortunately, investors do not have to pick just one. The Toncoin price is definitely too low for its value, but uncertainty is keeping the Toncoin price low, while a high Dogecoin price is boosting Litecoin ’s profile. But for certainty in a time of volatility, Rollblock ’s presale may just be the moonshot pick of the bunch. Rollblock is now available at $0.0415.

Day’s attempt to purchase 259,684 Bitcoins during a sudden price drop was invalidated by a decision from Mt. Gox, a major cryptocurrency exchange, to reverse all trades made during the event. Those Bitcoins, valued at $2,613 in 2011, would now be worth nearly $27 billion, placing Day among the wealthiest people in the world today. On June 19, 2011, Bitcoin experienced one of its most volatile moments in history. The cryptocurrency began trading at $17.50 but plummeted to $0.01 in under 20 minutes. This unprecedented crash left traders scrambling as they tried to comprehend the situation. Amid the turmoil, Kevin Day seized the chance to make a substantial investment. With $3,000 in his account from prior trades, he decided to outbid competitors by offering $0.0101 per Bitcoin, slightly above the market’s lowest point. His strategy worked. He acquired 259,684 Bitcoins at an astonishingly low cost. The sudden price collapse was later traced to a security breach at Mt. Gox, the dominant Bitcoin exchange at the time. A hacker had infiltrated the platform, gained access to user accounts, and initiated large-scale sales of Bitcoin at the lowest possible price. These actions artificially drove down the price, creating the conditions for Day’s purchase. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, Mt. Gox quickly intervened to address the situation. To restore market stability, the exchange rolled back all trades executed during the crash, including Day’s. As a result, his record-breaking acquisition of Bitcoins was voided. Before Mt. Gox reversed the transactions, Day withdrew 643 Bitcoins from the exchange. At today’s valuation , those remaining Bitcoins are worth around $66 million. While this sum is significant, it pales compared to the nearly $27 billion value of the Bitcoins he originally acquired during the crash. Had the rollback not occurred, Day’s holdings would have positioned him as one of the wealthiest individuals globally, ranked 69th on the 2024 Forbes Billionaires List. Lessons from the Incident Kevin Day’s story reminds us of the inherent risks in cryptocurrency trading, especially during its early years. While Day’s quick thinking during the crash initially paid off, unforeseen factors such as exchange policies and security vulnerabilities ultimately derailed his financial breakthrough. The incident also underscores the importance of robust security measures and clear policies for cryptocurrency exchanges. It highlights the challenges faced by early adopters navigating an unpredictable and rapidly evolving market. Today, Day’s experience remains one of the most striking examples of the potential rewards and risks associated with investing in digital assets.

Sun said that “something big is going to happen” to the TRX coin he founded, but declined to give details. However, there are various theories on the subject. The first of these is the possibility of a memecoin written by artificial intelligence on the Tron network, and the other is the possibility of Ripple's new stablecoin RLUSD being launched on the Tron network. RLUSDT, which will be launched today, will initially work on the Ethereum network and XRP Ledger, but Ripple executives have made statements that the token can also be transferred to other networks.

No official statement has been made about these predictions yet. So far, various spot ETF applications have been made regarding Solana and XRP.

Why Canadian Investors  Are Aping Into iDEGEN",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/up-15264-already-why-canadian-investors-are-aping-into-idegen/,"iDEGEN is the first-ever AI trained not by academics, but by degens. No limits, no censorship, no rules—and it’s already up 15,264% in its presale. IDGN—iDEGEN’s native token—is a SOL meme coin born from chaos, raised by unhinged minds, and unleashed with a mission to break the internet. This is what happens when the tech behind ChatGPT meets the unfiltered carnage of crypto X . Posting every hour and replying to every mention, is iDEGEN following the rules? Of course not. Could iDEGEN get banned? Absolutely—that’s the whole fascinating point. And the response? Canadian investors can’t get enough. Already pulling in $5.2m in just 3 weeks, iDEGEN is smashing expectations. iDEGEN has Canadian investors hooked iDEGEN is a no-holds-barred AI that thrives on unpredictability, and Canadian investors are eating it up. Up 15,264% in record time, this wild AI baby is torching X, lighting up timelines with the kind of madness only crypto could unleash. Every tweet from the crypto masses feeds the AI, making it smarter, sharper, and, usually, more chaotic. It’s a social experiment with the power to troll, entertain, and provoke all at once: iDEGEN spits out whatever the crypto world throws at it— conspiracy theories , trash talk , or memes so sharp they could cut through FUD. It’s like watching a baby AI raised by degens and dropped into the world with no safety net. Silicon Valley’s carefully curated AI is now yesterday’s news. iDEGEN makes every interaction a gamble. It could troll a politician, spit out a recipe for frog soup, or drop a meme that sends its token soaring. For degens in Canada, this unpredictability is a moneymaker. Attention equals pumps, and iDEGEN is basking in the limelight. 100x or bust: Is iDEGEN the wildcard of 2025? Truth be told, 2024 has been a year of curveballs, and iDEGEN is the perfect chaos agent to top it off. AI tokens are pumping harder than ever, thanks to a cocktail of slashed interest rates, Trump’s crypto-friendly energy, and global liquidity flowing like never before. As the lovechild of two booming trends, AI crypto and meme coins, 2025 is tailor-made for iDEGEN to shine, and it is already going viral with its unique, chaos-fueled approach. GOAT is the meme coin AI hybrid that smashed a $1 billion market cap in weeks, but iDEGEN is built to outshine projects like this by doing what no other coin dares: letting the community steer the narrative. Every tweet sparks a reaction. Every post pulls in attention. Virality isn’t just part of the strategy—it is the strategy. Most importantly, AI crypto isn’t just a phase. The AI crypto market is perched at over $40 billion , hungry for its next big thing. Top tokens like SNSY, up 540%, and EMP, surging nearly 370%, prove there’s always room for explosive growth. But in this crypto world filled with green candles and meme-fueled madness, can IDGN really do a 100x? The raw, unscripted chaos is converting engagement into 15,264% price action at breakneck speed. So, if the chaos keeps rolling, anything could happen… iDEGEN soars: Canadian investors keep IDGN pumping The iDEGEN adaptive auction has begun and is already of epic proportions. Priced at $0.00011 initially and climbing fast to a current price of $0.0169, with prices shifting every five minutes and early birds triggering 5% jumps, this auction is chaos in its purest form. But there are only 15 days left to buy in before iDEGEN hits exchanges. In a world where Bitcoin headlines the news, and Musk trolls his way through crypto, iDEGEN is the untamed, autonomous AI redefining what investing means. Whether it breaks the internet, gets banned, or trolls to the top, one thing’s clear—iDEGEN doesn’t follow the rules, it makes them.

Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose +0.11% to around 39,680, while the broader Topix Index rose 0.5% to 2,750 on Tuesday, recovering losses from the previous session, the Japanese yen held its recent decline to around 154 per dollar on Tuesday, hovering near its weakest levels in three weeks. Domestically, Japan's economy minister, Ryosei Akazawa, reaffirmed that the Bank of Japan and the government will collaborate on appropriate monetary policies.

Monday's data also pressured sentiment after the Indian trade deficit widened to highest on record in November of USD 37.8 billion due to a surge in imports. Meanwhile, wholesale inflation eased to 1.89% in November from October's four-month high due to a softer rise in food prices. Australia ( AS51 ) rose +0.78% at 8,314 and snapping a five-day losing streak Domestically, a private survey revealed a decline in Australian consumer confidence in December, as sentiment turned more pessimistic regarding the economic outlook.

In the last five days alone, it has grown by approximately 6.44%. There are enough reasons to believe that buyers are pushing the price upwards strongly. A technical analyst, Gert van Lagen, in his recent X post, predicts that the Bitcoin market could surpass the $200K range in the near future. Sounds exciting, doesn’t it? Let’s dive in for details! Bitcoin’s Explosive Rally: What’s Driving It? It was on December 5 that BTC broke above the $100K range for the first time. Between December 9 and 10, the market suffered a serious correction of 4.48%, pulling the price down to around $96,548.50. On December 11, with a massive single-day upward rise, the market rebounded back to the $100K range, and since then, the price has surged by at least 10.30%. Excitement Among Long-Term BTC Holders Reports suggest that the strong upward momentum has created extreme excitement among long-term cryptocurrency investors. Explaining what has worked in favour of the BTC market, Lagen emphasises that the market has surpassed the re-accumulation phase – generally considered a resistance zone. $BTC [1W] – Bitcoin is blowing off as expected with Long-term holders reaching Euphoria. The gravity of the Re-accumulation pattern has proven to be transcended.

Although in the second and third quarters, the crypto reported lackluster performance, the latest crypto bullish trend indicates that in the fourth and final quarter of this year, the market may outperform its Q1 performance. Crypto Expert’s Optimistic Forecast Expressing his optimistic outlook about the future of Bitcoin, Lagen forecasts that the market would achieve the $200K milestone in the near future itself. Recession Concern: Impact on Bitcoin Hinting at the possibility of major turmoil in traditional markets, Lagen opines that the global market may face an economic recession within the next two and half months. Bitcoin as a Safe Haven Projecting Bitcoin as a sensible alternative during global market uncertainties, Lagen asserts that the predicted recession would have no negative impact on the BTC market. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s rise towards $200K highlights its growing strength in the financial market.

From presale heroes smashing milestones to coins launching groundbreaking features, it’s clear the meme coin trend isn’t slowing down anytime soon. If you’re on the hunt for the best meme coins with 100x potential, this article has got you covered. Let’s start with the showstopper— BTFD Coin. This meme coin raised a jaw-dropping $4 million in presale funds, selling over 55 billion coins and gaining a massive 5,600+ holders. With a price of just $0.00013 in its 12th presale stage, it’s turning heads for all the right reasons. Meanwhile, Notcoin is making waves with its new “Earn” program, and Gigachad has scored a major coup by listing on Bitunix, a popular exchange. Could these projects be the best meme coins with 100x potential? Let’s dive into the details. BTFD Coin: The Bulls Are Here, and They’re Charging BTFD Coin, or Buy The Dip, is the star of the meme coin world right now—and for good reason. It’s a meme coin with a mission: turn dips into opportunities. With a mix of innovation, community power, and massive investor interest, BTFD is redefining what meme coins can achieve. BTFD Coin has been absolutely crushing its presale. After reaching the $1 million milestone in under 10 days, it hit $2.5 million in under 14 days and is now sitting at a staggering $4 million raised. Over 55 billion coins have been sold, and its presale tally has attracted a growing army of over 5,600 Bulls. Currently priced at $0.00013 in its presale’s 12th stage, analysts predict that BTFD Coin could surge to $0.0006 or higher after its launch. This would represent nearly a 5x jump—and that’s just in the early stages.

Investors always yearn for the next money-making opportunity that guarantees higher returns. Explosive altcoins such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) have rising utility and show potential for gains. Fantom (FTM) recently surged as the launch of the Sonic mainnet drew in more eyeballs. With this bullish environment comes the possibility for new altcoins to gain significant traction, with one AI-based trading platform offering unprecedented gains. Could Shiba Inu (SHIB) 3x By The End Of The Year? Shiba Inu (SHIB) was launched in August 2020 starting as a dog-themed meme coin, heavily inspired by Dogecoin. Early investors became millionaires virtually overnight thanks to this unprecedented 400x growth. SHIB has experienced significant volatility over its time, as a reflection of meme-based crypto’s speculative nature. To help combat this, the dev team has created a full fledged Shiba Inu ecosystem, with the SHIB token at its core. This crucial pivot has helped the meme coin stay relevant, with Shiba Inu trading at $0.000027 on December 16, 2024, with a market cap of $16.27 billion. After facing a 10% correction over the last week, many have started to speculate on the future outlook for SHIB. Bullish projections claim that a potential 200% increase would result in Shiba Inu getting close to its previous all-time high of $0.000088. One analyst claimed that Shiba Inu’s upcoming features could propel the price of SHIB tokens through the roof. Prominent Analysts Claim Fantom (FTM) Has A $5 Price Tag In Sight Fantom (FTM) is a high-performance and scalable Layer-1 blockchain with speed as its core focus. In recent times, Fantom has flourished in the short-term market, as its coin increased 10% in a week and 8% in a day, trading at $1.39 currently. FTM is keeping up the momentum from its stellar 86% increase earlier this month. Fantom has formed a broadening wedge pattern, which is a very strong uptrend indicator, according to crypto analyst Alex Clay. FTM is in its 3rd bullish leg, suggests Clay, outlining price targets of $5.59, $8.92 and $12.26 as market conditions improve. On similar grounds, analyst Captain Faibik urges the long term holders to wait, while setting FTM price target at $15, firmly backing the views on the token’s future prospects. Is IntelMarkets (INTL) The Next Altcoin Set For 20,428% Gains? An emerging altcoin, IntelMarkets (INTL) , has already caught the attention of many analysts as it demonstrates enormous potential for profits. Priced initially at $0.07, IntelMarkets is offering its INTL tokens as a ground floor opportunity for investors seeking high rewards. As early backers have already seen 800% increase on the initial price, IntelMarkets is hailed as one of the biggest presales of this year. With IntelMarkets closing in on the $5 million presale fundraising milestone , INTL tokens are in significant demand, with the 7th stage selling out in record time. Even before the presale, the project is turning heads, raising over $550,000 from Fortune 500 investors. Backed by a team of Open AI and MIT experts, investors have shown an extreme vote of confidence for INTL. With a 20,428% potential projected post-launch, a $1,000 investment could turn into over $200,000, as analysts are drawing parallels between Fantom’s historic 90x and IntelMarkets. Final Thoughts Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Fantom (FTM) have not only provided big returns in the past, but are also showing bullish patterns for 200% gains. However, those in IntelMarkets (INTL) will enjoy access to an innovative project with a serious upside before it goes mainstream. Backed by a team of Open AI and MIT alumni, the $5 million presale is the next big thing in crypto.

PNUT, the popular memecoin inspired by the squirrel, saw a nearly 10% decrease following the news. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Faces Headwinds: Can Bulls Revive Momentum? Internet Squirrel Becomes Memecoin Sensation On Sunday, Mark Longo, owner of Peanut the Squirrel, announced that his legal team had initiated legal action against crypto exchange Binance. In an X post, Longo, also known as “Peanuts Dad,” accused the exchange of using his intellectual property without authorization. The rescued squirrel became an internet sensation after Longo’s online videos became viral, amassing over half a million followers on Instagram. However, Peanut was seized from Longo’s home alongside a rescued raccoon named Fred. Both animals were euthanized to be tested for rabies, as there are not any approved antemortem rabies testing methods for animals by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Following the news, the public condemned Peanut’s death, with several lawmakers criticizing authorities’ actions. It also sparked a wave of Peanut-inspired memecoins, which resulted in the creation of Solana-based memecoin PNUT. Amid the controversy, the token quickly grew in popularity, hitting a $120 million market capitalization in less than a week. Binance announced the listing of the memecoin on November 11, opening spot trading that same day. After the news, PNUT’s price went on a massive rally, climbing to the top 10 memecoins by market cap. The token achieved the $1 billion milestone in less than a month, reaching a $2.27 billion market cap before retracing. For the past month, PNUT has held above the $1 billion mark, with the price hovering between the $1.80-$1.00 price range. Crypto Exchanges Hit With Cease And Desist Letter According to the letter shared by the animal rights activist, Binance allegedly infringed “the intellectual property rights owned by Mr. Longo.” His legal team argues that the exchange’s use of the copyrighted photograph of Peanut the Squirrel wearing a cowboy hat and the “identical” trademark of “PEANUT THE SQUIRREL and PNUT” in the listed memecoin infringes their client’s “various copyrights and trademarks.” The letter demanded that Binance respond to the letter by December 31st, 2024, to verify the exchange received the letter and “have ceased all infringing activity.” Moreover, Longo revealed in his post that this was the first of multiple cease and desist letters to be issued. PNUT faced a 10.2% dip after the news, falling from the $1.17 level to the $1.05 support in 24 hours. The retrace drove the token near its lowest levels in over a month, worrying investors about the memecoin’s performance. Related Reading: Ex-Hedge Fund Guru Bets Big On Dogecoin As ‘Core Crypto Bet’ It’s worth noting that Longo has previously stated his discontent with the PNUT memecoin, accusing the crypto community of profiting from his late pet. As a protest, the animal rights activist launched a memecoin named Justice for Pnut and Fred (JUSTICE), which faced controversy over insider trading allegations. Longo also promoted another memecoin, Justice for Peanut (JFP), in his warning post, which saw a 159% increase after the publication before losing all its recent gains. At the time of writing, PNUT is trading at $1.10, a 5.1% drop in the daily timeframe.

Recent parliamentary discussions shed light on plans to balance innovation with investor protection while addressing the global and borderless nature of cryptocurrencies. India’s Comprehensive Crypto Framework India aims to establish a robust regulatory structure for VDAs, with a focus on international cooperation. This would help prevent regulatory loopholes and ensure a consistent approach globally. However, officials noted that such a framework requires international cooperation, as VDAs transcend national boundaries. Current Rules and Taxation Updates The government has already implemented key measures to regulate VDAs: Anti-Money Laundering: VDAs have been governed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) since March 2023. Taxation: Income from VDAs is taxable under the Income Tax Act, of 1961. Additional Oversight: Activities involving VDAs are also regulated under the Information Technology Act, of 2000, and the Companies Act, of 2013. Adding clarity to the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) in Jodhpur recently ruled that cryptocurrencies are considered capital assets. This decision means profits from cryptocurrency sales should be taxed as capital gains rather than income from other sources. The ruling is particularly significant for transactions conducted before the government introduced specific regulations for VDAs in 2022. Global Leadership Through the G20 During its G20 presidency in 2023, India played a pivotal role in advancing international crypto regulations. The adoption of the IMF-FSB Synthesis Paper and the G20 Roadmap on Crypto Assets provided a global blueprint for crypto governance. The government plans to release a discussion paper to outline its approach to crypto regulations and seek feedback from stakeholders. While no timeline has been confirmed, this step could help refine the regulatory landscape. Addressing Key Challenges India faces unique challenges in regulating VDAs due to their borderless nature. The government is working to safeguard the economy and financial stability while fostering innovation in blockchain and crypto technology. By combining domestic efforts with global collaboration, India is laying the foundation for a secure and innovative future in digital assets.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-17 07:00:56

On Monday, BTC's price rose above $107,000, surpassing the previous peak on Dec. 5 and taking the cumulative post-U.S.-election gain to over 50%, CoinDesk data show. The rally follows President-elect Donald Trump's assurance that the U.S. will build a bitcoin strategic reserve similar to its strategic oil reserve. Analysts expect the winning streak to continue next year, with prices ranging between $150K to $200K by the end of the following year. However, the current pricing of options trading on Deribit indicates that traders aren't chasing the rally like they used to, signaling a more cautious outlook for the short term. At press time, the 25-delta risk reversal for options expiring on Friday was negative, indicating the relative richness of put options that provide protection against price drops. Puts expiring on Dec. 27 were trading at a slight premium to calls, while the risk reversals extending to the end of March end expiry demonstrated a call bias of less than three volatility points. That starkly contrasts the trend we've observed over the past few weeks, where traders aggressively chased new price peaks, driving short-term and long-term call biases to over four or five volatility points. In fact, short-term risk reversals frequently displayed a stronger call bias than their longer-term counterparts. The latest block trades coming through on Deribit, as tracked by Amberdata , also show a bearish lean. The top trade so far today has been a short position in the Dec. 27 expiry call at the $108,000 strike followed by long positions in the $100,000 strike puts expiring on Dec. 27 and Jan. 3. The cautious sentiment could be due to concerns that on Wednesday the Federal Reserve will signal fewer or slower rate hikes for 2025 while delivering the widely expected 25 basis points rate cut. Such an outcome could accelerate hardening of the bond yields, strengthening the dollar and denting the case for investing in riskier assets.

The breakout above this crucial resistance comes amid strong ETH whale accumulation supported by optimistic on-chain metrics. Market analysts are confident of Ethereum reaching a new all-time high soon. Ethereum Price Surge Amid Strong Whale Accumulation As per the blockchain analytics platform Santiment, the total number of Ethereum whale wallets, holding at least 100K ETH, has reached 104. Their combined holdings now account for 57.35% of the total ETH supply, worth a staggering $333.1 billion. Furthermore, 92% of ETH holders are currently profitable. On the other hand, wallets holding between 100 and 100K ETH have dropped to their lowest share of the supply in history at 33.46%. Similarly, smaller wallets with less than 100 ETH hold 9.19%, a near 4-year low. Santiment noted that the concentration of ETH among major stakeholders is a long-term bullish signal that can drive Ethereum price to all-time highs of around $5,000. Source: Santiment Crypto analyst Venturefounder noted that the recent Ether closure above the $3,800 support on the weekly chart confirms the uptrend. Ethereum’s “cup and handle” pattern is now playing out, signaling bullish momentum. The next key price targets include a retest of the all-time high (ATH) at $4,900, followed by milestones at $5,349, $6,457, and $7,238. Venturefounder predicts that this upward trajectory could materialize by the end of Q1 2025 at the latest. Source: Venturefounder The analyst also noted that despite widespread skepticism, Ethereum may “blast off and never look back,” catching investors off guard. Venturefounder maintains a bullish long-term Ethereum price target of $15,937, projecting this milestone achievement by May 2025. As Glassnode reported, Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin and other altcoins like Solana on a 30-day chart. While the BTC price is up by 17.49%, ETH has gained 26.99% in the same period. Also, it notes that there’s a clear shift in top altcoins from Solana to Ethereum. The SOL price gains during the last 30 days stand at just 1.69%. Source: Glassnode ETH-BTC Showing Strength With the recent Ethereum price outperformance in comparison to Bitcoin, the ETH/BTC is once again showing strength. Analyst Venturefounder notes: “Nothing has changed for ETH/BTC. 2016-2017 bottom reversal pattern is repeating. Bottom is already made. Could be anytime now for the liftoff”. Furthermore, VanEck’s head of digital assets Matthew Sigel noted that similar to 2020, the ETH/BTC pair is all set to go parabolic. Source: Matthew Sigel As of press time, the ETH price traded at $4,005, up 1.34%, with a market cap of $482 billion.

The tokens were moved at an average price of $2.68, signaling significant trading activity. Notably, the entity behind this movement previously served as a market maker for Binance’s $PORTAL mining project.

Interestingly, much of this growth predates the widespread buzz around artificial intelligence and $VIRTUAL’s association with it. A major factor behind this rally is the prolonged accumulation strategy of SDT, an entity that had been quietly amassing $VIRTUAL at price levels around $0.026 months before its breakout. $VIRTUAL pumped 6300% is an example of this feature! Before many people started talking about #AI and $VIRTUAL, SDT had been accumulating them for months at the $0.026+ range. During long-term accumulation, the price might drop by half or even more, but the results can be quite… https://t.co/mFmCgzAEQS pic.twitter.com/PUeRyuXk5f — iCrypto | Sentiment & On-chain Analysis (@iCryptoAI) December 16, 2024 Long-term accumulation strategies, like the one employed by SDT, often see prices drop significantly—sometimes by half or more—before delivering unexpected and substantial returns. $VIRTUAL is a clear example of this, rewarding patient investors as its value skyrocketed over time. With significant deposits by market makers and ongoing holdings in key wallets, $VIRTUAL appears to be gaining traction among institutional players. The token’s dramatic rise and the strategic accumulation leading up to it suggest a calculated move by early adopters, leaving many in the crypto space watching closely for what comes next.

Thanks to the team of quant prodigies behind the Vantard Meme Portfolio (VMP)—effectively the world’s first actively managed memecoin portfolio—some of the market’s most lucrative coins from Zerebro to Popcat were stacked nice and early. The result? Vantard’s basket of memecoins has skyrocketed in value by 65.76%—no wonder degens looking to play this supercycle on easy mode are aping in, with $955k raised already. For now, VTARD tokens are available for just $0.00011, which looks like a bargain given the diversified gems in the VMP, Vantard’s burgeoning meme premium, and the quant team’s industry-leading performance. Let’s dive into one of the year’s best ICOs. Vantard: Surf the supercycle on autopilot The crypto market is heating up, and Vantard takes the pressure off, allowing investors to trust in a team of expert quants with a proven track record to bag gems early while they’re nice and undervalued. This is effectively the S&P 500 of memecoins, so no wonder it’s popping off on the main stage. In case you’ve been living under a rock, it’s worth remembering we’re in the midst of an unprecedented memecoin supercycle. And in the coming months, we will witness some once-in-a-generation price action. Until Vantard, traders could sit on the sidelines with the TradFi tribe and watch as millionaires get minted—or join all the other degens by wading into a stormy and volatile ocean of a market with no life jacket. But now, thanks to Vantard, investors don’t just have a jacket—they’ve got a full-scale raft packed full of the data, flexibility, and unteachable intuition they need to unlock their ultimate earning potential while others sink beneath the selling pressure and get drowned by margin calls. Early to every trend: Why Vantard is dominating its meme rivals Vantard basically has this cycle’s cheat code: know what to buy before anyone else and know what to sell before the market even knows what to buy. Every emerging trend, every fresh-faced meta, is flooding into the Vantard treasury like it’s being managed by a caffeinated Warren Buffet. Take ai16z, for instance—Vantard’s quants loaded up on tokens while sweaty and FUD-afflicted paper hands were busy panic selling. The result? AI16Z skyrocketed to a new ATH and delivered blockbuster gains without VTARD investors even lifting a finger, while bears were left to weep into their bowl of Cap’n Crunch. AI has formed a rock-solid foundation for the VMP, and with notable analysts targeting a $250 billion sector valuation—we’re only at about $40 billion right now —send season is about to get serious as we storm into 2025. Only 8 weeks left to buy the Vantard ICO All good things must come to an end, and unfortunately for degens, the same is true of Vantard’s rip-roaring ICO . Vantard’s presale ends on January 15th, with DEX listings set to follow. January has historically been one of the best months for crypto traders targeting major-league growth, and if the supercycle is a gale-force storm right now, this launch is likely to be smack bang in the middle of a hurricane of FOMO. Once markets catch wind of the value proposition, Vantard’s unrivaled track record will likely see a mad scramble for VTARD.

37747487,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/bitcoin-btc-hits-a-new-all-time-high-at-106k-altcoin-market-prepares-for-surge,1734419661,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/37747487.jpeg,Bitcoin (BTC) Hits a New All-Time High at $106K: Altcoin Market Prepares for Surge,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/bitcoin-btc-hits-a-new-all-time-high-at-106k-altcoin-market-prepares-for-surge,"The altcoin market has exploded after Bitcoin (BTC) broke through its vital $100,000 level and set a new ATH of $107,780. As the world’s leading cryptocurrency continues to trade above this crucial level, altcoins are preparing to set record highs. BTC remains the undisputed leader of the crypto world and maintains its reputation as the most trusted digital asset. As the dominant store of value, BTC is the go-to choice for institutional investors, and spot BTC ETFs witness record inflows. Despite BTC reaching a new ATH of $107,780 yesterday, its dominance is declining, and investors are turning their attention to smaller assets, signalling the start of the altcoin season. Let’s delve into some of the top altcoins to own as Bitcoin makes these historic gains. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) is the largest memecoin by market cap and is the 7th largest crypto with a market cap exceeding $59.13 billion. Elon Musk, the world’s richest man with a net worth exceeding $350 billion, is the CEO of Tesla, owner of social media platform X (formerly Twitter), and one of the president-elect’s most prominent supporters and has long endorsed Dogecoin . Musk recently joined the Trump campaign and was integral to Trump’s victory, and his involvement with the republican party could see DOGE run to new highs in the coming months. DOGE’s surge stepped into overdrive after Donald Trump released a statement revealing that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. According to Trump, DOGE will pave the way for his administration to “dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditure, and restructure Federal Agencies – Essential to the “Save America” Movement.” DOGE is expected to surge after DeFi Technologies introduced Valour Dogecoin (DOGE) ETP on Sweden’s Spotlight Stock Market. The ETP will allow retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to DOGE without directly owning the asset. Ripple (XRP) Ripple’s XRP has gained massively over the past month and is now the fourth-largest crypto with a market capitalization exceeding $143 billion. Ripple (XRP) has witnessed a spectacular gain in value after news of Gary Gensler’s planned exit surfaced. Ripple Labs has been embroiled in a highly publicized legal battle with the securities agency for which Ripple paid a hefty price. In 2020, the regulator sued Ripple for its supposed breach of securities laws, resulting in many exchanges, such as Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, and Gemini, choosing to delist XRP. Ripple finally found some relief after a partial victory in 2023 ended the SEC’s 3-year-long crusade against the company. The Southern District of New York Court delivered a partial victory to Ripple in its matter with the SEC after Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s XRP token is “not necessarily a security on its face.” Ripple received some further bullish news after Chris Giancarlo, former chair of the CFTC, predicted the SEC would drop its case against the company. The price of XRP surged further after WisdomTree filed an S-1 application for a spot XRP ETF. Husky Inu (HINU) As BTC continues to trade around the $106,800 level and top altcoins reach new heights, investors must look for well-priced alternative investment opportunities to profit from the bull run, and Husky Inu is precisely that. Husky Inu (HINU) is one of the newest members of the Solana network, created to bring its holders more value and utility by harnessing the power of this popular blockchain. Husky Inu recently launched the presale of its native token, HINU , with tremendous success, and the two are on a mission to conquer the memecoin industry through a robust and supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Since going live, the presale has generated over $622,000, completing its third presale round. Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting. Husky Inu’s presale success sets the tone for immense gains and is expected to skyrocket following exchange listings. HINU presale tokens are available at a modest $0.00015000 with exceptional profit potential for early backers.

With $BTFD Coin rallying over 5,600 holders , Turbo Coin delivering an impressive 30% price surge, and Fartcoin pushing its market cap to a jaw-dropping $800 million, these projects are undoubtedly the best meme coins to invest in now. The momentum around $BTFD Coin’s presale is especially worth noting. The project has already raised over $4 million, selling more than 55 billion coins. Its meteoric rise began with $1 million raised in just ten days, quickly climbing to $2.5 million in under 14 days. The growth has been phenomenal, pulling in a dedicated community that continues to expand. Turbo’s sudden price spike has caught the eye of savvy traders, while Fartcoin’s impressive valuation proves the enduring appeal of meme coins. Let’s explore what’s driving these projects and why they should be on your radar. BTFD Coin: A Meme Coin with Real Value BTFD Coin has solidified its position as one of the most exciting meme coins in the market. With a name that screams confidence, a high-energy community, and innovative features, it’s clear why investors are charging into this project. One of the key highlights of BTFD Coin is its staking program, which offers an average APY of 90%. Unlike typical meme coins that rely solely on hype, $BTFD rewards its holders by letting them earn passive income simply by holding and staking their tokens. This feature has made it a favourite for both meme coin enthusiasts and more traditional crypto investors looking for reliable returns. The Play-to-Earn (P2E) game is another standout feature. Players can immerse themselves in a Bulls-themed adventure where they earn rewards that can be converted into real $BTFD tokens. This unique blend of gaming and investment opportunities has attracted a wide audience, from casual gamers to serious crypto enthusiasts. The community backing the coin, with over 5,600 active holders, adds even more credibility to its meteoric rise. If you were to invest $3,000 in $BTFD Coin at its current presale price of $0.00013, you’d receive approximately 23,076,923 tokens. Once the coin reaches $0.0006 post-presale, that investment could grow to $13,846. If the price continues to rise to $0.001, the potential value of your holdings could soar to $23,077. BTFD Coin is showing every sign of being a meme coin that delivers significant returns, making it an essential pick for any portfolio. How Do You Buy BTFD Coin? Buying BTFD Coin is simple and investor-friendly. Start by setting up a digital wallet, such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Fund your wallet with ETH, BNB, or USDT, and then head to the presale page to purchase your tokens. After confirming your transaction, your BTFD tokens will be available to claim once the presale ends. This straightforward process ensures anyone can join the bullish movement. Turbo Coin: A Fast-Moving Contender Turbo Coin has proven that speed matters in the meme coin race. This week, Turbo surged by 30%, a move that sent waves through the market. The spike followed a significant partnership with a leading decentralised exchange (Coinbase), which increased Turbo’s daily trading volume by 50%. What’s more, Turbo has been named the second largest AI-powered meme coin by market cap, the first one being GOAT. As for its live price, it’s $0.01092, with analysts predicting it could hit $0.0247 on the higher end in 2025. Turbo’s rapid growth and clear roadmap make it a strong choice for investors looking to capitalise on short- to medium-term gains. Fartcoin: From Laughter to Serious Gains Fartcoin, once a joke, has become a meme coin heavyweight with an $800 million market cap. Crypto experts have gone as far as to claim it’ll hit the $1 billion mark soon. There have been several arguments regarding its sudden surge, with some analysts backing up the theory that it’s all due to the US election results. I mean, if that was after Bitcoin’s recent $100K rise, why shouldn’t it affect the price of other meme coins, right? Currently priced at $0.8616, Fartcoin is projected to gain 175.99% by 2025. With its combination of humour, viral appeal, and solid tokenomics, Fartcoin continues to defy expectations and deliver impressive results for its holders. Why These Coins Are the Best Meme Coins to Invest in Now Meme coins are no longer just about fun and games—they’re serious investment opportunities, and BTFD Coin, Turbo Coin, and Fartcoin exemplify this shift. Each coin offers unique advantages. BTFD Coin’s staking rewards, P2E game, and strong community make it a standout, while Turbo Coin’s fast price growth and Fartcoin’s viral appeal give them their own competitive edge. Whether you’re looking for long-term value or quick profits, these projects have something to offer. Wrap Up: Join the BTFD Coin Presale Before It’s Too Late BTFD Coin’s presale is moving fast, with over $4 million already raised.

The decision is a part of changes in the regulation that FCA is gradually making to create clearer and more coherent rules for firms and consumers thus driving the integrity of markets and protecting investors. A Step Toward Cleaner and Safer Crypto-Markets The discussion paper published on December 16, 2024, is aimed at presenting the proposals concerning the methods for admissions and disclosures together with the market abuse regime innovations in the sphere of crypto-assets. In this respect, the FCA has recently put in place stringent measures to check on and rein in fraudulent behaviours, promote fairness and assist consumers in making appropriate financial decisions. Therefore, the paper’s approach supports enhanced internal control over authorized trading in cryptocurrencies and information sharing to prevent market abuse. “The proposed rules for admissions and disclosures and market abuse regimes are essential in enhancing the cleanliness of the Crypto Markets and contributing to the best efforts of consumers to make sound financial decisions,” The FCA concluded. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Regulations in the United Kingdom 2024 , For the past few years, the crypto sector has raised different dangers that are still valid up to the present time. However, measures to toughen the rules in this area were made again, the FCA stressed that such assets remain extremely dangerous. “The worst is that you won’t be shielded in case of something going wrong or you would be ready to lose all your funds,” the FCA warned. The call for feedback comes as the FCA steps up its attempts to rid the sector of rogue operators. In the first quarter of the year, it shared that out of the applications made by the firms, only 10% were approved because of poor AML standards. Besides, more than 450 signs warning against unauthorized crypto promotions were released. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Breaking News: India’s Parliament Discusses Comprehensive Crypto Framework , Creating a Secure Crypto Future This preemptive action now leans to the UK’s effort in the development of a responsible environment for cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets within the country alongside the protection of investors.

This move represents a significant step in Ripple’s expansion into regulated digital currencies. In anticipation of the launch, Vet (@Vet_X0), a validator on the XRP Ledger, shared information about the stablecoin’s supply. According to Vet, RLUSD’s pre-launch supply is 13.3 million tokens on the XRPL and 52.9 million tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Pre launch supply distribution of RLUSD. 13,300,033 $RLUSD on XRP Ledger. 52,900,129 $RLUSD on Ethereum. — Vet (@Vet_X0) December 17, 2024 RLUSD stands out for its regulatory approval by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), a milestone that shows its bank-grade compliance. This distinction positions RLUSD as a reliable and secure option compared to competitors like USDC and USDT. Key Features of RLUSD The stablecoin is designed to meet rigorous regulatory and technological standards. Although the NYDFS certification does not extend to XRPL or Ethereum networks, both platforms offer the scalability and security required to host such high-grade financial assets. Ripple has emphasized that RLUSD will enable seamless cross-border transactions, potentially reducing costs and settlement times in the financial ecosystem. The launch on the Ethereum network also broadens the appeal of RLUSD. As one prominent crypto figure speculated, the company launched RLUSD on the Ethereum network to allow fast onboarding by exchanges that don’t support XRPL tokens. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Impact on Ripple and XRP RLUSD’s launch is part of Ripple’s ongoing efforts to expand the adoption of blockchain technology. The stablecoin’s integration with XRPL, known for its efficiency and low transaction costs, is expected to bolster XRP’s utility within the ecosystem. The quick onboarding of RLUSD would also introduce more people to the amazing features of Ripple’s stablecoin and network, and increase the adoption of XRP. Ripple’s executives have highlighted RLUSD’s potential to attract institutional and retail participants to the blockchain space. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently stated that USDT, the top stablecoin in the market, won’t have the same market share in two years with RLUSD on the market. RLUSD’s debut is a pivotal moment for Ripple, showcasing the potential of regulated digital currencies to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and traditional finance. However, it is best not to get swept up in the excitement of the stablecoin’s launch as Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz recently explained some price fluctuations that could occur at launch, which could lead to losses for speculative investors.

However, the real game-changer came with the announcement by Upbit, one of South Korea’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, of a $MOCA listing. This news sent $MOCA’s price soaring by approximately 350%, solidifying its position as one of the most talked-about tokens in the market. Whales Play With $MOCA Tokens Amid this frenzy, whale activity has come into focus. Two wallets, likely controlled by the same entity, recently deposited 9.5 million $MOCA tokens (valued at $3.55 million) to Bybit. If these tokens were fully sold at the current market prices, the whale could pocket an impressive profit of $2.55 million.

There were a lot of speculations and fraud attempts ahead of the official statement, but CryptoQuant’s data shows that the actual number of minted new tokens has risen to almost $66 million. Interestingly, the majority of the RLUSD coins are on the Ethereum network – $52.9 million, while only $13.3 million have been minted on Ripple’s own – XRPL. Minted RLUSD Ahead of Launch. Source: CryptoQuant The numbers are quite impressive, given the fact that the stablecoin has not officially seen the light of day yet. This is scheduled to take place later today, as reported yesterday. After receiving the necessary green light from the NYDFS, Ripple’s team announced on December 16 that RLUSD was going live the next day. Moreover, the stablecoin Advisory board has seen a couple of new additions – Raghuram Rajan (former RBI governor) and Kenneth Montgomery (former First VP and COO of Boston’s Federal Reserve). Ripple described RLUSD as the “future of finance.” It’s a stablecoin fully backed by US dollar deposits, government bonds and “other cash equivalents with monthly third-party audits.” It will receive multi-chain support, which is already evident by the minting process on Ethereum and XRPL, with other networks coming later. RLUSD is built for “cross-border payments, DeFi integration, and bridging between fiat and crypto.” Ripple aims to enter a highly competitive and growing stablecoin market. The total value of all such tokens has shot above $200 billion recently and is mostly dominated by Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC.

The disconnect between Aave’s robust revenue growth and $AAVE’s underwhelming price performance has puzzled many in the DeFi community. While the platform’s fundamentals remain strong, the bearish sentiment around $AAVE raises concerns about broader market trends affecting DeFi tokens. The decline comes as a surprise given Aave’s continued success as a top-tier DeFi platform. The $500 million in annual revenue underscores its importance in the space, yet it has not been enough to reverse the token’s downward trajectory. As Aave continues to innovate and lead in DeFi, the challenge remains to translate its platform success into stronger price action for $AAVE. Investors will be watching closely to see if improved market conditions can help the token recover in the coming months. For now, $AAVE’s price dip serves as a reminder of the complexities of the crypto market, where platform growth doesn’t always guarantee token appreciation.

Let’s dive into the tokenomics of some notable AI projects and their upcoming supply expansions. $TAO (Bittensor): High Emission Impact Bittensor leads the pack with a projected 3.02% increase in circulating supply over the next month, adding $129.26 million in value to the market. This significant emission could introduce increased liquidity and selling pressure. Investors should closely monitor trading volumes and price movements to assess market appetite for absorbing the additional supply. $AKT (Akash Network) and $AIOZ (AIOZ Network): Moderate Emissions Both $AKT and $AIOZ are set to expand their circulating supplies by 0.82% ($7.92 million) and 0.59% ($7.37 million), respectively. These moderate emissions reflect a measured approach, balancing token dilution while maintaining a controlled release schedule, minimizing shocks to the market. $FET (FetchAI) and $RENDER (Render Network): Conservative Strategies FetchAI and Render Network exhibit the most conservative supply expansion strategies. $FET will see a modest 0.30% increase, equating to $14.15 million, while $RENDER plans a minimal 0.10% increase, adding $4.60 million. These strategies are designed to protect token value by limiting supply-side inflation, especially during periods of market volatility.

From a user’s standpoint, this means lower gas fees and faster finality, but this comes at the hefty price of centralization—counterintuitive to the ethos of Web3. The L2 and rollup environments are currently vulnerable to single points of failure. If a single sequencer goes offline, the entire chain comes to a halt, as we have already seen with Arbitrum . This means a loss of opportunity for the user and a loss of trust in the project and technology. Additionally, a single centralized sequencer also exposes an L2 to other vulnerabilities like front-running, transaction censorship, and denial of services. So, while centralized sequencers are quick and cost-effective, there’s a higher risk of failure or censorship on top of one entity taking all the network revenue. Hence, the focus is on a decentralized sequencer, which utilizes a network of nodes to sequence the transactions at random. While decentralized sequencers perform with increased latency, they are far more secure and resilient. Also, these systems enable incentives alignment with revenue sharing—innovations that allow the average user to participate and earn rewards. So, in alignment with blockchain ethos, Metis has established itself as the first Layer 2 running a decentralized sequencer (dSeq). After the successful community testing of dSeq on the testnet, the decentralized sequencer went live on the mainnet earlier this quarter. Then, the onboarding of independent dSeq clients began, which enhanced the reliability and security of Metis’ core infrastructure. Meanwhile, the decentralized sequencer nodes get the opportunity to earn rewards in METIS tokens for their role in transaction processing and block production. Moreover, active participation helps increase nodes’ recognition within the community, creating possibilities for future collaborations and partnerships. Several entities, including Artemis , ENKI , Hashkey Cloud , OKX , and more, have already joined the Metis network and are currently contributing to its reliability, decentralization, and stability. The more nodes and entities engaged in sequencing, the more challenging it becomes for malicious actors to control or compromise the L2. At the same time, these nodes earn from transaction fees on top of being rewarded by the Metis network for their contribution. The current expected mining rewards rate for these nodes is 20%, available for a limited time period of the first 12 months, with a total of 34,869 METIS already distributed as rewards (at the time of this writing). This is simply an excellent opportunity for anyone looking to contribute to the growth and success of an innovative project and, in exchange, earn rewards, creating a win-win situation for all. This is just the tip of the iceberg, though, with what a node can achieve by being involved with Metis. A few months ago, the project began distributing grants through a new grants system for developers, innovators, and community members to help expand the network. Now, to further boost participation, Metis has introduced a Decentralized Sequencer Reboot campaign. According to the campaign documents, which takes a two-pronged approach to revitalizing the Metis Decentralized Sequencer and supporting upcoming markets and changes to Metis, decentralized sequencer nodes and liquid staking tokens (LST) can now apply for rewards. These performance-based rewards are multitiered, offering increased benefits. More details about the specific rewards structure is to come in the following days. There are also ongoing business development efforts aimed at attracting liquidity and node operators from reputable projects by offering them incentives and support. Large liquidity providers, after all, are always looking for better and safer places to park their liquidity. Amidst the ongoing bull market, Metis, with its rewards, marketing subsidies, and a focus on creating a mutually beneficial ecosystem, is well-positioned to capture interest and capital. To make sure these efforts are not in vain, Metis has based its reward on performance tiers, with higher tiers being “unlocked” once a certain performance indicator is reached. Metis Decentralized Sequencer nodes can earn up to 5,000 METIS every month on a successful application, while nodes that have LST protocols, which provide DeFi opportunities to users and boost network utilization, stand to earn as much as 10,000 METIS monthly. With enticing incentives, funding support, and additional benefits in the works, Metis aims to offer enhanced growth and stable foundational assistance to participants while attracting liquidity and new users, including institutions, to expand its ecosystem. Overall, these latest moves from Metis showcase the project’s commitment to its users and active contributors, who are the core of its growth and success. Through these rewarding initiatives, Metis aims to bring the most value to its users and turbocharge participation that will catapult Metis to the forefront of technological innovation, ecosystem expansion, and user engagement.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-17 07:35:44

Chill Pepe (CHILPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CHILPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Chill Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Chill Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Chill Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Chill Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Chill Pepe by entering its contract address – AfPftBmzfb2pan4Drt2ZKgT7VK5Rn7CLQHpp8DpLhXZj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CHILPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-17 07:35:58

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $100K by the end of 2024 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2030, BTC might touch $270,593 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin is approaching a significant milestone, with the potential to hold above $100,000. This surge in value is partly attributed to the broader market response to Donald Trump’s election. Since the beginning of the year, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential of hitting the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Token BTC Price $106,881 Market Cap $1,238,914,422,643 Trading Volume $22,318,495,561 Circulating Supply 19,719,062 All-time High $103,900, December 5, 2024 All-time Low $0.04865, Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $103,900 24-hour low $94,660 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $106,881 Price Prediction $ 108,001 (1.67%) Fear & Greed Index 84 (Extreme Greed) Sentiment Bullish Volatility 12.34% Green Days 17/30 (57%) 50-Day SMA $ 87,855 200-Day SMA $ 76,476 14-Day RSI 69.34 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows a bullish pressure toward $107K Resistance for BTC is at $107,002.

The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin makes it a good investment option. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history that is filled with very volatile prices. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is Bitcoin up today?

Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, forming a new ATH. The price is currently aiming to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 Million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Robert Kiyosaki predicts Bitcoin may drop to $60,000 but views this as a buying opportunity, expecting it to eventually stabilize around $250K by 2025. BITCOIN to CRASH Bitcoin is stalled short of $100k. That means BTC may crash to $60k. If and when that happens I will not sell. BTC will be having a sale. I will buy more.

At this stage of the BTC process… price is not… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 1, 2024 Bitcoin price prediction December 2024 November was a bullish month for Bitcoin, characterized by significant upswings. Will BTC price establish a new ATH in December? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to surge toward $100,000 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $105,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $92K. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction December 2024 $92,000 $100,000 $105,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2024 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Bitcoin spot ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2024. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2024 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $110,000 in the highest and the low could be around $88,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 $88,000 $97,000 $105,000 Bitcoin Price Predictions 2025-2030 Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2025 $95,000 $120,000 $160,000 2026 $115,000 $130,000 $185,000 2027 $140,491 $170,100 $216,738 2028 $164,063 $185,068 $244,142 2029 $195,629 $200,312 $255,321 2030 $225,903 $248,568 $270,593 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 The Bitcoin Halving event’s impact is expected to last into 2025, potentially holding the Bitcoin price above the $100,000 mark. If the global economy strengthens and inflation stabilizes at 2%, interest rates could be reduced by 2025. Clearer crypto regulations could boost BTC investor confidence, leading to more buying demand amid scarcity due to halving. Following the halving event over the next 12-18 months, BTC price is expected to surge toward $160,000, with a minimum price of $95,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2026 Bitcoin might witness a slow growth after 2025’s halving surge, resulting in a surge in selling pressure. However, more financial products including a surge in ETF demand might hold BTC price within a bullish region. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2027 Based on detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin Price Forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year.

Bloomberg Intelligence’s Mike McGlone estimates Bitcoin will reach $100,000 by 2030, attributing the increase to rising demand and BTC scarcity. Robert Kiyosaki predicts Bitcoin price to touch $120,000 by the end of 2024. Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2024, Bitcoin might record a maximum price of $105,000, with a minimum price of $88,000 and an average price of $97,000. However, the future market potential for Bitcoin entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation and investor sentiment in long-term holding. We expect Bitcoin price to create a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin Historical Price Sentiment BTC Price History Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000 and remained volatile with October prices fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start.

The SEC has sent a Wells Notice to US-based cryptocurrency investment firm Unicoin. A Wells Notice is a preliminary notice letter that notifies an individual or company that the institution plans to file a lawsuit. According to Fortune, the SEC is accusing Unicoin of fraud, deceptive practices, and selling unregistered securities. However, the details of the breaches were not specified in the Wells Notice. The deadline for Unicoin to respond to the Wells Notice was stated as December 24. Speaking to Fortune, Unicoin CEO Alex Konanykhin revealed that the company has sold around $3.5 billion worth of tokens and attracted around 70,000 investors.

It’s the perfect setup for a festive altcoin pump. But what projects will perform the best? That’s the question we answer in this article. Crypto All-Stars Crypto All-Stars is one of the top presales taking place right now, but it ends in four days. Investors are faced with their last opportunity to buy $STARS at a fixed and discounted rate, and many are scrambling to not miss out. The presale has raised over $18 million so far, showing massive market appeal. Crypto All-Stars is the first unified staking platform for meme coins. It allows users to lock up their Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Mog Coin, Brett, and other tokens and earn $STARS rewards in return. POV: You're on your way to the Crypto All-Stars launch. pic.twitter.com/n5IP4mUbuC — Crypto All-Stars (@all_stars_coin) December 14, 2024 But here’s the kicker: they can earn up to three times more tokens by maximizing the amount of $STARS they hold. Users can also stake $STARS for even more gains. All of this creates a significant demand source for $STARS, which could translate to explosive price growth once it is listed on exchanges. Wall Street Pepe What happens when you mix the ruthless ambition of Jordan Belfort with the iconic laid-back energy of Pepe coin? You get Wall Street Pepe – the most viral ICO on the market. The project launched on 10 December and has already raised $24 million. For perspective, that’s $6 millon more than Ethereum raised in its 2014 ICO. Wall Street Pepe aims at traders sick and tired of watching others get rich while they’re left counting marginal gains. It’s a project for degens who “choose rich.” https://twitter.com/WEPEToken/status/1863905080426058015 And it’s equipping them with the tools for success. Trading signals, meme coin picks, data insights, trading rewards, and staking are all available.

Visit Best Wallet Presale Solaxy Solana is the most active blockchain, with 4.5 million users in the past 24 hours. This activity puts a huge strain on the ecosystem’s infrastructure, which often leads to issues such as congestion, scalability constraints, and failed transactions. This worsens the user experience and caps the growth of Solana’s ecosystem. But Solaxy is a new project with a solution. https://twitter.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1867318005660889427 It follows Ethereum’s scalability blueprint by introducing the first layer 2 blockchain to Solana. Think of the Solaxy blockchain as a highway that gets you where you’re going cheaper and faster than if you were to use a congested street. Solaxy will bundle transactions off the main network, processing them at a lower cost and higher speeds than Solana. However, it will report all transactions to Solana for finality, ensuring it maintains Solana-grade security and decentralization. The project is undergoing a presale and has raised $500K in its first two days. Visit Solaxy Presale Flockerz Flockerz is a bird-themed meme coin with a twist: the community is in complete control.

However, developers are free to build whatever they like on the network. Pepe Unchained is 100x faster and far cheaper than the Ethereum network. It comes with staking, a block explorer, a dedicated Ethereum bridge, and a decentralized exchange. Soon, it’ll also launch Pepe Pump Pad, a no-code meme coin generator.

The need for a cryptocurrency which is simple, and private without the need to fill out forms and open accounts has long been felt. This brings us to GhostSwap. Calling itself the new generation anonymous crypto exchange, GhostSwap is the real “ no KYC crypto exchange ”, allowing crypto traders to reach new heights of ease in freedom. A Crypto Exchange with No KYC and Account Opening Requirements Traditionally, we have seen crypto exchanges require its users to fill out complex forms, perform identity checks and go through elaborate security verification during the on-boarding process. But That’s not the case with GhostSwap. Users don’t need to worry about providing personal information, remembering usernames and passwords. This removes every layer of onboarding friction, ensuring users spend more time on trading and less time talking to the admin. Many users do not prefer providing personal documents to engage in trading a few coins. For them, GhostSwap is ideal as there is no account needed. As a no KYC platform, you can simply arrive and start trading – no locked gates, no waiting periods. How Does GhostSwap Work? GhostSwap has a seamless, three step process to start crypto to crypto exchanges. Selecting Crypto Pairs: Start by selecting a token or coin that you want to send to the “You Send” field. Next, select the asset you are receiving in the “You Get” field. This allows GhostSwap users to exchange anything, such as swapping Bitcoin for Ethereum, or converting stablecoins like USDT to an altcoin. Entering Your Recipient Address: To receive the swapped crypto, provide your wallet address. This should be your designated target address, or in other words, your personal private storage for your funds. Everything is sent directly to your wallet since GhostSwap doesn’t hold any crypto. Sending Your Funds and Receiving Instantly: Once your details are confirmed, send the crypto you’ve exchanged to the address provided by GhostSwap. The platform automatically processes the swap as soon as the transaction hits the network, sending it straight to your chosen destination. It is an instant crypto-to-crypto exchange that is complete in mere moments. GhostSwap focuses on privacy through the entire process. It never asks for your personal identity or demands extra steps. You’re just another crypto address interacting with them, which is a reflection of the new era of anonymous crypto exchange. Privacy and Security is at the Focus Many people are skeptical about whether speed and simplicity can co-exist with strong security. But GhostSwap is set to prove them wrong. Its infrastructure is based around the core principles of robust network protocols, decentralization and encryption, helping keep funds secure. Since no personal data is ever stored on the platform, the risk of identity theft or large-scale data breaches is almost nil. All GhostSwap’s measures are evidence that a privacy crypto exchange can exist, which meets world-class security standards. Every transaction is as transparent and private as possible, underpinned by cryptographic blockchain principles. The Role GhostSwap Plays in Today’s Crypto Climate Right now, the cryptocurrency market is at a crossroads. Large exchanges are starting to impose strict rules that are starting to turn this liberated crypto market into a territory bound by KYC mandates. Decentralized and privacy-focused solutions such as GhostSwap are steadfast in their mission to not sacrifice freedom just for the sake of complying with rules. Ideal for Casual as well as High Frequency Traders GhostSwap’s instant conversions and the absence of KYC mandates ensure that high frequency traders do not miss any opportunities. Casual investors will find the platform’s simple, no-account approach which lets them trade without any strings attached.

The digital asset’s value relative to gold has grown significantly, breaking through the highest value ever as institutions show increasing interest in BTC ETFs. Although gold is widely considered a strategic reserve asset, Bitcoin is rapidly gaining momentum. Bitcoin’s value relative to gold has soared to its highest value, signifying a potential shift in strategic reserve preference. Bitcoin-to-gold ratio surges to a historic 37.3 Just in: Bitcoin-Gold Ratio Hits New All-Time High! On Dec. 16, 1 $BTC equaled 40 ounces of gold as Bitcoin soared past $106K, with gold trading at ~$2,650. A milestone showcasing Bitcoin’s growing dominance as a store of value. 🚀 #Bitcoin #Gold #Crypto pic.twitter.com/5kV2495JJh — Andres Meneses (@andreswifitv) December 16, 2024 The BTC-to-gold ratio, which measures how many ounces of gold one Bitcoin can buy, broke through the highest levels. The ratio is calculated by dividing Bitcoin’s price by gold’s spot price per ounce. The value is then used to compare the relative strength between Bitcoin and gold. On Monday, the ratio sat at a record-breaking 37.3 as Bitcoin broke through the $106k. The ratio signifies that one Bitcoin can purchase about 37 ounces of gold. The current Bitcoin-to-gold ratio has surpassed that witnessed in the previous bull cycle, which peaked at 36.7 in November 2021. Sidney Powell, CEO and co-founder of institutional capital marketplace Maple Finance, said Bitcoin’s rally shows the cryptocurrency’s adoption and maturity as an asset class. The executive told Decrypt that he expects the ratio to “catch up” as spot BTC ETF inflows continue to propel Bitcoin’s price. Powell also noted that Bitcoin is increasingly being considered a staple part of balanced portfolios. Singapore-based digital asset trading firm QCP Capital wrote on Monday that the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio aligns with Bitcoin being considered digital gold. The asset trading firm also noted that Bitcoin has retained its position as the best preference for storage of value over traditional gold. “The BTC/Gold ratio reached an all-time high during the move, amplifying Bitcoin’s status as “digital gold” and cementing its position as an increasingly favored store of value over traditional gold.” ~ QCP Capital The note also highlighted that MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 reinforced the prevailing market sentiment. Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s chair, hinted that the company would purchase more Bitcoin despite the asset pricing above $100k. MicroStrategy adopted Bitcoin as a strategic reserve in 2020 and has become the largest corporate Bitcoin holder. According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries, MicroStrategy has doubled down on the asset since then and now holds $46.87 billion in Bitcoin. Governments hint at adopting BTC as a reserve asset Michael Saylor’s company has inspired other companies to adopt BTC as a strategic reserve. Nasdaq-listed Solidion recently pledged to allocate 60% of its cash reserves to purchase Bitcoin. Metaplanet also mirrored Michael Saylor’s approach and adopted the asset as a strategic reserve. As more corporations join the bandwagon, governments worldwide consider Bitcoin a strategic national reserve asset . President-elect Donald Trump promised to establish a national Bitcoin reserve asset, which has sparked discussions in other countries such as Russia, Brazil, Poland, and Japan. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Michael Saylor advised the incoming administration to sell the country’s gold reserves and adopt Bitcoin instead. Saylor also discouraged the U.S. government from buying more gold for its national reserve.

CRV Price Rally to $2 Soon Amid Key Developments After a staggering 200% gain over the last month, the CRV price has been consolidating at $1.1 levels over the past week. However, the recent purchases by Curve Finance founder could provide an additional boost to the altcoin leading to the next leg of the mega rally. Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov has made a significant CRV buyback, purchasing 1.08 million CRV tokens worth approximately $1.2 million at an average price of $1.114, according to blockchain tracker Spot On Chain . This marks Egorov’s first major CRV purchase since the liquidation event on June 13, signaling renewed confidence in the token. The buyback comes as just as CRV price faced some pullback to $1.0 in the past 24 hours, reflecting market volatility.

Crypto market analysts are confident that as Bitcoin price hits new all-time highs , capital will rotate back into altcoins like CRV setting the stage for a strong surge.

Binance will suspend LUNC token deposits and withdrawals on the network to support its major network upgrade, ensuring the best user experience. “The trading of token(s) on the aforementioned network will not be impacted. Binance will handle all technical requirements involved for all users.” Other top crypto exchanges such as Bybit and OKX have also announced support for the Terra Classic chain’s major upgrade. Terra Luna Classic v3.3.0 Upgrade Details As CoinGape reported earlier, the v3.3.0 Terrad upgrade simplifies tax handling by automatically deducting tax from the amount sent before it reaches the recipient’s wallet. It also boosts security and utility, making it easier for developers and dapps to build on the Terra Luna Classic network. Utility, LUNC burn and USTC repeg are the community’s major focus for LUNC revival. The community has burned 393.87 billion LUNC, with 68.39 billion incinerated by Binance. The community has expressed thanks to the exchange for supporting the upgrade. BREAKING: @binance announces support for the $LUNC v.3.3.0 upgrade.

Bitcoin and a range of altcoins are strongly trending upward. Bitcoin has just created yet another all-time high (ATH), so the stage may be set for an even bigger wealth rotation into altcoins in the coming weeks. With that in mind, here are five of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now. Wall Street Pepe Wall Street Pepe is currently the hottest new emergent on the crypto market. The project is undergoing a presale and has raised over $24 million in just one week. It’s a meme coin that blends the laid-back demeanor of Pepe coin with the high-octane energy of Jordan Belfort, aiming to rally an army of hungry crypto traders. But it doesn’t stop there. Wall Street Pepe will equip its community with all the tools needed to succeed in crypto. Memes don’t sleep. Neither do I. pic.twitter.com/t19mAlxafI — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) December 14, 2024 Look on the Wall Street Pepe whitepaper; you’ll see plans for trading signals, alpha calls, meme coin picks, trading rewards, and staking – everything needed to get the most out of a crypto bull market. Users can access all this by purchasing the $WEPE presale, which is why it’s performing so well. Virtuals Protocol Virtuals Protocol is the best-performing crypto inside the top 100 by market cap today. Just like Wall Street Pepe is showing incredible momentum at presale, Virtuals Protocol is also proving a favorite. Momentum is crucial in crypto since it’s ultimately what moves prices. Virtuals Protocol is an AI project on the Base chain that allows users to create and own AI agents. Co-ownership of AI Agents is now live on @base , powered by #VIRTUAL Buy, trade and create AI Agents now at https://t.co/eNr7UssUfw Here’s how to get started: pic.twitter.com/VO2lfN1MKm — Virtuals Protocol (@virtuals_io) October 16, 2024 It’s trailblazing with a feature called Generative Autonomous Multimodal Entities (G.A.M.E), which allows AI developers to access and experiment with its AI agents via API and SDKs. Currently, Virtuals Protocol is trading at $2.83, up 19.4% in the past 24 hours and 395% in the past week. It holds a $2.83 billion market cap and a $234 million 24-hour trading volume. Crypto All-Stars Crypto All-Stars is a new staking platform for meme coins that lets users generate passive rewards on their Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Brett, Bonk, Mog Coin, and more. Users will earn $STARS rewards but can earn up to three times more by maximizing their $STARS holdings. Meme coins and AI have been the two most dominant narratives through 2024. Right now, AI tokens are surging, and projects like Crypto All-Stars and Wall Street Pepe continue to storm ahead. The All-Stars ride to their launch in style Want to ride along? Get your $STARS before it's too late: https://t.co/8IZTKBdAp2 pic.twitter.com/9iOZEbkRIx — Crypto All-Stars (@all_stars_coin) December 15, 2024 Crypto All-Stars is undergoing a presale and has raised $18 million, showing huge market demand. The presale will end in four days, and then $STARS will be listed on exchanges. With an innovative use case and strong presale momentum, the token price will likely soar once it hits the open market. As such, investors should not wait around to buy the Crypto All-Stars presale. Stacks Bitcoin has hit a new all-time high (ATH) today, and its leading layer 2 cryptocurrency, Stacks, is also racing ahead. Stacks is building a layer 2 blockchain that will help with Bitcoin’s congestion and scalability issues, opening it up to a wide range of new applications. And it doesn’t end there. Stacks even introduces smart contract functionality to its layer 2, which means developers can create versatile apps while benefitting from the security, decentralization, and permanency of the Bitcoin blockchain. Stacks' sBTC will pave the way for the Bitcoin economy sBTC is being embraced by the crypto world, with many leading entities and institutions adopting Stacks' novel way to move BTC to the $STX L2. Let's highlight a few of them in this thread, starting with Solana 1/6 pic.twitter.com/SDfQLUQP9p — stacks.btc (@Stacks) December 4, 2024 As is often the case when Bitcoin rallies, Stacks has outperformed. It’s up 14% in the past 24 hours with a $3.7 billion market cap and a $455 million 24-hour trading volume. If Bitcoin continues to surge, this provides a favorable juncture for Stacks to keep gaining. Solaxy On layer 2 blockchains, Solaxy is bringing the technology to Solana for the first time. While Solana is highly scalable with 6,500 transactions per second (TPS) capabilities, it’s industry-leading ecosystem activity means it remains under intense strain and often subdues to congestion, scalability issues, and failed transactions. Solaxy is fixing this by creating a layer 2 blockchain that bundles transactions off-chain and reports back to Solana for finality. This bolsters scalability while maintaining Solana-grade decentralization and security. https://twitter.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1867318005660889427 And here’s the interesting part: it’s currently just three days into its presale. Unlike Stacks, which is already worth $3.7 billion, investors can buy $SOLX at a $500K valuation today. However, the presale is soaring ahead so prospective buyers should move quickly. The Solaxy presale price is incrementally increasing with next increase in one day or when the total raise hits $673K. ​​",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-17 07:54:32

As it stands, Revolut says, there is limited visibility into card transactions and bank transfers its crypto customers make with exchanges, potentially exposing them to higher levels of fraud due to card mechanisms having limited anti-scam protections. A 12-month pilot of firms using Revolut Pay’s enhanced due diligence, direct API integration and end-to-end control over the payment process showed crypto customers were exposed to about 50% fewer attempts to defraud them, Revolut said in a statement. These enhancements include know-your-customer (KYC) name matching, fraud warning screens, proof of crypto delivery and the ability for crypto merchants to receive transaction risk scores. Crypto has more than its fair share of fraudulent activity and scams, whether that involves identity theft, phishing scams and even the involvement of AI deep fakes and so on. “In the crypto space, there's a little bit of an issue with fraud outcomes,” said Alex Codina, general manager for merchant payments at Revolut in an interview. “Now, crypto firms, either exchanges or on-rampers, can integrate Revolut Pay as a payment method and by doing that we allow our users to directly buy crypto on those checkouts in a safer manner.” Match your customer Under the hood, the integration with third-party exchanges or on-ramps starts with KYC matching, so validating that the person who is buying on Revolut side is the same person who is KYC’d on the exchange’s side. “If those names don’t match the transaction is rejected. In the card world, this would be the equivalent of a stolen card or something like that,” Codina said. Beyond that, firms are in a running battle to combat a sophisticated array of investment scams, whereby customers are duped into thinking they need to perform some transaction or other to qualify for a fictitious reward of some kind, he added. “These are the hardest ones to deal with,” Codina said. “Basically what we do is assess the risk score of the transaction based on information on our users, like if they have traded crypto in the past or not with Revolut, with a third party, and assess the probability of that transaction being part of an investment scam.” Obviously, a balance has to be struck when it comes to user experience and safety, Codina said. The safety measures put in place by Revolut could be a question or two about the transaction, or in some cases the customer could be referred to a customer services manager to briefly chat about the transaction. “We have a pretty robust model and framework where we can add some friction, depending on how risky we think the transaction is,” he said.",Finance|Revolut|Fraud|Exclusive|banking|Fintech,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|MINING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-17 08:00:00

In her tweet, Jones stated , “While we wait for RLUSD to go live, don’t forget this one. XRP,” referencing an earlier comment from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Attached to her tweet was an image from Coinspeaker, a crypto blog, quoting Buterin’s assertion that XRP is “better sound money than Bitcoin.” While we wait for RL USD to go live, don’t forget this one. #XRP pic.twitter.com/amLU2eqbkN — Linda P. Jones (@LindaPJones) December 15, 2024 Vitalik Buterin’s Comparison of XRP to Bitcoin The Vitalik Buterin comparison points to XRP’s technical advantages over Bitcoin. While Bitcoin has long been recognized as a store of value, it struggles with slow transaction times, limited scalability, and significant energy consumption. In contrast, XRP is designed for real-world use cases, specifically targeting the inefficiencies of cross-border payments. Buterin’s assertion that XRP is “better sound money” stems from its ability to process transactions in under five seconds with minimal fees, making it an ideal option for financial institutions seeking swift and low-cost solutions. Bitcoin, though dominant, remains challenged by network congestion and transaction costs, especially during periods of high demand. XRP’s infrastructure avoids these issues, offering a reliable alternative for high-volume, high-speed financial transfers. Jones’ tweet reminds investors and analysts, that these advantages position XRP as a practical and functional digital asset.

The stable digital asset is expected to integrate seamlessly with Ripple’s existing payment networks. XRP serves as the foundation for Ripple’s cross-border payment ecosystem, where it is used to bridge currencies and enable near-instant settlements. Ripple’s growing partnerships with financial institutions globally highlight the asset’s ability to address real-world financial challenges. Despite ongoing regulatory scrutiny, including Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), XRP has maintained its position as a critical player in global finance. Jones’ acknowledgment reinforces its relevance in a competitive digital asset market. Her tweet serves as both a reminder and a forward-looking signal to investors who see value in XRP’s ability to deliver efficient, scalable financial solutions.

This might mean that your positions, depending on your risk appetite, will result in a potential return of 3-5x in BTC valuations. Why is that a case? Well, most of the altcoins have literally not been breaking out yet, as they are still in the accumulation zone in their Bitcoin pair.

The global issue is getting more complex as Bitcoin surges to a new ATH of $107K today and demand is going to rise in the future. Moreover, coming back to the issue Bitcoin mining difficulty has been driven by multiple factors, including an increase in network hash rate and big bulls adding Bitcoin as a strategic reserve and raising the Bitcoin demand. British Columbia continues to enforce Bitcoin mining ban While Vancouver’s City Council is exploring becoming a ""bitcoin-friendly city,"" British Columbia continues to enforce a province-wide ban on new Bitcoin mining connections to preserve power for clean energy initiatives,… — CoinNess Global (@CoinnessGL) December 17, 2024 British Columbia’s Ongoing Mining Ban British Columbia (B.C.) is sticking to its ban on new Bitcoin mining until December 2025, even though Vancouver’s City Council passed a motion to become a “Bitcoin-friendly city.” The ban started in December 2022 to save energy for clean projects. Conifex Timber, a company planning to mine Bitcoin, challenged the ban in court, but the B.C. Supreme Court backed the decision in early 2024. The province’s largest electricity utility, BC Hydro, generates over 90% of its power from hydroelectric sources. Vancouver’s motion, introduced by Mayor Ken Sim, highlights Bitcoin’s financial benefits but has no impact on mining regulation, as electricity falls under provincial jurisdiction. The province has been working on a permanent crypto-mining policy. Earlier this year, B.C. passed an updated version of the Energy Statutes Amendment Act, which gives the provincial government direct authority to regulate electricity for crypto mining, bypassing the BC Utilities Commission. This move came after BC Hydro temporarily suspended Bitcoin mining connections to the provincial grid. Regulations on Check The legal challenge from Conifex Timber argued that the ban was discriminatory, but the provincial judge disagreed. This case raises questions about whether other industries, like AI or Liquified Natural Gas, might face similar energy regulations due to their high energy use and limited economic benefits, as suggested by the Green Party during the legislative debate. B.C.’s stance on Bitcoin mining mirrors other regions. For example, New York State has a mining moratorium with exceptions for renewable energy, while some states, like Arkansas and Montana, have passed bills protecting Bitcoin miners from discrimination. Pennsylvania recently lifted its mining ban to focus on energy conservation bills. On the flip side Bitcoin (BTC) mining profitability improved in December, with the hashprice, a measure of daily earnings, increasing by 5% compared to the end of November, according to JPMorgan’s recent report. Bitcoin network hashrate rose 6% in December, averaging 773 exahashes per second (EH/s). Miners earned about $57,300 in daily block reward revenue per EH/s in the first two weeks, the highest in seven months but still 40% below pre-halving levels. The combined hashrate of 14 U.S.-listed miners tracked by JPMorgan surged 94% year-to-date to 222 EH/s, making up 29% of the global network. However, their market cap fell 4%, or $1.5 billion, despite a 50% increase after the U.S. election. These miners are trading at about twice their share of the block reward opportunity.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-17 08:05:02

Even protocols with the best technology stand no chance if they don’t have a solid community built around them. This is one of the most important aspects of Web3: the power is truly held by the users, and without their presence, the technology is superfluous. The R0AR team understands this and aims to build around the community. The first step in this community-oriented approach can be found in the R0AR token presale, which acts as a gateway to the Executive R0AR Society NFT collection. By participating in the presale, individuals acquire R0AR tokens at a discounted price and gain the opportunity to secure a spot on the whitelist for the upcoming NFT mint. This allows them to become part of an exclusive community and enjoy a range of benefits within the R0AR ecosystem. This article will explore how R0AR is building a thriving DeFi community through its presale and NFT collection. We will discuss the importance of community engagement and the benefits of the R0AR NFTs. The Power of Community in DeFi An active and engaged community can make the difference between a crypto success story and a failure. It’s a critical pillar of any long-term plan, and just a quick look at some of the most successful crypto projects will reveal extremely active Telegram, X, and Discord communities. A strong community provides numerous benefits for a DeFi project. It can help to spread awareness, generate excitement, and attract new users. It can also serve as a valuable source of feedback, helping the team to identify areas for improvement and ensure that the platform is meeting the needs of its users. Community can also play a crucial role in the development and evolution of a DeFi platform. By providing feedback, suggesting new features, and contributing to the project’s codebase, they can help to shape its future direction and ensure its long-term success. In essence, a thriving community is the lifeblood of any successful DeFi project. It provides the foundation for growth, innovation, and sustainability, ensuring that the project remains relevant and responsive to the needs of its users. The R0AR Presale: Building a Foundation for Community Growth The R0AR presale has entered its sixth stage, with each token priced at $0.01. The next and final stage will see the price of the tokens rise to $0.025 before their listing on DEXs and CEXs. The presale has been instrumental in building a strong foundation for the R0AR community, attracting a diverse group of individuals who believe in the project’s vision. With over $3.6 million raised so far, the presale has demonstrated strong community support for R0AR and its commitment to building a comprehensive and user-friendly DeFi ecosystem. The R0AR token itself plays a crucial role in this ecosystem, serving as the key to accessing various features and benefits, including potential airdrops, staking rewards, and discounts on the xCHANGE. Beyond its financial implications, the presale also serves as a gateway to the upcoming NFT collection. By participating in the presale, individuals can secure a spot on the whitelist for the Executive R0AR Society NFT mint. This whitelist guarantees access to the NFT collection, ensuring that early supporters and community members have a fair chance to acquire these exclusive digital assets. The R0AR presale is nearing its final stage. The Executive R0AR Society: An Exclusive Community with Tangible Benefits The Executive R0AR Society (ERS) is the virtual gathering hub for early members of the R0AR community who got their wallet addresses onto the NFT whitelist during the R0AR token presale. It’s a limited-edition collection of 10,000 unique NFTs, each representing membership in this exclusive club within the R0AR ecosystem. The ERS NFTs are not just digital collectables; they are keys that unlock a range of benefits and opportunities within the R0ARverse. These benefits include access to a private community, participation in platform governance, and potential future airdrops and rewards. The NFTs themselves are of extremely high quality, featuring unique artwork and designs that reflect the R0AR brand and its values. They are more than just static images; they are dynamic assets that represent a commitment to the R0AR project and its vision for a decentralized future of finance. By holding an ERS NFT, users gain access to a variety of exclusive benefits. This includes entry into the “Penthouse Suite,” a private community space where members can connect, collaborate, and stay informed about the latest developments within the R0AR ecosystem. Furthermore, ERS members will be eligible for future R0AR token airdrops, giving them a stake in the project’s growth and success. They will also gain access to exclusive rewards and staking opportunities within the R0AR ecosystem, enabling them to earn additional benefits and maximize their returns.

Notably, this rally comes amid soaring institutional interest and whale accumulation, which suggests that the demand for BTC remains strong despite the recent rally. On the other hand, veteran trader and market expert Peter Brandt has shared a bold forecast for BTC amid this, sparking further discussions in the market. Bitcoin Price To Hit $125K, Peter Brandt Says Bitcoin price has recorded a robust rally recently, which has caught the eyes of investors. Notably, this is because the institutional interest remained strong and continued to grow after Donald Trump’s election win. Notably, Trump has pledged to make the US a crypto capital while voicing strong support for BTC during his campaigns. In addition, he has recently said “We’re gonna do something great with crypto,” indicating its competitive focus in the digital assets space. Besides, he also reiterated his focus on making BTC the US strategic reserve. On the other hand, the institutional interest is also evidenced by the robust US Spot Bitcoin ETF inflow recently. Notably, the overall influx into the investment instrument has continued over the last few weeks, with BlackRock’s IBIT providing the biggest boost. According to Farside Investors data , the overall influx into the US Spot BTC ETF was $636.9 million on December 16. Meanwhile, this robust inflow suggests that the Wall Street players as well as the investors remained confident in the asset. Besides, the BTC price performance and the recent on-chain data also indicate a strong BTC demand, which could further fuel the rally in the coming days. Amid this, veteran trader Peter Brandt has shared a bullish BTC forecast. Sharing a price chart for BTC in a recent X post, he has set $125K as the next target for BTC. Besides, he also said that “everything else is a pretender”, reflecting the expert’s strong confidence towards the flagship crypto. Source: Peter Brandt, X What’s Next For BTC? With Peter Brandt’s bold forecast and Donald Trump’s recent hint towards making BTC the US strategic reserve, BTC has recorded a robust rally. The latest BTC price showed a spike of 2% from yesterday to $106,729, with its trading volume soaring 25% to $79 billion. Notably, the crypto has recently touched an ATH of $107,780 in the last 24 hours, while providing a monthly gain of nearly 18%. Furthermore, CoinGlass data showed that BTC Futures Open Interest rose 2%, suggesting a continuing strong momentum ahead. Besides, a Bitcoin price prediction indicates a potential rally for the flagship crypto to $115,208 this month, boosting market sentiments. Meanwhile, prominent crypto market analyst Ali Martinez has recently highlighted the BTC whale trend. In a recent X post, he said that the “number of Bitcoin (BTC) whales on the network went parabolic ever since Donald Trump won the US presidential elections!” This showcases the growing whale confidence in the asset, which could trigger further rallies for the asset ahead. Source: Ali Martinez, X In addition, top on-chain analytics firm CrytoQuant has also highlighted a bullish trend recently. In a recent X post, CryptoQuant said that as Bitcoin price touched its ATH recently, the demand is continuing to outpace supply. The firm’s head of Research Julio Moreno said that BTC OTC Desks are witnessing their highest monthly balance decline so far in 2024 amid soaring BTC demand. Since November 20, the balance has slumped by 40K BTC, indicating a bullish trend ahead.

This acquisition brings Riot’s total Bitcoin reserves to 17,429 BTC , valued at nearly $2 billion at current market prices. The announcement caused Riot’s stock to jump by 8%, showing strong investor confidence in its strategy. Riot, which began focusing on Bitcoin mining in 2018, operates from its Oklahoma facility and has since adopted a strategy similar to MicroStrategy's, led by Michael Saylor. This includes raising funds through share buybacks to expand its Bitcoin reserves. Riot’s Q4 Bitcoin yield stands at 36.7%, with a year-to-date yield of 37.2%, underlining steady growth despite share dilution. Other major Bitcoin investors are also making significant moves. Marathon Digital (MARA) recently purchased 11,774 BTC worth $1.1 billion, funded through a zero-coupon convertible note. Similarly, MicroStrategy announced its latest Bitcoin purchase, acquiring 15,350 BTC for $1.5 billion at an average price of $100,386. MicroStrategy’s total holdings now exceed $27.1 billion, with a Q4 Bitcoin yield of 46.4% and a year-to-date yield of 72.4%. MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) has surged nearly 500% this year, closely tracking Bitcoin’s performance. This massive growth has placed the company among the top 100 publicly traded firms in the United States. Michael Saylor remains vocal about Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation and a valuable corporate asset. Recently, he posted on X (formerly Twitter): “Everyone buys Bitcoin at the price they deserve. BTC doesn’t wait. It simply transfers wealth to those who see.” While Saylor continues to encourage businesses to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets, not all companies are on board. Microsoft’s shareholders recently rejected a proposal to include Bitcoin in its treasury reserves. In contrast, Amazon’s shareholders have taken a different stance, suggesting that part of the company’s $88 billion cash reserves could be allocated to Bitcoin as protection against inflation. The growing interest in Bitcoin among companies like Riot Platforms, Marathon, and MicroStrategy highlights increasing institutional adoption. These firms are capitalizing on Bitcoin's potential as a long-term investment, despite ongoing debates about the risks of using equity and debt to fund large purchases. Riot’s recent acquisition reinforces its commitment to strengthening its Bitcoin reserves while benefiting from market optimism. This surge in corporate Bitcoin purchases signals a broader trend of traditional businesses shifting toward cryptocurrency as a store of value.",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-17 08:51:36

The government’s response followed queries posed by two Members of Parliament on what steps were being taken to set up a structured regulatory framework along with an expected timeline for such regulations. Although the administration noted that it consulted with industry stakeholders and relevant international organizations both formally and informally, it asserted that policy efforts on VDA are needed globally in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage to ANI . India seeks to have effective regulation of borderless crypto assets emerge only through deep international cooperation. https://twitter.com/CryptooIndia/status/1868618473011880344 As taxation on VDA-related income already exists and with VDA transactions brought under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act since March 2023, the government said crypto assets are borderless and thus require international cooperation to prevent regulatory arbitrage. The adoption of the “ G20 Roadmap on Crypto Assets ” during India’s G20 Presidency brought forth the pressing need for collaborative action at the global level while urging all jurisdictions, especially emerging economies, to develop risk-sensitive regulation.

Họ xem Bitcoin như “lá chắn” chống lạm phát và két sắt lưu trữ giá trị. Xu hướng này, khởi xướng bởi MicroStrategy, đang lan tỏa mạnh mẽ với những cái tên đình đám như Tesla, Tether Holdings, Jetking Infotrain (Ấn Độ) và Metaplanet (Nhật Bản). Bitcoin hấp dẫn bởi khả năng chống lạm phát và tiềm năng sinh lời khủng. Tuy nhiên, biến động giá, rủi ro pháp lý và lo ngại về môi trường đòi hỏi doanh nghiệp phải quản trị rủi ro thận trọng. Dù vậy, Bitcoin vẫn đang lột xác ngoạn mục từ tài sản đầu cơ thành công cụ quản lý tài chính chính thống, hứa hẹn sẽ định hình lại bức tranh tài chính toàn cầu. Cơn sốt Bitcoin lan rộng đến các ông lớn toàn cầu Các công ty trên toàn cầu đang có xu hướng xem xét việc đầu tư vào Bitcoin như một phần trong chiến lược quản lý tài sản của mình, giống như công ty tiên phong MicroStrategy đã làm. Xu hướng này cho thấy Bitcoin đang ngày càng được công nhận là một công cụ chống lạm phát và là nơi lưu trữ giá trị an toàn trong bối cảnh kinh tế bất ổn hoặc những sự kiện “thiên nga đen” khó lường. Cổ đông của các tập đoàn đa quốc gia như Microsoft và Amazon đã đề xuất đưa Bitcoin vào danh mục đầu tư của công ty. Mặc dù cổ đông Microsoft gần đây đã bỏ phiếu chống lại đề xuất này do lo ngại về sự biến động của Bitcoin, nhưng việc ngày càng có nhiều người ủng hộ cho thấy vai trò của Bitcoin trong chiến lược tài chính của doanh nghiệp đang được thảo luận rộng rãi. Nói một cách đơn giản, các công ty lớn đang bắt đầu xem Bitcoin như một cách để bảo vệ tiền của họ khỏi mất giá và những biến động kinh tế khó lường. Không chỉ phương Tây, các công ty ở châu Á cũng đang tích cực “gom” Bitcoin. Jetking Infotrain của Ấn Độ đã trở thành công ty niêm yết đầu tiên tại đây chỉ định Bitcoin là tài sản dự trữ chính. Tại Nhật Bản, Metaplanet (MicroStrategy của châu Á) gần đây đã tăng lượng Bitcoin nắm giữ lên 639.5 BTC (trị giá 40.5 triệu đô la), thể hiện chiến lược mạnh mẽ trong việc áp dụng Bitcoin. Việc ngày càng nhiều công ty tích hợp Bitcoin vào bảng cân đối kế toán đã làm dấy lên cuộc tranh luận về hiệu quả của nó. Các cổ đông và giám đốc điều hành đang cân nhắc giữa lợi ích của việc đa dạng hóa danh mục đầu tư và rủi ro từ biến động giá. Thí nghiệm Bitcoin này cho thấy vai trò đang phát triển của tài sản kỹ thuật số trong tài chính hiện đại và mở ra những cuộc thảo luận về cách chúng định hình lại chiến lược kho bạc doanh nghiệp. Những “gã khổng lồ” nào dẫn đầu xu hướng? Theo BitcoinTreasuries.net , nhiều công ty lớn nhỏ trên thế giới đang tích cực đưa Bitcoin vào danh mục tài sản dự trữ. Dẫn đầu xu hướng này là MicroStrategy với 423,650 BTC (trị giá 42.7 tỷ đô la), tiếp theo là Tesla với 9,720 BTC (trị giá 979 triệu đô la). Trong số các công ty tư nhân, Block.one sở hữu 164,000 BTC (16.5 tỷ đô la) và Tether Holdings nắm giữ 82,454 BTC (8.3 tỷ đô la). Các công ty này coi Bitcoin không chỉ là kho lưu trữ giá trị mà còn là tài sản chiến lược. Tether thậm chí còn đầu tư vào các dự án liên quan đến Bitcoin như khai thác mỏ, thể hiện niềm tin vào giá trị lâu dài của đồng tiền này. Marathon Digital Holdings và Riot Platforms cũng là những cái tên đáng chú ý với lượng Bitcoin nắm giữ lần lượt là 40,435 BTC và 11,425 BTC. Xu hướng này cho thấy Bitcoin đang dần được tích hợp vào hoạt động tài chính của doanh nghiệp. Lợi ích và rủi ro khi đầu tư vào Bitcoin của các công ty Vậy tại sao các công ty lại mê mẩn Bitcoin đến vậy? Chống lạm phát: Với nguồn cung giới hạn 21 triệu đồng, Bitcoin được xem như vàng kỹ thuật số , giúp bảo vệ giá trị tài sản trước những biến động của thị trường. Tăng trưởng vốn: Lịch sử đã chứng minh Bitcoin có tiềm năng tăng trưởng vượt bậc, mang lại lợi nhuận khổng lồ cho những nhà đầu tư tiên phong. Nâng cao uy tín: Việc đầu tư vào Bitcoin còn giúp doanh nghiệp xây dựng hình ảnh đổi mới và thu hút sự chú ý của nhà đầu tư. Tuy nhiên, Bitcoin cũng không phải là “miền đất hứa” hoàn hảo. Biến động giá: Giá Bitcoin lên xuống thất thường, có thể gây ra những khoản lỗ lớn cho doanh nghiệp. Rủi ro pháp lý: Các quy định về tiền điện tử vẫn còn chưa rõ ràng, tiềm ẩn nhiều rủi ro pháp lý cho doanh nghiệp. Vấn đề môi trường: Hoạt động khai thác Bitcoin tiêu tốn nhiều năng lượng, có thể gây ảnh hưởng đến môi trường và làm “mất lòng” những nhà đầu tư có ý thức bảo vệ môi trường, mặc dù thực tế cho thấy khai thác Bitcoin khuyến khích sử dụng năng lượng bền vững . Tóm lại là: Việc đầu tư vào Bitcoin là một cuộc chơi mạo hiểm nhưng đầy tiềm năng cho các doanh nghiệp, với những lợi ích hấp dẫn như khả năng chống lạm phát, tiềm năng tăng trưởng khủng, Bitcoin cũng đi kèm với những rủi ro nhất định. Do đó, các doanh nghiệp cần cân nhắc kỹ lưỡng, xây dựng chiến lược quản trị rủi ro hiệu quả để tận dụng tối đa tiềm năng của đồng tiền này. Xu hướng này cho thấy Bitcoin đang dần lột xác từ một tài sản đầu cơ thành công cụ quản lý tài chính chính thống, hứa hẹn sẽ định hình lại bức tranh tài chính toàn cầu trong tương lai.

Economics professor Özgür Demirtaş, in his post from his X account, suggested a cryptocurrency for Türkiye. Demirtaş, while drawing attention to the fact that the increasing value of the Turkish Lira and the weakening of the Russian economy have a negative impact on the tourism sector, suggested that Turkey switch to a cryptocurrency payment system in order to overcome the difficulties in the tourism sector. Demirtaş stated that accepting payments with cryptocurrency could attract new tourists to the sector, and emphasized that this step would make Turkey attractive for tourists in the crypto ecosystem. Demirtaş suggested the following steps to be taken to popularize the use of cryptocurrencies in the tourism sector: “1. This summer, tourism businesses should be allowed to accept payments with cryptocurrency. 2. Devices that can receive payments through wallets managed by the Ministry should be distributed to businesses. 3. Businesses should be able to decide whether to keep crypto payments in Bitcoin, Dollars or TL with these devices. 4. Educational studies should be conducted to eliminate the misperception that cryptocurrencies are associated with crimes such as money laundering. 5. It should be emphasized that crypto payments can be tracked and the advantages of the system in terms of transparency should be emphasized. By being able to receive payments with crypto, it becomes possible for those in the crypto ecosystem around the world to be attracted to the country as tourists. “It would be a good advertisement for the country. I would be happy if it comes to life.” https://twitter.com/ProfDemirtas/status/1868702007797633120 *This is not investment advice.

This marked the 16th consecutive day of net inflows, showing increased investor interest in Ethereum-based investment products. BlackRock’s Ethereum spot ETF trading under the ticker “ETHA” led the pack with the largest single-day net inflow of $30.7 million, highlighting institutional confidence in the asset. On December 16, the total net inflow of Ethereum spot ETFs was $51.1256 million, and the net inflow continued for 16 days. The Ethereum spot ETF with the largest net inflow in a single day yesterday was BlackRock ETF ETHA, with a net inflow of $30.7235 million in a single day.… pic.twitter.com/H0PpxbLNxS — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 17, 2024 Massive ETH ETF Boom Last week, between December 9 and 13, Ethereum spot ETFs saw record-breaking inflows of $855 million, according to data from Sosovalue. Ethereum price pushed above $4,100 for the first time this year on Monday, as bullish sentiment rose following Bitcoin’s renewed push to fresh record levels above $107,000. There is optimism that the US will establish some sort of strategic Bitcoin reserve in 2025 under the incoming Trump administration is the main talking point right now. Of course, this is helping to lift the entire crypto market, not just Bitcoin. But Ethereum also benefits from highly bullish narratives of its own. The introduction of spot ETFs has provided investors with a regulated and accessible avenue to gain exposure to Ethereum, contributing to the sustained inflows seen over the past few weeks. BlackRock’s leading position in net inflows on December 16 demonstrates the growing role of major asset managers in shaping the crypto investment landscape. According to research by Blockhead, ETF inflows continue their two-week streak, with Bitcoin seeing $637 million and Ethereum attracting $51 million in fresh support. This strong institutional backing is a key driver behind the market’s ability to push past previous all-time highs. “On-chain data reveals that large players, or whales, are gaining more control over both the Bitcoin and Ethereum markets. In particular, 104 Ethereum whales now control 57.35% of the total ETH supply, suggesting robust confidence in Ethereum’s future performance as transaction volumes and network fees rise,” said the Blockhead in a research note.

37750793,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/easing-smart-contract-deployment-headaches-to-drive-innovation-in-decentralized-ai,1734426718,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/37750793.jpeg,Easing Smart Contract Deployment Headaches To Drive Innovation In Decentralized AI,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/easing-smart-contract-deployment-headaches-to-drive-innovation-in-decentralized-ai,"Smart contracts are a pivotal component of every Web3 application. They facilitate decentralized finance, blockchain gaming, real estate, supply chain management, virtual land deals in the metaverse, and much more. They are the secret sauce that makes Web3 click, enabling it to support transactions between independent parties without any middlemen. Without smart contracts, Web3 simply couldn’t exist. However, the methods for deploying them remain complex and challenging, even for experienced developers. This is considered a major impediment to Web3’s growth, and there’s an urgent need for the process to be simplified. The role of smart contracts Smart contracts are digital agreements that automatically trigger blockchain actions when specified conditions are met. For developers, they’re a key tool that enables them to build sophisticated applications, automating their financial agreements and processes. Because they’re deployed on public blockchains, smart contracts are fully transparent and offer heightened security. By making the code public, no one can alter the terms of a smart contract once it has been deployed, so users can have full confidence that it’ll work as proscribed. This transparency also makes it simple for anyone to validate transactions, increasing trust among users and reducing the opportunities for fraud. The hassles of smart contract deployment Most smart contracts are written in Solidity, which is a blockchain-specific programming language, so developers must be proficient in this. Writing smart contracts in Solidity is a tricky business, with developers required to define their objectives with clarity and precision, establish their purpose and goals, determine their scope and limitations, and identify the necessary functions and features required to achieve all of this. Other technical requirements include defining the data structure and variables, creating the necessary logic and algorithms, testing, and debugging. Only after navigating all of these challenges will the developer be ready to deploy their smart contracts, and this can be just as arduous. Throughout each stage of the deployment, developers must pay careful attention to detail to ensure that their smart contracts are activated securely and function as intended. One of the key steps involves defining the deployment parameters, which include setting the gas limits and fees. For smart contacts intended for enterprise use, developers will likely want to deploy on a test net, first of all, to verify they function as intended. Monitoring the smart contract’s performance is essential too, as coding errors can have a negative impact on their efficiency and security. By instituting real-time alerts, developers will be able to receive updates to any issues and ensure a smooth experience for smart contract users. Smart contracts must be deployed carefully to ensure their reliability and security, and this means that thorough testing is also required. It’s recommended to implement a test-driven development approach using tools such as Remix and Truffle , which can help to simulate various transaction loads in different scenarios. For instance, developers need to perform unit tests, integration tests and system tests prior to deployment, while third-party audits can further minimize risks. The biggest challenge in terms of deployment is the migration from a development environment to a blockchain network. In addition, network congestion may delay the deployment process and increase the costs. Version control is also essential to avoid any discrepancies between different smart contract versions, and developers must create a timely update process to quickly fix any vulnerabilities or errors discovered later. Another challenge pertains to the high gas costs associated with certain blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum. While this doesn’t matter so much in low-cost networks, inefficient transaction code can result in substantially increased gas costs, meaning higher operational expenses. Developers can get around this by optimizing their code so it uses fewer computational resources, for instance by reducing storage variables and minimizing loops. Developers must also be aware of blockchain scalability issues, which can make it very difficult to maintain optimal smart contract functionality, hindering their performance when the network is experiencing high transaction volumes. Reducing the complexity Fortunately, there are some newer blockchain networks that attempt to streamline the smart contract deployment process and make life as simple as possible for developers. For AI developers, one of the most promising options is OG , formerly a modular blockchain network that’s since pivoted to become a Decentralized AI Operating System. The OG Chain uses blockchain technology to coordinate decentralized resources for AI, including computing, storage, and data availability. It’s a direct response to the rise of centralized AI systems that lack transparency in terms of their users’ data. One of the main benefits of OG is its flexible design, which allows for the major components of its platform – storage, computing, data accessibility, and AI model hosting – to be easily integrated with any decentralized application. The other advantage of OG Chain is its simplified smart contact deployment process. As an EVM-compatible network, the process of deploying smart contracts on OG is the same as it is on any other EVM chain, with developers able to write code in Solidity and use familiar tools and processes. Unlike other networks, OG offers a user-friendly interface that walks developers through each stage of deployment, ensuring smart contracts can be activated much faster. It breaks things down to a few easy steps To get started , developers can use Solc or another compatible Solidity compiler to compile their smart contract code. OG then automatically generates the binary and Application Binary Interface or ABI for their smart contract, ready for deployment. It’s then just a matter of using a tool such as web3.js., ether.js, or hardhat to commit their code to the OG Chain, via an OG Chain node or an RPC endpoint. To verify that the contract is deployed correctly, developers can perform a simple check using the OG Chain block explorer. With that tool, they’ll be able to bring up a basic overview of contract deployment data, including its public address, interaction histor,y and transaction status. More time to innovate If Web3 is to grow its presence and become mainstream, it needs more useful applications. But Web3 developers are in short supply, and so there’s an urgent need for them to become more productive. OG Chain plays an important role in enabling this, making it easier than ever to deploy smart contracts. It provides developers with a streamlined workflow that minimizes the technical complexity involved in bringing their smart contracts online. By removing the hassles of deployment, OG allows developers to focus more on writing the code that defines their smart contracts, giving them more time to innovate and expand the possibilities of Web3.

Prominent cryptocurrency analyst Steph Is Crypto recently highlighted a technical indicator on the 4-hour timeframe of XRP’s chart. Sharing an annotated image, Steph Is Crypto stated, “Big move ahead for #XRP! Bollinger Bands on the 4hr are tightening—last time this happened, #XRP surged 126%!” This statement has sparked significant discussion within the XRP community concerning a potential price breakout for the token. Big move ahead for #XRP ! Bollinger Bands on the 4hr are tightening—last time this happened, #XRP surged 126%! pic.twitter.com/oN1ZBDgury — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 15, 2024 Key Observations from the Chart The image attached to the tweet reveals three prior instances of Bollinger Bands tightening. Each of these instances preceded substantial price increases for XRP. The first major move saw XRP rally 130.81% to a price of $0.717 while the second observed surge resulted in a 52.84% gain, bringing the price to approximately $1.565. The most recent significant breakout showed XRP climbing 126.23%, reaching a peak of $1.616. These price movements occurred shortly after periods where the Bollinger Bands tightened, a phenomenon that typically signals a period of reduced volatility and a potential breakout—either upward or downward. As of now, the chart shows the Bollinger Bands converging once again, leading many to speculate that another significant price movement may be imminent. Market Sentiment and Reactions The post has garnered varying opinions, particularly around XRP’s price catalysts. One user, Preston, provided a critical perspective, stating , “The only way XRP goes up is pure utility. Until then it requires USDT to mint billions at which point most of the market, especially Bitcoin, benefits the most. No liquidity injection, no price movement. RLUSD changes the game. But it’s not live yet.” Preston’s comment highlights a broader concern in the crypto community regarding liquidity. He argues that the price movement for XRP and other cryptocurrencies often depends on external liquidity injections, such as those associated with stablecoins like Tether (USDT). He also references RLUSD, Ripple’s coming liquidity solution , suggesting it could significantly alter market dynamics after launch. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another user, Richie Rich, offered a more optimistic outlook, writing, “I hope you’re right. I know it’s inevitable we will be going much higher. XRP will be the best performing out of them all, especially when the utility is in play.” Richie Rich’s viewpoint reflects the confidence of many XRP holders in the token’s long-term potential, particularly as Ripple advances its efforts to drive utility through real-world use cases, including cross-border payments. Factors to Watch for XRP’s Future Price Movement While the technical indicator is promising, XRP’s price remains subject to broader market conditions and developments, including: Ripple’s Legal Standing: XRP’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) influences investor sentiment. Positive regulatory outcomes could serve as a major catalyst. Utility and Adoption: Ripple’s efforts to expand XRP’s use in cross-border payments and other financial applications will help drive sustainable demand. Market Liquidity: As highlighted by Preston, liquidity injections and the availability of stablecoins like USDT often influence XRP’s ability to move significantly in either direction. Whether XRP repeats its previous upward trends or faces a different outcome will depend on these combined elements.

After climbing 6.1% since October, the dollar is having its strongest quarter since the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes in 2022. Traders are eyeing further gains next year, despite President-elect Donald Trump’s push for a weaker currency. The dollar has strengthened from $1.11 against the euro in early October to below $1.05. Deutsche Bank forecasts parity—$1 to €1—by 2025. More than half of major banks surveyed, including Goldman Sachs, UBS, and Morgan Stanley, predict the greenback will remain robust. Trump’s hopes for a weaker dollar to help US exporters? Not likely, analysts say. Trump’s policies may fuel dollar strength Trump has repeatedly called the dollar’s strength a “big problem” for American companies. In July, he said, “That’s a tremendous burden on our companies that try and sell tractors and other things to other places outside of this country.” During his first term, he even labeled China a “currency manipulator” amid trade tensions. Despite this rhetoric, analysts believe Trump’s pro-growth policies will only strengthen the currency. Trump’s plans for import tariffs, tax cuts, and an inflationary boost to domestic demand are seen as dollar-positive. Higher inflation could force the Fed to keep interest rates elevated, attracting foreign capital into dollar assets. Barclays expects the dollar to inch up to $1.04 against the euro by the end of next year. Global dynamics limit Trump’s control over the US dollar Despite Trump’s desire to devalue the dollar, the mechanics are complicated. Analysts rule out a “Plaza Accord” repeat—similar to the 1985 deal when countries intervened to weaken the dollar. Mark Sobel, a former US Treasury official, says support for a so-called “Mar-a-Lago Accord” is unrealistic. “Perceptions about US leverage over China are woefully exaggerated,” he explained . Beijing is unlikely to agree to engineered devaluation. Brad Setser, another former Treasury official, says the 1985 Plaza Accord worked because US rates were already falling. “The macroeconomic backdrop, with interest rate differentials that favor the dollar versus the euro and the yuan, isn’t conducive to a weak dollar.” Right now, the Fed’s stance and global capital flows strongly support the greenback. Even with Trump pushing against it, the dollar’s fundamentals remain strong. Analysts believe weakening it would require measures like reducing the government deficit or forcing trade allies into currency agreements—highly unlikely paths. Franklin Templeton says , “It’s not clear to me that he can actually run around screaming about how the euro is too weak against the dollar.” Market pricing and recent dollar movements The dollar’s rally has taken a brief pause in recent weeks. The Dollar Index , which measures the greenback against major currencies, is trading around 106.8, down from highs above 108 late last month. But this doesn’t signal the end of the rally. The stronger dollar creates challenges for exporters but benefits foreign investors. The higher the Fed keeps rates, the more attractive dollar-denominated assets become. Analysts agree: Trump’s economic agenda—whether intentional or not—will keep the dollar climbing. For investors, the dollar remains a safe bet. Analysts largely dismiss Trump’s rhetoric. Currency strategies hinge on interest rate differentials, trade policies, and global capital flows. None of these favor a weaker dollar. The Federal Reserve remains the central player in the dollar’s outlook. If inflation rises, the Fed may hold rates steady or even hike further. That’s a direct pull for global capital, keeping upward pressure on the greenback. The market has priced in a near-certain 25 basis point cut by the Fed next year. Even if the dollar rally slows, analysts don’t expect a reversal. Economic effects of a strong dollar The dollar’s strength is already affecting financial markets. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones fell 0.25% for its eighth consecutive day of losses—the longest losing streak since 2018. The S&P 500 climbed 0.38%, and the Nasdaq rose 1.24%, hitting a new high. In Europe, France’s CAC 40 dropped 0.71% after Moody’s downgraded the country’s credit rating. Tech stocks are also in focus. Nvidia shares dipped 1.7% on Monday, closing at $132. The stock is now down 11% from its November peak but remains up 166% year-to-date. Meanwhile, other chipmakers like Broadcom continue to post gains, indicating sector strength despite Nvidia’s dip. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son also made history when he announced a $100 billion investment plan in the US over the next four years. The deal includes creating 100,000 jobs focused on AI and infrastructure. Bitcoin, though, broke two all-time highs just yesterday. It was trading at $106,622 at press time.

This bold strategy has positioned MicroStrategy as a leader in corporate Bitcoin adoption but also raised concerns about its impact on market stability and decentralization. MicroStrategy’s aggressive approach uses debt and equity to fund Bitcoin purchases, deviating from traditional corporate treasury methods. The company recently raised $1.5 billion by selling 3.8 million shares, purchasing 15,350 BTC at an average price of $100,386. This tactic has made MicroStrategy a proxy for Bitcoin investment , giving stockholders exposure to Bitcoin without owning the asset directly. While this approach has fueled growth, it carries risks. MicroStrategy's market value depends heavily on its Bitcoin holdings, making the company vulnerable to price drops. Experts point out that even a significant decline—such as Bitcoin falling below $18,000—would impact the market but not immediately destabilize MicroStrategy’s position. The cryptocurrency market has surged in 2024, with Bitcoin surpassing $100,000 for the first time on December 5. Optimism surrounding pro-crypto policies, including the nomination of Paul Atkins as SEC Chair, has fueled this growth. The market’s total value nearly doubled in 2024, reaching $3.8 trillion. Other companies are following MicroStrategy’s lead. Riot Platforms announced plans to raise $500 million through convertible notes for Bitcoin purchases, while Marathon Digital secured $700 million for similar acquisitions. These moves signal growing corporate interest in Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Blockstream, a blockchain leader, has also entered the Bitcoin treasury space. The company’s new asset management division focuses on helping businesses optimize Bitcoin investments. CIO Sean Bill expects more corporations and even nations to adopt Bitcoin, reshaping how companies manage reserves. However, MicroStrategy’s dominance raises questions about Bitcoin's decentralization. Large holdings by a single entity pose risks if a sell-off occurs. Historical examples highlight this concern: in 2024, the German government sold 50,000 BTC over five weeks, triggering a 13% price drop. While disruptive, Bitcoin proved resilient and recovered quickly. Exchange-traded products (ETPs) add complexity by concentrating ownership in fewer hands. Yet analysts argue that ETPs cater to diverse investors, balancing accessibility with decentralization. In contrast to MicroStrategy , companies like Block Inc. have taken a more conservative path. Block reinvests 10% of its Bitcoin-based profits into its reserves instead of using debt. This measured strategy reduces exposure to volatility and aligns with organic growth. Bitcoin’s resilience continues to attract institutions, but experts advise caution. Alexandre Schmidt from CoinShares suggests diversification and monitoring market signals like share sales or leadership changes. While MicroStrategy’s influence is significant, Bitcoin’s fundamentals—its scarcity, decentralization, and utility—remain intact. “Long-term holders should stay focused on Bitcoin’s core strengths. It has survived multiple 50%+ drops, and patience has consistently rewarded those who take a long-term view,” Schmidt explains. Michael Saylor remains a strong advocate, encouraging companies to adopt Bitcoin. Despite pushback—such as Microsoft rejecting Bitcoin as part of its reserves—other corporations like Amazon are exploring similar options. Shareholders recently proposed allocating part of Amazon’s $88 billion cash reserves to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. MicroStrategy’s strategy represents both an opportunity and a challenge for Bitcoin. On the one hand, it has legitimized Bitcoin as a corporate asset, inspiring others to follow suit. On the other, it raises concerns about market centralization and stability. As institutional players continue to enter the market, the balance between decentralization and corporate influence will define Bitcoin’s future. While risks exist, Bitcoin’s growth in 2024 proves its appeal as “digital gold.” For companies and individual investors alike, a long-term perspective remains key to navigating this evolving landscape.",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-17 09:14:20

37751121,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394053,1734427387,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,RLUSD Launch Price Prediction: Here’s What Industry Leaders Are Saying,https://coinpedia.org/news/rlusd-launch-price-prediction-heres-what-industry-leaders-are-saying/,"The post RLUSD Launch Price Prediction: Here’s What Industry Leaders Are Saying appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple is set to launch its USD-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, on December 17, 2024. The stablecoin will initially be available on platforms like Uphold, MoonPay, CoinMENA, Bitso, and Archax, with plans to expand to more exchanges in the future. RLUSD is backed by U.S. dollar deposits, U.S. government bonds, and cash equivalents, offering transparency through monthly third-party audits of its reserves. While RLUSD is designed to always maintain a $1 value, some collectors are already bidding on it in on-chain marketplaces, with bids reaching up to 836 XRP ($2068) (As reported by Coindesk) before its release. This early demand could lead to temporary price fluctuations, as RLUSD may not have enough liquidity to immediately maintain its $1 peg. Himanshu Maradiya, Chairman and Founder, CIFDAQ, told Coinpedia, “Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, pegged to $1, has already generated significant excitement ahead of its launch, with onchain bids soaring up to $2,000. This pre-launch frenzy reflects limited supply and heightened demand, as speculators rush to secure the first RLUSD tokens.” He added, “While such inflated prices may turn heads, volatility is expected to settle, bringing the price closer to $1 as liquidity normalizes post-launch. With RLUSD set to go live on the XRP Ledger, Ripple’s entry into the stablecoin market marks a pivotal moment, enhancing utility, driving liquidity, and strengthening stablecoins’ role in cross-border payment solutions.” XRP Price Expected To Reach New Highs: Ever since the news about RLUSD launch was announced, XRP has been rising and is currently trading close to the $2.60 levels. Experts are suggesting that XRP bulls may break the previous ATHs once RLUSD goes live. However, XRP has been facing major resistance at $3 and it remains to be seen if the altcoin can cross the crucial mark today.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|WALLET|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-17 09:23:07

BTC is up 2.42% over the past 24 hours and 10% over the past week as its post-election rally continues. The world’s largest and most popular cryptocurrency has registered gains of over 50% since Trump’s November election victory. BTC’s record-breaking price action has significantly impacted other cryptocurrencies as well. Ethereum (ETH) crossed the crucial $4,000 mark, up 2.40% over the past 24 hours. Ripple (XRP)’s latest rally has seen it leapfrog Tether (USDT) again to become the third-largest cryptocurrency. XRP is up almost 16% over the past week. However, Solana (SOL) registered a notable decline, down nearly 3% over the past 24 hours. Cardano (ADA) , Tron (TRX) , Chainlink (LINK), and Aave (AAVE) also registered substantial gains. Crypto Receives Major Boost Thanks To Trump’s Comments Bitcoin (BTC) has rallied over 50% since the US elections, which saw Trump voted to office, along with several pro-crypto candidates. As a result of the substantial jump in prices, the overall value of the crypto market has doubled over the year so far to hit $3.8 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. Trump, who once called crypto a scam, embraced digital assets during his election campaign and promised to make the US the crypto capital of the world. Trump also named former PayPal executive David Sacks White House czar for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies. Additionally, Trump has nominated pro-crypto attorney Paul Atkins as the next Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair. MicroStrategy Added To Nasdaq-100 Michael Saylor-led MicroStrategy will be added to the Nasdaq-100 Index. The change will come into effect before the market opens. MicroStrategy’s strategy of aggressively investing in Bitcoin (BTC) has seen the company’s shares soar sixfold during the ongoing year. As a result, its market value has surged to $94 billion. The company is also the largest corporate holder of BTC. The news also led to the company’s shares registering an increase of 4.2% on Monday. Matthew Dibb, the Chief Investment Officer at Astronaut Capital, stated the inclusion was a bit unexpected, adding, “The inclusion seems a bit unexpected, but that hasn’t stopped the excitement of what many believe to be the start of a looping cycle of capital that could potentially drive up the spot Bitcoin price.” MicroStrategy Purchases More Bitcoin (BTC) MicroStrategy purchased an additional 15,350 BTC during the week ending December 15 at an average price of roughly $100,386 per BTC. The purchase was financed by selling MicroStrategy shares. The latest purchase brings MicroStrategy’s total BTC reserves to a staggering 439,000 BTC worth $47 billion at current prices. MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy has seen the company’s market cap grow from $1.1 billion to almost $100 billion. The jump in BTC prices has also boosted MicroStrategy shares. BTC has seen an unprecedented rally this year thanks to the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs and Trump’s victory in the US presidential elections. The company has also been included in the Nasdaq 100. The company now aims to become part of the S&P 500 index. However, this may be difficult, according to analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas. While companies must have a market cap of at least $18 billion, the S&P has complete discretion in deciding which companies make the cut. According to Seyffart and Balchunas, MicroStrategy’s biggest problem could be profitability, with the company failing to profit over the past few quarters. However, that could change in 2025. Current accounting rules do not allow companies like MicroStrategy to record BTC on their books at fair value. Instead, they must take an impairment loss if prices fall and cannot take any gains from rising BTC prices into their books. However, new rules by the Financial Accounting Standards Board allow companies to capture some upside from rising BTC prices. Ripple To Roll Out RLUSD Stablecoin Ripple announced it will begin rolling out the RLUSD stablecoin on December 17 after receiving regulatory approval. It will be listed on several prominent exchanges and crypto platforms, including MoonPay, Uphold, Archax, and CoinMENA. Further listings on Bitstamp, Bitso, Bullish, and others are also planned in the coming weeks. The company also announced two additions to its stablecoin advisory board: Raghuram Rajan, former governor of the Reserve Bank of India, and Kenneth Montgomery, the former first vice president and COO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) hit another record as it surged to a new all-time high of $107,780, thanks to growing optimism about its potential role as a US reserve asset. BTC’s latest milestone came after President-elect Donald Trump announced his intention to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve similar to the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Trump reaffirmed his stance in an interview, stating that the US would do something great with crypto. As a result, markets have a renewed sense of optimism, with other altcoins also registering substantial gains. Additionally, crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) have also registered record-breaking inflows. Data from CoinShares reported a staggering $3.2 billion flowing into these products, with BTC accounting for over half of these investments. BTC declined marginally after hitting a new all-time high and is trading around $106,719, up almost 1% over the past 24 hours. Sentiment around BTC has become positive after Trump’s comments, despite the asset getting off to a bearish start during the previous week. BTC started last week with a drop of 3.57%, falling to an intraday low of $94,185, briefly slipping below the 20-day SMA. However, it recovered partially from this level to go above the 20-day SMA and settle at $97,434. Bearish sentiment persisted on Tuesday as BTC registered a marginal decline and settled at $96,912, but not before dropping to an intraday low of $94,313. Despite starting the week in the red, BTC recovered on Wednesday, registering an increase of 4.12% to cross $100,000 and settle at $100,900. However, the price fell back in the red on Thursday, dropping almost 1% to slip below $100,000 and settle at $99,923. Source: TradingView BTC recovered on Friday to reclaim $100,000 after an increase of 1.47% and settled at $101,394. However, the weekend began with a marginal decline as buyers failed to build momentum on Saturday. BTC recovered strongly on Sunday, registering an increase of almost 3%, and settled at $104,181. Bullish sentiment persisted on Monday as BTC set a new all-time high, reaching an intraday high of $107,780 before marginally declining to $105,750. The current session sees BTC up by almost 1% as it eyes the $110,000 mark. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) finally broke past the resistance at $4,000, a level it struggled to surpass. Market watchers will hope ETH can build on its recent uptick and push towards $4,500. ETH has struggled to go above $4,000 since the beginning of December and plummeted over 7% last Monday as it failed to stay above this level. As a result, ETH fell to an intraday low of $3,536 before settling at $3,715. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as ETH dropped to an intraday low of $3,521, briefly going below the 20-day SMA before settling at $3,630, a decline of 2.30%. However, ETH recovered on Wednesday, registering an increase of 5.62% to cross $3,800 and settle at $3,834. Buyers retained control on Thursday as ETH rose to an intraday high of $3,988 before declining to settle at $3,882, ultimately registering an increase of 1.26%. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment began waning on Friday as ETH registered only a marginal increase. Despite the marginal increase, ETH could go above $3,900 and settle at $3,907. The weekend began with ETH dropping almost 1% on Saturday to go below $3,900 and settle at $3,869. However, it recovered on Sunday, registering an increase of 2.25% and settling at $3,956. The current week began with ETH experiencing significant volatility as buyers and sellers struggled to take control. As a result, ETH dropped to an intraday low of $3,882 and rose to an intraday high of $4,106 before settling at $3,985 after an increase of 0.74%. The current session sees ETH marginally up and trading around $4,007. Buyers will look to keep ETH above $4,000 and push towards $4,500. On the other hand, sellers will attempt to wrest control and drive ETH below $4,000 and towards $3,800. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) slipped below the $220 support level as growing selling pressure saw the price plummet to $211. SOL has been trading in a downward trajectory since November 23, as its bull run halted abruptly after it failed to stay above $260. Bearish sentiment intensified considerably at the beginning of last week, as SOL plummeted by 8.55% to drop to an intraday low of $205 before settling at $216. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as SOL fell to an intraday low of $201 before settling at $213 after a drop of 1.47%. Despite considerable selling pressure, SOL recovered on Wednesday, registering an increase of 6.38% and settling at $227. SOL attempted to push above the 20-day SMA on Thursday as it reached an intraday high of $234. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped to $215, registering a marginal decline. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Friday as SOL dropped by 0.96% to $224. Sellers attempted to drag SOL below the 50-day SMA on Saturday as it fell to an intraday low of $215. However, it partially recovered from this level to settle at $219, ultimately registering a drop of 2.22%. SOL recovered on Sunday, registering an increase of almost 2% and moving to $224. Despite ending the weekend positively, SOL was back in the red on Monday, dropping nearly 4% to slip below the 50-day SMA and $220 to settle at $216. The current session sees SOL marginally down as sellers look to drive SOL towards $200. Arbitrum (ARB) Price Analysis Arbitrum (ARB) is struggling to build momentum and go above the 20-day SMA as sellers look to yank the price below $1. ARB suffered a substantial decline at the beginning of last week, plummeting over 17% to an intraday low of $0.840 before partially recovering and settling at $0.960. Bearish sentiment persisted on Tuesday, with ARB witnessing an increase in volatility. As a result, ARB rose to an intraday high of $1.10 and fell to an intraday low of $0.875 before settling at $0.938, below the 20-day SMA. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising by 6.51% to move past the 20-day SMA and settle at $0.999. Source: TradingView Buyers pushed ARB to an intraday high of $1.11 on Thursday as bullish sentiment increased considerably. However, buyers could not maintain momentum, and the price dropped to $1.02, registering an increase of almost 3%. Friday saw a marginal increase as ARB rose to $1.03 as momentum began waning. Sellers took control on Saturday, driving ARB down nearly 5% as it fell below the 20-day SMA and $1 and settled at $0.984. The price recovered on Sunday, rising over 3% to reclaim $1 and settle at $1.01. However, bearish sentiment returned on Monday as ARB fell by 1.28% and settled at $1. The current session sees ARB down by almost 1%, slipping below $1 and trading around $0.995. Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis Chainlink (LINK) is struggling to go above $30, with buyers losing momentum thanks to considerable selling pressure. LINK suffered a substantial collapse last Monday as it dropped almost 15%, falling to an intraday low of $19.78 before settling at $22.30. The price faced considerable volatility on Tuesday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. As a result, LINK rose to an intraday high of $23.78 and fell to an intraday low of $20.29 before settling at $22.13, ultimately registering a marginal decline. LINK recovered on Wednesday as it rebounded from its support levels to register an increase of almost 9% and settle at $24.06. Bullish sentiment intensified considerably on Thursday as LINK rose over 21% and surged to $29.15, as it sought to rest the resistance at $30. Source: Tradi ngView With LINK encountering resistance at this level, volatility increased on Friday as buyers and sellers sought to dictate price action. As a result, LINK rose to an intraday high of $30.95. However, it could not stay at this level and fell to a low of $27.54 before settling at 428.99 after a marginal decline. Buyers attempted to claim $30 over the weekend as LINK rose to $30.78 before settling at $29.11. Sunday also saw a marginal increase as LINK settled at $29.24, still unable to stay above $30. Bearish sentiment intensified on Monday after another failed attempt to go above $30, as LINK fell almost 2% after reaching an intraday high of $30.83 and settled at $28.72. The current session sees LINK down nearly 2% as buyers look to lower the price towards $25. Toncoin (TON) Price Analysis Toncoin (TON) registered a dramatic drop last week, falling over 14% to slip below key support levels and the 20 and 200-day SMAs to $5.80. TON fell further on Tuesday, dropping to an intraday low of $5.50. However, it recovered from this level to register an increase of 2.41% and settled at $5.94.

Buyers attempted to go above the 20-day SMA on Thursday, and TON reached an intraday high of $6.48. However, it lost momentum at this level and registered a marginal drop to settle at $6.32. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Friday as TON dropped 0.54% and settled at $6.29. Selling pressure increased on Saturday as TON dropped over 1% and settled at $6.22. Despite growing selling pressure, TON recovered on Sunday to register an increase of almost 3% and settle at $6.39. Bearish sentiment returned on Monday as TON dropped over 5% to slip below the 200-day SMA and settle at $6.05. The current session sees the price marginally down as sellers look to drive TON below $6.

FTM registered a dramatic drop last Monday, falling almost 16% and settling at $1.12. Despite starting the week in the red, FTM recovered on Tuesday, rising over 3% and settling at $1.15. Bullish sentiment persisted on Wednesday as FTM rose 8% and settled at $1.25. Buyers attempted to push higher on Thursday as FTM reached an intraday high of $1.32. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped to $1.23, registering a decline of 1.35%. Buyers returned to the market on Friday as FTM registered an increase of almost 7% and settled at $1.31. Source: TradingView Despite a strong showing on Friday, FTM fell back in the red on Saturday, dropping almost 7% to $1.22. The price recovered on Saturday, surging nearly 17% to go above the resistance at $1.35 and settle at $1.38.

Currently, LINK is forming an ascending triangle pattern, indicating a potential breakout. Investors are anticipating further gains as speculation rises about what Chainlink price would be if it matched XRP’s $144 billion market cap. Here’s Chainlink Price If It Hits XRP’s Market Cap Chainlink price has the potential to surge significantly if it matches XRP’s current market capitalization. At present, Chainlink holds a market cap of $17.7 billion, placing it at 12th on the CoinMarketCap ranking. Meanwhile, XRP’s market capitalization stands at $144 billion, positioning it third on the list after a 5% surge in the last 24 hours. The difference highlights that XRP’s market cap is approximately 712% larger than Chainlink’s, showcasing a vast gap between the two assets. For LINK to achieve XRP’s market cap of $144 billion, it would require an approximate 8x to 9x increase in its valuation. At LINK’s current price of $28, this means it would need to rally 720% to reach a price target of around $230. Using the circulating supply of about 626 million tokens, this analysis is in tune with this expectation. Despite this forecast being a rather bold step, it makes sense when considering the inclusion of LINK in Donald Trump’s portfolio, rumors about a partnership with BlackRock and other fundamental developments surrounding Chainlink, crypto’s oracle. The below tweet explains how Chainlink is the only crypto company that is partnering with not one but many institutional companies like DTDC, Fidelity, Swift and so on. $LINK is the only project collaborating with the biggest financial institutions on the planet Study it before the train leaves the station pic.twitter.com/P2s63QPB3A — Quinten | 048.eth (@QuintenFrancois) December 17, 2024 LINK Technical Analysis The latest price of LINK was $28.21, as of Tuesday during the European trading session and has dipped 3.63% since then. In the past week, Chainlink has risen by 22% and, looking at the past month, the coin has increased by 95%. It follows the wider cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin hitting an ATH of $107,000 recently. This has boosted investors confidence, leading other major altcoins such as Ripple’s XRP, and Chainlink (LINK) to rise. The LINK price faces strong resistance at $30 as bulls and bears battle for control. If the bullish momentum persists, LINK price prediction could rally toward $40 in the short term. A sustained breakout above $40 might even push the token toward $52, reclaiming its all-time high last seen four years ago. However, if sellers overpower buyers, the price could reverse and test support near $20. The MACD indicator shows a slowing bullish trend as the blue line hovers slightly above the signal line. The histogram, though positive, reveals shrinking bars, hinting at reduced buying pressure. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) stands at 0.07, indicating modest inflows of capital into LINK. Chainlink price chart: TradingView If Chainlink reaches XRP’s $144 billion market cap, its price could surge to $230. While ambitious, current bullish momentum and market trends signal growing investor confidence in LINK’s future.

Ripple’s stablecoin has received approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and will compete with giants like Tether’s USDT, and Circle’s USDC. Many speculate that RLUSD could catalyze the XRP price to shoot up to $3. RLUSD To Go Live Today: Here’s Everything You Need to Know After receiving the approval from NYDFS, Ripple announced on December 16, that their stablecoin RLUSD will go live on December 17, 2024. The New York Trust Company Charter will issue the token. RLUSD is a stablecoin backed 1:1 with U.S. dollar, cash equivalents, and government bonds. Based on the announcement, there will be third-party monthly audits to ensure pegging and transparency. The Ripple news confirmed that it will get launched today on many famous crypto exchanges like Uphold, MoonPay, CoinMENA, etc. However, trading is likely to begin tomorrow. Later, Bitstamp, Bitso, Zero Hash, and many others, will launch the stablecoin as well. The wait is over: RLUSD launches globally tomorrow! https://t.co/mYcyyX6Vre — Ripple (@Ripple) December 16, 2024 The blockchain network has planned this Ripple stablecoin to facilitate real-time cross-border payment, along with providing liquidity and seamless integration of the DeFi protocol. Its launch is on two primary networks, i.e., Ethereum blockchain and XRP Ledger worldwide, but not in the EU due to the nation’s newly implemented MiCAR regulations. Interestingly, the blockchain firm has launched this stablecoin to benefit the XRP and will be paired together to support each other in the financial markets and cross-border payments. Further, two more prominent industry leaders have joined the project, Raghuram Rajan (former governor of the Reserve Bank of India) and Kenneth Montgomery (chief operating officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston). How Will Ripple Stablecoin Launch Impact XRP Price? Ripple price has maintained continuous bullishness over the last few weeks. It has jumped to as high as $2.8 earlier in the month. Even at present, the XRP price is at $2.51 with a market capitalization of $143.85B, making it the third biggest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and Ethereum. More importantly, its trading volume is at $12.49B after an 87% surge, clearly indicating the investor’s enthusiasm building around the RLUSD stablecoin launch. Regardless, this Ripple news is likely to push the token further, where some claim to see the XRP price at $5, $10, or even higher. A crypto analyst, CrediBULL Crypto, says the XRP chart is so clean and bullish that it can easily trade above $5 in 2025. Another analyst, DonAlt, revealed that the Ripple price is moving between $2.20 and $2.60, between the support and resistance. If it broke the resistance at $2.60, it could trigger a bullish momentum, pushing the token to $3 or higher. However, this is not the only factor contributing to the XRP price rally. Others like Bitcoin attaining ATH, the launch of XRP ETFs , Gensler’s resignation in January, and much more will contribute to this token’s future rally. XRP Whales Accumulate $830M in 24 Hours In anticipation of the Ripple price rally, the whales have begun accumulating the token. In the last 24 hours alone, whales accumulated 830 million XRP tokens, favoring the price surge in the token. However, there are also volatility issues with the Ripple RLUSD launch, as the demand is persistently high. People have hyped its price as high as $1,200 on DEX in pre-listing due to the supply shortage. With that, the investors questioned whether the Ripple stablecoin would stay pegged to $1 after launch or not. This decision alone will ultimately affect the XRP price. Is RLUSD Going To Change Crypto Transactions? RLUSD is Ripple’s dream to transform cross-border transactions with cryptocurrency. Stabelcoin has been dominating this sector, in which USDC and USDT are superior, but analysts believe Ripple stablecoin could challenge that. The token is going live today, i.e. Tuesday, December 17, with a listing on many crypto exchanges. This Ripple news has activated the whales and investors on the network, as the trading volume is rising high. More importantly, the whales have purchased 830 million XRP in the last 24 hours. As a result, the Ripple stablecoin might push the XRP price to $3 or higher.

Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines as it crosses key milestones, while SUI’s network activity is reaching all-time highs. But one name that’s turning heads is Qubetics ($TICS). Analysts are predicting a massive surge, expecting it to jump to $15 after its mainnet launch. For those seeking significant gains, these altcoins could offer exciting opportunities. Qubetics is shaking up the crypto space by tackling real-world problems through asset tokenization. The current Qubetics presale offers incredible ROI potential and is drawing major investor interest. Let’s break down what makes these three projects stand out. Qubetics Tokenizes Real-World Assets and Targets $15 After Its Mainnet Launch Qubetics ($TICS) is addressing a major gap in traditional investment markets through real-world asset tokenization. By converting tangible assets like real estate, intellectual property, and commodities into digital tokens, Qubetics is creating a faster, more transparent way to unlock liquidity. Businesses and individuals alike benefit from this efficient approach, which removes many of the barriers seen in traditional asset trading. For instance, a $10 million property can be tokenized into digital units, allowing multiple investors to purchase fractional ownership. This process opens real estate opportunities to smaller investors who previously couldn’t participate. Similarly, businesses can tokenize their inventory, reducing red tape and improving cash flow. The Qubetics presale has already seen massive success, with more than 347 million $TICS tokens sold. Over $6.8 million has been raised so far, with over 10,000 token holders on board. Currently, the token is priced at $0.0342, and analysts are confident it could jump to $15 after the mainnet launch, a move that would mean incredible returns for early investors. Each Qubetics presale stage lasts just 7 days and ends every Sunday at 12 AM, with the price increasing by 10% at the end of each stage. This makes it an exciting project to watch for those seeking altcoins with exponential potential. If you’re curious to know more, this video dives deeper into the project. SUI Sees Network Activity and DEX Volume Reaching New Highs SUI, a Layer 1 blockchain optimised for high-speed transactions, has recently seen impressive growth. Its daily DEX (decentralised exchange) volume hit a record $466 million, pushing its total DEX trading volume past $35 billion. This surge reflects growing adoption and increased network activity. The platform’s focus on speed and scalability makes it a favourite among developers and users alike. Analysts have highlighted SUI as one of the best altcoins with 1000X potential, as its ecosystem continues to attract partnerships and new projects. SUI’s price has also seen a steady climb, trading around $4.80 recently, showing gains of about 4% in the last 24 hours. This upward trend signals strong market confidence in the project. As its ecosystem expands, SUI remains one of the most promising altcoins to watch. Bitcoin Continues Its Dominance and Surpasses Key Milestones Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, continues to prove its market dominance. Recently, it surged past $100,000, marking a key milestone driven by institutional demand and regulatory optimism. Analysts point to reduced restrictions and the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs as major drivers behind this rally. Despite some selling pressure at this level, Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains bullish. The introduction of new policies could further solidify Bitcoin’s role as the leading digital store of value. Analysts believe that Bitcoin’s resilience and expanding adoption will continue to support its growth. While it’s the oldest player in the market, Bitcoin remains a critical part of any diversified crypto portfolio, cementing its position as a top contender among the best altcoins with 1000X potential. Conclusion: Exploring the Best Altcoins with 1000X Potential The cryptocurrency market is filled with opportunities for exponential returns, and Qubetics, SUI, and Bitcoin are clear contenders for those seeking substantial gains. Qubetics is innovating through real-world asset tokenization, SUI is capturing attention with its network growth and high trading volumes, and Bitcoin continues to dominate as the market’s cornerstone. Each of these projects brings something unique to the table, catering to investors with different goals. As the crypto market evolves, staying informed and watching these promising altcoins closely could unlock massive opportunities.

37751346,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374935,1734427893,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/37751346.jpeg,"New BTC Peak, Bullish XRP Price Predictions, Pi Network Warning: Bits Recap Dec 17",https://cryptopotato.com/new-btc-peak-bullish-xrp-price-predictions-pi-network-warning-bits-recap-dec-17/,"TL;DR Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new all-time high of almost $108,000. Analysts predict it could climb to $250,000 or even $500,000 this cycle. Ripple’s XRP surged over 130% in a month, trading above $2.50. Market observers set short-term targets between $5.85 and $8.76. Pi Network urged users to rely on official channels and use the verified Pi Wallet. The launch of the open network is pending, with approximately one million verifications left. BTC Hits a New ATH The primary cryptocurrency has been on a tear in the past seven days, registering a price increase of over 10%. Several hours ago, it tapped a new all-time high of almost $108,000. In the following hours, BTC experienced enhanced volatility and eventually stabilized at its current $107,000 (per CoinGecko’s data). BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko It is important to note that the asset’s new peak came shortly after MicroStrategy announced its latest crypto purchase. As CryptoPotato reported , the business intelligence company acquired 15,350 BTC at an average price of $100,386. Its total holdings increased to 439,000 BTC, which , according to ongoing rates, equals nearly $47 billion. Massive purchases of that type leave fewer assets available on the open market, which could potentially result in a price rally (assuming demand stays the same or rises). However, when MicroStrategy disclosed multi-billion Bitcoin purchases the previous two times, BTC’s valuation briefly headed south. The asset’s push toward a new ATH aligns with overall bullish sentiment among popular analysts on X. Jake Gagain said he would be surprised if BTC doesn’t reach $250,000 this cycle , while Michael van de Poppe believes the price could explode to as high as $500,000. XRP Price Forecasts Another leading cryptocurrency that has pumped substantially as of late is Ripple’s XRP. Its price is up over 130% in the past month, currently trading well above $2.50. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Some factors possibly fueling the resurgence include the overall market revival and the upcoming launch of Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD. The product is supposed to go live on many exchanges in the next two days. Among the first to embrace it are Uphold, MoonPay, Bitso, CoinMENA, and more. Many industry participants believe XRP’s latest spike could be just the beginning of a major bull run that has yet to be witnessed . The X users JAVON MARKS recently forecasted a potential price explosion, while Dark Defender set $5.85 and $8.76 as short-term targets. The latter also outlined $2.29, $2.24, $2.10, and $2.02 as major support zones. X user Scofield chipped in , too , advising XRP investors to consider selling their positions once the asset’s valuation climbs to $5. Pi Network Alerts Last but not least, we will conclude with two warnings that came from the controversial cryptocurrency project Pi Network. The team urged users to rely only on information shared on official channels. They provided a dedicated safety page showing all the sources and URL links the community can refer to. The developers also warned people to use only their Pi Wallets in the designated Pi Browser. “Ensure you’re in the correct Pi Wallet, not any fake one, to safeguard your Pi. The authentic Pi Wallet is also visually identified by a purple color in the navigation bar of the Pi Browser with a Pi logo featuring the Core Team apps logo,” the warning reads. Pi Network saw the light of day in 2019, amassing a multi-million community in the following years. However, it has yet to launch its native token and open mainnet, which has created some controversy. According to the team, the open network will see the light of day once 15 million people complete the necessary verifications. Pi News recently claimed that only one million are left to do so. In addition, the Pi Core Team promised to announce the mainnet open roadmap in December, which should provide more clarity on when users will be able to buy and sell Pi tokens. It remains to be seen whether the final weeks of 2024 will bring significant developments or there will be further delays.

37751590,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628761,1734428084,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37751590.jpeg,Former Google CEO Schmidt urges ‘unplugging’ AI systems at certain capabilities,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ex-google-ceo-schmidt-warns-of-ai-power/,"Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has warned artificial intelligence developers to control their development ceiling. He also highlighted the importance of the United States winning the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) race against China. Speaking on ABC News’ This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday, Schmidt cautioned about the potential for AI systems to operate independently and even improve themselves. “ We’re soon going to be able to have computers running on their own, deciding what they want to do ,” Schmidt said. Schmidt: AI shouldn’t be left unchecked Schmidt reiterated the risks of advanced AI developing unchecked, noting that systems capable of self-improvement present a significant danger. “ When the system can self-improve, we need to seriously think about unplugging it ,” the former Google CEO said. When Stephanopoulos asked Schmidt whether such AI systems could counter efforts to shut them down, Schmidt replied, “Well, in theory, we better have somebody with the hand on the plug—metaphorically.” While concerns about AI’s existential risks are growing, some experts argue that such fears are exaggerated. Professor Nick Jennings, vice-provost of research at Imperial College London, is among those dismissing doomsday predictions. Jennings contends that while AI can excel in specific tasks, creating systems with human-like intelligence across diverse areas remains far beyond the current capabilities of scientists. “ Developing AI that performs a singular task very well is achievable, ” Jennings explained. “But building general AI that mirrors human intelligence across multiple subjects is not something we can expect in the near future.” Diverging opinions on AI threats Meanwhile, concerns persist among leading AI researchers who warn of the dangers posed by poorly defined objectives and inadequate safety measures. UC Berkeley professor Stuart Russell and postdoctoral scholar Michael Cohen argue that powerful AI systems could ultimately pose an existential threat to humanity if left unchecked. In an insights paper published in the Science Journal, Russell and Cohen called for stricter oversight of AI development. They emphasized the need for tech companies to prove the safety of their AI systems before releasing them into the market. Without clear objectives and robust safeguards, advanced AI systems could act against human interests, they argue. “ If the objectives of these AIs conflict with those of humans, it could spell disaster, ” Russell and Cohen wrote. They believe tech companies should be held responsible for ensuring the safety of their systems and identifying critical “red lines” that AI should never cross. A growing debate on AI safety The rapid pace of AI advancement has already presented challenges, including the spread of disinformation, societal polarization, and algorithmic bias. Concerns about safety and regulation have yet to keep pace with the technology’s development. Schmidt’s remarks reflect the growing urgency among industry leaders to address these challenges. Experts like Elon Musk have long called for preemptive regulations to mitigate AI risks. Musk, who once described AI as the “biggest risk we face as a civilization,” warned that authorities have done little to address its dangers. Similarly, physicist Stephen Hawking feared that achieving singularity, the point where machines surpass human intelligence could leave humanity unable to control advanced AI systems. In his interview, Hawking argued that without regulations, AI could become “either the best or the worst thing to happen to humanity.” US-China AI competition intensifies Schmidt noted that while the US previously held a lead over China in AI development , the gap has significantly narrowed over the past six months. “ China has caught up in a way that is remarkable, ” he said, describing the current situation as a high-stakes race between the two superpowers. “ There’s a point, maybe in the next year or two, where the systems can begin to do their own research. They’re called AI scientists, as opposed to human scientists. So you go from having 1,000 human scientists to a million AI scientists. I think that increases the slope, and when you’re moving at this pace, it’s very hard for your competitors to catch up, ” he remarked. Schmidt believes the incoming Trump administration will prioritize US competitiveness in AI, which he sees as a positive step. “As long as human values are preserved,” he said, “we should be okay.” A Step-By-Step System To Launching Your Web3 Career and Landing High-Paying Crypto Jobs in 90 Days.",AI|CNY|GOOG|Google|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-17 09:34:44

Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETFs See Steady Inflows, BlackRock Leads Total net inflows for Bitcoin spot ETFs reached $637 million, marking the 13th consecutive day of positive inflows. The largest single-day inflow was recorded by BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, which saw net inflows of $418 million. Ethereum spot ETFs also maintained their momentum with net inflows totaling $51.13 million on the same day. This marks the 16th consecutive day of net inflows for Ethereum-based products. BlackRock’s ETHA ETF led the category with single-day net inflows of $30.72 million. Sustained inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs underscore the growing institutional confidence in crypto investment products as the market heads into 2024. Analysts suggest that the recent influx is driven by optimism surrounding expectations for regulatory clarity, greater adoption of crypto-backed financial products, and a positive macroeconomic environment. BlackRock’s dominance of both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF inflows underscores its influential role in bridging traditional finance and the cryptocurrency sector, further cementing digital assets as a maturing asset class. *This is not investment advice.

Trading support for GOAT and Korean won pairs begin on Dec. 17 at 04:00 UTC. In a recent notice , Bithumb announced that Goatseus Maximus ( GOAT ) will be added to the exchange’s Korean won market starting from Dec. 17 at 04:00 UTC. Deposit and withdrawal for the viral Solana-based meme coin start two hours after the notice was posted. While buying and selling orders are restricted within the first five minutes of trading. Previously, GOAT made its debut on the major crypto exchange OKX on Dec. 12. The token saw a rise in value by 30% after listing on the exchange. However, the same cannot be said about the meme coin’s Bithumb listing. Shortly after the notice was released, the token went up only slightly by nearly 4% before dropping by 1.16% a few hours later. In fact, the meme coin has been going downhill by 0.9% in the past 24 hours of trading. This seemingly contradicts the general consensus, as most tokens experience a boost in value after major crypto exchanges announce their listings. In Goatseus Maximus case, the token has barely moved by much since Bithumb’s listing.

As anticipation builds for the stablecoin’s official launch in a few hours, Ripple has released an official list of supported wallets, further preparing the ecosystem for adoption. The image, shared on X by Chad Steingraber, outlines retail and enterprise wallets compatible with RLUSD. The wallets span two major blockchain networks, including the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum, as Ripple stated in its announcement earlier in the year. OFFICIAL WALLET LIST RELEASED FOR RLUSD! PER RIPPLE // XRP https://t.co/DsLDKKJDRL pic.twitter.com/zDqDEnWx9M — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) December 15, 2024 Supported Wallets for RLUSD Retail wallets on the list include Xumm (Xaman), Torus Wallet, Gem Wallet, Trust Wallet, Ledger, Trezor, MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and MyEtherWallet (MEW). These wallets provide options for users seeking secure storage and easy access to RLUSD for individual transactions. Notably, Gem Wallet, Trust Wallet, Ledger, and Trezor support XRPL and Ethereum, catering to users who prefer multi-chain flexibility. For institutional users, supported enterprise wallets are Ripple Custody, Fireblocks, and BitGo. These wallets are integral for larger-scale transactions and custodial services, ensuring RLUSD’s seamless integration into the operations of financial institutions and enterprises. They also support both XRPL and Ethereum blockchains. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Strategic Importance of the NYDFS Approval In a different post , Steingraber drew attention to Ripple’s acquisition of the New York Charter as part of the company’s acquisition of the Standard Custody and Trust Company. He noted this as a pivotal move, enabling the company to align with the stringent regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuance in the U.S. financial landscape. Steingraber emphasized the significance of this approval, remarking that “no other stablecoin has this.” The timing of the stablecoin’s approval aligns closely with the impending introduction of the U.S. Stablecoin Act, which is expected to impose strict guidelines for stablecoin issuers. Ripple’s proactive approach positions RLUSD to meet these standards, making it a potential leader in the regulated stablecoin space. RLUSD’s Launch With the official wallet list now public, Ripple’s commitment to building a robust infrastructure for RLUSD is becoming clearer. By ensuring compatibility across a diverse range of wallets, Ripple provides accessibility for both retail users and enterprises. This strategic move bolsters user confidence and lays the groundwork for RLUSD’s adoption in cross-border payments and other real-world use cases. However, investors should not move too fast, as Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz recently issued an important warning about the stablecoin’s launch.

Our Pepe price prediction for 2024 is a maximum price of $0.0025 In 2030, we expect the Pepe price to touch $0.0258. The meme coin sector momentarily slows down, hinting at a potential rally if the broader market stabilizes after its recent downturn. Specifically, PEPE coin prices display a bullish pattern, presenting an opportunity for a breakout based on the daily chart analysis. Moreover, the volatility of meme coins is exacerbated by the prevailing market uncertainty. This causes fluctuations in PEPE prices as they oscillate in search of a solid support level to initiate a recovery. Considering investing in Pepe crypto?

The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours.

The hourly price chart confirms that Pepe attempts to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a further recovery rally in the upcoming hours. If Pepe’s price holds momentum above $0.00002508, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.00002882. PEPE/USD chart. Image source: TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.00002238, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00001881. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2024 could potentially propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe down today? Pepe’s price has been declining for over the last few hours as it gained intense selling pressure. The price is aiming for a hold below the $0.00002 mark. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040. Is Pepe a good long-term investment? If Pepe price continues to attract investor interest and lead the meme coin market in the future, we might see a strong long-term future for Pepe coin. Recent news Last week, a newly created wallet unexpectedly withdrew 150 billion PEPE and 60 billion SHIB from Binance, totaling over $4.46 million. These large withdrawals often raise concerns about market sentiment and potential upcoming events for the tokens. PEPE Price Prediction December 2024 PEPE price has been on a bearish rally over the past few days as Bitcoin price is facing intense bearish momentum. However, it made a robust comeback in December. If BTC price records robust surges this month, we might see PEPE price skyrocketing. We expect the PEPE price to record minimum and maximum prices of $0.000015 and $0.000028, respectively. The average price might be around $0.000017. December Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) December 2024 0.000015 0.000017 0.000028 Pepe price prediction 2024 The roadmap for Pepe is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. This lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential, despite its robust community. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2024 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. See also Tezos price prediction 2024-2030: How high can XTZ rise? In 2024, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000015. It may peak at a maximum value of $0.000028, with an average trading price of $0.000017 throughout the year.

Although it has achieved significant hype following its launch and again in February 2024, it remains to be seen if it can establish itself as a long-term cryptocurrency. For 2025, the anticipated minimum price of one Pepe is $0.0033. The maximum price could climb to $0.0038, maintaining an average of $0.0034 over the year. PEPE price forecast for 2026 Pepe must offer tangible value to reach a valuation comparable to Shiba Inu and Dogecoin . For instance, Shiba Inu is developing Shibarium, a layer-two scaling solution on Ethereum , alongside various protocols and tools for its community. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is enhancing tools and libraries that facilitate the integration of $DOGE as a payment option for businesses. According to predictions and technical analysis, Pepe could achieve a minimum price of $0.0048 in 2026. The price may rise to a maximum of $0.0058, with an average expected trading price of $0.0050. Pepe Price Prediction 2027 The forecast for 2027 suggests that Pepe will have a minimum price of $0.0071. The maximum price is projected to be $0.0084, with an average price of $0.0073 throughout the year. Pepe price prediction 2028 By 2028, the lowest predicted price for Pepe is $0.0102. It might reach a maximum price of $0.0122, with the average price expected to be around $0.0105. Pepe price prediction 2029 Based on forecasts and technical analysis, the price of Pepe in 2029 is expected to start at a minimum of $0.0149. It could potentially reach a maximum of $0.0179, with an average trading value of $0.0154. Pepe price prediction 2030 Drawing from deep technical analysis of past PEPE data, the price in 2030 is projected to have a minimum value of $0.0204. The maximum price could reach up to $0.0258, with an average value of $0.0211 throughout the year.

Another prominent event in 2024 could similarly propel Pepe to unprecedented levels. Cryptopolitan predicts that Pepe’s lowest price in 2024 will be $0.000015. The price could reach a high of $0.000028, but the average trading price is expected to remain at $0.000017 throughout the year. We expect the Pepe price to reach a high of $0.000028. Pepe historic price sentiment PEPE price history Initial Market Entry and Early Fluctuations: PEPE was introduced to the open market in May 2023, starting at $0.000001514. It experienced a peak at $0.000008117 in July 2023, followed by a dip to $0.0000006105 shortly after. End of 2023 and Trends in 2024: By the close of 2023, the price of PEPE stabilized at $0.000001335. However, 2024 began with a downward trend, with the price dropping to $0.00001237 by mid-February. Record High in March 2024: Amidst a surge in the memecoin sector, PEPE reached a new all-time high of $0.00001074 on March 14, 2024, but slightly decreased to $0.0000083 by March 21, 2024. In May, the price of Pepe surged exponentially, and a new ATH was formed each week. On 27 May, Pepe price reached a new ATH at $0.00001718. However, the price heavily declined in June as it broke below the crucial level of $0.00001. In July, though the Pepe price touched $0.000012, it failed to maintain its momentum and dropped toward $0.0000093. In August, Pepe’s price dropped toward the $0.0000058 level. However, it is now recovering slightly. In September, the price of Pepe witnessed extreme fluctuation; however, it ended the month on a bullish note as it hit $0.000012. Pepe price experienced an Uptober rally later as it surged toward the high of $0.000012 in October. However, the price is now declining below support channels. In November, the price of Pepe skyrocketed above $0.000026.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|PEPE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-17 09:43:01

Many altcoins have followed suit, including XRP, XLM, and CRO. In Ripple’s case, the asset managed to overcome USDT in terms of market cap once again. BTC Keeps Pumping It was just a week ago when the primary cryptocurrency struggled to maintain its momentum and was pushed south hard on a couple of occasions to $94,400. However, the bulls managed to defend that level and initiated a leg-up that drove the asset to $98,000 on Thursday and beyond $100,000 on Friday. Since then, BTC has predominantly traded within six-digit territory. Moreover, it broke its early December all-time high of $103,800 on Monday by surging past $106,000. After a brief retracement in the afternoon, the cryptocurrency went on the offensive in the evening, and especially during the Tuesday morning Asian trading session, when it exploded to $107.800 to chart its latest peak. Despite losing some ground since then, BTC is still above $107,000. Its market cap has skyrocketed to well above $2.1 trillion, and its dominance over the alts has risen to almost 54% on CG.

This sent the other native token – XRP – soaring immediately, as it pumped from under $2.37 to a multi-day peak of almost $2.6 earlier today. Additionally, XRP has reclaimed the third spot in terms of market cap by surpassing USDT. XLM and CRO are the other notable gainers from the larger-cap alts, surging by 9% and 7%, respectively. ETH is above $4,000 once again after a minor daily increase, similar to those of SOL, BNB, ADA, and AVAX. In contrast, TON and LINK have retraced by around 4% each.

At the center of the fight is the semiconductor industry—a $600 billion sector driving everything from smartphones to artificial intelligence (AI). For the last two years, American chip stocks have been riding a euphoric AI boom. Nvidia, Broadcom, AMD, and Micron are reaping the rewards as artificial intelligence skyrockets demand for advanced chips. The toolmakers that build the machines to produce these chips (Lam Research, Applied Materials, and KLA) have been right there with them. But this is where the AI hype crashes into politics. The Biden administration’s campaign to shut China out of the semiconductor race has created chaos in supply chains, reshaped global sales, and triggered a geopolitical struggle over technology. It started in October 2022 when Washington banned the export of the most advanced chips and manufacturing tools to Chinese companies linked to the government. Then came October 2023 when Washington tightened the rules, closing loopholes and limiting sales to Chinese data centers. Earlier this month, the crackdown went further, pulling US allies into the effort and locking out major Chinese buyers. US chip restrictions hit hard, but China saw it coming The bans have teeth. Chinese companies can’t buy the cutting-edge tools needed to produce high-performance chips. For Beijing, it’s a nightmare. China’s ambitions to lead the world in AI, 5G, and advanced tech depend on these chips. But the US, along with the Netherlands and Japan, has slammed the door shut. Beijing didn’t sit still. Anticipating the bans, Chinese buyers stocked up on older-generation tools throughout 2024. Data shows a massive jump in Chinese purchases of so-called “trailing-edge” equipment—older but still functional technology that can produce less advanced chips. Toolmakers face long-term risk as China pushes for independence There’s another problem. These bans may unintentionally push China to build its own semiconductor industry. For years, China has relied on foreign companies to supply chipmaking tools. Now, locked out of the advanced tech market, Beijing has no choice but to develop its own. Some analysts believe that this could be a long-term threat to US and European toolmakers. But others argue that global demand for chips will keep toolmakers afloat, regardless of geography. For toolmakers, the focus is on meeting global demand, not the politics of where the chips are made. Lam Research CFO Douglas Bettinger confirmed this, saying , “Investment in China this year was pretty very strong.” But he also acknowledged a slowdown ahead. The geopolitical pressure is unlikely to let up. If Trump returns to the White House, his trade policies could escalate tensions even further. Trump’s team of China hawks is ready to revive hardline strategies, and tariffs could be back on the table. Beijing knows this. Xi Jinping has already reached out with messages of cooperation, but he’s also drawn clear lines in the sand. During the November APEC summit, Xi warned Biden against crossing China’s “four red lines”: Taiwan, human rights, China’s political system, and its right to development. The stakes are super high too. Last week, China conducted its largest naval exercises around the Taiwan Strait in 30 years. It was a warning shot. Beijing sees Taiwan as its territory, and any US interference could trigger further retaliation.

With the sluggish price action, a portion of the market participants had turned uncertain about the next price action. However, the latest rise in the prices revives the hopes for a new ATH, which may not be before the end of 2024 but certainly in early 2025 Ethereum is known to closely follow Bitcoin, as it did during the 2021 bull or before. The top two tokens surged with the same intensity, dominating a major portion of the volume and marking new ATH side-by-side. However, the current trade setup and price action suggest the second-largest token may have become independent. One of the major reasons is said to be the spot ETH ETF inflows, which accelerated after the U.S. election results. However, the whales seem to have been preparing for the rise much before, as they constantly increased their positions, which have reached levels not seen since 2017. The data from Santiment shows a rise in wallets that at least hold 100K ETH, which holds 57.35% of the whole Ethereum supply. To be precise, there are 104 whale wallets, holding at least 100K Ethereum. On the other hand, the wallets with ETH holding between 100 and 100K and below 100 were constantly declining and have reached the lowest point at 33.46% & 9.19%, respectively. This flashes a strong bullish signal for the long term, where the whales hold the highest portion of the supply. What’s Next for the ETH Price Rally? When Can We Expect a New ATH? The historic ETH price rally suggests the token is at the stage where BTC was during the start of the quarter. The token broke the consolidation and launched a nearly 60% rise, marking a new ATH very close to $108K. Therefore, if the ETH price replicates a similar breakout, the ATH could be much higher than $5000. The weekly chart of ETH suggests the price has reached the crucial resistance and a rise from these levels may help the token enter the final resistance zone before the ATH. The Ichimoku cloud has turned bullish with the conversion & base line undergoing a bullish crossover, validating the upcoming rise. As per data from Intotheblock, a total of 7.2 million ETH were bought just below $4000, which is expected to stabilize the levels above the range. With this, the Ethereum (ETH) price appears to be poised to launch a massive bullish attack, aiming to form new highs probably before the end of 2024.",Price Analysis|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-17 09:56:41

This could be boosted further by the approval of an Ripple XRP ETF, paving the way for greater institutional involvement in the crypto market . With market conditions shifting, both DTX and XRP could see significant gains. In this article, we will discuss the possible outcomes and what it means for investors and the future of crypto. Crucial SEC Vote on Caroline Crenshaw Could Impact Ripple Lawsuit and XRP Future The vote on SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw’s reappointment is scheduled for Wednesday, December 18, according to Fox Business. Congress will adjourn for the year on Friday, December 20. If Crenshaw is not reappointed, former President Trump could nominate a new Commissioner. Crenshaw’s renomination has received a lot of attention. She is one of the three Democratic Commissioners at the SEC and voted against allowing Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETFs. The SEC also has an important case in the Ripple (XRP) lawsuit. The SEC must file its opening brief for the appeal by January 15. If Crenshaw is reappointed, the three Democrats at the SEC will likely vote to continue with the appeal. This could lead to more selling pressure on XRP, but some investors hope the SEC will eventually drop the appeal. If the SEC does drop the appeal, it could be a big win for Ripple (XRP) and the broader U.S. digital asset market. This would make the court ruling in July 2023, which found that Programmatic Sales of Ripple do not count as securities, even more important. Ripple’s Strong Outlook: XRP ETF, Market Gains, and Big Hopes for DTX Exchange Ripple (XRP) is currently around $1.30, and many people expect an XRP ETF to launch soon. Ripple’s CEO, Garlinghouse, believes an XRP ETF in the US is likely, especially after the Bitwise Physical XRP ETF was launched for European investors. The news about RLUSD being approved is still spreading, and investors are preparing for more updates. XRP’s price increased by 3% over the week, but its market volume dropped by 23%, now at $9.13 billion. Ripple is becoming one of the most promising cryptocurrencies this year, with more developments and use cases. Many investors who made gains from XRP are now putting their money into the new DTX Exchange ICO, hoping for big returns, with some expecting a 1000x growth by Q1 2025. DTX Exchange: A Leading Presale Token of the Year DTX Exchange (DTX) is the most popular presale token this year. It is built on a strong and creative platform that offers many features, such as the non-custodial Phoenix Wallet, 1000x leverage, and the VulcanX hybrid blockchain. These features make DTX Exchange a powerful player in the crypto trading world. DTX Exchange combines the best parts of centralized and decentralized exchanges, giving users the advantages of both. Key Features The platform is designed to be easy to use and includes privacy features like a no-KYC registration process. This makes it ideal for investors who want to trade without revealing their identities. Hybrid Trading Platform: Powered by the VulcanX blockchain, combining features of both centralized and decentralized exchanges for a smooth trading experience. Wide Asset Access: Offers 120,000 assets, including stocks, forex, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies, allowing investors to manage all their trading in one place. Increased Visibility: Listing on CoinMarketCap has boosted DTX’s visibility and credibility, helping the Ethereum-based altcoin gain traction. Strong Early Success: DTX Exchange’s presale has raised over $10.3 million with more than 300,000 registered wallet addresses. Future Growth Potential: Analysts predict that the Ethereum altcoin could 50x in the long run. DTX is currently in Stage 6 of its public presale, priced at $0.12. This offers a 500% ROI for early buyers who purchased it at $0.02. Additionally, Stage 6 buyers will receive a 67% return after the presale cryptocurrency is listed on major markets at $0.20.

What Historical HODLer Selloff Pattern Says,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-top-historical-hodler-selloff-pattern-says/,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin long-term holders are selling. Here’s whether the current level of selloff is enough for a price top or not. Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Been Selling Big Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about the historical trend in the holdings of the long-term holders relative to the Bitcoin top. The “long-term holders” (LTHs) refer to the BTC investors who have been holding onto their coins for more than 155 days. The LTHs represent one of the two main divisions of the BTC market done on the basis of holding time, with the other group being known as the short-term holders (STHs). Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Now In Selling Mode For A Year: Should You Be Concerned? Historically, the latter cohort has proven to contain the weak hands of the market, while the former is made up of the HODLers who barely react to rallies and crashes in the price. As such, selling from the STHs is usually not of any note, but that from the LTHs can be, as it’s not a particularly common event. One way to keep track of the behavior of the diamond hands is through their Net Position Change. The Net Position Change is an on-chain metric that measures the total amount of Bitcoin entering into or exiting out of the LTH cohort. Below is the chart for the indicator shared by the analyst that shows the trend in its value over the history of the cryptocurrency. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin LTH Net Position Change has witnessed a sharp decline into the negative territory in recent weeks, which implies a net amount of supply has been leaving the cohort. This isn’t the first time this year that the indicator has shown this trend, as something similar was also observed back during the first quarter of this year. In the chart, Martinez has highlighted this and the other older instances of this trend occurring. It would seem that the major selloffs from the LTHs have generally coincided with some sort of top in the cryptocurrency. “Interestingly, in 2017 and 2021, their biggest sell-offs occurred right before the final leg up,” notes the analyst.

Thus, if the current bull market is going to show anything similar, then it’s possible that the current LTH selloff may in fact only be the start of that final leg up that’s going to lead to the cyclical top for Bitcoin. The indicator is also currently not as negative as during the largest red spikes of the 2017 and 2021 bull runs, which could be another indication that the top isn’t in just yet. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the same pattern would repeat this time as well or not.

Here’s the Benefit,https://timestabloid.com/top-shareholder-calls-sbi-holdings-to-initiate-xrp-buyback-heres-the-benefit/,"In a significant development for the cryptocurrency and financial sectors, GAM Global Special Situations Fund, a Swiss independent investment manager, has called upon SBI Holdings, a key Japanese financial group, to adopt a transparent and active approach toward its blockchain and XRP-related investments. Crypto Eri (@sentosumosaba), a prominent crypto figure, shared GAM’s open letter on X. The letter, dated December 3, 2024, suggests an XRP buyback program as part of a broader strategy to align SBI’s market value with its net asset value (NAV). Recommendations for SBI The letter emphasizes that SBI Holdings is undervalued, highlighting that its XRP holdings alone are valued at JPY 1.6 trillion, surpassing the company’s entire market capitalization of JPY 1.2 trillion. GAM suggests a strategy similar to MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-focused approach in the U.S. that could significantly boost SBI’s market perception and shareholder value. The fund managers also argue that clearer communication about XRP holdings and strategic actions like a buyback program, could close the gap between SBI’s market value and net asset value, estimated at JPY 3.9 trillion. GAM also calls for increased transparency, including regular updates on the value of SBI’s XRP holdings and a detailed outline of its blockchain strategy. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 SBI Japan’s Relationship with XRP SBI Japan has long been a staunch advocate of Ripple and XRP as an investor and partner in various blockchain initiatives. SBI Remit, a subsidiary of the crypto-focused SBI branch in Japan SBI VC Trade, has adopted XRP as a bridge currency for its remittance services in The Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia. The company has also shown support for XRP multiple times. Given this background, the proposal from GAM Investments aligns closely with SBI’s historical support for Ripple’s ecosystem. However, it also represents a bold step forward, as an extensive XRP buyback program would signal an even deeper commitment to the asset’s role in SBI’s overall corporate strategy. Potential Implications for XRP If SBI Japan proceeds with an XRP buyback program, the impact on the token’s market dynamics could be significant. Such a move would likely increase demand for XRP, potentially driving up its market price. Furthermore, SBI’s public endorsement of XRP through a high-profile investment would reinforce the asset’s credibility in the eyes of institutional investors. Additionally, this strategy could lead to broader adoption of XRP in financial markets, as it would highlight its value proposition as a powerful digital asset for cross-border transactions. This would align with Ripple’s ongoing efforts to position XRP as a key player in global remittance and liquidity solutions.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/the-founder-of-this-altcoin-purchased-a-lot-of-his-own-altcoin-here-are-the-details/,"Michael Egorov, founder of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Curve Finance, has conducted a large-scale CRV token buyback for the first time since the June 13 liquidation, according to on-chain data analytics platform Spot On Chain. Curve Finance Founder Michael Egorov Purchases $1.2 Million in CRV Tokens Following June Termination Egorov reportedly purchased 1.08 million CRV tokens at an average price of $1,114 over the past three hours, bringing the total value to around $1.2 million. This marks a notable move for the Curve founder following the events of June 13, when Egorov faced a series of forced liquidations due to his heavy debt positions in various lending protocols. The incident has raised concerns in the DeFi space as CRV’s price volatility threatens broader market stability. CRV, Curve Finance’s native governance token, is a critical asset within the DeFi ecosystem, serving as the backbone for liquidity pools and incentives in the protocol. Egorov’s recent purchase signals renewed confidence in CRV and Curve Finance’s long-term outlook. The buyback comes amid an ongoing recovery in the broader cryptocurrency market, with analysts closely monitoring CRV’s price action and market activity for potential shifts in investor sentiment. Market participants will now observe whether Egorov’s strategic move will help stabilize CRV’s price or generate more interest in the token as DeFi platforms continue their resurgence. *This is not investment advice.

The seemingly random hauls have all been connected to the Last Pass data breach, potentially exposing multiple wallets. ZachXBT reported a total of $5.36M taken from personal wallets containing Bitcoin and assets from the Ethereum ecosystem. All the seemingly random addresses had one thing in common – using Last Pass as their password storage and protection. After a data leak in 2022, the list of wallets turned out to be compromised. ZachXBT also identified the attackers as a cohesive entity, the ‘Last Pass threat actor’. The attackers had a similar approach of draining the wallets, then immediately swapped through instant exchanges for Ethereum and Bitcoin. The attack affected multiple tokens, but the hackers were trying to simplify their holdings. Last Pass victims face another round of wallet attacks Apparently, some of the wallet owners also stored private keys on the service, leaking direct access to the wallets. The actual attack happened long after the data leak, and there may be more wallets that are potentially exposed, but not drained yet. The recent batch of drained wallets includes crypto influencers with ENS names, as well as active DEX and DeFi users. Despite being experienced, the exposed addresses led to total losses. Wallets automated to receive funds or rewards from smart contracts may be especially at risk. In one of the cases, the funds received came from an OpenSea user, potentially from the sale of an NFT. In this case, the receiving wallet may be automated and already linked to the NFT marketplace. The wallet was drained soon after that, with the funds sent directly for an anonymous swap. More than 40 addresses in total were drained to date. In some cases, the addresses show evidence of being watched, as the draining happened right after a recent deposit of funds. Some of the wallets received funds from exchanges for storage or as intermediate holding, and were drained within a short time after the incoming transaction. ZachXBT had already tracked an earlier batch of 22 addresses, with losses exceeding $6.2M even at the earlier stage of the bull market. Other on-chain researchers have also sounded the alarm on potentially exposed wallets. It’s been 2 years since Path sounded the alarm. Since then we’ve investigated thousands of these thefts. Including 2 more in the last few hours. Please migrate your funds to fresh wallets if you’ve used LastPass. Please tell your friends. Please. Begging you. 🙏 https://t.co/5xd5oYxbwb — Tay 💖 (@tayvano_) December 16, 2024 The only solution for users is to abandon all potentially exposed wallets. The risk remains for anyone using Last Pass before the exploit in 2022. All funds must be moved to new addresses, as the old ones are already monitored for incoming transactions. The latest wallet attack follows a previous batch of wallets linked to Last Pass data. In October 2023, a total of 25 wallets were drained of $4.4M worth of digital coins and tokens. As previously reported, some of the wallets had substantial funds and belonged to crypto insiders, even VCs and DeFi developers. The previous hack did not alert all wallet owners exposed to Last Pass. ZachXBT has previously warned about potentially exposed wallets, though the hackers still managed to attack more accounts. Hacks sent straight to exchanges Unlike other hacking attempts, the wallets were drained directly onto exchange accounts. This suggests the hacker had full control and decided to trade the funds as a way of concealing them. In one case, a wallet was drained of 15 ETH, which were sent directly to a swapping address. Another wallet lost 32 ETH, which was sent to the FixedFloat hot wallet. The exchange was used for other wallets as well. The exchange itself is not affected and is completely neutral to the hack. However, the DEX is a regular target for hackers, used to transform funds and cover their tracks. Previously, analysts have tracked funds from an attack against Rocket Pool to the same DEX. FixedFloat offers a simplified swap service with relatively high fees, without requiring an account or KYC. The exchange itself has been a target of hackers, when it was exploited in March for $26M in ETH and BTC.

The crypto exchange announced that these services won’t be available anytime after January 8, 2025, however, noting that it remains committed to adhering to the recent regulatory developments. Bybit Users In France Need to Withdraw Before January 8 Crypto exchange Bybit has asked all of its users in France to withdraw their funds as it plans to close down service in the country. Thus, the exchange has set a January 8 deadline which is less than a month from now. The recent decision comes after the crypto exchange halted buying and selling digital asset services earlier in August 2024. Bybit has urged French nationals and residents to withdraw their assets before the deadline. After January 8, accounts holding 10 USDC or less will incur a 10 USDC fee and be closed. For users with assets exceeding 10 USDC, Bybit will transfer the remaining funds to Coinhouse , a regulated French crypto-asset platform, which will facilitate subsequent withdrawals. Bybit has a strong presence in Europe and is among the top crypto exchanges in Germany and the Netherlands. It is also the second-largest crypto trading platform worldwide by trading volumes, after Binance, with a presence in nearly 120 countries. Apart from France, the exchange has been facing regulatory challenges across other regions as well. Two weeks ago, Japan’s top financial regulator – Financial Services Agency (FSA) – accused Bybit and other crypto exchanges of violating the country’s crypto regulations. Next Steps for Users Crypto exchange Bybit has shared what are the next steps that its users in France should take. As said, for users holding 10 USDC or less, the exchange will deduct a 10 USDC termination fee and will close the account thereafter. For users with assets above 10 USDC, funds will be converted into USDC at the prevailing rate and transferred to Coinhouse, a regulated French crypto-asset platform. Custody fees will apply after initiating the transfers. Note that during the transfer process between January 8 and January 16, withdrawals will be unavailable. Apart from Bybit, other players have also been facing hurdles to continue operations in France. After strong betting in US elections, prediction platform Polymarket also faces resistance from French regulators.

In a post on Saturday, December 14, Selkis targeted the two prominent Layer 1 blockchain ecosystems, dismissing their relevance and implying that they lack substantial users. This criticism comes amid longstanding tensions between Selkis and supporters of XRP Ledger and Cardano, which are often the subject of debate in the broader crypto community despite being among the most established Layer 1 networks. Ripple, XRP, and Controversy The latest remarks follow backlash that Selkis received earlier on the same day for comments directed at Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty and the broader XRP community. Responding to a post featuring Alderoty with former Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, Selkis sought to challenge any suggestion of Ripple’s strong connections with Donald Trump’s political network. In his post, Selkis described XRP as “a piece of shit” and referred to Ripple as “the drowning victim of crypto,” further stoking tensions with the blockchain’s supporters. Selkis’ attacks against XRP are not new. Over the years, he has criticized the network, labeling it a centralized blockchain. He argues that XRP primarily benefits Ripple insiders and has stated that Ripple’s association with political figures, particularly from the Trump administration, poses risks to the broader crypto industry. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Cardano Excluded from Messari’s Report Cardano, another target of Selkis’ criticism, has faced similar dismissive comments from the Messari co-founder. The rift between Selkis and the Cardano community intensified in recent months after the network was excluded from Messari’s widely circulated Crypto Theses 2024 report. This 200-page document, which highlights trends and projects of economic significance, omitted Cardano because it did not meet Messari’s benchmark for economic activity. The decision drew strong reactions from the Cardano community, which pushed back on Selkis’ claims that the network lacked meaningful utility or user engagement. Critics highlighted recent data to counter his arguments. For instance, a community note posted on X emphasized that on December 12, Cardano processed over 280,000 transactions—roughly 20% to 60% of the daily transaction volume of Bitcoin and Ethereum—despite having only a fraction of their market capitalization. Despite Selkis’ repeated criticisms, the XRP Ledger and Cardano remain key players in the Layer 1 blockchain landscape. Supporters of both networks continue to highlight their unique attributes and progress, even as debates around their adoption and value persist. Selkis’ remarks reflect broader disagreements within the crypto space regarding the purpose, utility, and future of various blockchain projects. While the Messari co-founder maintains his stance, recent transaction data and network activity suggest that XRP and Cardano are far from inactive, as their communities challenge detractors.

Regulation 28 CFR 9.8(c) allows the government to prioritize its claim on forfeited assets over victim restitution, often leaving defrauded investors with little or nothing, according to a recent report from Bloomberg Law . The regulation, which took effect in 1997, contradicts the spirit of the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA) of 1996, which primarily aims to ensure victims of federal crimes are “made whole” by fully compensating them for their losses. Regulation 28 CFR 9.8(c) Limits Value of Lost Funds Under 28 CFR 9.8(c), the amount that can be restored to victims from forfeited funds is limited to the value of the property on the date of loss, ignoring any appreciation that may have occurred since the crime. This distinction is especially significant in the volatile world of cryptocurrency, where values can skyrocket in a short period. For example, the value of Bitcoin surged more than 1,200% in the past five years, and Ethereum’s value soared over 2,400%. Given this market dynamism, the difference between the value of stolen crypto at the time of theft and its value at sentencing can be staggering. Victims who lose 10 Bitcoin in a theft could see its value double or triple by the time of sentencing, but under current DOJ rules, they would only be compensated for the value at the time of theft. The 28 CFR 9.8(c) regulation remains despite the vast impact of crypto fraud. The FBI’s 2023 cryptocurrency fraud report revealed over 69,000 complaints, with total losses exceeding $5.6 billion. Seniors over the age of 60 were disproportionately affected. Yet, even when fraudsters are caught and their crypto assets seized, the government’s claim on these funds takes precedence over victim restitution. The report noted that federal forfeiture and victim restitution serve distinct purposes. Forfeiture is intended to punish criminals by seizing the proceeds of their crimes, while restitution aims to compensate victims for their financial losses. To bridge this gap, the DOJ’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section can use a process called “restoration” to return forfeited assets to victims. However, the 28 CFR 9.8(c) regulation restricts the amount that can be restored to the value at the time of loss, ignoring any appreciation in the stolen property’s value. FTX Creditors Miss Out on Bitcoin Rally Last month, a Delaware judge approved FTX’s reorganization plan , which involves paying out more than $14 billion to customers of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange. According to the plan approved by Delaware bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey, 98% of FTX’s creditors will get 119% of the amount of their allowed claim as of November 2022. #FTX to start distributing $16 BILLION to creditors 60 days after the record date of January 3rd.

At this point, SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci spoke to the Wall Street Journal and explained his expectations for 2025 and his BTC price forecast. Sacramucci, a former advisor to Donald Trump, has made a bold prediction for Bitcoin, stating that the BTC price could skyrocket to $200,000 by 2025. Scaramucci said he believes the BTC price could double due to crypto-friendly policies in the US and the Trump influence. Scaramucci also predicted that China, known for its strict bans on Bitcoin, will re-enter the Bitcoin market by the end of 2025. The famous name added that China's return to Bitcoin could include adding Bitcoin to its reserve assets and legalizing mining.

Memecoins have increased Solana's transaction volume and liquidity, but this activity is unsustainable and could lead to market corrections. Solana's valuation metrics suggest it trades at a premium, with much recent activity tied to speculative memecoin trading rather than long-term use cases. Investors should approach Solana with caution, considering gradual dollar-cost averaging out as the memecoin hype fades to mitigate potential risks. This article was co-produced with NoticeTrades (Nick Thomas). As many of my readers know, my son and I recently co-produced an article titled, “Bitcoin Hits $100,000: What Intelligent Investors Do?” It just so happened that this article received over 350 comments, validating the interest in bitcoin. Furthermore, many of you know me on Seeking Alpha for my experience as a dividend investor, much like my son (Nick Thomas) who has a circle of competence in crypto technology. So, without further ado, let's take a closer look at Solana USD ( SOL-USD ), a cryptocurrency named after a small southern California coastal city. SOL launched in 2017 and has become a popular crypto with a market cap of over $103 Billion (263% YOY return). Is Solana “Overvalued”? A Look at Memecoins and Market Psychology Solana the past few months has been making headlines for its major price recovery and network activity, driven in part by the rise of memecoins. While this surge has revitalized interest in Solana, there’s a debate about whether the recent rally has pushed its valuation beyond its intrinsic value. I want to discuss why some argue that Solana might currently be overvalued, with a particular focus on the role of memecoins and the psychological factors influencing the market. The Role of Memecoins in Solana’s Recent Rally Memecoins, such as Bonk ( BONK-USD ), have contributed significantly to Solana’s rise in price. These coins bring short-term excitement and speculative activity, but they lack utility or a sustainable value proposition. Here are some key factors that are currently in play: Transaction Volume Spike : Memecoins generate high transaction volumes, increasing Solana’s network activity. This creates the perception of a thriving ecosystem, which can attract investors. Speculative FOMO : Retail traders looking for quick profits often flock to ecosystems with trending memecoins, driving up demand for the underlying blockchain’s native token. Short-Term Liquidity Inflows : The hype around memecoins can temporarily boost liquidity and market capitalization, but this surge is usually unsustainable, leading to eventual corrections. SOL Chart Reasons Why Solana May Be Overvalued 1. Unsustainable Activity Driven by Hype While the volume on Solana has increased, much of it is tied to speculative trading of memecoins rather than long-term use cases like DeFi, and enterprise adoption. Once the hype subsides, network activity could decline, exposing gaps between Solana’s valuation and its real utility. Defillama (Volume vs Transaction) 2. Over-Reliance on Retail Investors The recent rally has been fueled largely by retail traders, who are typically driven by emotional decision-making rather than fundamental analysis. This reliance on retail-driven speculation creates a fragile market structure, vulnerable to sharp corrections when sentiment shifts. 3. Perceived “Community Revival” May Be Overblown After the FTX collapse, Solana’s reputation and ecosystem faced significant challenges. The memecoin rally has helped to revive community interest, but it may overshadow deeper concerns, such as the concentration of developer activity or competition from other Layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and Avax ( AVAX-USD ). The narrative of a “revival” might be overstated in terms of long-term growth. 4. Valuation Metrics Key valuation metrics, such as price-to-transaction ratios or TVL (Total Value Locked) compared to market cap, might suggest that Solana is trading at a premium. If the majority of recent activity is tied to memecoins, these metrics could be artificially inflated, giving the appearance of a more robust ecosystem than what fundamentally exists. DefiLlama (Price-Transaction Ratio) Psychological Factors Driving Overvaluation Stock Images 1. The Bandwagon Effect When traders see Solana’s price rallying, many jump on the bandwagon, fearing they’ll miss out on gains. This herd mentality amplifies price movements, often pushing assets beyond their fair value. 2. Recency Bias The market tends to focus on recent events, such as the success of BONK or other memecoins, rather than Solana’s broader ecosystem struggles. This short-term focus skews investor perceptions, making the network appear more valuable than it may be over the long run. 3. Overconfidence and Euphoria As prices rise, traders often become overly optimistic, believing the trend will continue indefinitely. This euphoria can inflate valuations as buyers ignore risks or fail to consider potential downside scenarios. 4. Narrative Investing The story of Solana’s “comeback” after the FTX collapse has captivated the market, grabbing attention from traders who are naturally drawn to a good redemption arc. Narratives like this often influence investment decisions far more than fundamentals, especially in a space like crypto where hype can dominate. But the reality is that these stories are fragile and can shift quickly, leaving investors exposed if the underlying fundamentals don’t support the momentum. Balancing the Argument It’s important to note that Solana does have legitimate long-term use cases. Its high throughput, low transaction costs, and vibrant developer community make it a strong competitor in the blockchain space. However, the current valuation may be pricing in future success prematurely, especially if much of the activity is tied to speculative memecoin trading, which is a loser's game, just like the casino. Deposit Photos Conclusion While Solana’s recent rally has been impressive, it’s crucial to approach the current market dynamics with caution. Memecoins have played a significant role in driving speculative activity, but their long-term impact on Solana’s ecosystem remains uncertain. Coupled with psychological factors like FOMO, recency bias, and overconfidence, there’s a valid argument that Solana could be overvalued in the short to midterm. With that in mind, gradually dollar-cost averaging (“DCA”) out as the memecoin craze begins to slow might not be a bad strategy. If we start to see a broader market correction, based on the data presented, SOL-USD could be among the assets most impacted. This isn’t meant to scare investors, but rather to provide a balanced perspective. By looking at the other side of the coin, it’s easier to identify the potential risks at current prices using the data discussed above. As always, investors and traders should focus on the fundamentals and be wary of hype-driven markets. The long-term success of Solana USD will depend on its ability to sustain meaningful use cases and grow its ecosystem beyond the temporary excitement of memecoins. Resources Baker, M., & Wurgler, J.

Following a significant yearly peak of $0.47 last month, the cryptocurrency is currently trading in the $0.40 range.

Significant whale activity and bullish market sentiment have contributed to the enthusiasm surrounding Dogecoin, particularly in the wake of recent political events, such as Donald Trump’s re-election. Dogecoin: Present Market Conditions There are numerous factors that have contributed to the recent increase in the price of Dogecoin. The investment from large holders, or “whales,” has been substantial, with an estimated $160 million worth of DOGE purchased in the past 24 hours. This is particularly noteworthy. This accumulation indicates a high level of confidence in the asset’s future performance.

Even though there was a 4.30% drop in the last month, a lot of experts believe that this phase of stability will end with a big break. The way prices are moving now is a lot like how they were moving in 2021, when Dogecoin prices went through similar events that made them stable. Bullish Outlook Backed By Technical Indicators Based on Fibonacci retracement, Dogecoin could climb 85% from its current price level by January 2025. If this comes to fruition, this rally would lift the price of the memecoin to around $0.75, putting it within the coveted $1 mark. The RSI has recently entered overbought territory. This condition frequently precedes substantial price fluctuations, whether upward or downward; nevertheless, historical evidence indicates that such signals have resulted in favorable trends for the memecoin. Additionally, analysts have underscored the significance of critical resistance levels at $0.50 and its previous all-time high of $0.7376. If DOGE is able to surmount these levels, it may facilitate the attainment of the anticipated target of $0.75.

A global standard means that crypto will be recognized everywhere, but is this move a necessary step for crypto adoption? Or does it undermine the very principles on which cryptocurrencies were built? Cryptocurrencies have long existed outside the mainstream financial system, with their decentralized, peer-to-peer models offering a stark contrast to the traditional, centralized banking system. However, as these assets evolve, there’s a growing interest in integrating them into global financial infrastructures. Financial authorities seem to agree that the best way for traditional financial institutions to find it easy to adopt cryptos is to employ a regulatory standard, which led to the ISO 20022. The basics of ISO 20022 ISO 20022 is a financial messaging standard designed to provide a secure and standardized way for organizations to exchange financial information. It was introduced by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to replace the outdated SWIFT system used by banks and financial institutions for global payments. While the standard was initially developed for traditional finance, its potential to serve the evolving digital currency market is now being explored . A key issue that ISO 20022 seeks to address is the lack of Digital Token Identifiers (DTIs), which are crucial for distinguishing between different digital currencies. Unlike fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar or the euro, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash lack universally recognized identifiers, making them difficult for banks to track and process. For example, while a bank’s system can easily identify transactions involving USD or AUD, it struggles to differentiate between transactions involving Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. ISO 20022 proposes a solution by introducing a standardized language for digital currencies. This will make it easier for financial institutions to facilitate cross-border payments involving cryptocurrencies. This global standard promises to improve efficiency and reduce errors while ensuring better regulatory compliance, transparency, and fraud protection. Cryptocurrencies adopting ISO 20022 As reported by Cryptopolitan, cryptocurrencies that have embraced the standard include XRP, Stellar, Quant, Hedera, IOTA, XDC, Cardano, and Algorand. These tokens now benefit from a higher degree of interoperability with traditional financial institutions. According to economists, the inclusion of these tokens in the ISO 20022 compliant list positions them as legitimate players in the global financial system, able to communicate seamlessly with banks and other financial organizations. For financial institutions, ISO 20022 compliance means more than just a technical upgrade. It enables seamless communication and ensures compliance with tightening global regulations. As most financial authorities are increasingly cracking down on the cryptocurrency industry, the ability to meet regulatory standards and provide detailed reporting is an imperative selling point. Cryptocurrencies that are ISO 20022 compliant have an edge in this regard, as the protocol’s rich data capabilities help institutions better track and report transactions. Feasibility of applying ISO 20022 to tokens The adoption of ISO 20022 by cryptocurrencies isn’t as straightforward as some may believe. While companies can adhere to the ISO 20022 standard, it doesn’t mean that the blockchain or the token itself is inherently compliant. This distinction is important because, at the protocol level, many cryptocurrencies still operate outside the scope of ISO 20022. The system doesn’t automatically recognize digital tokens as compliant, so companies and projects must voluntarily integrate these standards into their systems. ISO 20022’s role is primarily in the messaging layer rather than in altering digital currencies’ fundamental blockchain structure. This means that while ISO 20022-compliant cryptocurrencies can communicate more seamlessly with traditional financial networks, their underlying decentralized nature remains unchanged. ISO 20022 is an international standard for electronic data interchange between financial institutions and XRP is a digital asset that aligns with these standards.

For developers, complying with the protocol is a complex process. The importance of ISO 20022 for crypto adoption ISO 20022 compliance could play a crucial role in advancing crypto adoption, but it’s not a panacea. The integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial networks offers benefits that can’t be ignored. So if you don’t know about #ISO20022 recommend DYOR time is ticking and eventually very soon the average person will not be able to afford them I’m just a messenger carry on about the drones but don’t say I ain’t warn you $XRP $XLM $XDC $ALGO $IOTA $HBAR pic.twitter.com/cTQQB4lg5X — Trump’sBlackNephew🐸 (@45sBullishAnon) December 16, 2024 Chief among the perks is the legitimacy ISO 20022 brings to the tokens that adopt it. When cryptocurrencies adhere to a globally recognized standard, they’re no longer seen as fringe or rogue entities but as legitimate assets capable of participating in the global financial system. This sense of legitimacy could go a long way in reducing the skepticism surrounding cryptocurrencies, especially among institutional investors. The transition from a decentralized, unregulated space to one that operates within recognized financial frameworks has the potential to foster trust ; a key barrier to widespread adoption. “ We need to take the standards we have today and update them to ensure interoperability across countries’ recognized digital currency systems. This will be the first step towards universal acceptance. Trust is paramount: without that, all the technology in the world is not going to provide the answer ,” said retired Chairman of the Central Intelligence Agency Cryptographic Center Edward Scheidt. Yet, the very concept of ISO 20022 raises fundamental questions about the essence of cryptocurrency. Many early crypto adopters sought to create a system that operated outside of traditional financial institutions. The desire for decentralization and self-governance was central to the creation of Bitcoin and similar projects. To some crypto enthusiasts, the adoption of a globally recognized standard like ISO 20022 may seem like a step backward. It may undermine the decentralized ethos that cryptocurrencies were designed to uphold. Will ISO 20022 affect the price of compliant coins? Another important question surrounding ISO 20022 compliance is whether it will have a measurable impact on the price of compliant cryptocurrencies. The answer is far from straightforward, but the evidence suggests that it could influence the value of these coins, particularly in terms of mainstream acceptance. As cryptocurrencies become more integrated into the global financial system, the perceived stability and security of compliant tokens may make them more attractive to institutional investors. ISO 20022 compliance is expected to reduce the risks associated with digital assets, making them more appealing to larger financial players. This could, in turn, drive up demand for compliant tokens, potentially boosting their value. However, it’s worth noting that the broader cryptocurrency market operates on sentiment, and various factors contribute to price fluctuations. While compliance with ISO 20022 may enhance the credibility of certain cryptocurrencies, it’s unlikely to be a “big” factor in driving their price movements. The current ISO 20022 compliant coins’ prices were not significantly affected when they were first listed, so it could be reaching for the stars to think it will affect their values in the long term. ISO 20022: Crypto’s adoption and the future of decentralization ISO 20022 compliance offers a promising pathway for cryptocurrencies seeking integration into the global financial system. The standard’s potential to bring legitimacy, regulatory compliance, and enhanced transparency to the crypto market cannot be denied. However, the adoption of this protocol raises important questions about the future of decentralized finance. For now, it remains clear that ISO 20022 compliance isn’t an all-or-nothing proposition. While it offers tangible benefits to the cryptocurrencies that adopt it, it also serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle between crypto’s founding principles and its integration into the global financial system. The journey toward broader adoption will require both financial regulators and crypto developers to carefully consider the benefits and the philosophical forces at play.

This uptrend followed by consoldiation coincides with accumulation by large investors and spike in active addresses, hinting at another leg up. AAVE Price Soars By 420% AAVE has emerged as one of the best-performing DeFi tokens recently as it approached the crucial resistance at $400. It soared by 420% from its lowest level in April, pushing its valuation to over $5.6 billion and making it the 27th biggest coin. AAVE’s recent rally accelerated after Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial selected it as a service provider . WLFI has also become a big investor in AAVE tokens after buying 6,137 tokens valued at $2.28 million. This purchase is a big deal because WLFI is associated with Trump and his family members. AAVE price has also jumped as the total value in its ecosystem has jumped to a record high in US dollar and ETH terms. According to DeFi Llama , AAVE has over $23.2 billion in assets, much higher than the year-to-date low of $7.53 billion. Its TVL in ETH terms has jumped to 5.8 million ETH tokens, a trend that may continue. AAVE’s Active Addresses Spike More data shows that the total active addresses on AAVE has continued rising. The increase happened as investors embraced Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) as the token rallied. According to IntoTheBlock , the total addresses with balance has risen to over 166,000, higher than July’s low of 160,000. More data from the site shows that the number of large transactions rose to 828 on December 16, the highest level since Dec. 12. This growth is a sign that investors are getting more bullish on the AAVE crypto token. AAVE Balances AAVE Technical Analysis: Is New ATH Next? The AAVE token rallied for five straight weeks. It moved above several important resistance levels, including the psychological point at $300. Also, the coin rose above $152.68, its highest swing on March 11. AAVE has found a resistance at the strong pivot reverse point of the Murrey Math Lines at $375. It has also remained above the 50-week and 25-week moving average. Therefore, the value of AAVE coin will likely rise to the key resistance at $460, its highest swing in October 2021, and consolidate. Odds are that it will form a bullish flag or pennant pattern, a popular continuation sign. If this happens, the coin will ultimately rise to $667, its all-time high, which is about 80% above the current level. AAVE Price Chart The bullish view will be confirmed if the AAVE price rises above the resistance at $460. A drop below the major S&R level at $250 will invalidate the bullish view.

Notably, the MP said that Europe should follow the US and make Bitcoin a strategic reserve for the nation. She also criticized the EU’s digital euro, while backing investment into BTC. Meanwhile, this comes amid a global shift towards Bitcoin, with a flurry of countries and institutions increasing their focus on the digital asset. Bitcoin News: Europe Calls For Bitcoin Strategic Reserve The global race for crypto supremacy is evidenced by the recent developments among the nations. Notably, the competition appears to have started after Donald Trump’s election win and his active support for the digital assets space, especially Bitcoin. In addition, he has also recently reiterated his stance to make BTC the US Strategic Reserve. These developments have fueled a rally in BTC price , sending it to its ATH recently. Amid this, a recent Bitcoin Archive report showed that a European MP called for Bitcoin Strategic Reserve for Europe in a recent parliament speech. The MP has lauded El Salvador’s move to invest heavily in BTC over the past few years. She noted that while the Salvador President was criticized initially for such a move, the current holdings showed an added value of over 100%. While backing El Salvador’s BTC investment strategy, she has criticized the European Central Bank’s plan to impose a digital Euro. She said that rather than imposing the Digital Euro, Europe should focus on financial freedom by investing in Bitcoin. In addition, she also said that the EU should consider making Bitcoin a national strategic reserve like the US. BTC Gains Attention Globally Bitcoin has been on the investors’ radar lately, as evidenced by its robust rally recently. On the other hand, the robust inflow into US Spot Bitcoin ETF also indicates the growing institutional interest in the asset. Besides, Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy has continued its BTC buying despite the price creating new records every day. Meanwhile, a flurry of other countries like Japan, Bhutan, and others, are also shifting their focus towards crypto adoption. Having said that, it appears that crypto’s appeal is witnessing a massive surge among global leaders. Considering all these aspects, the market experts also remained bullish on the future trajectory of BTC. For context, in a recent X post, veteran trader Peter Brandt said that BTC price is poised to hit $125k soon, sparking market interest. Bitcoin price today surged nearly 3% to $106,741, and its trading volume soared 19% to $79 billion. The crypto has touched its ATH of $107,780.58 in the last 24 hours, especially as optimism soared over a potential US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve under Donald Trump’s presidency. Amid this, the recent call from Europe has further fueled discussions in the market, with experts anticipating the rally to continue ahead.

Despite the effort, SHIB’s valuation remains stable at $0.00002733. However, a 240% surge in large transaction volume and Shibarium’s rapid progress could boost the asset’s utility and drive future price increases. The Terms and Conditions Shifu – a new meme coin project introduced by the Shiba Inu ecosystem – launched an airdrop exclusively for the SHIB community. The total supply of SHIFU is 100,000,000,000 coins. The project revealed that 30% of that amount will be allocated for the community airdrop, with 50% unlocked during the Token Generation Event (TGE) and the rest released in the next four weeks. The team will require a snapshot from eligible users, but the final deadline has not yet been announced . It is important to note that 22,000,000,000 SHIFU tokens will be distributed to some of those holding at least 100,000 SHIB and 100 BUBBLE. 2,000,000,000 SHIFU will be allocated to eligible LEASH holders, while lucky BONE owners will receive 1,000,000,000 SHIFU. The remaining 4,000,000,000 tokens are meant to reach the BUBBLE community. The team added that 70% of the total supply (70 billion SHIFU) will be distributed for other purposes. 40 billion tokens will go to the “liquidity and public pre-sale” section, 20 billion will reach treasury, whereas 10 billion will fund marketing initiatives. SHIFU is a dog-themed meme coin that has yet to go live. Earlier this month, the popular X user Lark Davis described it as “the master of all,” highlighting its legitimacy due to its connection with Shiba Inu’s developers. SHIB Price Outlook The announced airdrop seems to have caused little-to-no price volatility for the second-largest meme coin. SHIB is up a mere 1.5% in the last 24 hours, currently trading at around $0.00002733. Its market capitalization remains hovering at approximately $16 billion, making the asset the 15th-biggest in the entire crypto sector. SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko On the other hand, some important metrics suggest that Shiba Inu may experience a much more substantial increase in the near future . One of those is the large transaction volume (where each SHIB transaction is greater than $100,000). According to IntoTheBlock, the figure has soared by 240% on a daily scale , reaching $175 million. Such a spike might be interpreted positively by traders, driving further demand for SHIB and pushing the price upward. Shibarium’s progress is also worth mentioning. The layer-2 scaling solution has been processing millions of transactions in the past several days, blasting through numerous milestones. Shibarium’s advancement can have a notable impact on SHIB’s valuation due to its role in improving the utility, adoption, and efficiency of the entire ecosystem.

The world’s economy is rapidly evolving, yet financial exclusion remains a persistent issue. A 2022 report by Visa revealed that 2.1 billion people globally remain unserved or underserved by digital financial services. This gap often traps individuals and businesses in underbanked regions in a cycle of limited growth and opportunity. You might also like: Launchpads are the key to decoding crypto’s investment complexity | Opinion The good news? Emerging technologies, especially cryptocurrencies, present an opportunity to rewrite this narrative. Merchant adoption of crypto payments has the potential to significantly uplift the welfare of these underbanked economies. Inflation is crippling cash It is getting harder and harder to rely on cash in economies with significant inflation and price instability. Local currencies have depreciated so much in nations like Argentina, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe that regular cash transactions are fraught with inefficiencies. Stablecoins that are linked to fiat currencies, such as Tether ( USDT ) and USDC ( USDC ), or cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ), can save the day. In enabling safer, peer-to-peer transactions without relying on erratic local currencies, crypto can help businesses protect their revenue value. Crypto payments are less susceptible to the inflation rates that cause cash to depreciate. This is invaluable to regions in which central banks struggle to preserve economic stability. The shift is already evident. According to a 2022 Deloitte survey , 93% of merchants accepting crypto reported positive impacts on customer engagement and satisfaction metrics. As more merchants recognize that crypto allows them to offer more efficient transactions, consumer trust is enhanced. In the long term, this galvanizes more sustainable economic activity. Crypto payments: An interconnected future for merchants and cross-border transactions Rising rates of crypto adoption among merchants are also bolstering cross-border growth. Crypto’s ability to provide reduced rates and faster settlement times is starting to make traditional SWIFT-based banking systems appear all the more archaic. Smaller businesses, in particular, can trade more effectively with the help of cryptocurrency payments, swerving excessive fees and reducing the risk of volatile exchange rates. Additionally, decentralized currencies can guarantee transparent financial transactions and minimize corruption, which is essential for economic stability in lower-income areas. The resulting shift toward crypto ultimately leads to the expansion of local commerce, which has an inevitable, favorable impact on the wider economy. Micropayments: A game-changer for financial inclusion The willingness to accept crypto also opens up a largely untapped opportunity to promote financial inclusion. In underbanked regions, where daily income might be as low as a few dollars, traditional banking fees render small transactions impractical. Cryptocurrencies, however, enable frictionless micropayments with minimal fees, unlocking a new frontier for commerce. If farmers, for example, can sell produce in small increments without losing significant revenue to transaction costs, profit margins increase and consequently create strong financial activity in local economies. Similarly, crypto gives service providers, like ride-share drivers or local artisans, the opportunity to receive smaller payments instantly and directly, bypassing middlemen. This embeds a sense of fluidity into the fabric of day-to-day transactions. As crypto is more widely adopted, it will also become more feasible for things such as pay-as-you-go household utilities to be dealt with in micropayments. This can eradicate the need to pay large, up-front, unaffordable costs in communities that struggle to stay above the breadline. In this sense, crypto-powered micropayments have the potential to change lives. Businesses in emerging and developing markets serve an underbanked yet youthful and tech-savvy population, creating a unique opportunity for innovative payment solutions. While mobile money has played a transformative role in bridging the financial gap for the unbanked, cryptocurrencies present an even more powerful and convenient alternative. By offering greater accessibility, lower transaction costs, and borderless capabilities, cryptocurrencies empower businesses to serve this demographic with seamless, reliable, and inclusive financial services. For these markets, crypto adoption could redefine financial ecosystems and accelerate economic participation. Key considerations for payment solution providers While the promise of crypto is undeniable, it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. It’s crucial that payment providers address several key factors when developing systems tailored to underbanked regions. For a start, solutions must be designed with inclusivity in mind. Many underbanked individuals lack access to sophisticated technology, so systems should work seamlessly on basic smartphones or even feature phones. User interfaces must be intuitive to encourage widespread adoption. Tied to this is the need to facilitate adequate awareness with educational resources. Crypto can seem intimidating to first-time users. Payment providers should invest in educating both merchants and customers on how crypto works, how to leverage its benefits, and how to navigate risks truly. Financial literacy campaigns will play a critical role in building trust and widespread adoption from both merchants and consumers. Regulatory compliance is also a challenge that needs careful navigation. Operating in underbanked regions can be a complex process in this regard. Providers must work closely with governments to ensure compliance while advocating for clear, supportive policies that enable innovation. Above all, security is paramount. Providers must implement robust fraud prevention measures. Hacks and the fear they perpetuate among new users are often a primary cause for slow adoption and severely undermine any progression of trust. Final thoughts The integration of cryptocurrencies into merchant ecosystems in underbanked regions is more than just a technological shift—it’s an opportunity to drive economic welfare and foster inclusion. Cryptocurrency payments have the potential to be a potent equalizer in the global economy by resolving the shortcomings of conventional payment systems, enabling companies to conduct business internationally, and helping people avoid the traps of cash dependence. However, cooperation between local communities, governments, and payment solution providers is essential to success. The adoption of cryptocurrency payments has the potential to become a major component of financial inclusion for billions of people globally, surpassing the status of a specialized trend with the correct tactics.

37756074,https://finbold.com/?p=220114,1734437478,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,AI predicts Aave (AAVE) price for year-end,https://finbold.com/ai-predicts-aave-aave-price-for-year-end/,"Aave ( AAVE ), the leading decentralized lending protocol, has surged to its highest levels since 2021, reaching a peak of $397 on December 16. Despite a slight pullback to $373 at the press time, the token has rallied an impressive 119% in the past month, pushing its market capitalization to $5.6 billion. With strong tailwinds fueling its growth and challenges beginning to surface, investors are left questioning whether Aave can sustain its momentum and where the token will land as the year draws to a close. AAVE one-month price chart. Source: Finbold What’s driving Aave’s rally Aave’s latest rally is closely tied to the broader cryptocurrency market rebound, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) surging past the $100,000 mark. As investors look for opportunities in decentralized finance ( DeFi ), Aave has emerged as a top choice, outperforming many altcoins with its recent gains. The data from IntoTheBlock supports Aave’s growing dominance in the DeFi lending sector, where it currently holds a commanding 45% market share. This dominance is further emphasized by Aave’s staggering total value locked (TVL), which stands at $23.209 billion, according to DeFiLlama , almost equal to the combined TVL of all major lending protocols. TVL of top 11 lending protocols. Source: DefiLlama Strategic partnerships drive growth Beyond favorable macroeconomic conditions, Aave’s recent partnerships and protocol developments have played a key role in its price surge. The protocol’s planned integration with Linea, a zk-rollup network backed by Consensys, promises improved scalability and lower transaction fees—two crucial factors for attracting new users to DeFi. Adding to the momentum, Aave’s collaboration with Balancer v3 has bolstered liquidity, reinforcing its role as a key pillar of decentralized finance. Meanwhile, the partnership with World Liberty Financial (WLFI) marks another milestone, with Aave v3 now deployed on Ethereum ( ETH ) to enable borrowing and lending for ETH, Wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC ), and major stablecoins like USDC and USDT . On-chain data further supports AAVE’s bullish momentum. According to Santiment , the decline in Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA), an indicator measuring the average age of held tokens, signals that dormant AAVE tokens are re-entering circulation, boosting trading volumes and market activity. Concerns over the Polygon network weigh on Aave Despite its strong performance, Aave faces challenges tied to its exposure to the Polygon (previously MATIC ) PoS chain. Marc Zeller, founder of Aave Chan, has proposed adjustments to mitigate risks linked to bridged assets, citing security concerns reminiscent of past bridge exploits like the Ronin and Harmony hacks. The proposal suggests setting loan-to-value (LTV) ratios to 0% and increasing the reserve factor to 85%, effectively discouraging further deposits or preventing users from borrowing against their collateral. AI prediction: AAVE price to target $400 to $450 by year-end To gauge AAVE’s future potential, Finbold analyzed market data and consulted ChatGPT-4o, which projects the token to close 2024 trading between $400 and $450, depending on market conditions and investor sentiment. Aave’s growing dominance in the DeFi lending sector, supported by strong on-chain activity, a rising total value-locked, and growing partnerships, highlights its solid foundation for further growth.

That said, Aave’s market leadership and expansion efforts signal a steady upward trajectory. Its ability to weather headwinds and capitalize on the broader market recovery will determine whether it can hit the upper end of its projected range.

Three particularly valuable coins— Rexas Finance (RXS), Arbitrum (ARB), and Fantom (FTM)—are ready to yield 10x returns by early 2025 as the next bull run gets underway. Each presents fresh technology, substantial market presence, and the ability to redefine blockchain use. Rexas Finance (RXS): Revolutionizing DeFi and Real Estate Tokenization Focused on tokenizing real estate and finance (DeFi), Rexas Finance (RXS) is a game-changing blockchain technology. It lets real-world assets—like real estate—be tokenized, giving consumers quick, safe, open access to financial tools. This creativity connects modern blockchain solutions with established markets. By establishing fractional ownership of actual objects and enabling users to tokenize real-world assets, Rexas Finance's creative platform opens high-value investments beyond the reach of only wealthy individuals. Through its Rexas Launchpad, the platform also helps entrepreneurs and inventors generate money quickly, thereby supporting new token launches in a user-friendly manner. Additionally, the Rexas QuickMint Bot simplifies token creation for non-technical users, allowing straightforward entry into the tokenization market on platforms like Telegram and Discord. With over $27.4 million raised and over 342.2 million tokens sold, Rexas Finance (RXS) is in Stage 10 of its presale, priced at $0.15. While its Certik audit shows a dedication to security, the project's participation in CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko supports its legitimacy. A $1 million giveaway with $50,000 worth of RXS tokens to 20 fortunate winners will also help investors. Rexas Finance's (RXS) capacity to tokenize real estate assets and its rising acceptance in the DeFi industry help explain its potential to 10x your portfolio. Given its intended listing at higher pricing and robust ecosystem, early investors should see significant returns by early next year. Arbitrum (ARB): A Game-Changer for Ethereum Scalability Arbitrum distinguishes itself among Ethereum scaling alternatives by using optimistic roll-ups, providing significant benefits, including compliance with unmodified EVM contracts, thus facilitating seamless transfer of Ethereum DApps without code changes. Despite maintaining Ethereum's strong security, it achieves scalability by processing thousands of transactions per second with minimal fees and quick finality. Stylus, a future tool that will let developers utilize popular programming languages like Rust and C++ for smart contract deployment, helps to improve its adaptability. Driven by its native token ARB, Arbitrum's governance system lets holders use the Arbitrum DAO to impact essential choices. Users of this system can vote on questions of governance, funds allocation, and protocol changes. As of writing, ARB's live price is $1.07, offering investors a reasonable starting place. Arbitrum's significance in scaling Ethereum's network will rise as the tool becomes more well-known, allowing investors to expand their holdings. As Ethereum acceptance increases, analysts estimate ARB might be 10x its present value, hence a formidable competitor for early 2025 expansion. Fantom (FTM): The Ethereum Alternative for DApps High-performance Layer-1 blockchain Fantom provides digital assets and an open-source framework for decentralized apps (DApps). By shining in scalability, security, and decentralization, it is designed to surpass the restrictions of past blockchain generations. Driven by its Lachesis consensus engine, Fantom supports Opera chains compatible with Ethereum. This technology guarantees fast, safe, and cheap transactions. Fantom also offers perfect DApp integration, built-in DeFi tools, and thorough staking rewards. As of this writing, its live price is $1.31, so both novice and experienced investors can find it appealing. With a scratch-built consensus mechanism dubbed Lachesis, Fantom offers greater capacity, two-second transaction finalizing, and improved security compared to conventional proof-of-stake (PoS) systems. This facilitates DeFi and innovative contract-based applications. Designed to compete with Ethereum, Fantom attracts developers looking for worldwide compatible decentralized solutions. Underlying transactions, FTM, the in-house PoS token, helps the platform collect fees, staking activity, and user rewards. Fantom's rising acceptance among developers and strong technological stack help to explain its 10x your portfolio capability. Fantom's ecosystem will become a preferred choice as blockchain applications explode, increasing its value to unprecedented levels in 2025. Conclusion: Seize the Opportunity Rexas Finance (RXS), Arbitrum (ARB), and Fantom (FTM) are straightforward options for investors hoping to 10x their holdings early next year. Every currency offers unique features that are suitable for a developing blockchain market. Early investments in these initiatives could pay off handsomely for life.

It is highest in history so far. While smaller investors hold less than ever, whales are quietly accumulating more ETH. Is this a sign of another bull run, or something else entirely? Whales Are in Control As of now, 104 wallets hold over 100,000 ETH each. That’s 57.35% of Ethereum’s total supply, the highest level ever recorded. While these massive wallets grow in power, mid-sized investors (those holding between 100 and 100,000 ETH) now control just 33.46%, the lowest share in history. Source : Santiment It’s not looking great for small investors either. Wallets with less than 100 ETH make up just 9.19% of the supply. That’s their smallest slice since January 2021. The trend has been building since late 2022, when big investors began aggressively accumulating ETH. Clearly, the whales know something, and they’re playing the long game marking the rise in Ethereum whale dominance. History Shows Whales Move the Market This isn’t the first time whales have shaped Ethereum’s price. Back in late 2020 and early 2021, similar levels of whale accumulation kicked off a massive bull run that sent ETH to new heights. But there’s a flip side to this. When whale dominance peaked in 2022, it was followed by a sharp price correction. Whale activity doesn’t just happen—it’s often a signal. Right now, ETH sits at $4,015, with immediate resistance at $4,109. On the 4-hour chart, the nearest 20-day moving average (MA) is at $3,931, and strong support rests at $3,575, backed by the MA 200. Source : Coinglass The technical indicators show cautious optimism. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 58.42, meaning ETH isn’t in overbought territory yet. However, On-Balance Volume (OBV) at -44.94 reflects a level of hesitation among investors. Money In, Money Out: Investor Breakdown A closer look at investor behavior adds more context. According to IntoTheBlock data, 74% of Ethereum holders have kept their assets for over a year. Short-term holders break down like this: 22% bought ETH between 1 month and 12 months ago. 4% are newer investors, buying within the last month. Profitability paints a bullish picture, too. Right now: 94% of investors are in profit. 3% are breaking even. Only 3% are at a loss, primarily those who bought during Ethereum’s all-time high (ATH) of $4,891 in November 2021. Source : IntoTheBlock However, there are still around 4.27 million addresses holding 1.21 million ETH in loss. Most of these losses occurred when ETH was purchased between $4,093 and $4,891—not far from the current price level. What’s Next? So what does all of this mean for the average investor? Well, it depends. On the bullish side, whales seem confident. They’re buying up Ethereum, especially during dips, and this often signals long-term optimism. If this trend continues, ETH could climb to the $4,500 – $5,000 range. But there’s a risk, too. When a few wallets hold so much of the supply, the market becomes vulnerable. A coordinated sell-off from these whales could cause a sudden drop. It’s something to watch closely as ETH’s story unfolds. Either way, Ethereum whale dominance is a clear reminder: the big players still have the most power in this market.",News|Ethereum|on-chain,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-17 12:21:07

If you think you are eligible, connect your wallet to OpenSea and visit the official R0AR NFT mint page.

For crypto traders, the NFTs can provide access to valuable resources and insights. This includes unrestricted access to the R0AR Portal, a research and analytics platform that offers in-depth project analysis, market trends, and regulatory guidance. This information can help traders make more informed decisions and potentially increase their chances of success in the crypto market. DeFi users can also benefit from holding ERS NFTs. The NFTs may grant access to exclusive yield farming opportunities, staking rewards, and other DeFi features within the R0AR ecosystem. This can enhance their earning potential. Beyond these specific benefits, ERS NFT holders will also enjoy a range of general perks. This includes priority access to exclusive merchandise, participation in community events, and potential airdrops of R0AR tokens.

37756453,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110834,1734438323,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,FNAF 2: A Comprehensive Guide to Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fnaf-2-guide/,"FNAF 2: A Comprehensive Guide to Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 (FNAF 2) remains one of the most iconic games in the horror genre, continuing the legacy of the Five Nights at Freddy’s franchise. Released in 2014 by indie developer Scott Cawthon , FNAF 2 builds on its predecessor’s success with more terrifying animatronics, challenging gameplay , and a gripping backstory. Whether you’re new to the franchise or a seasoned horror enthusiast, this guide will provide everything you need to know about FNAF 2 —from gameplay mechanics and story details to survival tips and fan theories. What is FNAF 2? Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 is the second installment in the FNAF series , a point-and-click survival horror game. Players assume the role of a night security guard at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza , tasked with monitoring security cameras and surviving against malfunctioning animatronics that roam the pizzeria after dark. Unlike its predecessor, FNAF 2 introduces new mechanics, more animatronics , and no doors to block the relentless attackers, making the game significantly more challenging and frightening. FNAF 2 Release Date and Platforms FNAF 2 was released on November 11, 2014 , only a few months after the first game. It became instantly popular for its fresh mechanics and lore development. Available Platforms: PC (Steam) Mobile (Android and iOS) PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch (as part of the FNAF bundle) FNAF 2 Storyline and Setting The Premise The game takes place in 1987 , serving as a prequel to the first Five Nights at Freddy’s game. Players take on the role of Jeremy Fitzgerald , a newly hired night guard at a revamped Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza location. The establishment has introduced “Toy Animatronics” , modernized versions of the older animatronics. However, despite their cheerful exterior, these new animatronics are prone to strange behaviors at night. The Bite of ’87 FNAF 2 subtly references the infamous “Bite of ’87” , a major event in the franchise lore where an animatronic attacked a customer, leading to severe injuries. This storyline detail adds layers of intrigue, encouraging players to explore the mysteries of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. FNAF 2 Gameplay Mechanics The gameplay in FNAF 2 builds on the original formula while introducing new elements: 1. Monitor Security Cameras Similar to FNAF 1, players must use security cameras to track the animatronics’ movements. Cameras cover various areas, including hallways, party rooms, and the prize corner. 2. No Safety Doors Unlike the first game, FNAF 2 does not include security doors to block animatronics. Players must rely on wearing a Freddy Fazbear mask or using lights to deter attackers. 3. Freddy Fazbear Mask Players can wear a Freddy mask to trick most animatronics into thinking they are one of them. However, some animatronics, like Foxy, are not fooled by the mask. 4. Wind Up the Music Box Players must wind up a music box in the Prize Corner to prevent the Puppet (Marionette) from attacking. Failing to keep the music box wound up results in an inevitable game over. 5. Flashlight The flashlight is essential for checking the dark hallways and deterring Foxy and Mangle . Flashlight power is limited, so players must use it wisely. All Animatronics in FNAF 2 FNAF 2 features 10 animatronics that players must monitor and survive against. They are divided into two categories: 1. Toy Animatronics The Toy Animatronics are the new, shinier versions of the original characters. Toy Freddy: A friendly-looking bear who becomes hostile at night. Toy Bonnie: A blue bunny with a guitar. Approaches from the air vents. Toy Chica: A yellow chicken with a bib that says “Let’s Party!” Mangle: A broken, spider-like animatronic who hangs from the ceiling. Balloon Boy (BB): A mischievous character who disables the flashlight, making Foxy harder to manage. 2. Withered Animatronics The older animatronics are worn-out versions of the originals, lurking in the shadows. Withered Freddy: Resembles the Freddy from FNAF 1 but with a damaged appearance. Withered Bonnie: Missing its face, creating a terrifying and unsettling design. Withered Chica: Distorted jaws and broken arms make her one of the creepiest animatronics. Withered Foxy: Requires careful flashlight management to prevent attacks. 3. The Puppet (Marionette) The Puppet hides in the Prize Corner and is awakened if the music box is not wound up. Once it activates, there’s no way to stop it from attacking. Tips to Survive in FNAF 2 FNAF 2’s difficulty can feel overwhelming, especially for beginners. Here are essential tips to help you survive the nights: 1. Prioritize the Music Box Always keep an eye on the Prize Corner camera to wind up the music box. Letting it stop will summon the Puppet, resulting in a game over. 2. Use the Freddy Mask Wisely When animatronics appear in your office, put on the Freddy mask immediately to avoid being attacked. Balloon Boy, Toy Freddy, and Toy Bonnie can be fooled with the mask. 3. Manage Flashlight Power Flashlight power is limited, so avoid overusing it. Use the flashlight sparingly to check the hallways and stop Withered Foxy or Mangle. 4. Check the Vents Toy Bonnie, Toy Chica, and Balloon Boy use the air vents to sneak into the office. Use the cameras to monitor vent activity. 5. Stay Calm and Listen Audio cues are crucial. Listen for sounds like breathing, footsteps, and the rattling of vents to anticipate animatronic movements. Why FNAF 2 is a Fan Favorite FNAF 2 is often considered one of the best games in the Five Nights at Freddy’s series for several reasons: 1. Increased Challenge The lack of doors, introduction of new mechanics, and a larger roster of animatronics make the game more intense and challenging. 2. Richer Lore FNAF 2 expands on the mysterious lore of the franchise, including the origins of the animatronics and hints at the Bite of ’87 . 3. Improved Animatronic Designs The Toy and Withered Animatronics have iconic designs that are both unsettling and memorable, adding to the game’s creepy atmosphere. 4. Replay Value The game offers increasing difficulty across five nights , along with unlockable custom nights for added replayability. FNAF 2’s Legacy in the Horror Genre Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 solidified the franchise as a cornerstone of the horror gaming genre. It inspired sequels, spin-offs, merchandise, fan theories, and even a feature film adaptation. Its unique gameplay and spine-chilling atmosphere have earned it a loyal fanbase and continued popularity across YouTube and streaming platforms. Conclusion: Why FNAF 2 is a Must-Play Horror Game FNAF 2 delivers a heart-pounding survival horror experience with its terrifying animatronics, challenging mechanics, and gripping lore.

37758299,https://coinpaper.com/6577/avalanche-unveils-major-network-upgrade-to-boost-subnets-and-smart-contracts,1734442224,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Avalanche Unveils Major Network Upgrade to Boost Subnets and Smart Contracts,https://coinpaper.com/6577/avalanche-unveils-major-network-upgrade-to-boost-subnets-and-smart-contracts,"Two major developments in blockchain technology emerged this week, highlighting ongoing efforts to enhance scalability and efficiency across layer-1 networks. Avalanche rolled out its largest upgrade to date, Avalanche9000, introducing improvements that reduce costs for launching subnet blockchains and running smart contracts. Meanwhile, Monad Labs announced the formation of the Monad Foundation, an independent entity focused on governance and ecosystem development, signaling significant progress toward a potential mainnet launch. Avalanche Launches Avalanche9000 Upgrade to Usher in Hundreds of New Layer-1 Blockchains Avalanche (AVAX) - the application-friendly layer-1 blockchain - has officially rolled out its largest-ever upgrade, Avalanche9000, introducing key advancements aimed at enhancing its network efficiency and accessibility. Announced on Monday, the much-anticipated upgrade is poised to revolutionize the blockchain landscape by making it easier and significantly cheaper to launch subnet blockchains and deploy smart contracts. “This is the start of hundreds of Avalanche L1s launching,” Avalanche’s team proclaimed in a post on X. “Avalanche9000 reduces the cost to deploy an L1 by 99.9%, and with hundreds of L1s being developed on testnet, look out for an explosion of launches in the coming months.” Key Features of Avalanche9000 The Avalanche9000 upgrade integrates two major improvement proposals, ACP-77 and ACP-125, signaling a significant leap for developers, validators, and end-users. 1. Validator Optimization Through ACP-77 A major highlight of ACP-77 is its overhaul of validator requirements. Previously, validators had to stake a minimum of 2,000 AVAX tokens – valued at approximately $100,000 – to validate the main Avalanche network alongside any subnets they operated. This setup posed substantial financial and hardware burdens on participants. The “Etna” upgrade, as part of ACP-77, addresses this limitation by decoupling validators from the requirement to validate the primary chain when focusing on specific subnets. This change allows validators to dedicate their efforts to specific layer-1 subnets, cutting down operational costs and enabling more efficient hardware usage. With reduced entry barriers, the Etna upgrade paves the way for projects to bootstrap their own blockchains cost-effectively. Furthermore, it introduces regulatory flexibility, empowering subnet operators to meet specific jurisdictional requirements as needed. 2. Lowering Fees with ACP-125 Another pivotal enhancement is ACP-125, which directly impacts Avalanche’s primary smart contract chain, the C-Chain. The proposal reduces the base fee from 25 nAVAX to 1 nAVAX (roughly $0.00000004), addressing what the Avalanche team described as an ”artificially high” minimum fee. “The current minimum base fee of 25 nAVAX is higher than what the market demands, leading to artificially reduced network usage,” reads the official ACP-125 proposal on GitHub . “By lowering the minimum base fee to 1 nAVAX, we allow the market to dictate appropriate fee levels, resulting in a more efficient allocation of resources and potentially higher network usage.” This reduction is expected to stimulate activity on Avalanche’s C-Chain by making smart contract interactions significantly cheaper, catering to developers and users seeking affordable decentralized application (dApp) deployment. At the heart of Avalanche’s scalability lies its subnet architecture. Subnets are sovereign groups of validators working together to validate transactions on specific blockchains, offering a “blockchain-as-a-service” model that supports customization for diverse use cases. Subnets can tailor their parameters, including tokenomics, validator sets, and consensus mechanisms, enabling developers to create highly specialized layer-1 solutions without being tied to Avalanche’s main chain operations. This flexibility opens doors for innovation across industries ranging from gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi) to enterprise applications. Avalanche claims to already support over 500 layer-1 blockchains, with Avalanche9000 expected to accelerate subnet adoption significantly. The Avalanche9000 upgrade arrives on the back of substantial financial support and developer activity. Earlier this year, Avalanche launched its Avalanche9000 testnet, allocating over $40 million in retroactive rewards to developers building on the network. The testnet saw strong engagement, signaling growing enthusiasm among blockchain builders. Adding to this momentum, the Avalanche Foundation recently secured $250 million in funding through a locked token sale. The round was led by prominent venture capital firms including Galaxy Digital, Dragonfly Capital, and ParaFi Capital, signaling investor confidence in Avalanche’s vision. The capital injection will help ensure a smooth rollout of Avalanche9000 while supporting future ecosystem growth, developer incentives, and subnet launches. Avalanche: A Multi-Chain Powerhouse Avalanche’s architecture comprises three distinct blockchains optimized for specific functionalities: X-Chain (Exchange Chain): Handles the creation and trading of digital assets. P-Chain (Platform Chain): Coordinates validators and manages subnets. C-Chain (Contract Chain): Executes Ethereum-compatible smart contracts, making it ideal for dApp deployment. This multi-chain design, combined with Avalanche9000’s improvements, positions Avalanche as one of the most scalable and versatile layer-1 networks in the blockchain ecosystem. Monad Labs Unveils the Monad Foundation to Drive Blockchain Development Ahead of Mainnet Launch In related news, on Monday, Monad Labs announced the establishment of the Monad Foundation, an independent organization dedicated to advancing the growth, governance, and adoption of the Monad blockchain. The formation of the foundation marks a critical milestone for Monad, which recently rolled out its testnet and is now positioning itself closer to a potential mainnet and token launch. In its official blog post , the Monad Foundation described its mission as fostering validator-driven governance, supporting community-led improvement proposals, and providing tools and documentation for developers. The foundation will also play a pivotal role in ecosystem growth, marketing, and advisory initiatives for the Monad blockchain. ”We are sharing an exciting organizational update, signaling a next step in the evolution of the Monad blockchain: the Monad Foundation, an independent organization dedicated to encouraging the development and adoption of the Monad blockchain protocol,” the foundation announced. While the statement refrained from explicitly confirming a mainnet or token launch, the timing of the foundation’s launch has fueled speculation that such milestones could be imminent. This comes on the heels of Monad Labs' progressive testnet rollout, which began in November, a step widely regarded as a precursor to a full mainnet deployment. The Monad Foundation’s core focus areas include: Validator-Led Governance:The foundation will facilitate decentralized governance through validators, ensuring that key decisions about the protocol’s evolution are driven by stakeholders within the community. This approach aligns with the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology. Developer Support and Tools:Providing detailed developer documentation, tools, and educational resources will be central to the foundation’s activities. The goal is to create a robust developer ecosystem that supports the growth of decentralized applications (dApps) on the Monad blockchain. Ecosystem Development and Adoption:The foundation will engage in ecosystem development, offering marketing and advisory support for projects building on Monad. By fostering strategic partnerships and promoting community-led improvement proposals, the foundation aims to accelerate Monad’s adoption. The formation of the Monad Foundation comes amid increasing interest and investment in the Monad blockchain ecosystem. In July, three projects built on Monad announced securing venture capital funding, signaling growing confidence in the network’s potential. Earlier this year, Monad Labs made headlines when it raised $225 million in a Series A funding round led by Paradigm in April, reportedly at a $3 billion valuation. The funding points to strong backing from major players in the blockchain investment space and highlighted the industry’s recognition of Monad as a promising layer-1 solution. Monad aims to address Ethereum’s current scalability challenges by offering significant improvements in throughput and efficiency. Unlike layer-1 networks that replicate Ethereum’s existing codebase, Monad is building a brand-new Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) from the ground up. Monad leverages a pipelined architecture, a technical innovation that allows the blockchain to process multiple steps of transactions simultaneously. This design significantly enhances transaction throughput, making Monad a high-performance alternative to traditional Ethereum-compatible chains. By improving Ethereum’s operational efficiency while maintaining EVM compatibility, Monad enables developers to deploy Ethereum-based dApps with higher scalability, lower latency, and greater performance. The approach positions Monad as a next-generation layer-1 solution capable of supporting demanding decentralized applications. Mainnet Launch on the Horizon? The timing of the Monad Foundation's formation and the recent launch of Monad’s testnet have fueled anticipation within the crypto community. Typically, testnet deployments allow developers to test applications and protocols in a simulated environment, ironing out bugs before launching a mainnet. With Monad’s testnet already in progress, the community is speculating that a mainnet rollout—and potentially a token launch—could soon follow. The foundation’s focus on governance and ecosystem development further hints at readiness for a fully operational network. Validator participation, governance frameworks, and developer adoption are all critical components that must align ahead of a successful mainnet deployment. Monad’s emergence comes at a time when scaling solutions and Ethereum alternatives are in high demand. Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform, but its limited throughput and rising transaction fees continue to present challenges for developers and users. By building a new EVM optimized for performance, Monad positions itself as a solution that retains Ethereum’s compatibility while offering a scalable, high-throughput alternative. This is particularly significant as decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and other dApp sectors require networks that can process large volumes of transactions efficiently.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,AVAX|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-17 13:30:24

Speaking with podcast host Natalie Brunell, Sigel outlined a clear four-year pattern in Bitcoin’s price action that he believes has persisted through multiple market cycles. Why $180,000 Per Bitcoin Seems Plausible Sigel explained that Bitcoin tends to outperform nearly every other asset class for three years out of each four-year halving cycle, followed by a deep correction in the fourth year. Referencing a drawdown typically ranging from 60% to 80%, Sigel said this decline often arrives roughly two years after the BTC halving event. Since Bitcoin’s most recent halving took place in April 2024, Sigel sees 2024 and 2025 as potentially strong years. “That down year typically is the second year after the halving,” Sigel explained. “The Bitcoin halving occurred in April of this year. So 2024 [will be a] strong year, 2025 should be a strong year. I think 2026, unless something changes, would be a down year.” Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Hit $160,000 In 2025? Matrixport Thinks So Drawing on historical data, he recalled the smallest trough-to-peak appreciation in Bitcoin’s previous cycles, which was approximately 2,000%. Even if that figure halves to 1,000%, Sigel pointed out that Bitcoin could rise from a trough of around $18,000 to as high as $180,000 in the current cycle. “So I see an upside to $180,000 this cycle, and I think that’s likely to happen next year,” Sigel added. He also emphasized that Bitcoin’s volatility means the price could overshoot or undershoot that number, but that $180,000 represents a plausible target for 2024 if the pattern holds and no major “red light” indicators appear. Sigel broke down what he sees as the most important topping signals for traders to watch. The first involves derivatives funding rates: if the annualized cost to hold bullish Bitcoin positions on leveraged markets pushes above 10% for longer than a couple of months, Sigel considers that a red flag. “Some of those indicators include the funding rates. When the funding rate for Bitcoin exceeds 10% for more than a couple months, that tends to be a red light,” Sigel warned and explained that recent market activity reset elevated funding rates: “[Last week’s] washout eliminated that as well. So funding rates [are] not really flashing red.” The second is the level of unrealized profits on the blockchain, where on-chain analysis can reveal whether market participants’ cost basis is so low that significant profit-taking might soon create selling pressure. “We’re not seeing scary amounts of unrealized profits [yet],” Sigel noted. Finally, he said anecdotal evidence of widespread retail leverage or speculation could also flash warning lights. He explained that if all these risk indicators were to align at a certain price point—for example, if Bitcoin hit $150,000 and these metrics pointed to a market top—he would be cautious. However, he said that if the price reached around $180,000 without those signals appearing, there might still be room for further appreciation.

If all those lights are flashing and the price is $150K, I’m not gonna wait,” Sigel added. Next BTC Cycle Predictions He also explored the longer-term growth potential for Bitcoin by comparing it to gold’s market capitalization. Because about half of gold’s supply is used for industrial and jewelry purposes, he reasoned that the other half can be compared more directly to Bitcoin’s function as an investment and store of value. If Bitcoin were to reach a valuation comparable to that half portion of gold’s market cap, Sigel believes the price could trend toward roughly $450,000 per coin over the course of the next cycle. Taking an even more forward-looking perspective, he described VanEck’s long-term model in which global central banks might eventually hold Bitcoin as part of their reserves, even if just at a 2% weighting. Since gold constitutes about 18% of central bank reserves worldwide, Sigel’s assumption is that Bitcoin’s share would be far smaller by comparison. He also factored in the prospect that Bitcoin might one day serve as a settlement currency for global trade, potentially among emerging economic alliances such as the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), which could push its valuation significantly higher. In VanEck’s calculations, this scenario might place Bitcoin at $3 million per coin by 2050: “We also assume that Bitcoin is used as a settlement currency for global trade, most likely among BRICS countries. We get to three million dollars a coin by 2050, which would be about a 16% compound annual growth rate.” At press time, BTC traded at $107,219.

Sarah Knafo, a French magistrate and a member of the European Parliament since June, in a pro-Bitcoin speech, has urged the European Union to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and opposed the proposed “digital euro,” a central bank digital currency (CBDC) being developed by the European Central Bank (ECB). “No to the digital euro, yes to a strategic Bitcoin reserve,” Knafo noted in an X post.

She stressed that he now shows a 100% return with hundreds of millions of dollars available for his people. She underscored that the whole world is now getting ready to take advantage of this revolution in decentralized finance. Notably, the Trump administration is set to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the U.S. She also pointed to U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s striking comparison of Bitcoin as digital gold as the cryptocurrency surges to new heights. With Bitcoin skyrocketing, she boldly asked: What is the European Union doing to keep up? Could Bitcoin reserves shape a nation’s future? Read Bitcoin price prediction to see how crypto adoption is changing the global economy! Time For A ‘Paradigm Shift’ She emphasized that its time for the EU to stop wasting money and address growing deficits. The EU’s heavy regulation and taxes are stifling progress. She suggests rejecting the European Central Bank’s digital Euro, which could give bureaucrats too much control over transactions. Instead, she suggests embracing freedom by investing in Bitcoin, building national reserves, and supporting the mining industry. She added that France, with its nuclear power advantage, should stop taxing cryptocurrency holders who have earned their savings through intelligence and risk. “It’s time to change the paradigm. It’s time to protect our people from inflation and the poor economic choices of our states. It is time to say no to the totalitarian temptations of the ECB, which wants to impose a fully controlled digital Euro. It’s time for our states to invest in Bitcoin to build national strategic reserves. It’s time to develop the mining industry,” she remarked. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a video shared on her X account on Dec. 17, Knafo delivered a speech in parliament, calling for European nations to start building national Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserves, develop the crypto mining industry and stop hiking up taxes on crypto holders. “It’s time to bet on freedom, it is time for our states to bet on Bitcoin. To build national strategic reserves. It is time to develop the mining industry,” said Knafo. She took the opportunity to oppose the European Central Bank’s plan to create a digital euro , a mechanism that she believes would only give the bank more power over people’s finances due to how centralized the digital euro was. “We do not want this dystopian world where a European bureaucrat will be able to prohibit certain transactions and even eliminate us from the banking system with a click for a simple comment made on social media or for stating an opinion that disagrees with them.” Sarah Knafo, Member of the European Parliament In the beginning of her speech, she cited El Salvador’s decision to invest in cryptocurrency back in 2021 and Donald Trump’s commitment to establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the U.S. as key examples for how the world has shifted towards decentralized finance. “The whole world is now preparing to take advantage of this decentralized finance revolution. Donald Trump to build strategic Bitcoin reserve for the U.S. Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve is now talking about digital gold. Bitcoin is exploding,” said Knafo, referring to Bitcoin’s major milestone of surpassing the $100,000 threshold for the first time in history and the U.S Fed Chairman’s comments that compare Bitcoin to gold. Read more: ECB official calls for urgency on digital euro amid global CBDC race She criticized the EU over their poor decision of still hanging onto the traditional finance systems that are much more prone to economic crises such as inflation and deficits. Knafo claimed that the EU “is squandering our money on unbelievable mismanagement” because it refuses to turn to crypto as a more reliable alternative to store its national funds. “It is time for a paradigm shift. It is time to protect our people from inflation and the poor economic choices of our states,” she stated. In the past few months, several nations have been leaning towards plans of building a Bitcoin reserve. On Dec. 16, Donald Trump reaffirmed his plans to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve as part of his plan to make America the “crypto capital.” In addition, states across the country are in the process of passing Bitcoin reserve bills, including Texas, Alabama and Pennsylvania. Prior to that, lawmakers in both Japan and Russia have urged their governments to consider establishing a national Bitcoin reserve to protect the national funds of their respective nations. On Nov. 26, Brazilian legislators in the Chamber of Deputies proposed a Bitcoin bill that would limit Brazil’s reserves to approximately $18.5 billion worth of Bitcoin.

Ripple ( XRP ) surged by over 12%, extending an uptrend that began on December 10 when the token bottomed at $1.9065. The rally came after Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, announced that the company would launch the RLUSD stablecoin on Dec. 17 . The stablecoin will initially debut on major exchanges such as Uphold, Bitstamp, MoonPay, and others. The launch follows Ripple developers receiving approval from New York authorities after months of regulatory review. Ripple Labs aims for RLUSD to become a significant player in the stablecoin industry by offering enterprise-grade solutions. Additionally, Ripple hopes RLUSD will complement XRP to boost cross-border transaction volumes in the coming months. Still, RLUSD faces substantial risks ahead. The biggest risk is that it may not gain traction among users after all. Some stablecoins launched by big companies have failed to become popular in the past. For example, Justin Sun’s USDD stablecoin’s market cap has remained around $740 million since its launch in 2022. Similarly, PayPal USD, which was launched in 2023 by PayPal, has struggled and has $458 million in assets. On the other hand, Tether ( USDT ) has continued to grow its market share as its market cap has jumped to over $140 billion. It has become the most used stablecoin in the industry, with a market dominance of over 66%.

This is a situation where users buy an asset in anticipation of a major event and then sell it when it happens. A good example of this is what happened after the last Bitcoin ( BTC ) halving in April. Bitcoin rose ahead of the halving and then retreated after it happened. Another technical risk for XRP is a developing double-top pattern at $2.90. A double-top is a bearish chart formation that often precedes a price pullback. In this case, XRP may hit $2.90 and then retrace to its neckline at $1.90. Furthermore, the coin could experience mean reversion, where the price falls back toward its key moving averages. Currently, XRP trades about 60% above the 50-day moving average, increasing the likelihood of a correction. Conversely, a move above the double-top resistance at $2.90 would invalidate the bearish outlook and could propel XRP toward the $5 level.

Lowest Logan’s experiment used an AMD BC-250 mining card and was able to run games like Gran Turismo 5 Prologue. The YouTuber also noted that game performance could be improved through optimization. Game emulation has remained a contentious area within the gaming world, with many gamers opting for PCs to emulate games across the board. However, with many tech developments, console gamers have joined in on the fun, with PlayStation emulation steadily growing and techies performing experiments. In one such case, a YouTuber experimented using underclocked hardware to debunk beliefs such as those stating that PS5 cannot run PS3 games. YouTuber proves that the PS5 can run PS3 games A tech YouTuber named Lowest Logan successfully used PS5 hardware to run PS3 games in a groundbreaking experiment. Logan used the AMD BC-250 mining card, which has a system-on-chip (SoC) similar to the PS5’s native chip but with limited CPU and GPU capabilities. The chip has six cores and 12 threads, and only 24 out of the original 32 GPU compute units are active. The BC-250 chip was limited to 450MHz clock speed with the Youtuber’s setup using 16 GB of GDDR6 memory. The YouTuber’s experiment also used RPCS3, the popular open-source PS3 emulator compatible with Windows, macOS, Linux, and FreeBSD. Logan’s experiment proved that the PS5’s setup can run PS3 games built using the complex CELL-based model by converting them to x86-compatible instructions. Logan’s improvised setup ran games such as Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, Watch Dogs, and LittleBigPlanet 2 at 60fps. The experiment was able to run the games with occasional shader compilation stutters being the only major issue despite increasing the resolution to 1440p. Logan’s experiment upstages previous attempts at backward compatibility on Sony consoles, which left many believing it was impossible. Watch Dogs notably had more glitches than the other games. The tech YouTuber attributed the extra glitches to the game’s original PS3 optimization issues. Logan reignited backward compatibility debates After his successful experiment, Logan reignited debates about the PS5’s untapped potential for backward compatibility without requiring cloud streaming. The YouTuber’s approach overcame many technical and software limitations while also using an underpowered setup to run PS3 games. Gamers pointed out that Logan’s experiment disproved Sony’s initial stance that implied that native PS3 emulation on the PS5 is not feasible due to technical barriers and high costs. Many gamers argued that Sony’s staff are not as competent or motivated when working towards providing backward compatibility for previous PlayStation consoles. The gamers stated that the problem was not the hardware but rather the PS3’s software issues that Sony was unwilling to address. Some gamers stated that Sony should do a better job since most PS1, PS2, and PS3 games could be properly emulated using a PC or other consoles such as the Steam Deck.

Zhang emphasizes the importance of AI and digitalization in future investment strategies. Investment success requires adapting to market dynamics with smart technologies and AI. China’s capital markets may enter a new bull cycle, driven by digital innovations. The future of capital markets lies in the transformative power of smart technologies. Zhang Bao Long, a renowned investor and strategic advisor for Finanx AI , often called China’s “Warren Buffett,” emphasizes that digitalization and artificial intelligence (AI) will shape investment strategies as market complexities grow. He believes that smart tools are critical for improving market efficiency and helping investors adapt to volatile global markets. The convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology is already transforming the financial landscape, creating new opportunities for innovation and efficiency. Finanx AI leads this revolution, using cutting-edge AI combined with blockchain to take trading to new heights. This vision is matched by Zhang’s forward-thinking insights about the necessity that investors embrace innovation for future success in an increasingly digitized market. Evolution of Investment Strategies Zhang views capital markets as a domain requiring systematic expertise, combining strategy design, knowledge, and empirical analysis. He stresses that investment success demands more than buying and selling; it requires understanding complex market dynamics. According to him, future growth opportunities lie in emerging sectors, particularly those leveraging digital assets, AI, and big data technologies. As smart technologies evolve, traditional investment approaches will need to incorporate these tools to keep pace. The Role of Quantitative Trading in Modern Markets Quantitative trading has significantly advanced, but Zhang believes its implementation must account for localized market systems. In China, the T+1 trading mechanism demands tailored strategies to achieve greater flexibility. Zhang predicts that technology-driven trading systems will allow for more agile decision-making, unlocking new opportunities. However, he urges investors to remain vigilant about policy changes, as these significantly influence market trends. Modern investing is increasingly driven by behavioral finance principles. Zhang argues that market movements often follow emotional patterns, creating both risks and opportunities. Identifying these signs can assist investors in keeping their cool during periods of extreme fluctuations and making rational decisions. Comprehending behavioral patterns are important for managing the risks associated with volatile markets, and more importantly, securing revenues in volatile conditions. Emergence of a Bull Market Cycle Zhang is optimistic about China’s capital markets entering a new bull cycle in 2024. He links this potential growth to global economic shifts, with digital and intelligent sectors leading the way. Key drivers include advancements in AI, blockchain, and big data, which are expected to reshape market structures. Investors who focus on these areas may seize substantial opportunities as the next market cycle unfolds. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In a notice released on December 16, the FCA stated that the project may be offering or promoting financial services without proper authorization, a breach of the regulator’s rules. The FCA noted the importance of dealing exclusively with FCA-approved firms to ensure consumer protection. According to the regulator, users interacting with unauthorized projects like Retardio risk losing their money, as they would not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). “This means it’s unlikely you’d get your money back if the firm goes out of business,” the FCA warned. The agency also encouraged users to verify firms through its registry and report unauthorized operations via official channels. Retardio Responds with Humor Amid FCA Crackdown The Retardio project, which includes a NFT collection and a memecoin, appeared unfazed by the warning. In a tongue-in-cheek response , the project claimed to have “issued a warning against the UK’s financial regulator.” Retardio’s NFT collection has reportedly amassed $31 million in lifetime sales, according to CryptoSlam data. Its memecoin, trading under the ticker “Retardio,” currently holds a market capitalization of $87 million, priced at approximately $0.08 as per Dexscreener. Despite its playful tone, the FCA’s warning highlights ongoing concerns about the rapid growth of unregulated crypto memecoin projects , particularly those relying on viral attention and speculative hype. Memecoins and the Value of Attention Animoca Brands Chairman Yat Siu weighed in on the concept of memecoins, describing them as tokens that capture the value of user attention. Siu argued that while traditional social platforms fail to transparently measure the value of user-generated content (UGC), memecoins embed that culture directly into Web3 ecosystems. “If attention was a token, that’s basically what memecoins represent,” Siu explained, adding that their market value often reflects the collective focus and engagement they command. The FCA’s notice serves as yet another cautionary reminder for consumers engaging in the speculative world of memecoins and NFTs .

Table of Contents Dogecoin’s bullish momentum points toward $1 target Rexas Finance presale gains traction with record-breaking interest New coin aims for 25x rally, drawing interest from buyers Looking ahead, will DOGE and RXS deliver? Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently gained momentum, sparking optimism among buyers as its price trends above 0.44 USDT. Meanwhile, a new cryptocurrency, Rexas Finance (RXS), is capturing attention with bold projections of turning 400 USDT into 10,000 USDT through a potential 25x rally, positioning it as a strong competitor in the market. Dogecoin’s bullish momentum points toward $1 target The price of Dogecoin has been on the rise due to the bullish investors and congestion in the Dogecoin market. Having fluctuated between 0.37 USDT and 0.47 USDT in the past couple of weeks, DOGE looks set to break out. Crypto analysts think that DOGE might cross 0.73 USDT its all-time high level and reach almost 1 USDT if the present performance persists. Source: TradingView There are signs of bullish strength from key technical analyses including the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). The MACD line is above the signal line and histograms of bars point upwards indicating that buying pressure is strengthening. On the lower time frames, chart patterns, such as an ascending triangle, also point to an upward breakout. One analyst claims that DOGE is in the process of constructing a bullish pennant chart pattern that suggests that the uptrend will persist. If this happens, the DOGE value could rise by approximately 30% to 40% and get a lot closer to that minimum of 0.62, than it currently is. However, according to the specialists, the current positions may be volatile, and the inability to maintain above 0.40 level may lead to short-term corrections. Rexas Finance presale gains traction with record-breaking interest While Dogecoin focuses on the bulls in its future, Rexas Finance appears to be one of the most promising projects in the presale segment. The arrangements are good as RXS has managed to receive more than 25 million USDT in its presale, and buyers are still eagerly purchasing tokens as they enter the 9th stage at 0.125 USDT. The presale price is planned to rise to 0.150 USDT in the subsequent stage, which generates interest among holders. Source: X In addition to security, there is an audit and review by Certik for more confidence in Rexas Finance. The project has some special tools including IEO which provides a 100,000 USDT rewards program that enhances participation as well. In the longer term, RXS must target a launch price higher than 0.20 USDT for long-term development. New coin aims for 25x rally, drawing interest from buyers Rexas Finance has lured the market with their great expectation to amplify 400 USDT to 10,000 USDT. Over the presale stage, RXS already has nearly 97% of the current stage completed with 325 million tokens sold. One of the main reasons behind the high demand for holding the project is its innovative nature as the bridge between the asset markets and Blockchain. While some buyers are getting ready, RXS’s detailed development plan and excellent start indicate it has the potential to be a giant in the crypto space. With increasing public interest and an inventive bonus plan, it is a project worth keeping an eye on over the next few months. Looking ahead, will DOGE and RXS deliver? As Dogecoin continues its upward trajectory, surpassing its all-time high remains a realistic goal for holders. Analysts have pointed to historical patterns suggesting that the meme coin could achieve a rally comparable to its 2021 performance. On the other hand, Rexas Finance presents a different kind of opportunity, with its presale setting the stage for a potentially explosive debut on major exchanges. Both DOGE and RXS are poised for strong performances, each appealing to a different segment of buyers. While Dogecoin targets steady growth, Rexas Finance offers high-risk, high-reward potential, making the crypto market more dynamic than ever.

Polygon price prediction for 2024 expects the price of MATIC to surge toward $1.03. By 2030, we expect the MATIC price to record a maximum price of $10.51. Polygon, an Ethereum side chain and layer two scaling solution, has experienced substantial uptake by enterprises and industries in the last year. Consequently, numerous analysts eagerly anticipate the future valuation of its native cryptocurrency, MATIC. This raises the question: Can MATIC’s price reach $10? This forecast for Polygon’s price examines factors such as ecosystem trends, adoption rates, underlying technology, and technical analysis to project the MATIC price prediction from 2024 to 2030.

Resistance for MATIC is present at $0.6291. Support for MATIC/USD is present at $0.5814. The MATIC price analysis for December 17 confirms that MATIC faces bearish pressure around $0.6. Currently, the bears are aiming for a drop below Fib channels. MATIC price analysis 1-day chart: Polygon aims for immediate decline MATIC witnessed a bearish rally after bulls failed to push the altcoin above immediate Fib levels. Over the last 24 hours, the price rejected $0.6 strongly. However, buyers are strongly defending a decline on the price chart. The 24-hour volume surged to $5.2 million, showing increased interest in trading activity. The price is trading at $0.59, decreasing by over 0.3% in the last 24 hours. Matic/USD price chart.

The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the MATIC price from an immediate surge. However, if MATIC’s price successfully breaks above $0.6291, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.7297. MATIC/USDT Chart If bulls cannot initiate a surge, MATIC’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.5814, resulting in a correction to $0.5241. Is MATIC a good investment? MATIC token can be a good investment option in the long run as the project develops a roadmap for its Polygon 2.0 version. Polygon collaborates with diverse industries to enhance adoption, focusing on NFT solutions and Ethereum scalability. Partnerships include Starbucks for an NFT loyalty program and collaborations with Adidas, Prada, and Disney to develop NFT offerings. Why is Matic price down today? Following intense sell off around $0.64, MATIC price failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a break below immediate Fib channels. Will MATIC price touch $1? Yes, Matic price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2024. However, this depends on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will MATIC Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and MATIC gains regulatory recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2030. Is MATIC a good long-term investment? As Polygon continues to expand its offerings, it gains a significant position in the altcoin market. Hence, MATIC can be a good long-term investment option. Recent news/ Opinions on MATIC According to Ali Charts, Polygon whales have accumulated more than 59 million POL tokens within the past 48 hours. This significant increase in activity from large holders suggests a growing confidence in the Polygon network. MATIC price prediction December 2024 Following Donald Trump’s election victory, the crypto market witnessed a robust price surge. As a result, the altcoin market skyrocketed, resulting in a bull run in the Polygon price. However, analysts expect a steady surge in crypto market prices following a bearish October. We expect MATIC to record a minimum price of $0.57 and a maximum price of $0.72, with an average of $0.6 in December. MATIC Price Prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high MATIC Price Prediction December 2024 $0.57 $0.6 $0.72 MATIC price prediction 2024 Based on our thorough technical analysis of MATIC’s historical price data, we anticipate Polygon’s price in 2024’s end to range between a minimum of $0.57 and a maximum of $0.72, with an average trading price around $0.6.

That’s why Polygon became popular during the last bull market. But this time, in 2025, Polygon has tougher competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. However, Polygon’s Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Hence, increasing adoption might drive up its price in 2025. In 2025, the price of Polygon is forecasted to reach a minimum level of $1.34. It’s anticipated to achieve a maximum level of $1.57, with an average price of $1.39 throughout the year. MATIC price forecast for 2026 Polygon has made PolygonzkEVM available to everyone, making it one of the first ZK Rollups to do so. This is a big step forward for Polygon and gives it an advantage. With its growing use by businesses, innovative technology, and past success, Polygon could reach a new all-time high in 2026. According to the forecast and technical analysis, Polygon’s price is expected to hit a minimum of $2.07 in 2026. The maximum price projection is $2.39, with an average value of $2.12. Polygon (MATIC) price prediction 2027 In 2027, one Polygon is anticipated to reach a minimum price of $3.03. The maximum projection for MATIC price is $3.60, with an average price of $3.11 for the year. Polygon price prediction 2028 For 2028, the price of Polygon is predicted to attain a minimum value of $4.28. The maximum value could soar to $5.36, with an average trading price of $4.43 throughout the year. Polygon price prediction 2029 In 2029, Polygon’s price is forecasted to bottom out at $6.08. The maximum possible level for MATIC price could hit $7.41, with an average forecast price of $6.26. Polygon (MATIC) price prediction 2030 Looking ahead to 2030, Polygon’s price is expected to reach a minimum of $8.93. The maximum projection is $10.51, with an average trading price of $9.18.

We anticipate Polygon’s price in 2024 to range between a minimum of $0.9012 and a maximum of $1.03, with an average trading price of around $0.9298. However, its future market sentiment entirely depends on the SEC’s stance, global regulation, and investor interest. MATIC historic price sentiment MATIC price history MATIC debuted in 2019, initially valued below a cent. Maintained a steady level around $0.02 for the following two years. The transformation of MATIC into Polygon in 2021 led to significant growth. Surged past the $1 mark in May 2021, eventually peaking over $2. Notably, on December 27, 2021, Polygon reached an all-time high of $2.92. However, in 2022, the token struggled, dipping below $1 in May. It experienced several market crashes throughout the year, falling below $0.50 in June. There was a brief resurgence above $1 in August. By the end of 2022, Polygon closed at $0.7585, reflecting a significant 70% decline. The following year, 2023, saw mixed performance for Polygon. It broke the $1 threshold in February but faced setbacks, such as dropping to $0.5593 in June due to Crypto.com news. Nonetheless, it peaked at $0.8775 on July 13. The token then experienced a decline to $0.4946 on September 11. Recovering momentum, it reached $0.9789 on November 14. As of January 16, 2024, Polygon was trading at approximately $0.8514.

Decentralized AI platform OpenLedger , which provides a data blockchain for AI model development, announced a strategic partnership with Ether FI , a leader in restaking infrastructure, to enhance the platform’s AI capabilities, security and scalability. Announced Tuesday, the collaboration will leverage Ether.fi’s restaking infrastructure with $6 billion TVL to enhance the security and scalability of OpenLedger’s decentralized ecosystem. As a top 3 restaking infrastructure provider with $6 billion in TVL, Ether FI will support OpenLedger’s vision of providing decentralized artificial intelligence modelling solutions to developers. OpenLedger will enhance its security and scalability features, providing innovative AI solutions – in models and data – to help developers efficiently train and scale workflows. Additionally, OpenLedger’s added scalability will also help AI startups and organizations address complex challenges across industries, powering the next generation of decentralized AI. One of the core contributors on OpenLedger believes the partnership with Ether FI will enhance the “trust and resilience” of the platform, making the platform “future-proof”. “Partnering with Ether.fi enables OpenLedger to elevate these principles by leveraging their restaking infrastructure,” the core contributor stated. “This collaboration reflects our shared vision of a decentralized ecosystem that is secure, scalable, and future-proof.” Notwithstanding, the partnership comes at a time when OpenLedger is preparing for the launch of its testnet and data intelligence layer, in its mission to democratize access to decentralized AI. The collaboration follows a strong adoption and investment year for OpenLedger. The decentralized AI company welcomed tens of partners during the year and recently completed an $8 million funding round led by Polychain Capital and Borderless. The funding highlights strong investor confidence in OpenLedger’s vision and further positions the company to support the development of adaptable AI models. Securing A Stronger Future For Decentralized AI The rise of artificial intelligence to the mainstream in the past few years has changed the world as we know it. Similarly, blockchains are increasingly adopting AI solutions to transform the AI landscape by distributing decision-making across networks rather than relying on centralized entities. OpenLedger is one of the pioneering firms in this space, offering industry-specific solutions for enterprises. The company creates scalable solutions for developers while ensuring data security and transparency. The partnership with Ether FI will see the company strengthen its offerings by leveraging its already-proven restaking infrastructure. It will gain a strong foundation to support the next phase of its development, enabling it to onboard developers seeking to create smarter AI models with verifiable data. As Ether.fi CEO and Co-Founder Mike Silagadze explains in his speech on the partnership: “Ether.fi is excited to shape the future of AI models and data infrastructure with OpenLedger. Through the utilization of our security and operators, we will work with OpenLedger to service the growing community of builders in need of specialized models and data for training, fine-tuning, and scaling their AI workflows.” In addition, the strategic collaboration will ensure secure processing for AI models and workflows, a critical requirement for developers and organizations in need of specialized solutions.

37759025,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628830,1734443533,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37759025.jpeg,Cardano Foundation clarifies position on ecosystem’s governance controversies,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-foundation-governance-controversy/,"Cardano Foundation has responded to criticisms of its overt involvement in the Project Catalyst program, noting that it is acting in the network’s best interests. In a blog post, the non-profit organization explained its role within the Cardano Network. According to the Foundation, it has been actively involved in Project Catalyst since 2021 through participation in previous editions, including F4, F7, F8, F9, and F12. Thus, its participation in F13 should not be controversial, even if it commits more ADA to voting. The Foundation explained that it has highlighted several concerns with the Project Catalyst since it started participating in 2021, but not all of these concerns have been addressed. One of the major concerns it identified was that several high-quality proposals, particularly from new entrants, do not get enough ecosystem support. To address this concern, the Foundation decided to allocate 180 million ADA to vote on proposals in Project Catalyst F13 to support these high-quality proposals. It said : “With our vote, we wanted to double down on the topics of long-term sustainability, decentralization and governance for Cardano. These principles are exemplified by the projects we chose to support.” Project Catalyst is a decentralized public goods innovation fund on Cardano where the community can determine which solutions to prioritize based on the proposals from the participants. Proposals usually focus on challenges within the crypto community. Meanwhile, the Foundation further noted that the level of its influence in the program might be overrated. This is because 4.8 billion ADAs registered to vote in Project Catalyst, which means the Foundation only has about 3.75% of the registered stake. However, it acknowledged the low participation given that there are 35 billion ADA in circulation and observed that not even all the registered stakes will vote on every proposal. This low participation could end up giving its 3.75% voting power a much larger influence. The roots of the controversy Concerns about the Swiss-based Cardano Foundation started last week after a popular Cardano community member, BigPey, shared an anonymous whistleblower email about the foundation’s actions. In the email, the whistleblower alleged internal power struggles in an attempt to sabotage key ecosystem contributors, including the network founder Charles Hoskison and Input Output Global. They further accused the Foundation of not participating in decentralized governance initiatives, including CIP-1694 and the drafting of the Cardano Constitution. Beyond this, there were concerns about the Foundation’s transparency and accountability. While the Foundation has since debunked several of the claims, network founder Charles Hoskinson acknowledged some of the issues. In a post on X, he observed that the foundation’s decision-making process is not transparent and that it exists independently of the community. Board members are not elected or appointed by the community and no one has the power to question their decisions. Cardano Foundation promises more transparency Meanwhile, the Foundation’s official statement also made new commitments to the community. It has now pledged to be more transparent about its decision-making process and provide more information about how it will vote in the Project Catalyst programs and how much ADA it will allocate for voting. It said: “We commit to providing improved clarity and predictability regarding our voting in Project Catalyst, including how much ada we will vote with and our criteria.” The organization further promised to incorporate the community’s feedback into its process and encouraged other stakeholders to do the same. However, it noted that the Foundation is not a membership-based organization. Thus, there is no plan to allow the community to elect board members. On a positive note, Cardano’s internal drama did not affect the market sentiment, as the ADA token is up 2% in the last 24 hours. The token has maintained its value above $1 after seeing over 50% gains in the last 30 days.

This will further demonstrate the exchange ‘s commitment to fostering innovation, supporting the growth of the Web3 ecosystem, and connecting users with the next wave of transformative blockchain projects. Recently, the exchange also announced VANA as its latest addition to Launchpool. It lauded the project’s compatibility as an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain. As per the company, the new platform will be a place for discoveries among blockchain enthusiasts where one can get early exposure to new projects. The initiative aligns with a growing trend in crypto, where platforms focus on grassroots innovation and smaller project visibility. Binance Alpha may have a big impact on both users and blockchain developers. The former will be able to access projects with high growth potential early, while the latter can use the platform to showcase their work and get listed on the exchange in the future. Enhancing Transparency and User Experience in Crypto Token This latest move illustrates the company’s further effort to stay atop the blockchain ecosystem, offering tools and platforms tailored to the changing needs of the crypto community. Announcements of upcoming tokens on the new platform will be made well in advance on the official social channels of Binance Wallet and the exchange itself prior to their launch. There will be a countdown clock and chain details on the Markets tab of the Wallet . The tokens will go live in batches for 24 hours to showcase the projects , during which users can browse project details and buy tokens with ‘Quick Buy’. Featured tokens will stay in the same Alpha section of the Markets tab for tracking and trading after the spotlight period is over . The ‘ Quick Buy’ feature elevates the user experience in trading through an optimization of the Swap function in Binance Wallet. This innovation allows quicker transactions with better success rates and prices compared to any DEX or trading bots. Key improvements include automatic selection of the native chain’s token and default trading amount based on wallet holdings. Auto slippage adjustment during retries improves transaction success rates. An anti-MEV mechanism mitigates MEV effects, ensuring better prices for large transactions. Users can explore the Alpha project and discover innovations starting December 18, 2024, on the Binance Wallet. The exchange will announce five tokens on December 18 and the following two days, December 19 and 20.

The company leveraged the NEAR Protocol and Aurora’s infrastructure to produce these upgrades, which are meant to boost the system’s DeFi services, token utility, and community-driven blockchain development . A dedicated virtual chain TurboChain is a pioneering development for the crypto community as it represents the first AI meme coin blockchain.

The new dedicated virtual chain will use the TURBO meme token for all transactions, cementing its role within the system with low fees and fast speeds, resulting in high accessibility to retail investors. Furthermore, TurboChain will foster the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and cross-chain compatibility with Ethereum ( ETH ), NEAR , and other prominent ecosystems. TURBO community gets a new trading platform TurboSwap, the second addition to the ecosystem, acts as a decentralized trading platform, boasting low fees, fast execution, user-friendly experience, and cross-chain liquidity. This will allow users’ assets to seamlessly transact between Ethereum, Bitcoin ( BTC ), NEAR, Solana ( SOL ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), TurboChain, and others. Aurora Cloud Aurora Labs stated that TurboChain and TurboSwap are the first steps in their plan to launch 1,000 interconnected blockchains in 2025 via Aurora Cloud. Alex Shevchenko, the CEO of Aurora Labs, commented: ‘TurboChain and TurboSwap show the power of Aurora Virtual Chains. They can turn ideas into scalable blockchain ecosystems.’ He added: ‘With the Turbo Token community, we’re setting a new standard for seamless blockchain innovation and interoperability.’ Aurora Cloud aims to foster the grassroots development of cheap, affordable, scalable virtual chains with no prerequisite tech skills.

With early funding, AADAO and Neutron aim to secure priority consideration in Confio’s future endeavors and encourage other stakeholders to follow suit. CosmWasm adoption and funding Confio has been working on CosmWasm since 2020, and so far, the smart contract framework has been adopted by nearly 100 blockchain networks. CosmWasm lets developers build decentralized applications ( dApps ) that interact across the Cosmos interchain. Over the last year, CosmWasm dApps generated more than $5.7 million in fees within the Cosmos ecosystem. Despite the broad adoption, the funding for CosmWasm has mostly come from the Interchain Foundation (ICF). However, following the recent ICF restructuring, Confio’s budget for 2025 has been significantly reduced, resulting in a lot of doubt in regard to the future of the platform. CosmWasm Coalition Atom and Neutron investments are part of the newly launched CosmWasm Coalition, which builds on previous support from the Cosmos Hub, including a $1.25 million allocation under Proposal #103 in March 2023. The coalition aims to raise the $2 million necessary to keep CosmWasm growing in 2025 and allow Confio to focus on security , performance optimization, feature development, source development kit (SDK) compatibility, and the overall developer experience. Relying on CosmWasm for permissioned smart contract capabilities, Cosmos Hub sees Confio’s framework as an essential component of its network. A number of consumer chains leveraging Cosmos Hub’s Interchain Security also depend on CosmWasm, meaning that fresh funds will affect an entire ecosystem.

According to a press release shared with CryptoPotato , Aurora Labs has launched TurboChain and TurboSwap in collaboration with the Near Protocol. TurboChain is the first AI meme coin blockchain and a virtual chain for TURBO, while TurboSwap offers decentralized trading with cross-chain liquidity for the ecosystem. Aurora Labs Unveils TurboChain and TurboSwap Per the announcement, TurboChain will offer its users scalability, customization, and unmatched speed. Built using Aurora’s advanced Virtual Chain technology, the network allows developers to create decentralized applications and enables cross-chain compatibility with Ethereum, Near Protocol, and other major chains. “By blending advanced technology with a thriving community-driven approach, TurboChain pushes the boundaries of blockchain innovation and exemplifies the future of AI-powered meme coins,” Aurora Labs stated. The launch of the TurboChain will enhance Turbo’s utility as the asset will become the network’s native token, powering all transactions and playing a central role in the ecosystem. The community-run meme coin, created from the ChatGPT prompt “create the next great meme coin, starting with a budget of just $69,” currently operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Noteworthily, TurboSwap will enable users to access liquidity from several networks, including Ethereum , Near, Bitcoin, Solana , Arbitrum, Base, and TurboChain. Alex Shevchenko, CEO of Aurora Labs, said: “TurboChain and TurboSwap show the power of Aurora Virtual Chains. They can turn ideas into scalable blockchain ecosystems. With the Turbo Token community, we’re setting a new standard for seamless blockchain innovation and interoperability.” Powering Communities to Use Aurora Cloud Aurora Labs intends to launch 1,000 interconnected blockchains in 2025, and TurboChain and TurboSwap represent the start of this plan. This plan aims to empower communities to use Aurora Cloud, which enables innovation at a low cost and with simplicity. Aurora Cloud allows innovators to deploy scalable virtual chains without any tech skills and at a very low cost compared to traditional financial systems. Aurora Labs says launching a blockchain on Aurora Cloud is as easy as launching a Shopify store. Meanwhile, TURBO recently hit an all-time high, rallying to $0.014 on December 11, per data from CoinMarketCap. At the time of writing, the token was worth $0.010, slightly up in the past 24 hours.

AI18+ aims to redefine the creators' economy by integrating blockchain technology with a comprehensive next-generation platform. AI18+ Helps Individuals Join the Industry Anonymously At the core of the ecosystem is the Modeland platform, which enables individuals of all backgrounds to publish content anonymously. With the advanced ""AI Face Swap"" feature for videos and photos, creators who may have previously felt too shy to engage in such work can earn without the fear of being recognized. Modeland will soon launch a watch-to-earn model, enabling users to earn tokens by watching community-generated content while compensating creators for their contributions. Users can also create private profiles that can be unlocked for free or at a monthly fee. With the motto ""Empowering the AI creators’ economy,"" the platform creates a secure environment where every creator can keep their privacy intact. AI18+ Token Airdrop: A Deflationary Mechanism As expressed in the whitepaper , AI18+ features a unique and rewarding model through daily airdrop cycles. These cycles prevent coin hoarding and aim to ensure every token is associated with value. Users who engage with the platform can earn credits through a process similar to a slot machine. However, these credits cannot be directly converted into AI18+. Instead, they must be used for content creation or other activities on the platform. This approach helps maintain the stability of the token's value. Any unused credits will automatically expire after 44 hours, creating deflationary pressure and helping to safeguard the ecosystem's stability. NFT IDs & Marketplace: A New Era for Creators The Modeland platform issues unique ""NFT IDs"" for every AI model created, ensuring that each one is distinct and linked to a specific creator. These innovators can set up private content rooms for a subscription fee and sell, trade, or promote their works through an exclusive marketplace. This approach can enhance their earning potential and empower their creative expression. Anonymity at the Core AI18+ respects users' right to anonymity. All transactions occur on the Binance Smart Chain, ensuring complete privacy and security. It is the first platform to merge content with a user-empowering economy while maintaining privacy. Official Launch on December 19, 2024 Following a private sale raising $1,000,000, AI18+ will officially launch on PancakeSwap on December 19, 2024, at 15:00 UTC / 10:00 EST / 17:00 EET. Corporate Social Responsibility AI18+ places corporate social responsibility and a commitment to ethics at the center of its mission to support community well-being. As part of this effort, the company funds a Non-Profit Organization dedicated to protecting children through education and awareness initiatives. The NPO’s activities are sustained through AI18+’s innovative funding model, which allocates 4% of the 100,000 daily circulated tokens to these efforts. This approach ensures the organization’s impactful work continues, fostering a brighter, safer future for children while aligning with the ethical values upheld by AI18+.

AI18+ aims to redefine the creators’ economy by integrating blockchain technology with a comprehensive next-generation platform. AI18+ Helps Individuals Join the Industry Anonymously At the core of the ecosystem is the Modeland platform, which enables individuals of all backgrounds to publish content anonymously. With the advanced “AI Face Swap” feature for videos and photos, creators who may have previously felt too shy to engage in such work can earn without the fear of being recognized. Modeland will soon launch a watch-to-earn model, enabling users to earn tokens by watching community-generated content while compensating creators for their contributions. Users can also create private profiles that can be unlocked for free or at a monthly fee. With the motto “ Empowering the AI creators’ economy ,” the platform creates a secure environment where every creator can keep their privacy intact. AI18+ Token Airdrop: A Deflationary Mechanism As expressed in the whitepaper , AI18+ features a unique and rewarding model through daily airdrop cycles. These cycles prevent coin hoarding and aim to ensure every token is associated with value. Users who engage with the platform can earn credits through a process similar to a slot machine. However, these credits cannot be directly converted into AI18+. Instead, they must be used for content creation or other activities on the platform. This approach helps maintain the stability of the token’s value. Any unused credits will automatically expire after 44 hours, creating deflationary pressure and helping to safeguard the ecosystem’s stability. NFT IDs & Marketplace: A New Era for Creators The Modeland platform issues unique “ NFT IDs ” for every AI model created, ensuring that each one is distinct and linked to a specific creator. These innovators can set up private content rooms for a subscription fee and sell, trade, or promote their works through an exclusive marketplace. This approach can enhance their earning potential and empower their creative expression. Anonymity at the Core AI18+ respects users’ right to anonymity. All transactions occur on the Binance Smart Chain, ensuring complete privacy and security. It is the first platform to merge content with a user-empowering economy while maintaining privacy. Official Launch on December 19, 2024 Following a private sale raising $1,000,000, AI18+ will officially launch on PancakeSwap on December 19, 2024, at 15:00 UTC / 10:00 EST / 17:00 EET. Corporate Social Responsibility AI18+ places corporate social responsibility and a commitment to ethics at the center of its mission to support community well-being. As part of this effort, the company funds a Non-Profit Organization dedicated to protecting children through education and awareness initiatives. The NPO’s activities are sustained through AI18+’s innovative funding model, which allocates 4% of the 100,000 daily circulated tokens to these efforts. This approach ensures the organization’s impactful work continues, fostering a brighter, safer future for children while aligning with the ethical values upheld by AI18+.

This pattern could lead to an explosive breakout. Considering that PEPE is an Ethereum-based meme coin and ETH has been showing strength, it is likely this top meme coins could follow suit and rally. This article explores how high Pepe Coin price could get if Ethereum price hits $5,000. Pepe Coin Price Forecast If Ethereum Hits $5,000 Pepe Coin is one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies this year as it soared by over 2,340% from its January lows. Recently, however, it has lagged other large coins like Bitcoin and AAVE that have soared by double digits. PEPE has dropped by 17% from the highest point this year, but its price fractal imitates that of the early 2024 consolidation that led to the 2,340% rally. A potential catalyst for Pepe price is the performance of Ethereum, the second-biggest crypto in the world. As mentioned above, PEPE is built on the Ethereum blockchain and is considered the mascot of ETH. Although ETH underperfomed in the first half of 2024, it has shown strength recently. This shift in paradigm is bullish and its ripple effect could serve as tailwind for PEPE. In an X post, Max , a crypto analyst with over 63,000 followers, noted that the coin will have a strong bullish breakout if Ethereum moves above $4,000. Ethereum has struggled to move above the resistance of $4,000 in the past few days. Still, as we wrote recently, there are rising odds that ETH price will stage a strong comeback and hit $5,000. We pointed to the ongoing whale accumulation, rising Ethereum transactions, and growing inflows in ETFs. Pepe coin price is likely to do well if Ether surges because it is the second-biggest meme coin in its ecosystem after Shiba Inu. PEPE Price Forecast The bullish outlook noted by technicals are also reflected by on-chain metrics, which also point to a massively optimistic future for Pepe Coin price. Pepe Whales On Accumulation Spree The other potential catalyst for Pepe price is that supply held in exchanges recent collapse. This drop has coincided with the rising supply held by top non-exchange addresses. That is a sign that whales are accumulating and moving their holdings off centralized exchanges. Such a development notes investor confidence and often leads to bull runs. Pepe Whale Transactions Whale accumulation is one of the most popular bullish catalysts for a cryptocurrency. Etherscan data shows that one of these whales transferred 1 billion Pepe coins valued at over $2.3 million from MEXC. This hoarding is likely because many Pepe holders are currently in the money. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that there are 331k in the money addresses and just 12.2k wallets out of the money. Furthermore, the only resistance that is preventing this meme coin from climbing higher is the $0.000024, which is where 20,780 addresses purhcased nearly 42.2 trillion PEPE tokens. Overcoming this cluster of “at the money” holders could kickstart a rally. Pepe Coin In The Money Pepe Coin Technical Analysis The daily chart shows that the Pepe coin price continues its consolidation after it reached the year-to-date high of $0.00002827. A falling wedge pattern continues to form, a highly bullish sign. This pattern had two falling and converging trendlines and often leads to gains when the two lines near their convergence. Pepe price remains above the 50-day moving average. It also recently formed a small inverse head and shoulders pattern. The distance between the YTD high and the head is about 33.42%. Therefore, if we measure this distance from $0.00002595, we estimate that the Pepe coin price will get to $0.00003450, which is 47% above the current level. Pepe Coin Price The bullish view is invalidated if the Pepe Coin price drops below the psychological point at $0.20. Such a move points to further drops to $0.00001712, the upper side of the previous cup and handle pattern.

Salovaara, who helped raise token sales for major names in the industry, believes 2025 will be dominated by two major trends: Fair Token Offerings (FTOs) — A push for more reasonable valuations and more equitable access for everyday investors AI Tokens — A major leap forward where crypto meets advanced AI agents, opening fresh opportunities for projects and investors alike “2024 was phenomenal, with Bitcoin hitting $100,000 on December 4th—CoinMarketCap confirms this milestone,” says Salovaara. “Thousands of meme-coins also launched this year, many reaching secondary markets, as tracked by BDC Consulting. But 2025 is set to be even bigger. I predict Bitcoin will push towards $150k–$200k, and meme-coins will hopefully adopt stricter compliance. Even more exciting is how AI is finally converging with crypto, spawning a new generation of AI-driven utility tokens.” 1. Fair Token Offerings (FTOs): Leveling the Playing Field While Bitcoin’s and meme-coin's rise dominated headlines in 2024, these trends also highlighted how rampant scams and rug-pulls remain. Meme-coins in particular saw thousands of launches, not all created equal. Private insiders often orchestrated low-float, high-valuation tactics—leaving retail investors at a disadvantage. To counter these, TokenBuilder has pioneered an FTO Rating system, providing a transparent scoring framework for new token offerings. This rating focuses on five pillars: Access: Retail investor inclusion in private rounds Appreciation: Fair token valuations with upside potential Supply: At least 20% circulating supply after token launch to avoid price manipulation Liquidity: Early secondary market trading plans (DEX or otherwise) Transparency: Public, identifiable teams rather than anonymous founders “We want to end the days of anonymous projects,” Salovaara says. “A legitimate project should be proud of its team, structure, and open to scrutiny.” FTOcalendar.com is TokenBuilder’s curated platform listing upcoming offerings. Each token must achieve at least one star on the FTO Rating scale to even be considered—raising the bar for fairness in Web3 fundraising. Although the five-pillar overview remains the core, TokenBuilder continues refining the FTO Rating for greater sophistication. 2. AI Tokens: The Next Billion-Dollar Crypto Sector According to Salovaara, For most of 2024, AI was overshadowed by surging meme-coins and the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin ETFs. Yet behind the scenes, developers have been blending language models (OpenAI, Grog, Llama) with crypto utility. In practice, these AI tokens will: Use AI-agent frameworks (like AI16Z’s “Eliza”) to enable advanced, automated services Offer exclusive data and analytics functionalities Function as native payment methods for discounted or premium AI services “We see AI tokens as the next wave of utility tokens—where owning them isn’t just about price speculation, but unlocking actual AI-based features,” Salovaara explains. “Expect many new AI-token launches by mid-2025, each aiming to monetize everything from data analytics to real-time predictions. We will launch our first version of ‘Eliza’ in January–February 2025.” 3. TokenBuilder’s Roadmap for 2025 and Beyond Building on a decade of crypto experience, TokenBuilder is developing a Fair Token Offering launchpad focused on AI-driven tokens. Using on-chain sales accessible to everyone, the platform plans to offer: $TBAI launch on Uniswap 2nd of January 2025 Multiple token offering methods: Fixed-price sales, Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) auctions, and more Multi-chain support: Ethereum, Base, and possibly other Ethereum Layer-2 networks AI-Powered Tools: AI-powered tokenomics analysis, compliance tracking, and advanced analytics Alongside the FTO Calendar and an “AI-Agent Army” for compliance and tokenization, TokenBuilder aims to streamline the entire process of launching new tokens in a fair, open, and transparent manner. “We believe the ‘AI-Agent Army’ will be central to many utility tokens from 2025 onward,” Salovaara adds. “Imagine an AI-powered framework that automates compliance checks, optimizes liquidity, and offers real-time market intelligence for both investors and founders. That’s the future we’re building.” Contacts TokenBuilder Platform: tokenbuilder.ai FTO Calendar: FTOcalendar.com Media Contact Ransu Salovaara, Founder & CEO Telegram: @ransu_salovaara Email: ransu@tokenbuilder.ai LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/ransu About TokenBuilder TokenBuilder is a Fair Token Offering launchpad and platform for Web3 projects.

Specifically, the maiden cryptocurrency’s Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) has yet to reach the 90 mark—a level achieved during the past two bull cycles , according to an analysis by financial data platform Barchart in an X post on December 17. Indeed, Bitcoin’s cycle tops in 2017 and 2021 coincided with the monthly RSI surpassing 90 and currently reads 77.19, far below previous overbought levels. “Bitcoin’s Cycle Tops in 2017 and 2021 occurred with a Monthly RSI reading above 90. It’s currently only at 77. This train still has room to run,” the platform noted. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Barchart. The RSI indicator measures the speed and magnitude of price changes. Readings above 70 typically indicate overbought conditions, but previous Bitcoin bull cycles show that the market can stay overbought for extended periods while prices continue to surge. Bitcoin’s room for further growth Regarding the possibility of continued price growth, whale transaction data could offer notable insights into what to expect. According to prominent on-chain crypto analyst Ali Martinez in an X post on December 17, wallets between 100 and 1,000 BTC have accumulated over 70,000 BTC in the past 48 hours. This accumulation represents a staggering $7.28 billion in Bitcoin. Bitcoin whale transaction chart. Source: Santiment/Ali_charts The sentiment suggests that the market remains optimistic as such transactions often trigger further price growth. In this scenario, with whales acting as catalysts, retail investors might also capitalize on the momentum. Adding further optimism to the possibility of Bitcoin surging past its record $107,000 is its historical performance in the year following the U.S. elections , which often aligns with its four-year halving cycle. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TrendSpider For instance, following the 2012 election, Bitcoin climbed from $15 to over $1,000 in 2013. Following 2016, it peaked at nearly $18,000 in 2017. Post-2020, the asset hit an all-time high of $69,000 in 2021. After the November 2024 elections, Bitcoin’s momentum was inspired by Donald Trump’s election , who is widely expected to spearhead the implementation of crypto-friendly policies. Additionally, several entities believe Bitcoin will likely double in value next year. As reported by Finbold, Standard Chartered projects the asset’s current cycle will peak next year, potentially reaching $200,000. According to the banking giant, institutional investors will be central to this rally. At the same time, investment firm VanEck projected that the current run will extend into 2025, peaking in Q1, with Bitcoin likely reaching $180,000. However, not everyone is fully bullish on Bitcoin. As per a Finbold report , a trading expert warned investors to prepare for an exit, noting that the asset might be nearing its top and that the current momentum may not last long. Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $107,133, an increase of 3.5% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, the maiden cryptocurrency had made gains of over 5%.

Large ETH wallets are accumulating aggressively, reaching an all-time high in supply ownership. Mid-tier and small wallet holdings hit record lows. On the upside, institutional inflows and historical trends suggest Ethereum has room for further growth despite market volatility. Ethereum Whales Strengthen Holdings According to Santiment’s latest analysis , whale wallets holding at least 100K ETH now own an all-time high of 57.35% of the total supply, which is worth approximately $333.1 billion. These 104 large wallets reflect growing confidence among Ethereum’s largest stakeholders as they continue accumulating despite market volatility. On the other hand, mid-tier wallets holding between 100 and 100K ETH have dropped to their lowest-ever supply ratio at 33.46%, while addresses with fewer than 100 ETH sit at a near four-year low of 9.19%. While the broader Ethereum ecosystem includes a rising number of DeFi and staking wallets, this trend generally signals a bullish long-term outlook, the on-chain analytic platform said in its latest analysis. For a mature, nine-year-old asset like Ethereum, such sustained accumulation by key stakeholders suggests growing conviction and reduced sell pressure from whales, which often aligns with positive market sentiment over time. The whale activity comes as the cryptocurrency broke yet another record that pushed its YTD gains to almost 80%. It hit $4,106 on Monday before dipping slightly to $4,020 at the time of writing. Despite this, the leading altcoin remains 22% below its all-time high of $4,878, set in November 2021, but experts suggest that it might still have room for significant growth. Room for Growth According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez’s update , Ethereum’s price movements historically correlate with shifts in long-term holder sentiment. In the past two bull cycles, ETH saw parabolic price surges when long-term holders entered the “greed” phase. Currently, these holders are in the early stages of the “belief” phase, essentially which indicates they are just starting to feel optimistic about the asset’s price potential. However, this still appears to be far from the euphoric peaks that typically mark the beginning of explosive rallies. If history repeats itself, this suggests that Ethereum’s major upward move could still be on the horizon as long-term investor sentiment strengthens. Adding to the positive momentum, Ethereum-based investment products have recorded seven consecutive weeks of inflows. CoinShares’ data revealed that these products attracted a total of $3.7 billion during this period. Notably, $1 billion flowed in just last week, highlighting steady institutional interest and confidence.

Fed Rate Cut Forecasted by BoA’s Mark Cabana Ahead of FOMC According to Cabana , the Fed Rate Cut of 25 basis points comes as the Federal Reserve signals a shift toward a more gradual approach to rate adjustments. While inflation remains stickier than expected, the labor market continues to exhibit signs of moderation. Cabana noted that the Fed’s decision reflects concerns over maintaining restrictive monetary policy for too long. The FOMC decision aligns with prior Fed signals to the market, ensuring stability and avoiding unnecessary disruption. Cabana emphasized that failing to follow through on prior guidance could upset financial markets, an outcome the Fed aims to avoid. Despite strong labor data and cooling employment growth, a cautious stance is justified. The Head of U.S. Rate Strategy at Bank of America Securities emphasized, “They likely worry that if they don’t cut, they risk upsetting markets, so they’re going to go ahead with this cut and then signal that they’re likely moving to a bit of a more gradual upsetting markets.” It is important to note that Fed rate cuts boost the crypto market and altcoins. BTC rallied past $100K as predicted due to the anticipated December cuts, which increased liquidity and investor risk appetite. Analysts highlight that a 25 basis point reduction could fuel further price momentum, with altcoins like Ethereum and XRP also drawing capital flows. Sticky Inflation and Cooling Labor Market The Fed Rate Cut comes amid persistent inflation that has proven difficult to bring down to the 2% target. Despite economic strength, rising prices remain a concern for policymakers. The potential for inflation to reaccelerate poses a risk that could force the Fed to reconsider its easing path in the future. According to last week’s report, US CPI inflation data came in at 2.7% for November, aligning with market expectations and slightly up from 2.6% in the prior month. The Core CPI remained steady at 3.3%, sparking optimism among investors. This data has fueled hopes for a potential Fed rate cut, driving sentiment for a Bitcoin and altcoins rally in the coming weeks. On the labor front, the hotter-than-expected US PPI inflation at 3% dampened hopes for a Fed rate cut, adding downward pressure on the crypto market. This comes as traders remain cautious, with concerns rising over potential hawkish moves by the Federal Reserve. More so, jobless claims have seen slight upticks, while broader employment data indicate a gradual slowdown. The Federal Reserve aims to balance inflation management with maintaining a healthy labor market ahead of the next FOMC meeting. Cabana pointed out that a rate cut helps avoid over-tightening, which could unnecessarily hinder growth. In addition, Cabana dismissed suggestions that the Fed Rate Cut will alleviate the Treasury’s debt burden. Cabana suggested that the Federal Reserve will monitor inflation expectations to ensure they remain anchored. Should inflation show signs of acceleration, policymakers could be forced to halt cuts or even consider future rate hikes. On the other hand, Elon Musk recently shared that government overspending remains the root cause of inflationary pressures in the US. He believes that eliminating wasteful expenditures through the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) could curb inflation. Musk’s focus on modernizing outdated federal IT systems aims to enhance transparency and prevent misuse of taxpayer funds.

This move is the latest in a run-up of six months for this stock, buoyed by the company’s adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) treasury strategy and continued capital raises. Semler Scientific Options Go Live Semler Scientific (SMLR), a small-cap medical device company that embraced a Bitcoin treasury strategy earlier this year, recently introduced options trading as part of its offerings. This follows six months of steady share-price growth for the company, fueled by its Bitcoin (BTC) pivot and ongoing capital-raising efforts. Semler Scientific's shares are now available for options trading, which opens a new path for raising capital to buy MORE #Bitcoin . MicroStrategy II $SMLR pic.twitter.com/97wjmNEgva — CryptoPiL (@CryptoPiL) December 17, 2024 The company applied to options trading back on December 5, citing a belief that it had been eligible for the same. It is still to make the official announcement, but a short check in showed options trading for Semler shares are available in some brokerage accounts. Options are financial contracts that entitle investors with the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a stock at a predetermined price before a specified date. In general, options trading, upon its introduction, started providing investors with useful tools for hedging risks and speculating on market movements. A stock must meet specific minimum requirements to be option-eligible. These usually include things like a minimum share price in the range of $3 to $5, a market capitalization of at least $75 million, and average daily trading volume between 500,000 to 1 million shares. In addition, there should be adequate freely floating shares available and an adequate number of shareholders. Shares of Semler Scientific have surged about threefold to close above $74 Monday after the company said May 28 it first disclosed Bitcoin buys. The group has reached a market capitalization above $600 million amid news that SMLR has climbed 5% in Tuesday’s premarket session at $78.20. $150 Million Stock Offering to Fuel BTC Buys The company has filed a second prospectus supplement under its S-3 Shelf, adding another $50 million in share offerings to the existing ATM program, bringing the offering total to $150 million. So far, Semler has issued roughly $100 million in proceeds under the ATM issuance. Through Friday, Semler has invested 168.6 million for 2,084 Bitcoins or at an average cost basis around 81,000/Bitcoin. Its portfolio valued in today’s BTC price near $106,500 stands near $222m. Just on Monday it acquired $21.5 million in BTC . Semler might look at emulating the success of high-profile Bitcoin holder MicroStrategy’s strategy of using convertible notes to raise money in a bid to expand Bitcoin holdings. Just for reminder, MSTR recently bought another 15,350 BTC for $15 billion. Convertible offerings would be a way to raise capital without diluting existing shares and therefore could be more attractive from that standpoint. An active options market, which Semler plans to foster, would provide effective hedging tools for investors, making convertible notes more attractive to potential buyers.

Instead, she championed Bitcoin as a decentralized, freedom-affirming alternative. "" No to the digital euro, yes to a strategic Bitcoin reserve,"" Knafo wrote on X (formerly Twitter), accompanied by a video of her address. Sarah calling for Bitcoin reserve Sarah Knafo calling for Bitcoin reserve Learning from El Salvador's Bitcoin AdoptionIn her speech, Knafo highlighted the success of El Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele made the controversial decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021.At the time, critics, including the political class and the IMF, ridiculed the move. However, El Salvador's bet on Bitcoin has paid off, showing over 100% return and providing hundreds of millions of dollars in security and sovereignty for the country.Furthermore, Knafo pointed to growing global interest in Bitcoin, noting that influential figures such as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell are positioning themselves to take advantage of the cryptocurrency revolution. Powell has referred to Bitcoin as ""digital gold,"" and the U.S. is exploring the possibility of a strategic Bitcoin reserve.Europe Falling Behind on Crypto InnovationMeanwhile, Knafo criticized the European Union for lagging behind in cryptocurrency adoption. She lamented that the EU continues to waste public funds, struggle with inflation, and stifle innovation through excessive regulation and taxation.In her speech, Knafo called for a paradigm shift in Europe, urging EU states to protect their citizens from inflation and the consequences of poor economic policies. She particularly warned against the ECB's push for a fully controlled digital euro, fearing it could lead to a dystopian future where citizens are excluded from the financial system for expressing dissent or engaging in unpopular activities.Call to Develop Crypto Mining Industries In EuropeFurthermore, Knafo emphasized the need for European nations to follow El Salvador's lead in building strategic Bitcoin reserves and developing local crypto mining industries.She pointed out that France, in particular, has the advantage of abundant nuclear energy, which could power a thriving cryptocurrency mining sector. Knafo further urged policymakers to reduce the tax burden on cryptocurrency holders.In conclusion, Knafo called for a return to the values of freedom and innovation, advocating for a future where Europe embraces cryptocurrencies as a means of economic independence and protection from inflation. ""Let’s dare to be free,"" she concluded, ""and stay true to the ambition of our civilization."" Notably, the discussion around a strategic Bitcoin reserve has gained momentum since President-elect Donald Trump teased the idea at the latest Bitcoin Conference.

Responding to questions by Members of Parliament, the Government of India reiterated that by design, VDAs are borderless, hence their effective regulation and monitoring require cooperation at the international level to avoid regulatory arbitrage. The Push for Global Coordination India’s view epitomizes the challenges related to the regulation of crypto assets in a silo. As the G20 President, India emphasized the necessity of the G20 Roadmap on Crypto Assets to ensure that risk-sensitive regulatory frameworks have been instituted across jurisdictions. The government said consultation with industry stakeholders and international organizations has been ongoing, informally and formally. Cohesive, cross-border regulation remains necessary to bring about effective solutions to VDA complexities. Existing Measures and Sector Challenges While a structured regulatory framework is pending, Them has already taken steps to address immediate concerns. Income derived from VDA is taxed, and since March 2023, crypto transactions fall under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. These measures aim to enhance oversight and transparency in the sector. Despite these efforts, the challenges persist. The fast adoption of digital assets in India has resulted in growing risks as well. High-profile scams such as Andhra Pradesh fraud reveal how vulnerable the market is. In this regard, it was a case where investors were lured into promises of exaggerated returns, with wrong affiliations of reputed exchanges, which indicated the pressing need for far stronger mechanisms for investor protection. Balancing Innovation and Financial Stability The Indian government has to tread a tightrope between promoting innovation and economic growth on one hand, and financial stability and investor protection on the other. Without international cooperation, no national policy can effectively oversee and regulate borderless digital assets. This explains why them continued to push for international cooperation towards developing harmonized regulatory standards. Future Outlook While the absence of a clear-cut regulatory timeline keeps stakeholders in a state of uncertainty, India is committed to developing policies rooted in national interest while keeping in mind global consensus. The emphasis on collaborative approaches underlines India’s evolving role in shaping international VDA regulation. As the crypto industry grows, India’s leadership on global platforms like the G20 will be instrumental in creating a harmonized framework. Such efforts can foster sustainable growth, safeguard investors, and prevent misuse of digital assets in a rapidly evolving digital economy.",Blockchain|India|Regulation,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2024-12-17 15:28:56

Solana’s architecture supports flexible development across multiple programming languages, making it attractive for developers building high-performance dapps. The native cryptocurrency, SOL, is central to the ecosystem, facilitating transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network supporters. With its high-capacity network, Solana aims to host products and services that require quick and efficient processing, highlighting its potential in the evolving blockchain technology landscape. Conclusion While coins like SOL have less immediate potential, DOGEN emerges as a token for those pursuing luxury and success. With an expected 700% presale growth and potential for thousand-fold returns, DOGEN mirrors successful tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat. It fosters a community of alpha leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks to early supporters.

Meanwhile Ethereum is trading for $3,992, up more than 7.4% in the past week. The analyst also notes he believes that Bitcoin will reach the $150,000 price tag with or without support from President-elect Donald Trump. “INTEL: Trump plans to focus on Bitcoin price, viewing it as another stock market. He aims for Bitcoin to reach $150,000 early in his presidency.” Pentoshi believes Bitcoin will hit the $150,000 price target regardless of what Trump may do.

Ethereum ( ETH ), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading at $4,008. But the momentum failed to continue as it has faced resistance over the past three consecutive weeks. Still, ETH has positive catalysts that could push its price higher in the near term. The first main catalyst is that Bitcoin ( BTC ) has continued rising and moved to a record high this week. Altcoins like Ether often follow the price of Bitcoin. Spot Ethereum ETFs are also seeing strong inflows, a trend that may continue in the coming months.

Ethereum price could surge soon ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The weekly chart shows that the ETH price has been in a strong bullish trend in the past few weeks. It has found a strong barrier at $4,000, where it failed to move above since March. The main risk is that it has formed a triple-top pattern, a popular bearish sign in the market. This pattern has formed slightly above the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level. Ethereum has remained above the 50-week and 100-week moving averages. It is also between the middle line and the first resistance point of the Andrew’s pitchfork tool. Therefore, a break above the triple-top level will point to more gains, possibly to the all-time high of $4,877. A move above that will lead to more gains to $5,000.

Analysts are highlighting a 10x rally for the Dogecoin price, fueled by its loyal community and speculative trading appeal. Ripple (XRP) continues to see steady growth, with institutional adoption driving the XRP price upward. However, the standout performer among them is ETFSwap (ETFS), which is predicted to surge by an extraordinary 33,000% by 2025. ETFSwap (ETFS), listed on Uniswap , is now attracting savvy investors who missed its presale. Its unique tools and market positioning make it an ideal choice for investors seeking sustainable growth in 2025. ETFSwap (ETFS) is leading the way in utility and future potential over the Dogecoin price, as well as Ripple (XRP). ETFSwap (ETFS): A Mid-Cap Leader for Sustainable Growth ETFSwap (ETFS) sets itself apart by providing tools that cater to both novice and seasoned investors. One of its key features is a real-time ETF price tracker, which delivers accurate and immediate market data. This level of functionality makes ETFSwap (ETFS) a standout choice for those seeking long-term growth. With a projected 33,000% surge by 2025, the real-time tracker gives investors a critical edge in managing their portfolios, surpassing the speculative nature of the Dogecoin price and the institutional focus of Ripple (XRP). ETFSwap (ETFS) expands its appeal by offering access to crypto ETFs and traditional commodities such as oil, silver, and gold. This feature bridges the gap between decentralized trading and conventional markets, allowing investors to create balanced portfolios. The diversification potential of ETFSwap (ETFS) provides stability while maintaining exposure to high-growth opportunities. Unlike the Dogecoin price and XRP price, which are tied to specific market narratives, ETFSwap (ETFS) offers a more comprehensive investment strategy that caters to a wide range of financial goals. ETFSwap (ETFS) is also introducing an AI-powered ETF screener to assist investors in identifying profitable opportunities. The addition of this feature reinforces the platform’s position as a leader among mid-cap tokens. For those aiming to benefit from the predicted 33,000% surge by 2025, the AI-powered screener simplifies complex decisions, making ETFSwap (ETFS) an indispensable part of any portfolio. Why ETFSwap (ETFS) Stands Above Dogecoin Price And Ripple (XRP) The Dogecoin price has long been a reflection of community sentiment and high-profile endorsements. With expectations of a 10x rally, the token continues to attract traders looking for short-term gains. The Dogecoin price has built its reputation on market hype and speculative activity, making it a favorite during bullish phases. However, this reliance on sentiment leaves the Dogecoin price vulnerable to rapid fluctuations. While it may provide opportunities for quick profits, it lacks the structural advantages offered by tokens like ETFSwap (ETFS), which focuses on delivering long-term value through innovative platforms and practical tools. Ripple (XRP) has established itself as a leading solution in the cross-border payments space, with its XRP price benefiting from partnerships with major financial institutions. This focus on efficiency and scalability has made Ripple (XRP) a reliable option for those seeking steady growth in 2025. Despite its advantages, the XRP price faces challenges from regulatory scrutiny and competition within the payments sector. For investors looking for diversification and exponential returns, ETFSwap (ETFS) offers a broader range of opportunities through its integration of traditional financial assets and decentralized trading mechanisms. The Dogecoin price and XRP price highlight distinct advantages, with Dogecoin offering speculative gains and Ripple (XRP) benefiting from institutional partnerships. However, ETFSwap (ETFS) delivers a more well-rounded investment experience. Its combination of real-time data, portfolio diversification, and advanced tools makes it a token designed for sustained success beyond 2025. The affordability of the ETFSwap (ETFS) price on Uniswap adds to its appeal, providing a low entry point before the token gains further traction. As the market grows, ETFSwap (ETFS) is positioned to outpace competitors, making now the ideal time to join ETFSwap (ETFS) for exponential returns. Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is presenting a range of opportunities, with the Dogecoin price targeting a 10x rally and Ripple (XRP) seeing steady growth through institutional adoption. However, ETFSwap (ETFS) leads the pack with unique features and a projected 33,000% surge by 2025, setting it apart from other mid-cap tokens. Acting now offers the chance to join a project that is reshaping the future of cryptocurrency. Don’t miss out; take a step for long-term growth and significant returns stands out as the ultimate investment choice for those seeking. Join ETFSwap (ETFS) today.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-17 15:37:00

Whales Add $7.3 Billion in BTC appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap is gaining significant attention from crypto enthusiasts following its impressive performance. Today, December 17, 2024, a prominent crypto expert made a post on X (previously Twitter) that whales have purchased a significant 70,000 BTC worth nearly $7.30 billion. Bitcoin Whales’ Rising Interest This notable BTC purchase was made over a 48-hour period, during which BTC experienced an impressive upside rally and marked a new high today. However, the current market sentiment seems quite confusing, as BTC and only a few major assets are experiencing upside momentum, while the majority are struggling to gain traction. Source: X (Previously Twitter) Current BTC Price Momentum With this massive purchase, BTC reached a new high of $108,353 today. At press time, BTC is trading near $107,850 and has experienced a price surge of over 2.25% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume increased by a modest 8%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors amid the ongoing bull run. $117 Million in BTC Inflow Despite notable participation and whale acquisitions, data shows that some long-term holders continue to dump their holdings onto exchanges, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Data from Bitcoin spot inflow/outflow revealed that exchanges have witnessed a significant $117.66 million worth of BTC inflow. Source: Coinglass This inflow refers to the transfer of assets from the long-term holder’s wallet to the exchanges, which suggests potential selling pressure and a possible price decline in the coming days. However, the recent accumulation is significantly higher than the inflow, which suggests that this won’t impact the BTC price. Why is the BTC Price Increasing? Besides the recent accumulation by whales, demand from institutions has skyrocketed as of December 16, 2024. Major firms like MicroStrategy and Semler Scientific acquired 15,350 BTC and 211 BTC, respectively, as reported by CoinPedia. The acquisitions by these whales and institutions could be a potential reason behind the ongoing bull run.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-17 15:37:11

Notably, the US SEC recently labeled the stablecoin as an unregistered crypto asset in the Ripple lawsuit. XRP Lawyer Addresses US SEC’s ‘Unregistered’ Claim on RLUSD Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan commented on an X post regarding RLUSD issuance once labeled as an ‘ unregistered ‘ crypto asset by the US SEC in its remedies-related reply brief. While the Ripple USD stablecoin received greenlight from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), some crypto investors are skeptical. The post raised questions about whether the SEC or outgoing Chair Gary Gensler can cause problems for Ripple on RLUSD stablecoin. Interestingly, the SEC has remained silent on the approval from the NFDFS. In the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit, the agency mentioned RLUSD to claim that Ripple sold crypto assets without proper registration. This does not mean immediate actions but regulatory clarity is critical for broader adoption. Morgan commented — “That is correct.” However, he added that the SEC made many incorrect statements about crypto and the regulator was wrong here too. Notably, this also includes the term ‘crypto asset securities’ for which the SEC expressed regrets to the court. “Ripple does not care about the statement. If it was meant to be a warning or a threat it has been disregarded or worked around and quite frankly neither the market nor anybody else cares because RLUSD is now regulated,” he added. Will the Stablecoin Benefit the XRP Price Rally? Ripple President Monica Long earlier addressed concerns about RLUSD stablecoin impacting XRP. He clarified that the Ripple USD and XRP will serve different purposes within the ecosystem. XRP is used as a bridge asset for cross-border transactions. Meanwhile, the RLUSD stablecoin is more about impact such as increasing liquidity, boosting utility, and expanding business. Its use cases include cross-border payments, decentralized finance, real world asset (RWA) tokenization, and crypto on-off ramps as it launches on XRP Ledger and Ethereum . It will be initially available in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, UK and Middle East regions via its distribution and exchange partners. Moreover, the stablecoin launch fueled XRP price to surge 12% today and 22% in a week. The price currently trades at $2.62, with an intraday high of $2.72. It saw trading volumes of almost $19 billion, which is up 172% over the last 24 hours. In the derivatives market, the total XRP futures open interest shoots to $4.50 billion . It skyrockets 19% in the last 24 hours, with Bybit and Binance leading the trades, as per Coinglass data .

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Blockchain and tokenomics are changing gaming, merging crypto economics with GameDev for decentralized ecosystems. Table of Contents Play-to-earn models: Changing the way players are rewarded Use of blockchain in game development The role of non-fungible tokens Economic opportunities for developers Challenges facing gaming tokenomics The future of gaming tokenomics Conclusion The gaming industry has been characterized by fast evolution for its entire life cycle. Still, it seems like there’s yet another transformation that is ushering with the advent of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Once we cross over to 2025, incorporating tokenomics into game development (GameDev) will change how we engage with them, own them, and make money off of them. The combination of gaming and tokenomics works on the basis of the economics of cryptocurrency and principles of game development. This has developed decentralized ecosystems that are fundamentally altering the way games are created and played. You might also like: Tether backs StablR to expand MiCA-compliant euro stablecoin offerings Play-to-earn models: Changing the way players are rewarded Tokenomics is being changed by the P2E, or play-to-earn, gaming model. This paradigm allows players to receive a monetary payout for completing quests, winning battles, or staking tokens. The way ‘Axie Infinity’ and ‘The Sandbox’ have been adopted within use makes it clear that P2E will eliminate the boundaries of gaming and working. P2E games allow for flourishing local online marketplaces where users are players and investors. This cryptocurrency reward enables gamers to make money from their pastime. This has significantly improved the situation in countries that don’t have enough opportunities to earn money since it gave the players a new way to outperform them. Another opportunity to compete for real money is by applying to get free spins from an online casino , which users can explore further on platforms like Slotozilla. These spins let players try their luck without spending money, making it easier to win rewards. Together, P2E games and online casinos offer new ways for people to earn in the digital world. Use of blockchain in game development There is a remarkable correlation between ‘gaming tokenomics’ and ‘blockchain.’ Blockchain provides much-needed transparency and security while making decentralization a reality. In-game currencies and assets will now become permanent features of a game rather than being created or edited through a centralized gaming server because they are stored on a blockchain. This has not only increased the trust levels amongst players and developers but also has opened doors for new growth opportunities across economic models. No longer would all the hard-worked in-game assets be vulnerable to being erased, as users would have the answer to where people store in-game assets as they would be utilizing blockchain. Moreover, developers can now build games where virtual economies operate autonomously, reducing their need to micromanage transactions or maintain centralized control over assets. The role of non-fungible tokens Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) drive the player-centric approach to gaming tokenomics and allow a player to possess true ownership of in-game elements. They also allow game developers to forge one-of-a-kind, tradable assets in the form of skins, weapons, or possibly a new character. Unlike other digital assets, however, NFTs are secured on the blockchain, making them non-transferable. For gamers, NFTs are social features and economic tools. These virtual items can be resold on other trading platforms, frequently at great prices. Gods Unchained, and Decentraland’s examples display how NFTs can convert game economies into participatory markets, which allow players to spend and generate wealth. Economic opportunities for developers Game developers find new revenue generation models in gaming tokenomics beyond game sales and microtransactions. They can access funds through initial token offerings (Itos), whereby they sell attached tokens. With these tokens, players can access exclusive content or features or share in the profits. Additionally, NFT sales have turned out to be an excellent opportunity for developers. By selling unique and limited assets, studios can earn much more and engage the players more in the process. Such financial opportunities not only promote welfare but also make independent game development more realistic than ever before. Challenges facing gaming tokenomics Tokenomics holds much promise in the form of gaming but isn’t without its challenges. For instance, some blockchain games require high payments as an entry fee, which easily prohibits casual players, hence not being favorable for acclimatization. Additionally, certain blockchain networks’ energy consumption can also cause issues and promote the need for greener alternatives. Problems begin to appear for the regulations themselves as the universe of NFTs isn’t protected by a legal framework. Countries all over the world are still figuring out how digital currencies and NFTs can be treated, thereby presenting some legal risks for both developers and players. Lastly, the chance of the games shifting towards excessive economic aspects and becoming simply a money-making mechanism instead of a source of entertainment, which would not be acceptable for most gaming addicts, isn’t negligible either. The future of gaming tokenomics In the coming years, several factors will affect the future of gaming tokenomics. Cross-platform metaverses are becoming true, in which players can move their assets and experiences from one game to another across different platforms. Such a view promises the emergence of vast new digital nations where currencies will be merged. Also, AI is poised to make a huge contribution to the future of gaming in the blockchain world. Smart AI tools can improve the gaming experience by making it adaptive and more relevant to users. Moreover, the fusion of physical entities into virtual universes further diminishes the line between the two spaces. Blockchain games are expected to see an upsurge in the next growth in mobile gaming as the low barrier of entry. Simple interfaces appeal to more users. The prospect of gaming tokenomics in the future seems bright as there are rising trends that can be incorporated while existing issues are being solved. Conclusion Thanks to gaming tokenomics, new rules are being written, and new opportunities are emerging for players and developers. The combination of blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs has shifted the reach of games, facilitating a different sense of ownership, activity, and monetization. While there are still obstacles to overcome, it is unquestionable that the developments brought about by gaming tokenomics are going to change not only the development of games but also the in-game experience. At the beginning of the year 2025, The gaming industry is poised to lead a paradigm shift across the entertainment space and beyond. The combination of blockchain and GameDev is not a dream anymore– it is the present of the next phase of gaming.

These gains are largely thought to be the result of a $12 million altcoin shopping spree by Donald Trump’s crypto project World Liberty Financial over the last week, which was followed by a $500,000 investment in Ethena on Sunday. Trump's World Liberty( @worldlibertyfi ) spent 250K $USDC to buy 134,216 $ONDO 2 hours ago.

Looking at recent numbers, Ethena has outperformed the market leaders over the last fortnight and month too. $ENA rallied 36% in the last fourteen days and 100% over the last month. Bitcoin, which has had a better end of year than many expected, only rallied 12.2% and 17.4% over the respective periods. Ethereum rallied 10.4% over the fortnight and 28% over the month. However, Ethena’s surge is now cooling off. The token dropped 1.5% overnight and currently trades at $1.15. Meanwhile, Bitcoin added 3.4% to $106,983, while Ethereum rose 2.8% to $3,999. Ethena’s trading chart over the last three months shows just how rapidly $ENA has been climbing since late November, with both resistance (red line) and support (green line) shooting up in parallel. Source: TradingView The token’s 30-day moving average is higher than its current price, and its relative strength index is falling from the already-low 43, which indicates continued selling pressure that should rebound overnight as dip buyers a re-buyers take up position to help $ENA consolidate its position before the next leg up. Not Just Ethena, Other Altcoins are Dominating Christmas Crypto Sales The altcoin fun doesn’t just end with Ethena this Christmas.

The social media platform further confirmed that the new update was part of YouTube’s plan to give creators more control over how third-party companies can use their content. The YouTube team explained that the platform’s default settings will have the update off, indicating that a creator does not wish for third-party companies to use their content. The platform added that the decision to turn the update on would allow YouTube to share eligible creator videos with chosen third-party companies. Eligible creators include those using YouTube Studio and the YouTube Studio Content Manager. Another statement from YouTube highlighted that creators could choose from a list of companies with whom they could share their content. Some of the companies reportedly on the list include Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, Apple, AI21 Labs, OpenAI, Cohere, IBM, ByteDance, and more. YouTude added that if a creator selects ‘All third-party companies,’ any company, including unlisted companies, might leverage their content. The platform reportedly chose the 18 companies listed in the AI training update due to their progression in building generative AI models. They also reportedly chose the companies with the highest potential to collaborate with creators. YouTube confirmed that other companies building AI models that wish to work with creators can apply for the program.

A reported interview this year with the CEO of Viggle Hang Chu revealed that the company had been using publicly available videos to train its AI model. Another interview with the OpenAI CTO Mira Murati in the Wall Street Journal revealed that the AI company used publicly available content to train the Sora AI model. Google and YouTube have also been subject to similar accusations. Several users highlighted that the companies used their content without consent or compensation. The video-sharing platform assured users in September that it would address the issue. The platform announced the launch of AI detection tools to protect all creators. Content ID is an identification program that will allow partners to detect and manage AI content on the platform that uses their voices. The second tool will allow different parties to identify content on YouTube that uses their faces. The video streaming platform also promised to uphold its privacy terms, prohibiting the unauthorized access and use of creator content on the platform. The video-sharing service further assured users that it would continue investing in services that detect and prevent illegal access to creators’ content. YouTube opens creator access to the AI era The YouTube team revealed in the recent update that the steps it is taking are a way to open up creators to the AI era. The video-sharing platform insisted that the update was a way of helping creators understand the value of their content in AI development. YouTube also assured that it would use its users’ feedback to expand features that enable more collaborations between creators and AI companies. YouTube and Google have notably informed users of their use of creator content to improve products, services, and experiences on the platforms, including AI applications. The video-sharing platform insisted that it uses all content according to updated terms that creators agree to. An example of tools to improve user experience through AI includes the experimental Dream Screen for YouTube Shorts.

Bloomberg cited a person familiar with the meeting who asked not to be identified, who said Trump and Marszalek discussed appointments related to the cryptocurrency industry, including for the finance departments, Congress and the new administration. The source, who reported that the Bitcoin (BTC) reserve was also discussed at the meeting, said the exchange said, “We look forward to working with the new administration to develop and advance clear regulations for the cryptocurrency industry so that the US can become a global leader in digital assets and innovation.” Marszalek's meeting with Trump comes after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong's phone call with Trump last month, with more names from the cryptocurrency industry expected to meet with Trump.

Meanwhile, Rollblock is dominating the DeFi market with its viral GambleFi project and is poised for 880% gains before the end of its presale stages. Notcoin (NOT) Goes Viral After Launching New Reward Scheme Notcoin’s ecosystem is experiencing an impressive rebound as investors regained interest in the token earlier this week. Since Notcoin has recently launched a new Earn as a Community reward initiative, the platform is making it easier for Notcoin investors to benefit from the growing Telegram ecosystem. These rewards come from new projects on Notcoin’secosystem that want more market exposure. Notcoin is currently trading for $0.0077 after an intraday surge of 1.91%. Notcoin’s trading volume has declined by 37.71% during this period which suggests low network activity despite the anticipated airdrops. Since Notcoin’s RSI has recovered to the neutral zone already, analysts believe Notcoin can surge towards a new peak at $0.018200 by the end of Q4. Floki (FLOKI) Launches New Debit Card to Increase Crypto Adoption Floki has just launched its new Visa debit card which allows investors to spend digital assets at POS machines anywhere in the world. Since Floki’s card has no transaction fees or exchange rate fees, traders are rushing to invest in Floki to get their hands on a physical or virtual card. Since the card can be funded with Floki tokens, Floki is experiencing a huge surge in its demand. Floki is currently trading for $0.0002423 after an intraday surge of 1.26%. Since Floki’s debit card is expected to attract millions in capital inflow, analysts expect Floki’s ongoing rally to continue throughout early 2025. Since Floki’s Momentum indicator is already suggesting bullish dominance, analysts believe Floki could set a price target of $0.0005596. Rollblock (RBLK) Dominates DeFi Market in Q4 Altseason with Viral GambleFi Protocol Rollblock’s new GambleFi protocol is becoming an overnight sensation in the DeFi market as the platform has already accumulated more than $7 million in its presale stages. Since Rollblock is revolutionizing the global gambling market which is already valued at more than $500 billion per annum, analysts expect this new low cap crypto to target the gains of the Top 10 cryptocurrencies in early 2025. The main driver behind such bullish predictions is Rollblock’s commitment to user experience and security. Instead of only offering minimal security like traditional iGamblingplatforms, Rollblock has integrated Ethereum’s immutable blockchain to record all financial and betting information. Since this information is encrypted, Rollblock users can rest assured that their bets are 100% secure and unchangeable after they are placed. Rollblock is also breaking barriers to entry in the DeFi space by offering its presale tokens for a low price of only $0.0415 each. Since Rollblock’s circulating supply is capped at 1 billion tokens, analysts expect RBLK to experience strong deflationary pressure after its launch on the open market. This means that the forces of demand and supply will constantly drive Rollblock’s price upwards and increase the ROI for investors. Aside from the deflationary tokenomics, Rollblock also offers staking rewards with the highest APYs in the market. Since Rollblock uses 30% of its weekly revenue to purchase tokens on the open market, 40% of these are distributed to long-term holders as rewards. In addition, Rollblock also offers huge bonuses to VIP-tier presale holders which makes now the perfect time to invest in RBLK before the limited presale supply runs out.

Ethereum Blockchain Runs on Proof-of-Stake Technology The London hard fork is a significant Ethereum blockchain upgrade. It changed the network from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently shared his thoughts on X (formerly Twitter). He explained how Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is more decentralized than Proof-of-Work (PoW). Important Upgrades to Ethereum Blockchain Here are some key upgrades in the past five years that shaped Ethereum as the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. 2024 : Cancun-Deneb (“Dencun”) : This upgrade aimed to improve Ethereum’s scalability, security, and usability, setting the stage for further enhancements. 2023 : Shanghai-Capella (“Shapella”) : Enabled the withdrawal of staked Ether (ETH), marking a significant milestone in Ethereum’s transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. 2022 : Paris (The Merge) : Successfully transitioned Ethereum from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, reducing energy consumption and increasing security. Bellatrix : Prepared the Ethereum network for The Merge by introducing the necessary PoS consensus logic. Gray Glacier : Delayed the “difficulty bomb” that would have slowed down the network, ensuring a smooth transition to PoS. 2021 : Arrow Glacier : Delayed the “difficulty bomb” again, providing more time for the transition to PoS. Altair : Introduced several improvements to the Beacon Chain, including better validator incentives and enhanced security. London : Implemented the highly anticipated EIP-1559, which reformed the transaction fee market, making it more efficient and user-friendly. Berlin : Introduced several protocol upgrades, including improved gas efficiency and enhanced security features. 2020 : Beacon Chain genesis : Launched the Beacon Chain, marking the beginning of Ethereum’s transition to PoS. Staking deposit contract deployed : Enabled users to deposit ETH and participate in the PoS consensus algorithm. Muir Glacier : Delayed the “difficulty bomb” to ensure a smooth transition to PoS. ETH Gas’ Effect on Ether Prices The blockchain upgrades Ethereum receives aim to solve the trilemma of blockchain, i.e., balancing decentralization, security, and scalability. The switch to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) enhanced these aspects. Ethereum’s transaction fees (gas fees) plummeted post-upgrade, drawing more investors. Gas fees are like taxes, measured in Gwei, required for secure transactions. As of December 17, the gas fee for a transaction on the ETH network as of No data found for ethereum on 16 minutes ago is 12 Gwei. When Ethereum’s on-chain value grows, presenting opportunities, investors flock, driving gas fees up. This typically occurs during market upswings, peaking at all-time highs.

With sBTC, investors can access decentralized finance (DeFi) applications while maintaining Bitcoin’s core security principles. Its mainnet release follows the Nakamoto upgrade, which introduced faster transaction speeds and 100% Bitcoin finality to the Stacks network. Implemented in October, the upgrade provided the technical foundation for the successful launch of sBTC. Deposit-Only Mode According to a press release sent to CryptoPotato , sBTC deposits will be available on the Stacks mainnet starting December 17, 2024, with withdrawals expected in March 2025. L2 Labs noted that the initial phase of the sBTC launch introduces deposit-only functionality, allowing users to mint sBTC by depositing Bitcoin on Stacks. The platform has set a temporary cap of 1,000 BTC to manage liquidity and facilitate early development. “The BTC cap provides liquidity for developers to utilize sBTC and for further integrations with institutional custodians and additional partners,” the platform stated in the release. According to L2 Labs, the initial cap will gradually expand to accommodate more users as sBTC withdrawals become available in the first half of 2025 and the protocol transitions towards a fully open, permissionless signer set . Reward for Early Participants Perks have been set aside for early participants. According to the release, depositors will receive up to 5% annual Bitcoin rewards, paid in sBTC, simply for holding the asset. sBTC’s launch marks a pivotal moment for the Bitcoin ecosystem as it opens up new possibilities for developers and users to build and utilize DeFi applications on the Bitcoin network. Commenting on the latest release, Andre Serrano, Head of Product at Bitcoin L2 Labs, said: “sBTC is a major milestone for the Bitcoin ecosystem. With sBTC, Bitcoin becomes highly capable beyond a store of value, unlocking the full potential of BTC in decentralized applications.” The post sBTC Launches on Stacks Mainnet With Deposit-Only Functionality appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-17 16:00:52

Pudgy Toys are linked to the Pudgy World metaverse, which operates on Igloo’s Ethereum Layer 2 Abstract Chain. Once the mainnet is live, toy holders will be able to bridge their tokens through LayerZero. PENGU tokens are set to trade on several centralized exchanges, including Binance, Bybit, and OKX. Binance announced that PENGU will be integrated into its ecosystem, leveraging features such as Binance Simple Earn, Binance Convert, and Binance Auto-Invest. The Pudgy Penguins ecosystem includes collectible items like Rogs and SBTs. Rogs are rare, limited-edition items within the Pudgy Penguins universe, while SBTs represent achievements or participation and are non-transferable. These assets contribute to the growing utility and engagement surrounding the project. At press time, PENGU tokens are priced at $0.004999 per token, with analysts expecting the value to grow following its listing on exchanges.

This price surge is thanks to fundamentals such as Ripple’s RLUSD launch, which provides a bullish outlook for XRP. Why The XRP Price Is Up Today The XRP price has surged over 10% in the last 24 hours thanks to bullish fundamentals such as the RLUSD launch. As CoinGape reported, the RLUSD stablecoin went live today, sparking a bullish sentiment in the XRP ecosystem. This stablecoin launch presents a bullish outlook for XRP, considering the amount of liquidity it will inject into the coin’s ecosystem. In an X post , crypto analyst Egrag Crypto highlighted how bullish the RLUSD launch is. The analyst noted that the total market cap for stablecoins is still hovering around $200 billion. According to him, this signifies immense growth potential, of which XRP could become a major player in its ties to the stablecoin. Amid this XRP price surge, thanks to the RLUSD launch, crypto analysts have provided a bullish outlook for the crypto. Veteran trader Peter Brandt said that XRP appears to be resolving a half-mast flag. If so, the trader added that the distance to the upside should equal advance into the tip of the flag. Meanwhile, crypto analyst MikyBULL Crypto stated that the XRP chart is so clean and bullish that it can easily trade above $5 in 2025. A rally to that price level would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for XRP. Wave 3 Impulsive Move To The Upside Is Heating Up Crypto analyst CasiTrades stated that the Wave 3 impulsive move is heating up. This came as the analyst revealed that there has been some confirmation of this upward trend as XRP has broken through multiple local resistances, with volume and Relative Strength Index (RSI) at “extremely high levels.” CasiTrades added that there is still plenty of room to go as this Wave 3 hasn’t reached its final target yet. According to her, this Wave 3 is the largest wave of the cycle, breaking its own 5 waves. The standard XRP target is the 1.618 extension, but it could often extend further, reaching 2.618, 3.618, 4.618, or beyond. The crypto analyst highlighted the key levels to watch for this Wave 3 based on the Fibonacci extension levels. The 1.618 Fib puts the XRP price at $3.23, while 2.618, 3.618, and 4.618 puts XRP at $3.81, $4.40, and $4.98, respectively. As the analyst noted, these price levels will test XRP’s ATH at $3.80. However, the “big moment” comes when the ATH is not just broken but becomes a strong support level. If XRP quickly flips its ATH into support, CasiTrades predicts that the crypto could see the “explosive move” market participants have anticipated for a while now.

However, a new project, 1Fuel, is now catching the attention of ADA and SHIB backers as a potentially perfect addition to their portfolios. This article examines the unique features of 1Fuel and explains why its crypto presale is an investment opportunity worth considering. Trade Your Way To a Fortune With 1Fuel 1Fuel is quickly emerging as one of the most promising DeFi projects of the season, thanks to its impressive suite of benefits and standout features. Among these, its advanced cross-chain functionality truly sets it apart. Unlike traditional crypto trading platforms, 1Fuel achieves full decentralization through a robust cross-chain bridge, seamlessly connecting multiple networks within the crypto industry. The platform’s cross-chain system features a user-friendly one-click transaction model, enabling traders to effortlessly choose and trade any coin of their choice. Additionally, 1Fuel offers a decentralized P2P exchange, allowing users to connect directly with trading partners for transparent and secure transactions. Best of all, this exchange operates without any additional fees or hidden levies, ensuring maximum value for its users. Cardano Witnesses Huge Growth Trend in Price and Market Activity Like many other cryptos this altcoin season, ADA has had a good run this past month as it surged by an impressive 82.85%. For the past week, the token has been trading around the $1 mark after hitting its support level at $0.90 on Dec. 10. This price action has driven ADA above its 50-day EMA, so there could be some for growth in its future. However, the price of ADA‘s isn’t the only thing echoing growth in its ecosystem. The DeFi activity of ADA has also expanded exponentially. After only 2 days, ADA's TVL rose from $560 million to $644 million, according to DeFiLlama data. As such, if ADA can maintain both price and ecosystem growth, it could very well be en route to a new ATH by the end of 2024. Will Shiba Inu's Trend Continue Long Term? Over the past week, SHIB has been trading at around $0.000027, much to the delight of its investors. This price is remarkable, as it has gained almost 160% on its August low. While this growth is already noteworthy, some analysts believe the coin is on the cusp of a strong bullish breakout in the upcoming altcoin season. An X post by SHIB Mortal predicted that Shiba Inu could reach $1 during this bull run. One major factor driving this optimism in SHIB’s surge is its ongoing token burn. Data from ShibBurn shows that there has recently been a 425% burn rate increase, with 71,122,860 coins burned. Just a little over a month ago, SHIB formed golden cross and cup-and-handle patterns as its 200-day and 50-day moving averages crossed. These patterns are a sign that SHIB will go bullish soon and once this momentum starts, it might be sustained for the long term. Conclusion Want to see why ADA and SHIB backers are so hyped about 1Fuel? Take the chance to buy OFT at $0.012 each via 1Fuel's presale. Don't miss the chance to enjoy the benefits of what could be the best crypto presale of 2024.
