This achievement sets the stage for the company’s operations under the name Bitpanda Broker MENA DMCC, marking its first foray outside the European market. Dubai’s growing prominence as a digital finance and innovation hub presents a strategic opportunity for Bitpanda to tap into the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region’s burgeoning crypto market. Bitpanda Goes Global! We’re proud to announce that we’ve secured In-Principle-Approval from the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority in the UAE. This achievement takes us one step closer to offering our full range of services in this fast-growing global hub for digital assets.… pic.twitter.com/09bBm2oJpG — Bitpanda (@Bitpanda_global) December 16, 2024 Bitpanda’s In-Principle Approval: Is UEA Growing Stronger? While this milestone is a critical step, the road to full operational approval involves further measures, including setting up a fully operational office in Dubai, onboarding a regional management team, and implementing VARA-compliant infrastructure to support its services. Eric Demuth, Co-Founder and CEO of Bitpanda, articulated the importance of this achievement, stating: “In Europe, we have established ourselves as the most trusted and regulated digital asset platform. Now, we are scaling this proven model globally, with Dubai and the UAE serving as our strategic launchpad for international expansion.” He continued; “The opportunities are immense, and we are uniquely positioned to seize them as both Europe’s leading crypto broker and a top infrastructure provider in the digital assets space.” VARA’s progressive regulatory framework emphasizes investor protection while fostering innovation, a balance that aligns seamlessly with Bitpanda’s compliance-first ethos. Fabian Reinisch, General Counsel of Bitpanda, also remarked: “Securing VARA’s in-principle approval in under eight months reflects the strength of VARA’s regulatory guidelines and our commitment to innovation and compliance.” With this latest regulatory compliance move, Bitpanda will increase user trust and facilitate sustained growth in the MENA region. Strategic Expansion into a Dynamic Region Bitpanda’s entry into the UAE forms part of its broader strategy to establish a global footprint in the crypto space. The opening of an office at the DMCC Crypto Centre in Dubai earlier this year laid the groundwork for this expansion. Additionally, Bitpanda has forged strategic partnerships with key financial institutions, including The National Bank of Ras Al Khaimah (RAKBANK) and CoinMENA , a prominent licensed crypto platform in the UAE. Dubai’s reputation as a forward-thinking hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation was a major factor in Bitpanda’s decision to expand into the region. Initiatives like the DMCC Crypto Centre and VARA’s regulatory framework make the UAE a magnet for digital finance innovators. Demuth also expressed confidence in the UAE’s potential, noting: “The UAE’s regulatory framework fosters innovation while prioritizing investor protection. These principles align perfectly with our mission to offer safe and trusted access to digital assets worldwide.” Bitpanda’s expansion has also been described as a strategic move to bridge the gap between Europe’s regulatory rigor and the UAE’s dynamic market. Bitpanda has been proactive in fostering innovation and collaboration as part of its global strategy. Its partnership with Societe Generale Forge , the blockchain subsidiary of Societe Generale, is a notable example. This collaboration focuses on advancing euro-denominated stablecoins, such as EUR CoinVertible (EURCV), as integral components of the global financial ecosystem. Looking ahead, Bitpanda plans to roll out Bitpanda Fusion , a high-volume trading product launched last week for advanced traders. This tool aggregates liquidity from major exchanges, catering to the needs of ambitious crypto traders in the MENA region. With all these moves, Bitpanda is on to something for the UAE and beyond.

Pharma Bro mentioned on the Shkreli Planet podcast that Saylor was drunk on the idea. Shkreli added that the situation was a big bubble that would not end well for the company. The asset management company introduced Bitcoin as its treasury reserve asset. Saylor described the digital asset as ‘digital gold’ and mentioned its stability as a store of value. The asset manager’s CEO further mentioned MicroStrategy’s plan to leverage BTC as a hedge against inflation. Michael Saylor also introduced the idea of BTC as a reserve currency for institutions in his Bitcoin playbook. Shkreli pointed out MicroStrategy’s plan to continuously purchase Bitcoin as part of the company’s business model. The asset management company first purchased BTC in 2020 worth $250 million to get 21,454. MicroStrategy made the most recent purchase of BTC worth $1.5 billion on December 15, increasing its holdings by 15,350 coins and bringing its total to 439,000 BTC. Pharma Bro also revealed during the discussion that he was shorting MicroStrategy stocks. Despite this claim, the investor did not reveal the size of his position. Shkreli added that his trade was a bit painful but fun. MicroStrategy stocks have still been rising despite Pharma Bro’s negative sentiment. MSTR has been up 490% this year, allowing the company to join the Nasdaq-100 index. Martin Shkreli says Saylor is not a favorable BTC advocate Shkreli further criticized Saylor’s advocacy for BTC. The investor suggested that the MicroStrategy CEO was not the best advocate for the currency despite being among the loudest. Shkreli also doubted Saylor’s commentary on BTC, citing a lack of credibility. The investor mentioned Saylor’s recent presentation to Microsoft shareholders. The MicroStrategy CEO shared his thoughts with the technology conglomerate on December 1. Saylor suggested that Bitcoin was the next technology wave, and Microsoft could not afford to miss it. The executive of the asset management firm suggested that Microsoft redirect its debt, stock buybacks, cash payouts, and other income sources toward BTC. Saylor further explained that the action could increase the company’s value by trillions while reducing investor and shareholder risks. Microsoft shareholders voted no to the proposal, citing reservations due to the coin’s volatility. However, the company’s board still highlighted that it would monitor developments in the BTC markets. Shkreli discussed the vote turnout, mentioning the 0.5% ‘yes’ vote and describing it as the worst proxy vote he had ever seen. The investor added that the negative outcome made him slightly bearish on BTC. Shkreli speculates on the BTC price outcome Pharma Bro speculated the outcome of BTC prices in relation to MicroStrategy’s cryptocurrency acquisitions. In his opinion, the coin’s price should have spiked after the billions of dollars the asset management company has injected into BTC purchases. Shkreli then speculated that the current price showed a bearish BTC sentiment. The investor insisted that his prediction did not mean the coin’s price would plunge. BTC has made notable steps, reaching a new all-time high of $107,104 today. The coin is trading 0.18% lower than the new ATH but over 3% higher than yesterday’s price. Despite the ongoing discussions, Shkreli further mentioned that he expected the U.S. to stockpile only a little BTC. Shkreli highlighted that the next government could undo the progress even if Trump’s government accumulates BTC. President-elect Donald Trump has been preparing to make Bitcoin the strategic reserve asset of the U.S. Treasury. Trump has also promised that the government will continue with significant BTC mining projects and acquisitions.

One Solana memecoin innovation, Fartcoin, recently captured attention with a staggering 220% rally, proving that altcoins can use humor to drive value. A leading Solana memecoin expert claims to have discovered another hidden gem: RCO Finance (RCOF) . Could this altcoin replicate or even surpass Fartcoin’s trajectory? Fartcoin: The Solana Memecoin That Redefined Viral Success Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) , a flatulence-themed token built on the Solana blockchain, has taken the Solana memecoin world by storm. Breaking its previous records, Fartcoin recently hit an all-time high of $0.52, catapulting its market cap to over $520 million. This explosive growth highlights the unpredictable power of Solana memecoins , which thrive on internet humor and community-driven momentum. Fueled by its absurd origin story, Fartcoin emerged from the Infinite Backrooms, where Solana’s Pump.fun launchpad transformed a whimsical AI-powered idea into a thriving token. With a 69% surge in just 24 hours and a 154% rise over the week, Fartcoin’s gains overshadow even broader crypto market trends. This Solana memecoin has captured attention, partly due to its simplicity and relatability, with slogans like “Hot air rises” becoming rallying cries for its community. As Fartcoin proves, the Solana memecoin market balances humor, speculation, and ROI, offering lessons for projects like RCO Finance (RCOF), which seek to replicate this rise with added utility.

The first on Markus’s list is Dogecoin, which is quite expected since he is one of its creators. DOGE was created as a meme coin but has since gained a lot of adoption and has a large community of users. The digital asset has also been endorsed by celebrities such as Elon Musk. On Dogecoin’s 11th anniversary on 6th December, Markus said that he did not expect the impact from the coin, which he initially conceived as a joke. He stated, ” it is extremely surreal that some silly thing I made in a few hours has had the impact on the world that it has.” Bitcoin, the first digital currency in the world, was also on the list. Markus recognized its historical significance and its position as one of the early players in the crypto industry. Avalanche and Ethereum highlight utility Markus selected Avalanche as the third one because it is fast and scalable, and more people are joining the protocol. Avalanche is a blockchain platform that is based on Ethereum and has been on the rise due to the fact that it allows for the operation of real world applications that are efficient. According to Markus, Ethereum made it to his list because of its performance in the area of smart contracts and dApps. He shared his experience of positive interactions with Ethereum as he engaged in business with NFTs and other projects. Although the high gas fees are still a problem of Ethereum, it is the most versatile and popular coin among other cryptocurrencies. Rounding out the list was Solana, which was hailed for its expanding ecosystem and investment effectiveness. Markus also pointed out that the platform had been used in many projects and has helped build its image as a significant competitor in the market. At the beginning of the year, Markus even challenged Solana and Ethereum communities to a memecoins-themed contest. When asked why he didn’t include XRP in the list of currencies he owns, Markus replied that he doesn’t own any XRP and jokingly said that he might if he receives some as a gift. i own 0 xrp if someone sent me a million dollars worth i would probably like it more — Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) December 16, 2024 Trusting crypto over tradition Besides these choices, Markus recently disclosed that he had a shift in the perception of cryptocurrencies in general. In a recent post on the X, he confessed to liking crypto more than ever before. i’m beginning to appreciate cryptocurrency so much more recently and not simply because of the price increases (though ngl that helps lol) — Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) December 7, 2024 Though prices have gone up, he stressed that there was a more fundamental cause. He believes in code supremacy over humans because, according to him, it is easier to bribe a human than to tamper with well audited code. One follower pointed out that crypto can help with high bank fees, and Markus agreed that banking deserves disruption. According to him, the more one understands conventional finance, the more compelling the case for crypto is. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $106,000, while Ethereum crossed $4,000. Dogecoin also became the seventh largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, trading at $0.4 before a slight decline.

The launch was carried out in partnership with Securitize, a leader in the tokenization of real-world assets. Ethena Labs Expands Stablecoin Use Cases: USDtb Considered for CEX Collateral and Tokenization According to the announcement on Monday, USDtb functions similarly to established fiat-backed stablecoins like USDC and USDT, maintaining a 1:1 reserve ratio using cash or cash-equivalent assets. The stablecoin allows unrestricted transfers, offering users flexibility and accessibility. Today we are launching our new stablecoin product, USDtb, backed by @BlackRock 's BUIDL Fund in partnership with @Securitize Read below for full details pic.twitter.com/mSf3mWv3oF — Ethena Labs (@ethena_labs) December 16, 2024 A distinguishing feature of USDtb is its scalability, made possible by BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, which constitutes 90% of USDtb’s reserves. The remaining 10% consists of stablecoins and institutional-grade tokenized U.S. Treasury products, facilitating redemptions and liquidity. This represents the highest allocation to BUIDL among any stablecoin currently on the market. Unlike Ethena’s other stablecoin, USDe, USDtb is an entirely independent product designed to meet diverse user needs and exchange requirements. Its distinct risk profile provides an alternative to USDe while also supporting USDe’s stability in challenging market conditions. Ethena’s Risk Committee recently approved a proposal to use USDtb as a backing asset for USDe . Ethena plans to reallocate assets from USDe to USDtb during negative funding rates to mitigate risks and improve resilience. USDtb leverages LayerZero technology, enabling seamless cross-chain transfers across multiple networks. At launch, USDtb will be available on Ethereum mainnet, Base, Solana, and Arbitrum. It will also be bridgeable via Stargate for enhanced interoperability. The stablecoin’s infrastructure has been extensively audited to ensure security and compliance. Leading auditors, including Quantstamp, Cyfrin, and Pashov, completed three full audits of the core USDtb smart contracts in October, with no high or medium-level vulnerabilities detected. Additionally, a community-driven audit by Code4rena reported no significant findings. Ethena has partnered with several prominent institutions to support USDtb’s launch. Copper, Zodia, Komainu, and Coinbase Web3 Wallet provide custody solutions. Liquidity providers include Jump, Cumberland, Wintermute, Amber, GSR, and SCB Limited. USDtb is also being evaluated for broader use cases. It is under consideration as margin collateral on centralized exchanges that have partnered with Ethena and for allocation in Spark’s $1 billion Tokenization Grand Prix. How USDtb’s Launch Expands Ethena’s Stablecoin Ecosystem and Boosts User Choice USDtb has been submitted for Spark’s $1 billion Tokenization Grand Prix, a competition to boost liquidity for tokenized assets. If selected, USDtb could see a significant increase in adoption and utility. Ethena’s proposal includes mechanisms for swapping between USDtb and USDe, potentially improving allocation strategies in response to market conditions. With USDtb’s launch, Ethena Labs aims to expand its stablecoin offerings while providing users with a diversified, secure, and scalable product. CoinGecko recently reported that Ethena’s USDe market capitalization surpassed $4.3 billion as of Nov. 29. CCData’s analysis attributes this growth to increased interest in the Ethena ecosystem, driven by its proposal to introduce revenue sharing for Ethena (ENA) token holders.

This stablecoin, designed to raise the bar for compliance, utility, and transparency, will officially go live on December 17, 2024. The wait is over: RLUSD launches globally tomorrow! https://t.co/mYcyyX6Vre — Ripple (@Ripple) December 16, 2024 According to the announcement , RLUSD promises to cater to institutional needs and set new standards for trust and reliability within the stablecoin market. The timing of this launch aligns with increasing calls for regulatory clarity in the United States and beyond. Ripple’s decision to develop RLUSD under the stringent New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) limited purpose trust charter highlights its emphasis on regulatory compliance. RLUSD is backed by U.S. dollar deposits, government bonds, and cash equivalents and is engineered to maintain stability. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, emphasized that RLUSD represents years of expertise in seamlessly integrating crypto with the traditional financial system. He furthered: “Early on, Ripple made a deliberate choice to launch our stablecoin under the NYDFS limited purpose trust company charter, widely regarded as the premier regulatory standard worldwide.” With platforms like Uphold, MoonPay, Archax, and CoinMENA set to host RLUSD initially and additional listings expected soon, the stablecoin’s global rollout is set for rapid traction because of the attention it has garnered. Ripple’s RLUSD: A New Standard for Stablecoins? Ripple’s strategy revolves around creating a stablecoin that meets and exceeds the expectations of financial institutions, regulators, and retail users. Each RLUSD token will be fully collateralized, ensuring stability and liquidity even in volatile markets. To reinforce this commitment, Ripple claimed it would publish third-party attestations of RLUSD’s reserves monthly, ensuring full accountability and fostering trust. From a functional perspective, RLUSD is set to play a critical role in various use cases. Institutions can leverage the stablecoin for instant settlement of cross-border payments, enhanced liquidity management, and seamless integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Ripple’s vision also extends to creating a reliable bridge between fiat currencies and the blockchain ecosystem, simplifying on-ramps and off-ramps for users navigating between the two worlds. Furthermore, RLUSD is set to be a cornerstone for collateralizing tokenized real-world assets, such as commodities and securities, on-chain. This innovative approach promises to drive the adoption of blockchain-based finance while maintaining robust compliance measures. Ripple’s Ripple Payments division is also set to incorporate RLUSD into its operations early next year, which could give it global relevance. Ripple Payments has already processed over $70 billion in transaction volume and established near-global coverage, spanning over 90 payout markets. This integration will expand RLUSD’s utility, enabling enterprises to settle international payments efficiently while enjoying blockchain technology’s cost-effectiveness and speed. Expert Leadership and Global Vision Ripple’s ambitious plans for RLUSD are bolstered by the expertise of its advisory board, which the addition of two financial heavyweights has further strengthened. Raghuram Rajan, former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, and Kenneth Montgomery, former First Vice President and COO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Despite all the massive preparations surrounding it, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has recently warned of potential supply shortages and price volatility for RLUSD . Despite its 1:1 parity with the dollar, pre-launch speculative activity has driven inflated bids for RLUSD, with one bid valuing 1 RLUSD at 511 XRP—over $1,200. Schwartz downplayed the anomaly, emphasizing that RLUSD’s price would stabilize near $1 once supply increases, and urged against speculation.

In a recent post , he shared that Cardano is on the brink of achieving what he calls a decentralized revolution. Charles explained that the project is nearing its final milestones—approval of a budget system and a community-ratified constitution—steps he believes will make the platform unstoppable. “It’s messy and tough,” he said of governance, “but it’s the only way to include everyone.” For Charlie, this is personal. “I’ll never apologize for being passionate about this outcome. It’s my life’s work.” Cardano’s roadmap has been long and complex, but with these developments, the project is eyeing 2025 as the year it reaches full decentralization. The stakes? Nothing less than taking over the blockchain world. Cardano’s Chang Hard Fork reshapes governance The Chang Hard Fork, launched on September 1, represents a turning point for Cardano. This major upgrade pushed the blockchain closer to its ultimate goal: a fully decentralized governance system. Key features included the introduction of a constitutional committee, improved on-chain voting mechanisms, and the much-anticipated rollout of Plutus v3, which brought more advanced smart contract capabilities. The constitutional committee, acting as an interim governing body, was designed to oversee governance decisions during this transitional phase. It’s temporary, though—once the community approves the ratified constitution, the committee will dissolve. From there, governance will rest entirely in the hands of ADA holders. Charles sees this as a step toward the Voltaire phase, the final stage of Cardano’s development roadmap. Voltaire envisions a blockchain that funds itself through a treasury system and gives ADA holders full control over its evolution. In Charlie’s words, these upgrades are not about short-term price movements but about “ensuring Cardano thrives in the long run.” The Chang upgrade also introduced Delegate Representatives (DReps), allowing ADA holders to vote indirectly through elected representatives. This system encourages wider participation while maintaining efficiency. ADA struggles in a volatile market While Cardano’s governance upgrades grab headlines, ADA’s market performance tells a different story. As of press time, ADA is trading at $0.934, down 3.26% in the past twenty-four hours. Despite the current downturn, investor sentiment remains strong. The Fear & Greed Index for ADA sits at 74, signaling greed. Over the past month, ADA has seen gains on 67% of trading days, showing some resilience even amid market uncertainty. Analysts predict ADA will continue to fluctuate, with a trading range of $0.934 to $1.10 expected for December. The average price is projected at $1.02, but much depends on broader market conditions, which is incredibly bullish thanks to incoming US president Donald Trump.

However, the year ended with Bitcoin surpassing $100K. Another notable growth is seen with Solana, which drove the meme coin market. Messari data analysts compiled a two-part report on the trends and narratives in the crypto industry in 2024. The report, authored by Messari’s enterprise analysts and experts, explored various themes, including the rise of artificial intelligence in the crypto sector . Messari analysts reflect on 2024 inflationary worries Messari calls 2024 the “climbing wall of worry” because inflation uncertainty left investors wondering if the Fed’s monetary policies would trigger a recession. However, 2024 concludes with Bitcoin surpassing $100K after the crypto market overcame the macro obstacles of a weakening labor market. Along with the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the report underlines AI as the 2024 highlight. The report read in part; “The market is beginning to price in the potential for AI-driven productivity boosts.” Messari also calls 2024 the year of Solana. The report underlined advancements in Solana’s technology and adoption, making it a hub for memecoin trading. In the year, memecoins themselves remained wildly popular, capturing retail interest. Notably, user adoption surged globally, with apps like Phantom and Polymarket onboarding millions. The analysts also discovered that stablecoins have also become essential in emerging markets. Meanwhile, decentralized infrastructure (DePIN) gained traction in industries like energy and telecommunications. The report also touched on regulatory challenges and market volatility. However, the report revealed that the industry showed resilience and innovation. In the macro context, the analysts noted that crypto market trends faced challenges such as lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase. They added that government asset sales and Mt.Gox repayments also played a part in the volatility experienced in 2024. Messari highlighted the pressures eased after Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. The analysts added the president pledged to protect innovation, self-custody, and Bitcoin mining. According to the researchers, these policies signalled a friendly environment for cryptocurrency that emphasized Bitcoin as an innovation driver and strategic asset. Messari analysts discuss crypto sectorial highlights in 2024 The researchers highlighted some sectorial advancements, including the intersection of artificial intelligence and the crypto ecosystem. The analysts reported the intersection exposed the crypto ecosystem to content creation and gaming frontiers. Messari analysts also confirmed that NFTs gained popularity in 2024, especially in enhancing monetization and digital ownership. The analysts predicted that these trends would drive the adoption of cryptocurrencies in the years ahead. Messari also commented on the introduction of Bitcoin stalking in 2024. They added that Babylon, BTC’s first stalking protocol, enabled holders to stake their assets and earn rewards without giving up control of their assets. In the report, Messari predicted that even as the BTC network changes, BTC programmability and stalking remain nascent. The analysts highlighted the path worth monitoring as layers on BTC and AVSs.They predicted these could unlock the utmost levels of economic security and decentralization. However, the analysts disclosed that in 2024, users often preferred the performance capabilities of networks such as Base and Solana. They added that users overlooked decentralization and security. The researchers warned BTC builders could have difficulty competing against other networks if the trend continued.

Crypto Bitlord claimed that the real price target for XRP is not $6 as some commentators said but $589, adding that those who dismissed this three-figure target are not ambitious enough. You’re not delusional enough with your price targets $XRP $589 — Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7) December 16, 2024 The crypto analyst argued that the prices being forecast by several market observers are conservative estimates, believing that $589 per unit is very feasible. Previously, Crypto Bitlord had already stated that XRP would reach the three-figure price. However, he received derogatory remarks from investors for what they claimed as an ambitious dream. Now, with the crypto asset performing very well in the bull market, Crypto Bitlord was able to fire back at them, calling them not “delusional” enough. Smoking Crack? Several traders in the XRP community do not share the same vision as Crypto Bitlord, seeing the target of $589 as not feasible. Earlier this month, another crypto analyst, Tony Edwards, downplayed the $589 target, saying that the target is a “fantasy.” Edward argued that astronomical price predictions for the coin are delusional, saying, “People calling for $589, $1,000, or $10,000 are “smoking crack.” My $XRP price target for this cycle $5-$8. It could go a bit higher but I’m gonna play it safe and be conservative.

Edward estimated the price rally would put XRP between $5 and $8. Altcoin Performing Well Data revealed that XRP benefits greatly from the ongoing crypto bull market driven by Donald Trump reclaiming the White House.

The failed exchange confirmed this in an announcement today while also updating its claims portal. According to the information on the claim portal , creditors can also receive their bankruptcy payouts in stablecoins. This will be possible for creditors by converting their fiat for digital assets, including stablecoins. FTX Distribution Portal (Source: X) Meanwhile, both BitGo and Kraken have confirmed their partnership. In its announcement, BitGo noted that FTX retail users could reclaim their funds securely via its platform. The firm’s CEO, Mike Belshe, noted that it is proud to support FTX. He said: “With our long-standing reputation as the most secure choice in the industry, we work hard to bring institutional-grade service to both retail and institutional clients, ensuring users the peace of mind they need to manage and grow their assets safely.” As for Kraken , it confirmed the agreement in a blog post, stating it will assist the FTX and its affiliated debtors with distributing their recoveries in supported jurisdictions. The exchange noted that this is not its first rodeo, as it was also involved in the Mt Gox distributions in 2024. While FTX has already chosen two firms to distribute payouts to customers, the Claims Portal shows that the bankrupt exchange intends to select a third. The space for the third distribution partner currently says “ Upcoming Distribution Agent. More information to come soon.” The choice of the two distribution partners is already raising concerns in some quarters. Users in jurisdictions where BitGo and Kraken do not operate are worried about how they will be able to process their claims and get their repayments. FTX picks January 3, 2025, as effective date The announcement of distribution partners marks another major step in repaying the exchange’s creditors. With that decision, FTX has also picked January 3, 2025, as the effective date for its Chapter 11 Reorganization plan. This means that FTX will have to make the initial distributions to its customers within 60 days of that date. Based on the plan approved by the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware in October, 98% of the FTXE creditors in the convenience class and fall within the convenience class will get their initial distribution within this period. Creditors in this category are scheduled to receive 119% of their allowed claims based on the value of the customers’ crypto holdings as of November 2022, when the exchange filed for bankruptcy. All they need to do is meet the distribution requirements. FTX CEO John Ray III described the whole process up to this point as a reflection of the bankruptcy estate’s outstanding work and its efforts to recover assets. He said: “We are well positioned to begin executing the distribution of recoveries back to all customers and creditors and encourage customers to complete the necessary steps to begin receiving distributions in a timely manner.” Meanwhile, creditors in other classes of claims might still have to wait much longer before they can start receiving their repayments. FTX noted that it will announce payment dates for them soon. FTX recovers $35 million from Gate.io While the bankruptcy estate is working on commencing distribution, recovery efforts remain underway, and some are already yielding. After filing an adversary lawsuit against the Gate.io exchange in November to recover $40 million, on-chain transactions show that around $35 million has been returned to the FTX-controlled wallet. This marks another recovery after the exchange received around $14 million from several political action committees and campaign groups a few days ago. However, it remains locked in a dispute over claims with some creditors, such as Three Arrows Capital and Crypto.com. The professionals involved in the bankruptcy proceedings have also been criticized for the amount of money spent on the reorganization plan. Between May and July 2024, the bankruptcy professional fees were $98.5 million , with the financial advisor Alvarez & Marsal and legal counsel Sullivan & Cromwell being the top earners within that period.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe (PEPE) prices dip as Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) storms the stage with a record-breaking $25M presale. Table of Contents DOGE progress stalls PEPE hopping into trouble Next 100x meme coin: Wall Street Pepe hits $25M in presale Throughout 2024, crypto enthusiasts have been speculating about and passionately debating the meme coin supercycle, and how long it could last. While many meme coins saw price growth as Bitcoin broke past $100,000, the likes of Dogecoin and Pepe have since dipped, with DOGE down 10% on the weekly chart and PEPE down 14%. However, a brand-new meme coin – Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) – has raised $25m in a very short period. This is an incredible achievement that marks WEPE as one of the fastest-growing presales, a clear sign that the meme coin supercycle still has a lot of staying power. DOGE progress stalls From the chart below, DOGE bulls will be keeping an eye on DOGE’s ascending triangle. However, at this point, DOGE has spent over a week dipping towards the green diagonal trend line – and if the price breaks through it, traders and investors will turn their attention to the support levels below. Two psychological price levels stand out due to high wicks emerging from a couple of past daily candles. These are $0.30 and $0.22 – and if the DOGE price falls to $0.22 from its current value, that will be a dip of approximately 44%. Even though we are in a bull market and the meme coin supercycle theory remains plausible, all market cycles involve dips and corrections as well as pumps and other bullish movements. So, although $0.30 might prove a sufficiently strong support level to enable a bounce and bullish continuation, $0.22 is a good level to look at for investors who want to buy DOGE at a heavy discount. In the event of a dip, it’s likely to take some time – perhaps several weeks or a few months – before the DOGE price recovers and goes beyond $0.485. You might also like: PEPU surges 400% 2 days after IEO, viral WEPE to surge next PEPE hopping into trouble PEPE followed Dogecoin’s pump with a delay of a couple of days. Since that time, PEPE traders and investors have shown a lot less confidence in this token’s ability to sustain its higher price – and this is reflected in the high degree of chop in the chart below, as well as a notable tendency for dips to form and activate very quickly. Since DOGE dipped, PEPE has chopped with even more intensity, rather than falling too far down. Looking at Pepe’s trading volume, a much sharper drop-off in volume is seen over the last few days. This means that this intense chop is being driven by very little trading volume – which could be a sign of manipulation driven by algorithms and trading AIs. Taking a bullish perspective, just like DOGE, PEPE is located within an ascending triangle. However, the trendline that forms the support level for that triangle is quite steep – and that generally indicates weaker support and a high likelihood of a large dip if the support level is broken. From there, it’s quite a long way down (almost -35%) to the next strongest support level at $0.000015. Because of the high degree of recent chop, such a bearish move might take some time to reach its target – but it could easily get there before bouncing and moving into a new bullish phase. Overall, DOGE and PEPE are currently showing significant weakness, with a strong possibility of large dips ahead. Fortunately, it’s not all doom and gloom for meme coin traders as a new presale project is showing huge potential. Next 100x meme coin: Wall Street Pepe hits $25M in presale With so much potentially bearish uncertainty swirling through the crypto markets, projects that are achieving massive success under these conditions really stand out. Wall Street Pepe is one such project, and has already raised $25m in the first two weeks of its presale stage. Wall Street Pepe was created to empower degens across the crypto space with the skills and tools they need to get ahead. From alpha calls to key trading insights and strategic advantages, the WEPE army is already one of the fastest-growing meme coin communities. The token also offers staking – and can be staked during the presale stage, with current estimated rewards of 47% PA. Over at 99Bitcoins, a crypto analyst has completed a deep dive into Wall Street Pepe, and found it to be incredibly promising: Very few meme coins are designed to provide their community members with any utility at all – let alone actionable trading advice and the knowledge required to make money from crypto. Another frog meme coin, Pepe Unchained, saw gains of over 600% after its launch last week following a $60M+ presale, and Wall Street Pepe could be set for similar gains.

The spike led to a market capitalization of over $850 million, less than $150 million shy of crossing the $1 billion threshold. This growth is a significant achievement for the comedic cryptocurrency, which has gained traction through strong community support after AI agent Truth Terminal birthed the idea of Fartcoin, and the memecoin space took advantage of the opportunity to create the token. The rapid rise of Fartcoin underscores a growing trend in the cryptocurrency market where humor, community engagement, and viral appeal are driving value creation.

Chill Pepe (CHILPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CHILPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Chill Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Chill Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Chill Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Chill Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Chill Pepe by entering its contract address – AfPftBmzfb2pan4Drt2ZKgT7VK5Rn7CLQHpp8DpLhXZj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CHILPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-16 23:58:00

The Bitcoin miner used the additional proceeds from its coupon-convertible bond issue to acquire 667 BTC at $101,135 per token, bringing its total BTC holding to 17,429 BTC. Riot generated a BTC Yield Per Share of 37.2% YTD and 36.7% QTD through the recent Bitcoin acquisition and mining production YTD. Its total Bitcoin holding is currently worth $1.8B at the average market price of $103,873. Riot Platforms closes convertible senior notes offering With the additional proceeds from Riot’s upsized $594 million, 0.75% coupon convertible bond issue, the Company has acquired 667 BTC at an average price of $101,135 per BTC.

(@RiotPlatforms) December 16, 2024 According to Riot Platforms, the aggregate principal amount of the 2030 Notes sold in the offering included $69.4 million relating to the partial exercise of the initial purchasers’ option. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2030 Notes were approximately $579.2 million after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts, commissions, and estimated offering expenses payable by Riot. The Bitcoin miner disclosed that the 2030 Notes were sold in a private offering only to persons reasonably deemed qualified institutional buyers per the Securities Act. All the net proceeds were swiftly deployed to additional Bitcoin acquisition. According to Stock Titan, successfully completing the convertible notes offering represented a huge capital raise for Riot. The convertible structure provided flexibility for future equity conversion while minimizing immediate dilution. Investors should, however, note that the substantial BTC acquisition exposed Riot to increased crypto volatility, although the low interest rate indicated favorable market conditions. The 2030 maturity period also provided a lengthy runway for the company’s growth strategy. Riot’s capital raise marked one of the most significant fundraising events recently in the crypto mining sector. It signalled strong institutional confidence in the company’s business model and demonstrated Riot’s commitment to future operational expansion. Riot Platforms doubles down on Bitcoin with substantial additional acquisition On December 9th, Riot announced its intention to use all proceeds from the offering to purchase more Bitcoin, and it carried through with its plan by acquiring 667 BTC on December 16th. The company had already used a portion of the offering net proceeds to accumulate over 5K BTC between December 10th and 12th. Riot Platforms increased its BTC holding to 17,429, suggesting plans to expand its Bitcoin reserve significantly and potentially impacting its financial strategy. The Bitcoin mining company acquired and held Bitcoin to enhance stockholder value. Riot reported its BTC Yield KPI indicating a quarter-to-date Yield of 36.7% and a year-to-date Yield of 37.2%. According to Riot Platforms, the BTC Yield KPI could only be used by pro-level investors to supplement their understanding of the company’s decision to fund the purchase of Bitcoin by issuing additional shares of its common stock. Riot emphasized that the BTC Yield KPI was not equivalent to ‘yield’ in the traditional financial context since it could not be used as an operating performance or liquidity measure. InvestingPro analysts anticipated that the recent BTC acquisitions would push Riot’s revenue growth to 32% in 2024. InvestingPro data further showed that the company maintained a strong balance sheet with more cash than debt and a healthy current ratio of 5.86x. Recent stock performance was also strong, with a 16% return over the past week and 23% over six months.

Market analysts studying each crypto sector closely say Chainlink (LINK) is the altcoin to watch and believe Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) is poised to become a top Solana memecoin in 2025. However, regarding the best cryptos to buy now, experts say anyone looking for substantial profits by January has more to gain from the PropiChain (PCHAIN) presale. PropiChain is ushering in the Web3 real estate revolution, and PCHAIN, its native token, is projected for an outstanding 23,902% run . Should Your Portfolio Include Chainlink (LINK) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN)? While altcoins like XRP, ETH, and ADA stole the spotlight over the past month, many failed to notice the silent Chainlink (LINK) rally that was taking place. Some now even consider LINK one of the best-performing altcoins of Q4, considering that the Chainlink price at $28.62 today is up across the past week (13.28%), month (116.22%), and year (91.54%). This is even more true for Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) over in the Solana memecoin sector. Barely two months since its CMC listing, the Fartcoin price has surged 238.54%, 187.35%, and 948.26% to $0.5921 over the past week, month, and all-time, respectively. However, the problem with Chainlink (LINK) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) remains the same for investors. Despite being good portfolio options, their surging prices offer diminished gains and potential losses for investors who purchase today, leaving the search for the best altcoins to buy now still wide open. PropiChain: The RWA Altcoin Outpacing Chainlink (LINK) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) If you’re a crypto community member or pay any attention to Web3 news, you’ve likely heard about the PropiChain (PCHAIN) presale , which recently concluded round one after raising over $1.4 million. While it’s not uncommon in a hype-fueled industry, PropiChain’s early success with investors can be attributed to its breakthrough blockchain solutions for the $600T real estate industry. Unlike competing solutions focusing on a single industry problem, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is introducing the first-ever full-service platform for checkmating global property fraud, eliminating the financial investing barrier, providing unlimited market access, and allowing for super-convenient digital asset management. These are all problems the industry has been trying to fix for many years. Still, PropiChain is finally making it possible with blockchain, RWA tokenization, metaverse, smart contracts, and artificial intelligence technologies. Among these technologies, blockchain is most important as it enables PropiChain to tokenize real estate, provides an impervious vault for storing tokens, and allows for smart-contract-based property management. PropiChain is finally bringing RWA tokenization to real estate, but what might seem like a simple technological advancement can reshape the entire industry. First, tokenization will allow for fractional ownership in real estate , thereby making it possible to trade digitized properties in unlimited fractions and prices. But this digitization will also bring liquidity to real estate by allowing for instant property transactions instead of the 44-day average it currently takes. We’ll witness unprecedented access to the market with fractional ownership and digitization, but PropiChain is taking it a step further with its interactive metaverse marketplace. Experts believe that by letting users take virtual tours, hosting virtual meetings, and staging assets virtually, PropiChain will become a major property trading platform. Yet, things only get more interesting with PropiChain’s smart contracts for property management and artificial intelligent tools for investors. On PropiChain, smart contracts can handle property rights transfers and manage rental agreements with features such as auto asset leasing, auto-renewals, and auto rent payment collections. Furthermore, PCHAIN holders can make data-driven investment decisions and even automate the investing process with AI tools that can personalize property search, derive assets’ true value using real-time metrics, and automatically trade properties when their value drops or rises above a pre-specified amount. Chainlink (LINK) vs. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) vs. PropiChain (PCHAIN): Which to Buy? Chainlink (LINK), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), and PropiChain (PCHAIN) are three undervalued altcoins on investors’ watchlists today. However, its PCHAIN investors pick for the highest profits in this generation’s bull cycle. Unlike Chainlink and Fartcoin, offering modest gains and potential for significant losses from sharp price corrections, analysts project PropiChain (PCHAIN) for an astonishing 23,902% run by Q1 2025, outperforming LINK, FARTCOIN and most crypto markets. PropiChain Presale: Round Two Begins after Raising Over $1.4 Million Many already consider PropiChain (PCHAIN) the hottest new crypto after round one of its presale raised $1.4 million weeks after launch. Understandably, investors rushed to acquire a stake in the real estate Web3 revolution at its lowest-ever price. While round one is already gone, interested investors can still participate in round two of the presale , now selling PCHAIN at $0.011, the cheapest it’ll ever be again. However, round two is already moving quicker than the first as its early success signals investors of the best crypto presale project to invest in. The project’s BlockAudit security audit and PropiChain CoinMarketCap listing also have a hand to play after massively driving traffic following their announcements. Although a generous 291% profits await round-two investors by the final stage in the coming weeks, most are looking ahead as today’s investment of $1,500 can yield a staggering $360,030 by Q1 2025 when PCHAIN completes its 23,902% run. But remember, PropiChain is breezing through round two, and investors might miss this chance just as they missed round one.

As 2025 approaches, investors are searching for the best altcoins to buy in the US. Analysts have highlighted three promising altcoins— RCO Finance (RCOF) , TRON (TRX), and Cardano (ADA)—as potential high-risers by January 1. Can these tokens deliver the best altcoins to buy in the US? 1. RCO Finance RCO Finance stands out with its advanced robo-advisor, which provides a more efficient approach than traditional human market analysis. This tool scans the markets, reviews projects, and identifies trends that need to be included manually. Investors can now access insights and predictions that make decision-making easier. Experts who have used the AI tool say the robo-advisor predicts outcomes and creates customized portfolios based on each investor’s goals and risk tolerance. This personalized service helps investors make more informed decisions and aligns trades with their strategies. RCO Finance’s robo-advisor acts like a financial consultant thanks to its machine-learning algorithms. It offers real-time recommendations, telling users when to buy, sell, or diversify their assets based on specific patterns. This feature gives users a clear advantage in decision-making and ensures they are always one step ahead. Beyond the robo-advisor, RCO Finance offers access to the best altcoins to buy in the US. The platform has 120,000 digital assets across 12,500 categories, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, bonds, ETFs, and real-world assets (RWAs). This wide selection lets users diversify their portfolios and manage risk. Very importantly, in an age of increasing emphasis on security, RCO Finance takes security seriously. It has completed a smart contract audit with SolidProof, a leading blockchain security firm. The audit confirms the platform’s commitment to transparency and the safety of user assets. 2. TRX Justin Sun declared TRX the “Next XRP” on X (previously Twitter). This has sparked much curiosity in the crypto world, especially given XRP’s recent surge, spurred by legal updates, ETF registrations, and favorable news about Ripple. Sun’s posts, including “TRX = XRP” have captured the attention of the Tron and XRP community and the larger market, speculating that TRX will follow XRP’s trend. TRX boasts one of the blockchains’ highest active user bases, thanks to its seamless integration with popular platforms, and currently trades at about $0.2893. Analysts believe TRON is on the cusp of a major price breakout, making it one of the best altcoins to consider before January 1. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu experts believe that TRX could rise to about $0.7788 to become the best altcoins to buy in the US. With its solid foundation and growing adoption, TRX is a reliable option for long-term investors seeking steady growth. 3. Cardano The Cardano Foundation’s social media platform X account appears to have been compromised in the early hours of December 8, causing fake news to spread throughout the cryptocurrency community. A series of messages from the account indicated that ADA tokens would undergo significant changes, such as stopping trade and token burns. One message claimed that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had filed a lawsuit against the Cardano Foundation. At a current price of $1.10, ADA has a strong developer ecosystem and an active community that continues to drive its adoption. With its ongoing upgrades and partnerships, Cardano is poised for significant growth in 2025. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu analysts predict that the price of Cardano could rise by 22.49% and reach $ 1.34 by January 1. Cardano stands out as a top contender for investors looking for a secure yet high-potential crypto. RCOF Becomes The Best Altcoins to Buy in the US Ahead of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Dogecoin and Shiba Inu analysts are predicting a staggering 1000x return for early investors that would capitalize on the $0.077 selling price of RCOF during the ongoing stage 4 of the presale. Imagine turning a $5 investment into $5,000—a life-changing opportunity that is well within reach if you act now. Experts say RCOF is one of the best altcoins to buy in the US due to its post-launch potential. After the launch at the $0.4 to $0.6 price range, experts expect a further 5,000% surge. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are strong contenders with their robust ecosystems and promising growth trajectories, RCOF’s presale offers unparalleled potential for explosive gains. There’s no better time to invest as the token price increases with each presale stage. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the next big crypto success story.

As XRP and Cardano navigate uncertain growth, XYZVerse emerges with the potential to shake up the 2025 crypto market. Table of Contents The all-sports meme token ready to make its play XRP Cardano Conclusion Investors are questioning whether established cryptocurrencies like XRP and Cardano (ADA) can maintain their upward momentum in a rapidly evolving market. Meanwhile, new tokens are emerging, promising to disrupt the status quo and offer fresh opportunities for growth. One such contender is XYZVerse (XYZ), a meme coin that bridges sports enthusiasm and crypto culture, aiming to redefine community engagement and market dynamics. The all-sports meme token ready to make its play As XRP and Cardano work to sustain their growth, newcomers like XYZVerse are emerging to challenge the status quo. Bridging sports enthusiasm with the viral power of meme coins, XYZ is positioned as a transformative token that combines community engagement with growth potential. XYZ is more than just another meme coin – it’s an exclusive VIP pass to a sports-driven, meme-powered ecosystem. Think of it as the MVP of the XYZVerse platform, where investors can capitalize on the skyrocketing demand for meme coins. Polymarket hit $1 billion in trading volume during the U.S. presidential election. Imagine pairing that with the hype of meme coins and the excitement of sports betting. With millions of sports fans ready to participate, the XYZVerse ecosystem is primed for expansion, offering slam-dunk rewards for early adopters. Meme coins are dominating the 2024 crypto landscape, and XYZ is ready to crush the competition. With projected thousand-fold returns and a 9,900% growth target by the Token Generation Event (TGE), XYZ is set to outperform rivals like BOME (5,000% rise) and WIF (1,000% rally). Upcoming listings on major CEX and DEX platforms, audited smart contracts, and a vetted team ensure that XYZVerse is a secure and promising investment. The first-mover advantage is critical here – those who get in before the crowd storms the field could see unmatched returns. Intrigued investors can get XYZ via presale and be part of its crypto championship. XRP XRP has experienced significant growth over the past six months, soaring by 379.42%. In the last month, it surged 122.42%, marking a remarkable uptrend. Currently trading between $2.20 and $2.58, XRP is hovering around its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $2.42 and $2.40 respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 51.94, suggesting that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic indicator is at 37.97, reinforcing a neutral market position. Looking ahead, XRP faces its nearest resistance at $3.30. A breakthrough could propel it toward the next resistance level of $4.03. On the downside, immediate support lies at $1.83, with a secondary support at $1.09 if bearish momentum continues. You might also like: AI predicts XRP surpassing ETH this cycle — but the real crypto winner could be XYZ Cardano Over the past week, Cardano has seen a price increase of 7.07%. In the last month, ADA has surged by 48.08%, and over six months, it has climbed by 170.90%. The current price ranges between $1.06 and $1.33, showing significant movement in a short period. Technical indicators suggest potential for further growth. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 54.78, indicating neutral momentum. The stochastic oscillator is at 82.14, which is nearing the overbought zone. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is slightly negative at -0.00015329, hinting at a possible bullish reversal. If ADA breaks above the nearest resistance level of $1.46, it could aim for the second resistance at $1.73, representing an increase of approximately 30%. On the downside, if it falls below the nearest support at $0.923, it might test the second support at $0.653, a potential decrease of about 40%.

XRPL Validator, VET, recently shared valuable tips for beginners interested in setting up their nodes. This article outlines the key points from VET’s post to provide a comprehensive understanding of the process and its benefits. What is an XRP Ledger (XRPL) Node? An XRP Ledger (XRPL) node is essentially a computer running the XRPL software, known as “rippled.” These nodes connect to the XRP Ledger network by establishing peer connections with other nodes. This interaction forms a decentralized network that processes transactions and maintains the ledger’s integrity. There are several types of XRPL nodes, each serving distinct purposes based on their configuration: Validators: Nodes that validate transactions and add them to the ledger. Stock Nodes: Designed for standard use, such as querying balances, submitting transactions, and sharing ledger data. Full History Nodes : Nodes that store the complete history of the XRPL. Pathfinding Nodes: Nodes optimized for finding payment paths. Why Run a Node? Running an XRPL node comes with several significant benefits. First, it provides independence, allowing users to eliminate reliance on third-party wallet providers or exchanges that typically run nodes to submit transactions. By operating your own node, you ensure uninterrupted access to the ledger at all times. Additionally, running a node contributes directly to the XRPL network by supporting the dissemination and validation of ledger data, strengthening the overall system. Finally, maintaining a personal node enhances security and control by reducing dependence on potentially vulnerable third-party infrastructure. Setting Up an XRP Ledger Node: Basic Requirements To get started, you’ll need a few essential components. A standard laptop or PC will suffice as the primary hardware, paired with a stable internet connection. While VET recommends speeds above 200 Mbps for optimal performance, lower speeds may still work in certain situations. Additionally, you’ll need the XRPL software, known as “rippled,” which can be downloaded directly from the official XRPL documentation. Hardware Specifications: The hardware requirements for running a node are relatively modest. While the official XRPL documentation suggests higher specifications, VET notes that 32GB DDR3 RAM and a basic CPU should suffice for non-intensive use. Operating System: Linux is the recommended operating system for running “rippled.” For users unfamiliar with Linux, VET suggests using Docker , a platform that simplifies the setup process. A video guide on this approach is forthcoming. Overcoming Challenges: Setting up and maintaining a node may seem daunting, particularly for those unfamiliar with command-line interfaces. However, with available resources and support from the XRP community , many beginners have successfully navigated the process. Resources and Support: The XRPL documentation provides a detailed installation guide for Linux users, accessible here . Additionally, experienced members of the XRP community, including VET, are available to answer questions and provide guidance. Running an XRPL node is an excellent way for individuals to contribute to the network, enhance their control over their transactions, and gain deeper insights into blockchain technology. While the setup process may require effort and learning, the long-term benefits of independence, security, and community engagement make it a worthwhile endeavor. Those interested in getting started should leverage the resources and support available within the XRPL ecosystem.

On December 17, 2024, data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment revealed a massive rise in whale activity on the Cardano network, signaling potential upside momentum. Whale Transactions Surge on Cardano Network According to the data, the Cardano network witnessed a substantial 687 transactions, each worth more than $1 million, recorded in the past 24 hours. This highlights whales’ rising interest and confidence in the altcoin, suggesting a major price rally could be on the horizon. Additionally, these notable transaction details were highlighted by crypto experts on X (formerly Twitter). However, ADA experienced this surge in transactions during a period of consolidation, as it traded within a tight range over the past week.

In the past 24 hours, 687 transactions exceeding $1 million were recorded. pic.twitter.com/p8vzuLaFVP — Ali (@ali_charts) December 16, 2024 Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, ADA appears to have formed a bearish head and shoulders price action pattern. However, this pattern isn’t yet complete, as the price remains trapped in a consolidation range between $1.07 and $1.14. This range could determine whether ADA moves upward or downward in the coming days. Source: Trading View ADA Key Levels and Current Price Momentum Based on recent price action, if ADA breaks out of the narrow range and closes a daily candle above the $1.14 level, the bearish pattern would be invalidated, and ADA’s price could soar by 43% to reach the $1.63 mark in the future. Conversely, if ADA breaks down from the range and closes a daily candle below $1, the bearish pattern would be confirmed, and ADA could witness a price decline of 24%, falling to the $0.78 level. However, this bearish outlook currently appears manageable, as ADA continues to receive support from an ascending trendline. On the positive side, ADA’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 52, below the overbought zone, indicating that the asset has enough room to rise in the coming days. Currently, ADA is trading near $1.07 and has recorded a price decline of 2.7% in the past 24 hours.

This comes as the social media giant has been constantly upgrading the AI-enabled glasses to enhance performance including to handle more complex tasks and respond more naturally in major updates that are expected to transform the smart glasses. Meta made significant upgrades to Ray-Ban Earlier this year Meta revealed it was integrating its next-generation AI model Llama 3 into virtual assistant – MetaAI in its Ray-Ban smart glasses to enhance performance. The multi-modal features were in early access last December and can perform translations in addition to identifying objects, animals, and monuments. Now, Meta has brought other major upgrades to the smart glasses to boost their performance further. According to Cnet, the always-on continuous AI assistance started working on the Ray-Ban glasses on Monday for owners that have access to Meta’s features . This is in addition to the onboard translation, and Shazam which is currently available in the US and Canada only. The latest features added to the AI-enabled glasses include continuous audio and camera recording as opposed to specific individual prompts. This, according to Cnet , allows the glasses to be used for an extended period of time with the AI features turned on. Whenever the always-on live AI is activated, the glasses’ LED also stays on. Meta keeps a recording of the conversation that can be referred to throughout the AI session. In terms of translation, it is expected to work automatically while talking. However, although the translation comes through the glasses, it comes with a slight delay. The live AI assistance is reportedly similar to what Google demonstrated on its own prototype glasses this month via Gemini and Android XR, arriving next year. According to Meta, as cited by Cnet, the aways-on AI takes a hit on battery life, and users can expect up to 30 minutes of use before recharging the device. However, the company further explains that this type of always-on camera-assisted AI is exactly what more tech companies will be exploring in the next year. AI glasses hit their stride in 2024 The upgrades come as Big Tech is pushing AI assistants as the raison d’etre for smart glasses. Last week, Google revealed Android XR for new smart glasses, and specifically positioned its Gemini AI assistant as the killer app. In the meantime Andrew Bosworth, Meta CTO said in blog post that “2024 was the year AI glasses hit their stride.” In the same blogpost, Bosworth further opines that smart glasses may be the best possible form factor for a “truly AI-native device.” He added the AI-powered glasses could be the first hardware category to be “completely defined by AI from the beginning.” With Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses, users can activate the virtual assistant on the glasses by saying “ Hey Meta ” then ask a question or prompt, before the assistant can respond via speakers built on the frames. According to Meta , users can livestream from the glasses to social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, using “Hey Meta” to engage with the firm’s “advanced conversational assistant” MetaAI. The Ray Ban glasses feature enhanced audio and cameras, in addition to more than 150 different custom frame and lens combinations, “and they are lighter and comfortable.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",AI,EN,0,0,OTHER,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-17 00:40:58

This latest purchase comes as BTC has surged to new all-time highs, with the leading cryptocurrency recently surpassing the $106,00 mark on Monday. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Stash Grows To 439,000 BTC On Monday, Michael Saylor announced that MicroStrategy acquired an additional 15,350 BTC for approximately $1.5 billion, averaging around $100,386 per Bitcoin. This acquisition contributes to the firm’s substantial Bitcoin portfolio, which now totals 439,000 BTC, purchased for about $27.1 billion at an average price of $61,725 per Bitcoin.

Interestingly, Saylor also disclosed in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter) that the firm’s Bitcoin holdings have yielded notable returns, boasting a 46.4% gain quarter-to-date (QTD) and 72.4% gain year-to-date (YTD). This bullish momentum in the market follows increased optimism since November 5, when President-elect Donald Trump secured a new term in the White House with key promises made throughout the year to the industry. Investors are now confident that Trump’s new administration would make regulatory changes that could create a more favorable climate for digital assets. The US crypto market has encountered considerable difficulties in recent years, particularly from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Microstrategy’s MSTR Rises 3% On Nasdaq 100 News The recent uptick in Bitcoin’s price is further evidenced by a significant trading volume increase, with CoinGecko reporting a $92 million surge in the past 24 hours—a 54% increase compared to the previous day. However, MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin investment strategy has not only influenced the cryptocurrency market but has also positively affected its stock (MSTR) price. Following the announcement that MicroStrategy would be listed on the Nasdaq 100 index last week, shares of the company rose over 3% in premarket trading.

Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani remarked on Monday that MicroStrategy’s strategy to Bitcoin purchase is “unprecedented,” establishing the company as the largest corporate Bitcoin owner, with around 2% of the total supply. Chhugani commented: MSTR’s Bitcoin buying program is unprecedented on the street, and inclusion in Nasdaq 100 further improves MSTR’s market liquidity, expanding its capital flywheel and Bitcoin buying program. At the time of writing, BTC has managed to consolidate at $103,900 for the past few hours after surging to new all-time highs. The market’s leading crypto recorded gains of 2% and nearly 6% in the 24-hour and weekly time frames, respectively.

Pseudonymous analyst Credible tells his 448,500 followers on the social media platform X that XRP appears to be gearing up for wave three of its five-wave surge on the four-hour chart. Credible practices the Elliott Wave theory which states that a bullish asset tends to witness a five-wave rally where wave three represents the longest and steepest part of the surge. Credible shares a chart that outlines XRP’s path to $20 before its five-wave rally comes to a conclusion. “And for non-traders, you just need to zoom out a little so you don’t forget the big picture. Structure on XRP here looks so freaking clean and bullish, it’s actually insane. Forget what happens on these lower timeframes. It’s noise (for a non-trader), the big picture is incredibly and unequivocally bullish.” Source: Credible/X At time of writing, XRP is trading for $2.44, indicating a potential rise of 719% if the altcoin hits the massive price target. Zooming in, Credible believes it is within the realm of possibility for XRP to revisit a support level below $2 before taking off to new all-time highs. “XRP looking solid here, fresh local demand formed in the ORANGE zone. Any retests of that zone should be good long opportunities for those looking for an entry. Ideally, we get something like what is pictured.” Source: Credible/X Based on the trader’s chart, he appears to predict that XRP will first rally above $3 before witnessing a deep corrective move.
