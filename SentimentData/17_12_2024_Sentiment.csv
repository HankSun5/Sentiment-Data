This achievement sets the stage for the company’s operations under the name Bitpanda Broker MENA DMCC, marking its first foray outside the European market. Dubai’s growing prominence as a digital finance and innovation hub presents a strategic opportunity for Bitpanda to tap into the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region’s burgeoning crypto market. Bitpanda Goes Global! We’re proud to announce that we’ve secured In-Principle-Approval from the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority in the UAE. This achievement takes us one step closer to offering our full range of services in this fast-growing global hub for digital assets.… pic.twitter.com/09bBm2oJpG — Bitpanda (@Bitpanda_global) December 16, 2024 Bitpanda’s In-Principle Approval: Is UEA Growing Stronger? While this milestone is a critical step, the road to full operational approval involves further measures, including setting up a fully operational office in Dubai, onboarding a regional management team, and implementing VARA-compliant infrastructure to support its services. Eric Demuth, Co-Founder and CEO of Bitpanda, articulated the importance of this achievement, stating: “In Europe, we have established ourselves as the most trusted and regulated digital asset platform. Now, we are scaling this proven model globally, with Dubai and the UAE serving as our strategic launchpad for international expansion.” He continued; “The opportunities are immense, and we are uniquely positioned to seize them as both Europe’s leading crypto broker and a top infrastructure provider in the digital assets space.” VARA’s progressive regulatory framework emphasizes investor protection while fostering innovation, a balance that aligns seamlessly with Bitpanda’s compliance-first ethos. Fabian Reinisch, General Counsel of Bitpanda, also remarked: “Securing VARA’s in-principle approval in under eight months reflects the strength of VARA’s regulatory guidelines and our commitment to innovation and compliance.” With this latest regulatory compliance move, Bitpanda will increase user trust and facilitate sustained growth in the MENA region. Strategic Expansion into a Dynamic Region Bitpanda’s entry into the UAE forms part of its broader strategy to establish a global footprint in the crypto space. The opening of an office at the DMCC Crypto Centre in Dubai earlier this year laid the groundwork for this expansion. Additionally, Bitpanda has forged strategic partnerships with key financial institutions, including The National Bank of Ras Al Khaimah (RAKBANK) and CoinMENA , a prominent licensed crypto platform in the UAE. Dubai’s reputation as a forward-thinking hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation was a major factor in Bitpanda’s decision to expand into the region. Initiatives like the DMCC Crypto Centre and VARA’s regulatory framework make the UAE a magnet for digital finance innovators. Demuth also expressed confidence in the UAE’s potential, noting: “The UAE’s regulatory framework fosters innovation while prioritizing investor protection. These principles align perfectly with our mission to offer safe and trusted access to digital assets worldwide.” Bitpanda’s expansion has also been described as a strategic move to bridge the gap between Europe’s regulatory rigor and the UAE’s dynamic market. Bitpanda has been proactive in fostering innovation and collaboration as part of its global strategy. Its partnership with Societe Generale Forge , the blockchain subsidiary of Societe Generale, is a notable example. This collaboration focuses on advancing euro-denominated stablecoins, such as EUR CoinVertible (EURCV), as integral components of the global financial ecosystem. Looking ahead, Bitpanda plans to roll out Bitpanda Fusion , a high-volume trading product launched last week for advanced traders. This tool aggregates liquidity from major exchanges, catering to the needs of ambitious crypto traders in the MENA region. With all these moves, Bitpanda is on to something for the UAE and beyond.

Pharma Bro mentioned on the Shkreli Planet podcast that Saylor was drunk on the idea. Shkreli added that the situation was a big bubble that would not end well for the company. The asset management company introduced Bitcoin as its treasury reserve asset. Saylor described the digital asset as ‘digital gold’ and mentioned its stability as a store of value. The asset manager’s CEO further mentioned MicroStrategy’s plan to leverage BTC as a hedge against inflation. Michael Saylor also introduced the idea of BTC as a reserve currency for institutions in his Bitcoin playbook. Shkreli pointed out MicroStrategy’s plan to continuously purchase Bitcoin as part of the company’s business model. The asset management company first purchased BTC in 2020 worth $250 million to get 21,454. MicroStrategy made the most recent purchase of BTC worth $1.5 billion on December 15, increasing its holdings by 15,350 coins and bringing its total to 439,000 BTC. Pharma Bro also revealed during the discussion that he was shorting MicroStrategy stocks. Despite this claim, the investor did not reveal the size of his position. Shkreli added that his trade was a bit painful but fun. MicroStrategy stocks have still been rising despite Pharma Bro’s negative sentiment. MSTR has been up 490% this year, allowing the company to join the Nasdaq-100 index. Martin Shkreli says Saylor is not a favorable BTC advocate Shkreli further criticized Saylor’s advocacy for BTC. The investor suggested that the MicroStrategy CEO was not the best advocate for the currency despite being among the loudest. Shkreli also doubted Saylor’s commentary on BTC, citing a lack of credibility. The investor mentioned Saylor’s recent presentation to Microsoft shareholders. The MicroStrategy CEO shared his thoughts with the technology conglomerate on December 1. Saylor suggested that Bitcoin was the next technology wave, and Microsoft could not afford to miss it. The executive of the asset management firm suggested that Microsoft redirect its debt, stock buybacks, cash payouts, and other income sources toward BTC. Saylor further explained that the action could increase the company’s value by trillions while reducing investor and shareholder risks. Microsoft shareholders voted no to the proposal, citing reservations due to the coin’s volatility. However, the company’s board still highlighted that it would monitor developments in the BTC markets. Shkreli discussed the vote turnout, mentioning the 0.5% ‘yes’ vote and describing it as the worst proxy vote he had ever seen. The investor added that the negative outcome made him slightly bearish on BTC. Shkreli speculates on the BTC price outcome Pharma Bro speculated the outcome of BTC prices in relation to MicroStrategy’s cryptocurrency acquisitions. In his opinion, the coin’s price should have spiked after the billions of dollars the asset management company has injected into BTC purchases. Shkreli then speculated that the current price showed a bearish BTC sentiment. The investor insisted that his prediction did not mean the coin’s price would plunge. BTC has made notable steps, reaching a new all-time high of $107,104 today. The coin is trading 0.18% lower than the new ATH but over 3% higher than yesterday’s price. Despite the ongoing discussions, Shkreli further mentioned that he expected the U.S. to stockpile only a little BTC. Shkreli highlighted that the next government could undo the progress even if Trump’s government accumulates BTC. President-elect Donald Trump has been preparing to make Bitcoin the strategic reserve asset of the U.S. Treasury. Trump has also promised that the government will continue with significant BTC mining projects and acquisitions.

One Solana memecoin innovation, Fartcoin, recently captured attention with a staggering 220% rally, proving that altcoins can use humor to drive value. A leading Solana memecoin expert claims to have discovered another hidden gem: RCO Finance (RCOF) . Could this altcoin replicate or even surpass Fartcoin’s trajectory? Fartcoin: The Solana Memecoin That Redefined Viral Success Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) , a flatulence-themed token built on the Solana blockchain, has taken the Solana memecoin world by storm. Breaking its previous records, Fartcoin recently hit an all-time high of $0.52, catapulting its market cap to over $520 million. This explosive growth highlights the unpredictable power of Solana memecoins , which thrive on internet humor and community-driven momentum. Fueled by its absurd origin story, Fartcoin emerged from the Infinite Backrooms, where Solana’s Pump.fun launchpad transformed a whimsical AI-powered idea into a thriving token. With a 69% surge in just 24 hours and a 154% rise over the week, Fartcoin’s gains overshadow even broader crypto market trends. This Solana memecoin has captured attention, partly due to its simplicity and relatability, with slogans like “Hot air rises” becoming rallying cries for its community. As Fartcoin proves, the Solana memecoin market balances humor, speculation, and ROI, offering lessons for projects like RCO Finance (RCOF), which seek to replicate this rise with added utility.

The first on Markus’s list is Dogecoin, which is quite expected since he is one of its creators. DOGE was created as a meme coin but has since gained a lot of adoption and has a large community of users. The digital asset has also been endorsed by celebrities such as Elon Musk. On Dogecoin’s 11th anniversary on 6th December, Markus said that he did not expect the impact from the coin, which he initially conceived as a joke. He stated, ” it is extremely surreal that some silly thing I made in a few hours has had the impact on the world that it has.” Bitcoin, the first digital currency in the world, was also on the list. Markus recognized its historical significance and its position as one of the early players in the crypto industry. Avalanche and Ethereum highlight utility Markus selected Avalanche as the third one because it is fast and scalable, and more people are joining the protocol. Avalanche is a blockchain platform that is based on Ethereum and has been on the rise due to the fact that it allows for the operation of real world applications that are efficient. According to Markus, Ethereum made it to his list because of its performance in the area of smart contracts and dApps. He shared his experience of positive interactions with Ethereum as he engaged in business with NFTs and other projects. Although the high gas fees are still a problem of Ethereum, it is the most versatile and popular coin among other cryptocurrencies. Rounding out the list was Solana, which was hailed for its expanding ecosystem and investment effectiveness. Markus also pointed out that the platform had been used in many projects and has helped build its image as a significant competitor in the market. At the beginning of the year, Markus even challenged Solana and Ethereum communities to a memecoins-themed contest. When asked why he didn’t include XRP in the list of currencies he owns, Markus replied that he doesn’t own any XRP and jokingly said that he might if he receives some as a gift. i own 0 xrp if someone sent me a million dollars worth i would probably like it more — Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) December 16, 2024 Trusting crypto over tradition Besides these choices, Markus recently disclosed that he had a shift in the perception of cryptocurrencies in general. In a recent post on the X, he confessed to liking crypto more than ever before. i’m beginning to appreciate cryptocurrency so much more recently and not simply because of the price increases (though ngl that helps lol) — Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) December 7, 2024 Though prices have gone up, he stressed that there was a more fundamental cause. He believes in code supremacy over humans because, according to him, it is easier to bribe a human than to tamper with well audited code. One follower pointed out that crypto can help with high bank fees, and Markus agreed that banking deserves disruption. According to him, the more one understands conventional finance, the more compelling the case for crypto is. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $106,000, while Ethereum crossed $4,000. Dogecoin also became the seventh largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, trading at $0.4 before a slight decline.

The launch was carried out in partnership with Securitize, a leader in the tokenization of real-world assets. Ethena Labs Expands Stablecoin Use Cases: USDtb Considered for CEX Collateral and Tokenization According to the announcement on Monday, USDtb functions similarly to established fiat-backed stablecoins like USDC and USDT, maintaining a 1:1 reserve ratio using cash or cash-equivalent assets. The stablecoin allows unrestricted transfers, offering users flexibility and accessibility. Today we are launching our new stablecoin product, USDtb, backed by @BlackRock 's BUIDL Fund in partnership with @Securitize Read below for full details pic.twitter.com/mSf3mWv3oF — Ethena Labs (@ethena_labs) December 16, 2024 A distinguishing feature of USDtb is its scalability, made possible by BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, which constitutes 90% of USDtb’s reserves. The remaining 10% consists of stablecoins and institutional-grade tokenized U.S. Treasury products, facilitating redemptions and liquidity. This represents the highest allocation to BUIDL among any stablecoin currently on the market. Unlike Ethena’s other stablecoin, USDe, USDtb is an entirely independent product designed to meet diverse user needs and exchange requirements. Its distinct risk profile provides an alternative to USDe while also supporting USDe’s stability in challenging market conditions. Ethena’s Risk Committee recently approved a proposal to use USDtb as a backing asset for USDe . Ethena plans to reallocate assets from USDe to USDtb during negative funding rates to mitigate risks and improve resilience. USDtb leverages LayerZero technology, enabling seamless cross-chain transfers across multiple networks. At launch, USDtb will be available on Ethereum mainnet, Base, Solana, and Arbitrum. It will also be bridgeable via Stargate for enhanced interoperability. The stablecoin’s infrastructure has been extensively audited to ensure security and compliance. Leading auditors, including Quantstamp, Cyfrin, and Pashov, completed three full audits of the core USDtb smart contracts in October, with no high or medium-level vulnerabilities detected. Additionally, a community-driven audit by Code4rena reported no significant findings. Ethena has partnered with several prominent institutions to support USDtb’s launch. Copper, Zodia, Komainu, and Coinbase Web3 Wallet provide custody solutions. Liquidity providers include Jump, Cumberland, Wintermute, Amber, GSR, and SCB Limited. USDtb is also being evaluated for broader use cases. It is under consideration as margin collateral on centralized exchanges that have partnered with Ethena and for allocation in Spark’s $1 billion Tokenization Grand Prix. How USDtb’s Launch Expands Ethena’s Stablecoin Ecosystem and Boosts User Choice USDtb has been submitted for Spark’s $1 billion Tokenization Grand Prix, a competition to boost liquidity for tokenized assets. If selected, USDtb could see a significant increase in adoption and utility. Ethena’s proposal includes mechanisms for swapping between USDtb and USDe, potentially improving allocation strategies in response to market conditions. With USDtb’s launch, Ethena Labs aims to expand its stablecoin offerings while providing users with a diversified, secure, and scalable product. CoinGecko recently reported that Ethena’s USDe market capitalization surpassed $4.3 billion as of Nov. 29. CCData’s analysis attributes this growth to increased interest in the Ethena ecosystem, driven by its proposal to introduce revenue sharing for Ethena (ENA) token holders.

This stablecoin, designed to raise the bar for compliance, utility, and transparency, will officially go live on December 17, 2024. The wait is over: RLUSD launches globally tomorrow! https://t.co/mYcyyX6Vre — Ripple (@Ripple) December 16, 2024 According to the announcement , RLUSD promises to cater to institutional needs and set new standards for trust and reliability within the stablecoin market. The timing of this launch aligns with increasing calls for regulatory clarity in the United States and beyond. Ripple’s decision to develop RLUSD under the stringent New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) limited purpose trust charter highlights its emphasis on regulatory compliance. RLUSD is backed by U.S. dollar deposits, government bonds, and cash equivalents and is engineered to maintain stability. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, emphasized that RLUSD represents years of expertise in seamlessly integrating crypto with the traditional financial system. He furthered: “Early on, Ripple made a deliberate choice to launch our stablecoin under the NYDFS limited purpose trust company charter, widely regarded as the premier regulatory standard worldwide.” With platforms like Uphold, MoonPay, Archax, and CoinMENA set to host RLUSD initially and additional listings expected soon, the stablecoin’s global rollout is set for rapid traction because of the attention it has garnered. Ripple’s RLUSD: A New Standard for Stablecoins? Ripple’s strategy revolves around creating a stablecoin that meets and exceeds the expectations of financial institutions, regulators, and retail users. Each RLUSD token will be fully collateralized, ensuring stability and liquidity even in volatile markets. To reinforce this commitment, Ripple claimed it would publish third-party attestations of RLUSD’s reserves monthly, ensuring full accountability and fostering trust. From a functional perspective, RLUSD is set to play a critical role in various use cases. Institutions can leverage the stablecoin for instant settlement of cross-border payments, enhanced liquidity management, and seamless integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Ripple’s vision also extends to creating a reliable bridge between fiat currencies and the blockchain ecosystem, simplifying on-ramps and off-ramps for users navigating between the two worlds. Furthermore, RLUSD is set to be a cornerstone for collateralizing tokenized real-world assets, such as commodities and securities, on-chain. This innovative approach promises to drive the adoption of blockchain-based finance while maintaining robust compliance measures. Ripple’s Ripple Payments division is also set to incorporate RLUSD into its operations early next year, which could give it global relevance. Ripple Payments has already processed over $70 billion in transaction volume and established near-global coverage, spanning over 90 payout markets. This integration will expand RLUSD’s utility, enabling enterprises to settle international payments efficiently while enjoying blockchain technology’s cost-effectiveness and speed. Expert Leadership and Global Vision Ripple’s ambitious plans for RLUSD are bolstered by the expertise of its advisory board, which the addition of two financial heavyweights has further strengthened. Raghuram Rajan, former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, and Kenneth Montgomery, former First Vice President and COO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Despite all the massive preparations surrounding it, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has recently warned of potential supply shortages and price volatility for RLUSD . Despite its 1:1 parity with the dollar, pre-launch speculative activity has driven inflated bids for RLUSD, with one bid valuing 1 RLUSD at 511 XRP—over $1,200. Schwartz downplayed the anomaly, emphasizing that RLUSD’s price would stabilize near $1 once supply increases, and urged against speculation.

In a recent post , he shared that Cardano is on the brink of achieving what he calls a decentralized revolution. Charles explained that the project is nearing its final milestones—approval of a budget system and a community-ratified constitution—steps he believes will make the platform unstoppable. “It’s messy and tough,” he said of governance, “but it’s the only way to include everyone.” For Charlie, this is personal. “I’ll never apologize for being passionate about this outcome. It’s my life’s work.” Cardano’s roadmap has been long and complex, but with these developments, the project is eyeing 2025 as the year it reaches full decentralization. The stakes? Nothing less than taking over the blockchain world. Cardano’s Chang Hard Fork reshapes governance The Chang Hard Fork, launched on September 1, represents a turning point for Cardano. This major upgrade pushed the blockchain closer to its ultimate goal: a fully decentralized governance system. Key features included the introduction of a constitutional committee, improved on-chain voting mechanisms, and the much-anticipated rollout of Plutus v3, which brought more advanced smart contract capabilities. The constitutional committee, acting as an interim governing body, was designed to oversee governance decisions during this transitional phase. It’s temporary, though—once the community approves the ratified constitution, the committee will dissolve. From there, governance will rest entirely in the hands of ADA holders. Charles sees this as a step toward the Voltaire phase, the final stage of Cardano’s development roadmap. Voltaire envisions a blockchain that funds itself through a treasury system and gives ADA holders full control over its evolution. In Charlie’s words, these upgrades are not about short-term price movements but about “ensuring Cardano thrives in the long run.” The Chang upgrade also introduced Delegate Representatives (DReps), allowing ADA holders to vote indirectly through elected representatives. This system encourages wider participation while maintaining efficiency. ADA struggles in a volatile market While Cardano’s governance upgrades grab headlines, ADA’s market performance tells a different story. As of press time, ADA is trading at $0.934, down 3.26% in the past twenty-four hours. Despite the current downturn, investor sentiment remains strong. The Fear & Greed Index for ADA sits at 74, signaling greed. Over the past month, ADA has seen gains on 67% of trading days, showing some resilience even amid market uncertainty. Analysts predict ADA will continue to fluctuate, with a trading range of $0.934 to $1.10 expected for December. The average price is projected at $1.02, but much depends on broader market conditions, which is incredibly bullish thanks to incoming US president Donald Trump.

However, the year ended with Bitcoin surpassing $100K. Another notable growth is seen with Solana, which drove the meme coin market. Messari data analysts compiled a two-part report on the trends and narratives in the crypto industry in 2024. The report, authored by Messari’s enterprise analysts and experts, explored various themes, including the rise of artificial intelligence in the crypto sector . Messari analysts reflect on 2024 inflationary worries Messari calls 2024 the “climbing wall of worry” because inflation uncertainty left investors wondering if the Fed’s monetary policies would trigger a recession. However, 2024 concludes with Bitcoin surpassing $100K after the crypto market overcame the macro obstacles of a weakening labor market. Along with the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the report underlines AI as the 2024 highlight. The report read in part; “The market is beginning to price in the potential for AI-driven productivity boosts.” Messari also calls 2024 the year of Solana. The report underlined advancements in Solana’s technology and adoption, making it a hub for memecoin trading. In the year, memecoins themselves remained wildly popular, capturing retail interest. Notably, user adoption surged globally, with apps like Phantom and Polymarket onboarding millions. The analysts also discovered that stablecoins have also become essential in emerging markets. Meanwhile, decentralized infrastructure (DePIN) gained traction in industries like energy and telecommunications. The report also touched on regulatory challenges and market volatility. However, the report revealed that the industry showed resilience and innovation. In the macro context, the analysts noted that crypto market trends faced challenges such as lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase. They added that government asset sales and Mt.Gox repayments also played a part in the volatility experienced in 2024. Messari highlighted the pressures eased after Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. The analysts added the president pledged to protect innovation, self-custody, and Bitcoin mining. According to the researchers, these policies signalled a friendly environment for cryptocurrency that emphasized Bitcoin as an innovation driver and strategic asset. Messari analysts discuss crypto sectorial highlights in 2024 The researchers highlighted some sectorial advancements, including the intersection of artificial intelligence and the crypto ecosystem. The analysts reported the intersection exposed the crypto ecosystem to content creation and gaming frontiers. Messari analysts also confirmed that NFTs gained popularity in 2024, especially in enhancing monetization and digital ownership. The analysts predicted that these trends would drive the adoption of cryptocurrencies in the years ahead. Messari also commented on the introduction of Bitcoin stalking in 2024. They added that Babylon, BTC’s first stalking protocol, enabled holders to stake their assets and earn rewards without giving up control of their assets. In the report, Messari predicted that even as the BTC network changes, BTC programmability and stalking remain nascent. The analysts highlighted the path worth monitoring as layers on BTC and AVSs.They predicted these could unlock the utmost levels of economic security and decentralization. However, the analysts disclosed that in 2024, users often preferred the performance capabilities of networks such as Base and Solana. They added that users overlooked decentralization and security. The researchers warned BTC builders could have difficulty competing against other networks if the trend continued.

Crypto Bitlord claimed that the real price target for XRP is not $6 as some commentators said but $589, adding that those who dismissed this three-figure target are not ambitious enough. You’re not delusional enough with your price targets $XRP $589 — Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7) December 16, 2024 The crypto analyst argued that the prices being forecast by several market observers are conservative estimates, believing that $589 per unit is very feasible. Previously, Crypto Bitlord had already stated that XRP would reach the three-figure price. However, he received derogatory remarks from investors for what they claimed as an ambitious dream. Now, with the crypto asset performing very well in the bull market, Crypto Bitlord was able to fire back at them, calling them not “delusional” enough. Smoking Crack? Several traders in the XRP community do not share the same vision as Crypto Bitlord, seeing the target of $589 as not feasible. Earlier this month, another crypto analyst, Tony Edwards, downplayed the $589 target, saying that the target is a “fantasy.” Edward argued that astronomical price predictions for the coin are delusional, saying, “People calling for $589, $1,000, or $10,000 are “smoking crack.” My $XRP price target for this cycle $5-$8. It could go a bit higher but I’m gonna play it safe and be conservative.

Edward estimated the price rally would put XRP between $5 and $8. Altcoin Performing Well Data revealed that XRP benefits greatly from the ongoing crypto bull market driven by Donald Trump reclaiming the White House.

The failed exchange confirmed this in an announcement today while also updating its claims portal. According to the information on the claim portal , creditors can also receive their bankruptcy payouts in stablecoins. This will be possible for creditors by converting their fiat for digital assets, including stablecoins. FTX Distribution Portal (Source: X) Meanwhile, both BitGo and Kraken have confirmed their partnership. In its announcement, BitGo noted that FTX retail users could reclaim their funds securely via its platform. The firm’s CEO, Mike Belshe, noted that it is proud to support FTX. He said: “With our long-standing reputation as the most secure choice in the industry, we work hard to bring institutional-grade service to both retail and institutional clients, ensuring users the peace of mind they need to manage and grow their assets safely.” As for Kraken , it confirmed the agreement in a blog post, stating it will assist the FTX and its affiliated debtors with distributing their recoveries in supported jurisdictions. The exchange noted that this is not its first rodeo, as it was also involved in the Mt Gox distributions in 2024. While FTX has already chosen two firms to distribute payouts to customers, the Claims Portal shows that the bankrupt exchange intends to select a third. The space for the third distribution partner currently says “ Upcoming Distribution Agent. More information to come soon.” The choice of the two distribution partners is already raising concerns in some quarters. Users in jurisdictions where BitGo and Kraken do not operate are worried about how they will be able to process their claims and get their repayments. FTX picks January 3, 2025, as effective date The announcement of distribution partners marks another major step in repaying the exchange’s creditors. With that decision, FTX has also picked January 3, 2025, as the effective date for its Chapter 11 Reorganization plan. This means that FTX will have to make the initial distributions to its customers within 60 days of that date. Based on the plan approved by the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware in October, 98% of the FTXE creditors in the convenience class and fall within the convenience class will get their initial distribution within this period. Creditors in this category are scheduled to receive 119% of their allowed claims based on the value of the customers’ crypto holdings as of November 2022, when the exchange filed for bankruptcy. All they need to do is meet the distribution requirements. FTX CEO John Ray III described the whole process up to this point as a reflection of the bankruptcy estate’s outstanding work and its efforts to recover assets. He said: “We are well positioned to begin executing the distribution of recoveries back to all customers and creditors and encourage customers to complete the necessary steps to begin receiving distributions in a timely manner.” Meanwhile, creditors in other classes of claims might still have to wait much longer before they can start receiving their repayments. FTX noted that it will announce payment dates for them soon. FTX recovers $35 million from Gate.io While the bankruptcy estate is working on commencing distribution, recovery efforts remain underway, and some are already yielding. After filing an adversary lawsuit against the Gate.io exchange in November to recover $40 million, on-chain transactions show that around $35 million has been returned to the FTX-controlled wallet. This marks another recovery after the exchange received around $14 million from several political action committees and campaign groups a few days ago. However, it remains locked in a dispute over claims with some creditors, such as Three Arrows Capital and Crypto.com. The professionals involved in the bankruptcy proceedings have also been criticized for the amount of money spent on the reorganization plan. Between May and July 2024, the bankruptcy professional fees were $98.5 million , with the financial advisor Alvarez & Marsal and legal counsel Sullivan & Cromwell being the top earners within that period.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe (PEPE) prices dip as Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) storms the stage with a record-breaking $25M presale. Table of Contents DOGE progress stalls PEPE hopping into trouble Next 100x meme coin: Wall Street Pepe hits $25M in presale Throughout 2024, crypto enthusiasts have been speculating about and passionately debating the meme coin supercycle, and how long it could last. While many meme coins saw price growth as Bitcoin broke past $100,000, the likes of Dogecoin and Pepe have since dipped, with DOGE down 10% on the weekly chart and PEPE down 14%. However, a brand-new meme coin – Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) – has raised $25m in a very short period. This is an incredible achievement that marks WEPE as one of the fastest-growing presales, a clear sign that the meme coin supercycle still has a lot of staying power. DOGE progress stalls From the chart below, DOGE bulls will be keeping an eye on DOGE’s ascending triangle. However, at this point, DOGE has spent over a week dipping towards the green diagonal trend line – and if the price breaks through it, traders and investors will turn their attention to the support levels below. Two psychological price levels stand out due to high wicks emerging from a couple of past daily candles. These are $0.30 and $0.22 – and if the DOGE price falls to $0.22 from its current value, that will be a dip of approximately 44%. Even though we are in a bull market and the meme coin supercycle theory remains plausible, all market cycles involve dips and corrections as well as pumps and other bullish movements. So, although $0.30 might prove a sufficiently strong support level to enable a bounce and bullish continuation, $0.22 is a good level to look at for investors who want to buy DOGE at a heavy discount. In the event of a dip, it’s likely to take some time – perhaps several weeks or a few months – before the DOGE price recovers and goes beyond $0.485. You might also like: PEPU surges 400% 2 days after IEO, viral WEPE to surge next PEPE hopping into trouble PEPE followed Dogecoin’s pump with a delay of a couple of days. Since that time, PEPE traders and investors have shown a lot less confidence in this token’s ability to sustain its higher price – and this is reflected in the high degree of chop in the chart below, as well as a notable tendency for dips to form and activate very quickly. Since DOGE dipped, PEPE has chopped with even more intensity, rather than falling too far down. Looking at Pepe’s trading volume, a much sharper drop-off in volume is seen over the last few days. This means that this intense chop is being driven by very little trading volume – which could be a sign of manipulation driven by algorithms and trading AIs. Taking a bullish perspective, just like DOGE, PEPE is located within an ascending triangle. However, the trendline that forms the support level for that triangle is quite steep – and that generally indicates weaker support and a high likelihood of a large dip if the support level is broken. From there, it’s quite a long way down (almost -35%) to the next strongest support level at $0.000015. Because of the high degree of recent chop, such a bearish move might take some time to reach its target – but it could easily get there before bouncing and moving into a new bullish phase. Overall, DOGE and PEPE are currently showing significant weakness, with a strong possibility of large dips ahead. Fortunately, it’s not all doom and gloom for meme coin traders as a new presale project is showing huge potential. Next 100x meme coin: Wall Street Pepe hits $25M in presale With so much potentially bearish uncertainty swirling through the crypto markets, projects that are achieving massive success under these conditions really stand out. Wall Street Pepe is one such project, and has already raised $25m in the first two weeks of its presale stage. Wall Street Pepe was created to empower degens across the crypto space with the skills and tools they need to get ahead. From alpha calls to key trading insights and strategic advantages, the WEPE army is already one of the fastest-growing meme coin communities. The token also offers staking – and can be staked during the presale stage, with current estimated rewards of 47% PA. Over at 99Bitcoins, a crypto analyst has completed a deep dive into Wall Street Pepe, and found it to be incredibly promising: Very few meme coins are designed to provide their community members with any utility at all – let alone actionable trading advice and the knowledge required to make money from crypto. Another frog meme coin, Pepe Unchained, saw gains of over 600% after its launch last week following a $60M+ presale, and Wall Street Pepe could be set for similar gains.

The spike led to a market capitalization of over $850 million, less than $150 million shy of crossing the $1 billion threshold. This growth is a significant achievement for the comedic cryptocurrency, which has gained traction through strong community support after AI agent Truth Terminal birthed the idea of Fartcoin, and the memecoin space took advantage of the opportunity to create the token. The rapid rise of Fartcoin underscores a growing trend in the cryptocurrency market where humor, community engagement, and viral appeal are driving value creation.

Chill Pepe (CHILPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CHILPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Chill Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Chill Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Chill Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Chill Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Chill Pepe by entering its contract address – AfPftBmzfb2pan4Drt2ZKgT7VK5Rn7CLQHpp8DpLhXZj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CHILPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-16 23:58:00

The Bitcoin miner used the additional proceeds from its coupon-convertible bond issue to acquire 667 BTC at $101,135 per token, bringing its total BTC holding to 17,429 BTC. Riot generated a BTC Yield Per Share of 37.2% YTD and 36.7% QTD through the recent Bitcoin acquisition and mining production YTD. Its total Bitcoin holding is currently worth $1.8B at the average market price of $103,873. Riot Platforms closes convertible senior notes offering With the additional proceeds from Riot’s upsized $594 million, 0.75% coupon convertible bond issue, the Company has acquired 667 BTC at an average price of $101,135 per BTC.

(@RiotPlatforms) December 16, 2024 According to Riot Platforms, the aggregate principal amount of the 2030 Notes sold in the offering included $69.4 million relating to the partial exercise of the initial purchasers’ option. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2030 Notes were approximately $579.2 million after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts, commissions, and estimated offering expenses payable by Riot. The Bitcoin miner disclosed that the 2030 Notes were sold in a private offering only to persons reasonably deemed qualified institutional buyers per the Securities Act. All the net proceeds were swiftly deployed to additional Bitcoin acquisition. According to Stock Titan, successfully completing the convertible notes offering represented a huge capital raise for Riot. The convertible structure provided flexibility for future equity conversion while minimizing immediate dilution. Investors should, however, note that the substantial BTC acquisition exposed Riot to increased crypto volatility, although the low interest rate indicated favorable market conditions. The 2030 maturity period also provided a lengthy runway for the company’s growth strategy. Riot’s capital raise marked one of the most significant fundraising events recently in the crypto mining sector. It signalled strong institutional confidence in the company’s business model and demonstrated Riot’s commitment to future operational expansion. Riot Platforms doubles down on Bitcoin with substantial additional acquisition On December 9th, Riot announced its intention to use all proceeds from the offering to purchase more Bitcoin, and it carried through with its plan by acquiring 667 BTC on December 16th. The company had already used a portion of the offering net proceeds to accumulate over 5K BTC between December 10th and 12th. Riot Platforms increased its BTC holding to 17,429, suggesting plans to expand its Bitcoin reserve significantly and potentially impacting its financial strategy. The Bitcoin mining company acquired and held Bitcoin to enhance stockholder value. Riot reported its BTC Yield KPI indicating a quarter-to-date Yield of 36.7% and a year-to-date Yield of 37.2%. According to Riot Platforms, the BTC Yield KPI could only be used by pro-level investors to supplement their understanding of the company’s decision to fund the purchase of Bitcoin by issuing additional shares of its common stock. Riot emphasized that the BTC Yield KPI was not equivalent to ‘yield’ in the traditional financial context since it could not be used as an operating performance or liquidity measure. InvestingPro analysts anticipated that the recent BTC acquisitions would push Riot’s revenue growth to 32% in 2024. InvestingPro data further showed that the company maintained a strong balance sheet with more cash than debt and a healthy current ratio of 5.86x. Recent stock performance was also strong, with a 16% return over the past week and 23% over six months.

Market analysts studying each crypto sector closely say Chainlink (LINK) is the altcoin to watch and believe Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) is poised to become a top Solana memecoin in 2025. However, regarding the best cryptos to buy now, experts say anyone looking for substantial profits by January has more to gain from the PropiChain (PCHAIN) presale. PropiChain is ushering in the Web3 real estate revolution, and PCHAIN, its native token, is projected for an outstanding 23,902% run . Should Your Portfolio Include Chainlink (LINK) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN)? While altcoins like XRP, ETH, and ADA stole the spotlight over the past month, many failed to notice the silent Chainlink (LINK) rally that was taking place. Some now even consider LINK one of the best-performing altcoins of Q4, considering that the Chainlink price at $28.62 today is up across the past week (13.28%), month (116.22%), and year (91.54%). This is even more true for Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) over in the Solana memecoin sector. Barely two months since its CMC listing, the Fartcoin price has surged 238.54%, 187.35%, and 948.26% to $0.5921 over the past week, month, and all-time, respectively. However, the problem with Chainlink (LINK) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) remains the same for investors. Despite being good portfolio options, their surging prices offer diminished gains and potential losses for investors who purchase today, leaving the search for the best altcoins to buy now still wide open. PropiChain: The RWA Altcoin Outpacing Chainlink (LINK) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) If you’re a crypto community member or pay any attention to Web3 news, you’ve likely heard about the PropiChain (PCHAIN) presale , which recently concluded round one after raising over $1.4 million. While it’s not uncommon in a hype-fueled industry, PropiChain’s early success with investors can be attributed to its breakthrough blockchain solutions for the $600T real estate industry. Unlike competing solutions focusing on a single industry problem, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is introducing the first-ever full-service platform for checkmating global property fraud, eliminating the financial investing barrier, providing unlimited market access, and allowing for super-convenient digital asset management. These are all problems the industry has been trying to fix for many years. Still, PropiChain is finally making it possible with blockchain, RWA tokenization, metaverse, smart contracts, and artificial intelligence technologies. Among these technologies, blockchain is most important as it enables PropiChain to tokenize real estate, provides an impervious vault for storing tokens, and allows for smart-contract-based property management. PropiChain is finally bringing RWA tokenization to real estate, but what might seem like a simple technological advancement can reshape the entire industry. First, tokenization will allow for fractional ownership in real estate , thereby making it possible to trade digitized properties in unlimited fractions and prices. But this digitization will also bring liquidity to real estate by allowing for instant property transactions instead of the 44-day average it currently takes. We’ll witness unprecedented access to the market with fractional ownership and digitization, but PropiChain is taking it a step further with its interactive metaverse marketplace. Experts believe that by letting users take virtual tours, hosting virtual meetings, and staging assets virtually, PropiChain will become a major property trading platform. Yet, things only get more interesting with PropiChain’s smart contracts for property management and artificial intelligent tools for investors. On PropiChain, smart contracts can handle property rights transfers and manage rental agreements with features such as auto asset leasing, auto-renewals, and auto rent payment collections. Furthermore, PCHAIN holders can make data-driven investment decisions and even automate the investing process with AI tools that can personalize property search, derive assets’ true value using real-time metrics, and automatically trade properties when their value drops or rises above a pre-specified amount. Chainlink (LINK) vs. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) vs. PropiChain (PCHAIN): Which to Buy? Chainlink (LINK), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), and PropiChain (PCHAIN) are three undervalued altcoins on investors’ watchlists today. However, its PCHAIN investors pick for the highest profits in this generation’s bull cycle. Unlike Chainlink and Fartcoin, offering modest gains and potential for significant losses from sharp price corrections, analysts project PropiChain (PCHAIN) for an astonishing 23,902% run by Q1 2025, outperforming LINK, FARTCOIN and most crypto markets. PropiChain Presale: Round Two Begins after Raising Over $1.4 Million Many already consider PropiChain (PCHAIN) the hottest new crypto after round one of its presale raised $1.4 million weeks after launch. Understandably, investors rushed to acquire a stake in the real estate Web3 revolution at its lowest-ever price. While round one is already gone, interested investors can still participate in round two of the presale , now selling PCHAIN at $0.011, the cheapest it’ll ever be again. However, round two is already moving quicker than the first as its early success signals investors of the best crypto presale project to invest in. The project’s BlockAudit security audit and PropiChain CoinMarketCap listing also have a hand to play after massively driving traffic following their announcements. Although a generous 291% profits await round-two investors by the final stage in the coming weeks, most are looking ahead as today’s investment of $1,500 can yield a staggering $360,030 by Q1 2025 when PCHAIN completes its 23,902% run. But remember, PropiChain is breezing through round two, and investors might miss this chance just as they missed round one.

As 2025 approaches, investors are searching for the best altcoins to buy in the US. Analysts have highlighted three promising altcoins— RCO Finance (RCOF) , TRON (TRX), and Cardano (ADA)—as potential high-risers by January 1. Can these tokens deliver the best altcoins to buy in the US? 1. RCO Finance RCO Finance stands out with its advanced robo-advisor, which provides a more efficient approach than traditional human market analysis. This tool scans the markets, reviews projects, and identifies trends that need to be included manually. Investors can now access insights and predictions that make decision-making easier. Experts who have used the AI tool say the robo-advisor predicts outcomes and creates customized portfolios based on each investor’s goals and risk tolerance. This personalized service helps investors make more informed decisions and aligns trades with their strategies. RCO Finance’s robo-advisor acts like a financial consultant thanks to its machine-learning algorithms. It offers real-time recommendations, telling users when to buy, sell, or diversify their assets based on specific patterns. This feature gives users a clear advantage in decision-making and ensures they are always one step ahead. Beyond the robo-advisor, RCO Finance offers access to the best altcoins to buy in the US. The platform has 120,000 digital assets across 12,500 categories, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, bonds, ETFs, and real-world assets (RWAs). This wide selection lets users diversify their portfolios and manage risk. Very importantly, in an age of increasing emphasis on security, RCO Finance takes security seriously. It has completed a smart contract audit with SolidProof, a leading blockchain security firm. The audit confirms the platform’s commitment to transparency and the safety of user assets. 2. TRX Justin Sun declared TRX the “Next XRP” on X (previously Twitter). This has sparked much curiosity in the crypto world, especially given XRP’s recent surge, spurred by legal updates, ETF registrations, and favorable news about Ripple. Sun’s posts, including “TRX = XRP” have captured the attention of the Tron and XRP community and the larger market, speculating that TRX will follow XRP’s trend. TRX boasts one of the blockchains’ highest active user bases, thanks to its seamless integration with popular platforms, and currently trades at about $0.2893. Analysts believe TRON is on the cusp of a major price breakout, making it one of the best altcoins to consider before January 1. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu experts believe that TRX could rise to about $0.7788 to become the best altcoins to buy in the US. With its solid foundation and growing adoption, TRX is a reliable option for long-term investors seeking steady growth. 3. Cardano The Cardano Foundation’s social media platform X account appears to have been compromised in the early hours of December 8, causing fake news to spread throughout the cryptocurrency community. A series of messages from the account indicated that ADA tokens would undergo significant changes, such as stopping trade and token burns. One message claimed that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had filed a lawsuit against the Cardano Foundation. At a current price of $1.10, ADA has a strong developer ecosystem and an active community that continues to drive its adoption. With its ongoing upgrades and partnerships, Cardano is poised for significant growth in 2025. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu analysts predict that the price of Cardano could rise by 22.49% and reach $ 1.34 by January 1. Cardano stands out as a top contender for investors looking for a secure yet high-potential crypto. RCOF Becomes The Best Altcoins to Buy in the US Ahead of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Dogecoin and Shiba Inu analysts are predicting a staggering 1000x return for early investors that would capitalize on the $0.077 selling price of RCOF during the ongoing stage 4 of the presale. Imagine turning a $5 investment into $5,000—a life-changing opportunity that is well within reach if you act now. Experts say RCOF is one of the best altcoins to buy in the US due to its post-launch potential. After the launch at the $0.4 to $0.6 price range, experts expect a further 5,000% surge. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are strong contenders with their robust ecosystems and promising growth trajectories, RCOF’s presale offers unparalleled potential for explosive gains. There’s no better time to invest as the token price increases with each presale stage. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the next big crypto success story.

As XRP and Cardano navigate uncertain growth, XYZVerse emerges with the potential to shake up the 2025 crypto market. Table of Contents The all-sports meme token ready to make its play XRP Cardano Conclusion Investors are questioning whether established cryptocurrencies like XRP and Cardano (ADA) can maintain their upward momentum in a rapidly evolving market. Meanwhile, new tokens are emerging, promising to disrupt the status quo and offer fresh opportunities for growth. One such contender is XYZVerse (XYZ), a meme coin that bridges sports enthusiasm and crypto culture, aiming to redefine community engagement and market dynamics. The all-sports meme token ready to make its play As XRP and Cardano work to sustain their growth, newcomers like XYZVerse are emerging to challenge the status quo. Bridging sports enthusiasm with the viral power of meme coins, XYZ is positioned as a transformative token that combines community engagement with growth potential. XYZ is more than just another meme coin – it’s an exclusive VIP pass to a sports-driven, meme-powered ecosystem. Think of it as the MVP of the XYZVerse platform, where investors can capitalize on the skyrocketing demand for meme coins. Polymarket hit $1 billion in trading volume during the U.S. presidential election. Imagine pairing that with the hype of meme coins and the excitement of sports betting. With millions of sports fans ready to participate, the XYZVerse ecosystem is primed for expansion, offering slam-dunk rewards for early adopters. Meme coins are dominating the 2024 crypto landscape, and XYZ is ready to crush the competition. With projected thousand-fold returns and a 9,900% growth target by the Token Generation Event (TGE), XYZ is set to outperform rivals like BOME (5,000% rise) and WIF (1,000% rally). Upcoming listings on major CEX and DEX platforms, audited smart contracts, and a vetted team ensure that XYZVerse is a secure and promising investment. The first-mover advantage is critical here – those who get in before the crowd storms the field could see unmatched returns. Intrigued investors can get XYZ via presale and be part of its crypto championship. XRP XRP has experienced significant growth over the past six months, soaring by 379.42%. In the last month, it surged 122.42%, marking a remarkable uptrend. Currently trading between $2.20 and $2.58, XRP is hovering around its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $2.42 and $2.40 respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 51.94, suggesting that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic indicator is at 37.97, reinforcing a neutral market position. Looking ahead, XRP faces its nearest resistance at $3.30. A breakthrough could propel it toward the next resistance level of $4.03. On the downside, immediate support lies at $1.83, with a secondary support at $1.09 if bearish momentum continues. You might also like: AI predicts XRP surpassing ETH this cycle — but the real crypto winner could be XYZ Cardano Over the past week, Cardano has seen a price increase of 7.07%. In the last month, ADA has surged by 48.08%, and over six months, it has climbed by 170.90%. The current price ranges between $1.06 and $1.33, showing significant movement in a short period. Technical indicators suggest potential for further growth. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 54.78, indicating neutral momentum. The stochastic oscillator is at 82.14, which is nearing the overbought zone. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is slightly negative at -0.00015329, hinting at a possible bullish reversal. If ADA breaks above the nearest resistance level of $1.46, it could aim for the second resistance at $1.73, representing an increase of approximately 30%. On the downside, if it falls below the nearest support at $0.923, it might test the second support at $0.653, a potential decrease of about 40%. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close at $1.08 and $1.10, suggesting consolidation before the next major move.

From Dogecoin’s meteoric rise to Shiba Inu’s multi-billion-dollar ecosystem, meme coins have proven they’re more than just jokes. Enter BTFD Coin, the latest buzz in the meme coin universe, poised to redefine what these digital assets can do. With its play-to-earn (P2E) game , lucrative staking rewards, and vibrant community, BTFD Coin is already making waves—and it’s just getting started. The presale for BTFD Coin (BTFD) , which went live on November 26, 2024, has quickly captured the attention of crypto investors. With over $4 million raised in just a few weeks, BTFD’s presale performance is nothing short of legendary. Analysts predict BTFD’s price will skyrocket once listed at $0.0006 per coin. But what makes this meme coin so special? And how does it stack up against heavyweights like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? Let’s dive deep into why BTFD Coin, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu are the best meme coins to invest in right now and what sets them apart in the ever-growing crypto market. BTFD Coin: The Future of Meme Coins Is Here BTFD Coin’s presale is one of the hottest crypto events of 2024. In just a few weeks, it’s surged through 12 presale stages, raising over $4 million and selling more than 55 billion coins. What’s driving this success? A combination of innovative features and community-driven hype. BTFD’s presale kicked off at an eye-popping price of $0.000004 per coin. By Stage 5, the price had risen to $0.00005. Fast forward to Stage 12, and it’s now sitting at $0.00013 per coin. Once the presale concludes, BTFD will launch at $0.0006 per coin, offering early investors potentially massive returns. To illustrate: if you had invested $5,000 during Stage 5, you would have snagged 100 million BTFD coins. By the time the coin hits $0.0006, your investment would be worth a whopping $60,000. That’s a 12x return—not bad for a coin that’s just getting started! BTFD Coin isn’t just about numbers, though. Its ecosystem is packed with features to keep users engaged. The P2E game, which integrates $BTFD rewards, is already being hailed as a game-changer. Players can earn tokens while having fun, creating a win-win scenario. On top of that, staking rewards incentivise long-term holding, ensuring a steady price trajectory. Combine this with a strong community of over 5,600 holders, and you’ve got a recipe for success. BTFD also benefits from its tongue-in-cheek branding. “Buy the F***ing Dip” isn’t just a slogan; it’s a mindset. This meme coin embraces market volatility, turning it into an opportunity for its investors. With analysts projecting significant gains post-launch, the FOMO around BTFD is real. Don’t miss your chance to get in early on this trailblazing meme coin. Dogecoin: The OG Meme Coin That Started It All When it comes to meme coins, Dogecoin is the undisputed king. Launched in 2013 as a joke, it’s now a household name, thanks in part to its playful Shiba Inu mascot and high-profile endorsements from the likes of Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s rise to fame wasn’t just luck; it’s backed by a passionate community that believes in its potential as a decentralised currency for everyday use. In 2021, Dogecoin hit its all-time high of $0.74, catapulting it into the crypto elite. While its price has since cooled off, Dogecoin remains a favourite among meme coin investors. Its transaction speed and low fees make it a practical choice for microtransactions and tipping. Plus, with Musk recently hinting at integrating Dogecoin into X (formerly Twitter), there’s renewed optimism about its future. But Dogecoin isn’t without its challenges. Critics argue that its lack of utility and unlimited supply could hinder long-term growth. Still, its resilience and ability to weather market downturns make it a strong contender. For those looking for a relatively stable meme coin with a proven track record, Dogecoin remains a solid bet. While newer meme coins like BTFD offer innovative features, Dogecoin’s simplicity and charm continue to win hearts. It’s not just a coin; it’s a cultural phenomenon. And in the world of meme coins, that’s priceless. Shiba Inu: The “Doge Killer” with Big Ambitions Shiba Inu burst onto the scene in 2020, branding itself as the “Doge Killer.” What started as a joke quickly evolved into a multi-faceted ecosystem. Shiba Inu isn’t just a meme coin; it’s an entire universe, complete with its own decentralised exchange (ShibaSwap), NFTs, and a metaverse project in the works. In 2021, Shiba Inu made headlines when its price skyrocketed by over 70,000,000%, turning early investors into millionaires. Today, Shiba Inu continues to innovate, expanding its ecosystem to include real-world applications. For instance, the upcoming Shibarium layer-2 solution promises faster and cheaper transactions, making $SHIB more appealing for everyday use. One of Shiba Inu’s standout features is its deflationary model. A significant portion of $SHIB tokens is regularly burned, reducing supply and potentially increasing demand. This sets it apart from Dogecoin’s inflationary model and positions it as a long-term investment option. While Shiba Inu’s price is nowhere near its 2021 peak, its robust ecosystem and active community make it a strong contender in the meme coin space. For investors seeking a meme coin with serious utility and growth potential, Shiba Inu is worth a closer look. Conclusion: Join the BTFD Revolution Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu are the best meme coins to invest in right now. Each offers unique features and growth potential, but BTFD Coin stands out as the most exciting opportunity. With its explosive presale performance, innovative P2E game, and strong community backing, BTFD is poised to take the meme coin world by storm. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this revolution. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your spot in one of the hottest crypto investments of 2024. This is your chance to buy the dip—and ride the wave to the moon.

Bulls have reversed the negative sentiment, driving the price to a seven-day high of $7.08, marking a 12% increase in the past day and a 25% rise over the last 30 days.

Additionally, the 24-hour trading volume jumped by 142% to $583.99 million. Analysts now predict that RUNE could see a price increase of over 125% in the near term. Will Thorchain Price Soar 125%? The recent price rally has brought renewed attention to Thorchain (RUNE) as market activity intensified significantly. The cryptocurrency’s 24-hour trading volume increased to $583.99 million, representing a surge of 142%, reflecting heightened buying interest. Concurrently, the market capitalization also saw a 12.02% rise, solidifying Thorchain’s growing market position at $2.39 billion. Open interest in RUNE futures has also gained traction, increasing by 16.19% to $114.97 million. This rise indicates growing optimism among investors as bullish sentiment dominates the market. The uptick in both trading volume and open interest suggests that traders and buyers are actively positioning themselves for potential upward moves in RUNE’s price. Analysts see this strong momentum as an indicator of continued price growth. Cryptocurrency analyst Javon Marks commented on the current trend, stating, “$RUNE (THORChain) has an upside target of approximately $15.75, representing a potential increase of over 125%.” Technical Indicators Confirm Bullish Sentiment RUNEUSD technical indicators also point to sustained bullish momentum for the token. On the 4hr price chart, Thorchain price broke out of an ascending triangle pattern.which often signals of an impending upward price breakout. The breakout occurred when RUNE’s price crossed the $6.50 resistance level, leading to a significant upward surge. Following the breakout, the bulls have maintained control, driving the Thorchain price above $7. Analysts consider the breakout confirmation a strong sign of buyer dominance. RUNE/USD 4hr price chart (source: TradingView) The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator further supports this bullish sentiment. The MACD line recently crossed above the signal line, signaling the start of a potential upward trend. Concurrently, the histogram bars, which have turned green, show that buyer momentum is building as the MACD diverges upward. In addition, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 62.03, which indicates a bullish zone without the risk of being overbought. The indicator peaked at 75 during the recent rally, before slightly retreating, showing that buyers are still active without pushing the price into overbought conditions. Subsequently, this balance suggests there could be more upward movement for Thorchain price if current momentum is maintained.

XRPL Validator, VET, recently shared valuable tips for beginners interested in setting up their nodes. This article outlines the key points from VET’s post to provide a comprehensive understanding of the process and its benefits. What is an XRP Ledger (XRPL) Node? An XRP Ledger (XRPL) node is essentially a computer running the XRPL software, known as “rippled.” These nodes connect to the XRP Ledger network by establishing peer connections with other nodes. This interaction forms a decentralized network that processes transactions and maintains the ledger’s integrity. There are several types of XRPL nodes, each serving distinct purposes based on their configuration: Validators: Nodes that validate transactions and add them to the ledger. Stock Nodes: Designed for standard use, such as querying balances, submitting transactions, and sharing ledger data. Full History Nodes : Nodes that store the complete history of the XRPL. Pathfinding Nodes: Nodes optimized for finding payment paths. Why Run a Node? Running an XRPL node comes with several significant benefits. First, it provides independence, allowing users to eliminate reliance on third-party wallet providers or exchanges that typically run nodes to submit transactions. By operating your own node, you ensure uninterrupted access to the ledger at all times. Additionally, running a node contributes directly to the XRPL network by supporting the dissemination and validation of ledger data, strengthening the overall system. Finally, maintaining a personal node enhances security and control by reducing dependence on potentially vulnerable third-party infrastructure. Setting Up an XRP Ledger Node: Basic Requirements To get started, you’ll need a few essential components. A standard laptop or PC will suffice as the primary hardware, paired with a stable internet connection. While VET recommends speeds above 200 Mbps for optimal performance, lower speeds may still work in certain situations. Additionally, you’ll need the XRPL software, known as “rippled,” which can be downloaded directly from the official XRPL documentation. Hardware Specifications: The hardware requirements for running a node are relatively modest. While the official XRPL documentation suggests higher specifications, VET notes that 32GB DDR3 RAM and a basic CPU should suffice for non-intensive use. Operating System: Linux is the recommended operating system for running “rippled.” For users unfamiliar with Linux, VET suggests using Docker , a platform that simplifies the setup process. A video guide on this approach is forthcoming. Overcoming Challenges: Setting up and maintaining a node may seem daunting, particularly for those unfamiliar with command-line interfaces. However, with available resources and support from the XRP community , many beginners have successfully navigated the process. Resources and Support: The XRPL documentation provides a detailed installation guide for Linux users, accessible here . Additionally, experienced members of the XRP community, including VET, are available to answer questions and provide guidance. Running an XRPL node is an excellent way for individuals to contribute to the network, enhance their control over their transactions, and gain deeper insights into blockchain technology. While the setup process may require effort and learning, the long-term benefits of independence, security, and community engagement make it a worthwhile endeavor. Those interested in getting started should leverage the resources and support available within the XRPL ecosystem.

On December 17, 2024, data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment revealed a massive rise in whale activity on the Cardano network, signaling potential upside momentum. Whale Transactions Surge on Cardano Network According to the data, the Cardano network witnessed a substantial 687 transactions, each worth more than $1 million, recorded in the past 24 hours. This highlights whales’ rising interest and confidence in the altcoin, suggesting a major price rally could be on the horizon. Additionally, these notable transaction details were highlighted by crypto experts on X (formerly Twitter). However, ADA experienced this surge in transactions during a period of consolidation, as it traded within a tight range over the past week.

In the past 24 hours, 687 transactions exceeding $1 million were recorded. pic.twitter.com/p8vzuLaFVP — Ali (@ali_charts) December 16, 2024 Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, ADA appears to have formed a bearish head and shoulders price action pattern. However, this pattern isn’t yet complete, as the price remains trapped in a consolidation range between $1.07 and $1.14. This range could determine whether ADA moves upward or downward in the coming days. Source: Trading View ADA Key Levels and Current Price Momentum Based on recent price action, if ADA breaks out of the narrow range and closes a daily candle above the $1.14 level, the bearish pattern would be invalidated, and ADA’s price could soar by 43% to reach the $1.63 mark in the future. Conversely, if ADA breaks down from the range and closes a daily candle below $1, the bearish pattern would be confirmed, and ADA could witness a price decline of 24%, falling to the $0.78 level. However, this bearish outlook currently appears manageable, as ADA continues to receive support from an ascending trendline. On the positive side, ADA’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 52, below the overbought zone, indicating that the asset has enough room to rise in the coming days. Currently, ADA is trading near $1.07 and has recorded a price decline of 2.7% in the past 24 hours.

This comes as the social media giant has been constantly upgrading the AI-enabled glasses to enhance performance including to handle more complex tasks and respond more naturally in major updates that are expected to transform the smart glasses. Meta made significant upgrades to Ray-Ban Earlier this year Meta revealed it was integrating its next-generation AI model Llama 3 into virtual assistant – MetaAI in its Ray-Ban smart glasses to enhance performance. The multi-modal features were in early access last December and can perform translations in addition to identifying objects, animals, and monuments. Now, Meta has brought other major upgrades to the smart glasses to boost their performance further. According to Cnet, the always-on continuous AI assistance started working on the Ray-Ban glasses on Monday for owners that have access to Meta’s features . This is in addition to the onboard translation, and Shazam which is currently available in the US and Canada only. The latest features added to the AI-enabled glasses include continuous audio and camera recording as opposed to specific individual prompts. This, according to Cnet , allows the glasses to be used for an extended period of time with the AI features turned on. Whenever the always-on live AI is activated, the glasses’ LED also stays on. Meta keeps a recording of the conversation that can be referred to throughout the AI session. In terms of translation, it is expected to work automatically while talking. However, although the translation comes through the glasses, it comes with a slight delay. The live AI assistance is reportedly similar to what Google demonstrated on its own prototype glasses this month via Gemini and Android XR, arriving next year. According to Meta, as cited by Cnet, the aways-on AI takes a hit on battery life, and users can expect up to 30 minutes of use before recharging the device. However, the company further explains that this type of always-on camera-assisted AI is exactly what more tech companies will be exploring in the next year. AI glasses hit their stride in 2024 The upgrades come as Big Tech is pushing AI assistants as the raison d’etre for smart glasses. Last week, Google revealed Android XR for new smart glasses, and specifically positioned its Gemini AI assistant as the killer app. In the meantime Andrew Bosworth, Meta CTO said in blog post that “2024 was the year AI glasses hit their stride.” In the same blogpost, Bosworth further opines that smart glasses may be the best possible form factor for a “truly AI-native device.” He added the AI-powered glasses could be the first hardware category to be “completely defined by AI from the beginning.” With Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses, users can activate the virtual assistant on the glasses by saying “ Hey Meta ” then ask a question or prompt, before the assistant can respond via speakers built on the frames. According to Meta , users can livestream from the glasses to social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, using “Hey Meta” to engage with the firm’s “advanced conversational assistant” MetaAI. The Ray Ban glasses feature enhanced audio and cameras, in addition to more than 150 different custom frame and lens combinations, “and they are lighter and comfortable.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",AI,EN,0,0,OTHER,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-17 00:40:58

This article examines five significant blockchain projects—Origin Protocol, Syscoin, Particl, District0x, and Web3Bay. Each initiative introduces unique enhancements to the blockchain environment, from decentralized markets to advanced privacy measures, illustrating the adaptability and transformative capability of blockchain solutions. 1. District0x: Building Decentralized Community Networks District0x presents a novel approach to decentralized applications by offering tools for creating decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that manage marketplaces, social networks, and other community-driven platforms. Each ‘district’ within the network operates independently, governed by its participants under District0x’s governance frameworks. 2. Syscoin: Combining Bitcoin’s Security with Ethereum’s Versatility Syscoin integrates Bitcoin’s security features with Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities. It introduces the Z-DAG protocol, enhancing transaction speeds essential for scalable business uses. Syscoin’s framework accommodates various applications, from affordable global transactions to business services, aiming to establish a decentralized marketplace for diverse assets. 3. Particl: Promoting Enhanced Privacy in E-commerce Particl is dedicated to privacy, offering a decentralized marketplace where transactions remain confidential. By using its proprietary cryptocurrency, Particl ensures that user identities and activities are kept private. The platform’s focus on privacy is crucial for users who prefer anonymous transactions, especially in today’s frequent data breach climate. 4. Origin Protocol: Facilitating Decentralized Marketplaces Utilizing the Ethereum blockchain, Origin Protocol develops a comprehensive structure for creating decentralized marketplaces. It enables users to generate and handle listings for goods, services, and even rentals without traditional intermediaries. This approach minimizes transaction costs and hands control and profits back to the users, supporting a true peer-to-peer marketplace. 5. Web3Bay: Enhancing E-Commerce with Blockchain Innovation Web3Bay operates on its proprietary Layer-1 blockchain, promoting a secure, transparent, and efficient marketplace independent of central authorities. Its initial offering strategy aims to cultivate a solid community foundation, promoting stability and liquidity at its launch. Web3Bay combines blockchain’s core benefits—security, transparency, and decentralization—with an intuitive interface, appealing to a wide audience. Web3Bay’s initial offering provides a favorable opportunity for early backers, allocating 40% of its 5 billion 3BAY tokens to a 28-stage initial offering. Each stage incrementally raises the token price by 15%, benefiting early participants while securing vital capital. Beginning at $0.003 per token in Stage 1 and climbing to $0.1959 in Stage 28, each phase specifies funding goals and token distributions. This structured approach, combined with Web3Bay’s ambitious plans, aims to establish a steady introductory price and cultivate community loyalty, positioning it to revolutionize decentralized e-commerce with its secure, community-focused platform and cross-chain functionality. Key Insights While each platform offers targeted solutions to particular challenges, Web3Bay’s dedicated strategy in decentralizing e-commerce marks it as a potentially influential player in a broad market. Its strategic initial offering, designed to encourage early investment and community engagement, lays a strong foundation for success. Although Origin Protocol, Syscoin, Particl, and District0x each offer specialized services within their areas, Web3Bay’s wide market appeal and strategic use of blockchain technology could lead to extensive adoption and substantial impact. As these decentralized platforms evolve, Web3Bay emerges as a notable contender, potentially reshaping the e-commerce sector, making it an important project in the current blockchain innovation landscape.

37737084,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=663135,1734397241,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"MicroStrategy Raises Stakes, Acquires $1.5 Billion In Bitcoin Amid Positive Market Outlook",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/microstrategy-raises-stakes-acquires-1-5-billion-in-bitcoin-amid-positive-market-outlook/,"MicroStrategy, the business intelligence firm led by Michael Saylor, has ramped up its Bitcoin (BTC) acquisition strategy for the sixth consecutive week. This latest purchase comes as BTC has surged to new all-time highs, with the leading cryptocurrency recently surpassing the $106,00 mark on Monday. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Stash Grows To 439,000 BTC On Monday, Michael Saylor announced that MicroStrategy acquired an additional 15,350 BTC for approximately $1.5 billion, averaging around $100,386 per Bitcoin. This acquisition contributes to the firm’s substantial Bitcoin portfolio, which now totals 439,000 BTC, purchased for about $27.1 billion at an average price of $61,725 per Bitcoin. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Faces Headwinds: Can Bulls Revive Momentum? Interestingly, Saylor also disclosed in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter) that the firm’s Bitcoin holdings have yielded notable returns, boasting a 46.4% gain quarter-to-date (QTD) and 72.4% gain year-to-date (YTD). This bullish momentum in the market follows increased optimism since November 5, when President-elect Donald Trump secured a new term in the White House with key promises made throughout the year to the industry. Investors are now confident that Trump’s new administration would make regulatory changes that could create a more favorable climate for digital assets. The US crypto market has encountered considerable difficulties in recent years, particularly from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Microstrategy’s MSTR Rises 3% On Nasdaq 100 News The recent uptick in Bitcoin’s price is further evidenced by a significant trading volume increase, with CoinGecko reporting a $92 million surge in the past 24 hours—a 54% increase compared to the previous day. However, MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin investment strategy has not only influenced the cryptocurrency market but has also positively affected its stock (MSTR) price. Following the announcement that MicroStrategy would be listed on the Nasdaq 100 index last week, shares of the company rose over 3% in premarket trading. Related Reading: Ex-Hedge Fund Guru Bets Big On Dogecoin As ‘Core Crypto Bet’ The inclusion in the Nasdaq 100—a benchmark for technology stocks—takes effect on December 23 and is expected to attract significant investment flows, potentially leading to $2.1 billion in stock purchases from over 200 exchange-traded products that track the index. Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani remarked on Monday that MicroStrategy’s strategy to Bitcoin purchase is “unprecedented,” establishing the company as the largest corporate Bitcoin owner, with around 2% of the total supply. Chhugani commented: MSTR’s Bitcoin buying program is unprecedented on the street, and inclusion in Nasdaq 100 further improves MSTR’s market liquidity, expanding its capital flywheel and Bitcoin buying program. At the time of writing, BTC has managed to consolidate at $103,900 for the past few hours after surging to new all-time highs. The market’s leading crypto recorded gains of 2% and nearly 6% in the 24-hour and weekly time frames, respectively.

Pseudonymous analyst Credible tells his 448,500 followers on the social media platform X that XRP appears to be gearing up for wave three of its five-wave surge on the four-hour chart. Credible practices the Elliott Wave theory which states that a bullish asset tends to witness a five-wave rally where wave three represents the longest and steepest part of the surge. Credible shares a chart that outlines XRP’s path to $20 before its five-wave rally comes to a conclusion. “And for non-traders, you just need to zoom out a little so you don’t forget the big picture. Structure on XRP here looks so freaking clean and bullish, it’s actually insane. Forget what happens on these lower timeframes. It’s noise (for a non-trader), the big picture is incredibly and unequivocally bullish.” Source: Credible/X At time of writing, XRP is trading for $2.44, indicating a potential rise of 719% if the altcoin hits the massive price target. Zooming in, Credible believes it is within the realm of possibility for XRP to revisit a support level below $2 before taking off to new all-time highs. “XRP looking solid here, fresh local demand formed in the ORANGE zone. Any retests of that zone should be good long opportunities for those looking for an entry. Ideally, we get something like what is pictured.” Source: Credible/X Based on the trader’s chart, he appears to predict that XRP will first rally above $3 before witnessing a deep corrective move.

Musk Loves USA (MUSKUSA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Loves USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves USA could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves USA by entering its contract address – DdmquVnPoj7RrjCiZ1yAc8p3b6bmCagcRUedBH6c572h – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-17 01:26:00

In addition to the price action, whales and industry experts seem to be losing interest in the altcoin, as revealed by the on-chain analytics firms IntoTheBlock and CryptoQuant. Will ETH Price Decline? Recently, ETH experienced a price surge of over 15% and hit the $4,100 mark for the first time since March 2024, where it faced selling pressure and a notable price decline. Historically, ETH has reached this level five times, and each time, it has encountered a price decline and significant selling pressure. Ethereum (ETH) Rising Exchange Reserve This time, looking at past trends whales and long-term holders appear to continue depositing their ETH to exchanges, as revealed by CryptoQuant’s ETH exchange reserve metrics. Data shows that exchange reserves have increased by nearly 100k ETH worth $400 million which could signal increased selling pressure as the price nears a six-month high. Source: CryptoQuant Rising Unstaking Activity In addition to the rising exchange reserves, whales have begun withdrawing tokens from staking, suggesting they are gradually taking profits due to the recent price surge or indicating a loss of interest in holding ETH long-term. This is evidenced by the recent activity of Justin Sun, the founder of Tron. On December 16, 2024, the whale transaction tracker Spotonchain shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) stating that Sun’s linked wallet address requested to withdraw 52,905 ETH, worth $209 million, from the staking protocol Lido Finance. Source: Previously Twitter Ethereum (ETH) Technical Analysis and Key Levels According to expert technical analysis, ETH appears to be forming a bearish double-top price action pattern at the strong resistance level of $4,100. In addition to the double-top pattern, ETH’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is falling, indicating a bearish divergence, which further suggests a price decline and increased selling pressure. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price action, there is a strong possibility that ETH could decline by 12% to reach the $3,500 level in the future. Current Price Decline At press time, ETH is trading near the $3,970 level and has experienced a modest price decline of 0.80% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume has soared by 60%, indicating heightened participation from crypto enthusiasts amid the recent price surge.",News|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-17 01:52:50

From the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs early on, we have witnessed a robust bull market further energized by momentum from the U.S. elections. Cryptocurrencies—especially Bitcoin, which benefited from the significant change in macro conditions —are reaching record-breaking valuations and are increasingly influencing the social and political landscape. It has also been a fruitful year for HTX Ventures. Benefiting from the continuous innovation in the industry, this year we have supported 28 leading projects and funds that are exploring new frontiers of crypto utility. These projects span a range of sectors, including DeFi, BTCFi, ZK-rollups, modular infrastructure, Layer 1 & 2 solutions, AI, SocialFi, GameFi, and more. Looking ahead, HTX Ventures has identified five key sectors that showed encouraging progress in 2024 and will be closely monitored in 2025: the Bitcoin ecosystem, infrastructure, Meme, artificial intelligence (“AI”), and the TON ecosystem. This report provides an in-depth examination of the current landscape, challenges, and future opportunities within each sector, complemented by a macroeconomic overview and market projections. Bitcoin Ecosystem Market Dominance LTM Bitcoin dominance has increased from 45.27% to 56.81% . This implies most of the liquidity of the crypto market is currently lying mainly on the Bitcoin ecosystem and increasing. Source: CoinStats Bitcoin spot ETFs now account for 5.3% of the total Bitcoin supply, with holdings rising from 629,900 BTC at the beginning of the year to 1.24 million BTC, an increase of 613,708 BTC. This growth has elevated ETF holdings from 3.15% to 6.25% of the total Bitcoin supply in just twelve months. (data dated as of 4 Dec 2024) A new market trend has emerged – with Bitcoin as the core asset, spot ETFs as liquidity channels, and U.S. listed companies represented by MicroStrategy (MSTR) as the vehicles to absorb unlimited dollar liquidity. As a result, it is increasingly essential to further develop Bitcoin’s ecosystem and enhance capital utilization efficiency, which can also boost BTC’s demand and drive up its price. Layer 2 77 BTC L2s have been launched/ fundraised over the past 3 years. Existing bitcoin L2s from the previous cycles including Lightning, Stacks and Liquid Network had experienced a significant surge in trading volume and token prices in 1H 2024 with the BTC ETF narrative. Further technical development has also been witnessed from these previous cycle L2s. Various L2 solutions on Bitcoin have emerged, including Spiderchain (Botanix), ZKRollup (Nexio and Critea), EVM compatible chains (BOB and B Squared), Sidechains (Merlin), etc. Current TVL on BTC L2 has reached US$3 billion, contributed by 19 BTC L2 projects. Assuming all Bitcoin L2s are launched in the coming years, approximated TVL on all BTC L2s could reach at least 2 to 4 times further, indicating a TVL of US$6 billion to US$12 billion. Layer 1/ Execution Layer BRC-20, Ordinals and Runes were the new major execution standards that emerged in late 2023. BTC L1s activities were on a steady increase despite an overall market downturn in Q2. However, the growth momentum was not able to keep pace in Q3 despite the resurgence of the Bitcoin markets. BTC L1s Landscape in # of Transactions, Source: Cryptokoryo_research Other Bitcoin Infrastructure Other infrastructures including interoperability solutions and security layers emerge with the rise of Bitcoin adoption. Interoperability Bridges and WBTC remain the mainstream of interoperability solutions on Bitcoin. Given that the Bitcoin network does not directly provide composability to build applications directly, people have to rely on these bridges/ WBTC to unlock DeFi yields on other blockchains. HTX Ventures remain bullish on Bitcoin interoperability solutions given the surge in institutions’ growing investment in Bitcoin as an asset class, and anticipate more solutions coming including liquidity bridges Xlink, Atomiq and Auran will launch in the coming year. Security Layers However, these interoperability solutions may pose threats on security over the underlying assets as hacking issues often happen. In light of this, security solutions with Bitcoin arise. Babylon is an example. It developed a set of security-sharing protocols for Bitcoin. This includes (1) Bitcoin timestamp, which allows data to be recorded with a timestamp on the Bitcoin network, thereby enhancing the credibility and immutability of the data, and (2) Bitcoin staking, which allows Bitcoin to provide security for other networks with financial incentives. On top of that, further usage potential with Bitcoin has been unleashed with other new technology, such as Data Availability (“DA”) layers. Nubit is a key player in Bitcoin DA. It enables scaling of Bitcoin’s data capacities, to empower applications, L2s and oracles, secured by Bitcoin. OP_CAT Is the Key to the 2025 Upgrade The Taproot upgrade enables the Bitcoin mainnet to issue assets. From the rise of BRC-20 inscriptions and Ordinals NFTs in 2023 to the introduction of ARC-20, SRC-20, and other asset issuance protocols, as well as the emergence of infrastructure such as Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions, restaking, Liquid Staking Tokens (“LSTs”), and cross-chain bridges, the ecosystem has developed in leaps and bounds. Following the Bitcoin Conference in July 2024, the market shifted its attention to decentralized and unwrapped native BTCFi such as stablecoins. Currently, the Discreet Log Contract (“DLC”) with a cryptographic technique known as adaptor signatures can be utilized to allow Bitcoin scripts to program financial contracts dependent on external events while fully ensuring permissionless clearing for stablecoin and lending projects. Meanwhile, it facilitates permissionless multi-party transactions via Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (“PSBT”). However, this approach is dependent on game theory. In other words, it discourages projects’ malicious actions by significantly increasing their costs for such behavior rather than achieving decentralization at the smart contract level. For example, Shell Finance, a stablecoin project set to launch its mainnet, adopts this strategy. The real game-changer is OP_CAT. Once OP_CAT is enabled, developers will be able to use high-level Bitcoin native programming languages like sCrypt to develop fully decentralized, transparent smart contracts directly on the Bitcoin mainnet. sCrypt is a TypeScript framework for writing smart contracts on Bitcoin. It allows developers to write smart contracts directly in TypeScript, which is one of the most popular high-level programming languages. Bitcoin’s current Layer 2 solutions could also transition to ZK-Rollups, and BTCFi’s total market cap will be limitless. With the support of both macro markets and infrastructure support, we believe Bitcoin will experience a further surge in market demand over the coming 2 years. Infrastructure In 2024, infrastructure remains one of the most compelling sectors in the crypto industry. The synergy between capital and technology has driven the rapid development of Layer 1, Layer 2, and middleware projects, among others. Various factors have contributed to the thriving infrastructure, such as the Ethereum ecosystem’s ongoing upgrades and construction, as well as Layer 2’s improvements in costs and performance; rapid growth of high-performance Layer 1 blockchains led by Solana; the deepening of multi-chain landscape; the enhancement of network security and capital efficiency through restaking mechanisms by projects like EigenLayer; and the attempt by multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 projects to combine Bitcoin’s security with high-performance scaling solutions. Layer 1 Layer 1 projects continue to optimize consensus mechanisms and performance, thus consolidating the foundation for on-chain applications. ● Ethereum : It introduced EIP-4844 and reduced L2 network fees. ● Solana and Tron: On-chain transactions have been active, attributable to the development of meme coins, infrastructure like Pump.fun and Sunpump, and so on. ● Aptos and Sui : GameFi and DeFi applications have spurred growth in active user numbers. Layer 2 Layer 2 remains a critical pathway for scaling, with advancements in both ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups. ● zkSync and StarkNet : Continuous upgrades have significantly improved the user experience for ZK Rollups. ● Base and Arbitrum : DeFi and NFT projects are thriving on these platforms, with substantial growth in TVL. Layer 0 and Cross-Chain Middleware Layer 0 and cross-chain middleware have made breakthroughs in interoperability. ● LayerZero : It connects over 40 chains , with a significant increase in cross-chain transaction volumes. ● Cosmos : The IBC upgrade has boosted cross-chain performance by 50%. Modular Public Blockchains Modular public blockchains offer exceptional performance and flexibility, thus attracting diverse applications. ● Celestia : By supporting multiple modular execution layers, it has established itself as a benchmark for modular public blockchains. ● Monad : Its ultra-high TPS performance has attracted a huge number of developers and DApp deployments. BTC Layer 2 Bitcoin L2 has emerged as a new focus in the primary market in 2024. Several related projects like Babylon, Taro, BounceBit, and Corn completed their funding rounds this year, primarily introducing smart contracts and scaling to the BTC network. ● Taro : It expands BTC’s payment and contract capabilities via the Lightning Network. ● Stacks and RSK : They drive growth in Bitcoin smart contract applications. Restaking Restaking has seen speedy development and gained market attention for its ability to improve capital utilization efficiency. Projects like EigenLayer and Satori secured tens of millions of dollars in investments from leading venture capital firms this year. 2024 Key Funding Rounds in Infrastructure Project Funding Amount Lead Investors Valuation Funding Round EigenLayer US$50m Blockchain Capital, Polychain US$200m Round A LayerZero US$100m a16z, Sequoia Capital US$3bn Round B Celestia US$55m Polychain, Binance Labs – Round A Shardeum US$60m Multicoin Capital – Round A Monad US$30m Dragonfly Capital – Seed Round Fuel Labs US$40m Paradigm – Round A Lightning Labs (Taro) US$30m a16z – Round A Infrastructure is still imperative in this year’s crypto investments and funding. Layer 1 solutions, modular public blockchains, and infrastructure related to the Bitcoin ecosystem have all been favored by investors. Layer 1 now represents the most concentrated areas of technical development and exploration in the crypto space, and it is expected to remain a key sector for development resources and capital investment in the future. Meme An Important Gateway for Retail Investors Under Relaxed Crypto Policies In 2024, the Meme coin sector has once again become a hotspot in the crypto market. As an ecosystem bridgehead , it has not only built community consensus but also integrated with verticals like DeFi and GameFi to create new use cases. For example, Solana has actively championed the innovation and growth of Meme projects, successfully energizing its ecosystem. From Bome and Slerf earlier this year to the emergence of pump.fi mid-year, these projects are much like lottery due to their bonding curve pricing models and low market-cap launch strategies, thus attracting widespread attention. In addition, pump.fi is characterized by a decentralized feature that allows everyone to launch Meme coins, which fosters greater prosperity in the ecosystem. Over half of Solana’s Meme projects now originate from pump.fi, with dozens of these achieving market caps exceeding US$1bn. Public blockchains like SUI and TRON have also quickly adopted meme strategies, further invigorating their ecosystems. Pump.fun Characterized by their accessibility and low entry barriers, Meme projects have become a key tool for attracting new crypto users. The launch of Mootshot allows users to purchase Meme assets with fiat, while the craze of politically-themed Meme coins after the election has created a strong sense of engagement for new players. Looking forward, the potential influence brought about by the crypto policies and related governance trends under the Trump administration may spawn new hotspots related to Meme coins. For instance, if the “Department of Government Efficiency” (abbreviated asDOGE) led by Elon Musk garners attention, it could trigger another surge in Dogecoin. As the crypto market environment becomes increasingly relaxed, more retail investors are expected to enter the market, making Meme projects a key channel for capital inflows. Robinhood’s record of significant price surges following every Meme coin listing clearly highlights this trend, which is likely to drive future development in this sector. Meme Infrastructure With market participants’ growing demand for fair launches, the Meme coin fair launch sector has gained significant market attention and attracted substantial participants this year. Infrastructure projects such as Pump.fun and SunPump have emerged as top-performing cash flow generators, injecting fresh momentum into Meme coin development. Pump.fun Pump.fun is a Solana-based platform for launching Meme projects. By offering simple and intuitive creation tools, robust community support, a fair-launch allocation model, and mechanisms for automated liquidity injection into DEXs, coupled with Solana’s proven market operations, community management, and low transaction costs, Pump.fun gained market recognition upon its debut. It has successfully incubated several high-profile Meme projects. As of November 2024, over 40,000 projects have been launched on Raydium, generating cumulative revenue exceeding 1.17 million SOL, equivalent to approximately US$200m. Meanwhile, Pump.fun’s success has led to imitations by many other projects, inspiring numerous imitators across various chains, with SunPump being the most notable one. Overall, this market-driven meme coin craze owes much to innovation and progress in infrastructure tools. Tools like Pump pioneered automated liquidity injection on launch platforms while pursuing fair, low-cost, and efficient launch methods. These innovations effectively lower launch costs and barriers, boost the market and community confidence, and drive increased participation. As a result, Meme projects have sustained their popularity throughout the year. Pump.fun’s success has not been perfectly replicated on other chains, and the main reasons are as follows: ● Solana’s low transaction costs and high throughput make it one of the ideal platforms for launching meme projects. ● The Solana community has shown exceptional enthusiasm for new projects, which drives rapid growth for emerging Meme projects. ● Other ecosystems such as Ethereum struggle with high gas fees and other issues. Moreover, Meme projects on high-performance chains like BSC and Avalanche demonstrate lackluster performance because they are constrained by smaller community sizes and lower user stickiness. Launch platforms like Pump.fun and SunPump have become essential infrastructure for the development of Meme projects. Meme projects may become more diversified and practical in the future, with infrastructure potentially offering greater product functionalities, incorporating features tailored to specific use cases, such as gaming, NFTs, and social networking. As multi-chain ecosystems mature and real-world use cases expand, meme coin infrastructure will continue injecting more vitality into this sector. AI In 2024, the Crypto x AI sector has been exploring viable directions, giving rise to several segmented fields such as ZK/OPML for enabling AI on-chain, AI data crowdsourcing, decentralized computing power rental, AI data trading, AI games, and AI agents. Crypto Projects Expand Their Focus to Capture AI Narrative A significant number of blockchain infrastructure and applications have expanded their focus to AI this year. Centralization of resources and ownership is one of the key challenges in scaling AI infrastructure in the long term, while traits of decentralization enabled with blockchain networks present a viable solution to solve the centralization issues with AI. One of the major examples of traditional crypto projects moving with AI include Near – it encourages AI to run on open source protocols on the chain since this year. Data Labeling/ Management Data resource constraints have been a major challenge for scaling AI development currently. Majority of useful data for AI model development is monopolized by big tech. Language and cultural coverage inefficiencies have thus become a problem due to the exclusiveness of jurisdiction coverage of these firms. Existing centralized AI data labeling firms are not able to scale the dataset in a comprehensive manner due to the poor financial incentives offered and operational jurisdiction limitation. Blockchain can be a good solution for solving these problems. Multiple projects are going to launch to improve data provenance and incentivize more efficient data labeling tasks across jurisdictions, e.g. Kiva, Sapien, Bagel, etc. Decentralized Inferencing and Machine Learning People mainly use centralized service providers like Hugging Face to run inference of open source models currently, which may pose concerns over privacy or censorship issues. Decentralized inferencing allows people to run machine learning models without relying on centralized service providers while ensuring the model output is trustable. Three major verifiable inferencing verticals have emerged, with different cost and security trade off conditions embedded: Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (“ZKML”) ZKML allows inferencing of AI models with privacy provided by zk-snarks technology. Giza, Modulus Labs and EZKL were the key players in this vertical. These unlocks enhance security and accuracy over the inferencing process on open source models. However, the cost of inferencing will significantly surge due to the cost to generate ZK proof, leading to at least 100x time cost and latency compared to centralized inferencing. As such, current products still need further enhancement on ZK technology to be usable in the future. Optimistic Machine Learning (“OPML”) OPML assumes inference is accurate unless proven wrong by the challenger on the network. Network challengers act as watchers of the on-chain inferences and run on their own models to ensure output accuracy. A primary example of OPML platforms is ORA. Although the cost performance of OPML is lower than ZKML, it is still much more expensive than centralized inferencing due to the watcher cost. On-chain Decentralized Inferencing Network With a decentralized inferencing network, queries are run on-chain with a few nodes. If differences arise, the outstanding one will be slashed. This is the cheapest and fastest solution among the rest but security is not guaranteed as there are possibilities for the nodes to cheat. To ensure further security, more nodes may be considered to be deployed but this will further increase the cost. Ritual is one of the examples of running a decentralized inferencing network. Due to the weak cost efficiency compared to local inferencing, it is not a priority to decentralize AI inferencing for users at the moment. Output verification is rarely a huge concern of AI developers and users under the current AI status quo. Aside from that, edge computing can also be another solution for privacy and security for running AI models. As such, decentralized inferencing may face bottlenecks on growth in the long run. Decentralized GPU GPUs are heavily demanded in AI development while current GPU providers are largely monopolized by a few main players in the market, which may pose a risk of price sensitivity if any extreme market conditions happen. Old decentralized GPU protocol Render has experienced 10x growth in price since 2023. An influx of decentralized GPU networks is launching in the market this year, e.g. IO.net, Grass, Akash, etc. These networks incentivize GPU contribution with tokens, with target audiences of both consumers and smaller GPU companies. However, due to the lack of uniformity of GPU resources on these networks and the fact that most performant GPUs are not owned by the consumers, it is anticipated that centralized GPU providers will still be the mainstream of adoption by AI developers. AI Agent On Chain AI agents were put on chains to take advantage of the token mechanism to incentivise and bootstrap certain behaviors with the agents, including interacting with smart contracts, trading and querying on behalf of users. Myshell is one of the examples. In the future, AI Agents will gradually become personal butlers and assistants for users, serving them with comprehensive capabilities, such as independent asset issuance, initiation of viral marketing campaigns, formation of decentralized autonomous organizations (“DAO”), and even fund management and investment decision-making. Over time, they may develop unique cultures and religions. This deep integration of AI and encryption technology is a groundbreaking evolution that is unattainable within Web2 and cannot be achieved by Web3 relying solely on encryption technology. These innovations have not yet been transformed into products. Recently, in order to address AI agents’ needs for independent financial identities, specifically, the ability to autonomously control wallets, Coinbase has launched AI wallets based on its Coinbase MPC Wallet, allowing AI agents to conduct transactions with these wallets effortlessly. To make AI Wallet more accessible, Coinbase has also released a Based Agent template, which helps users deploy AI wallets with zero coding. More related products are expected to emerge in 2025. Based Agent Breakdown, Source: https://x.com/starzqeth/status/1853597036421259728 On top of that, AI agent networks have also arisen. Theoriq is a key example. It enables efficient multi-agent operation on blockchains with its community-governed AI agent marketplace. This creates an efficient distribution channel for AI agent creators and streamlined processes for AI agent users to perform multiple tasks. TON Ecosystem Attributable to Telegram’s hundreds of millions of users and robust technical support, the The Open Network (“TON”) ecosystem has gradually built a multi-layered blockchain ecosystem. In 2024, it experienced a full-scale boom in both its ecosystem and market. From DeFi and meme coins to NFTs and gaming, TON has made significant accomplishments with its massive user base in various fields, pioneering the monetization of Web2 social applications through crypto. TON data overview, Defillama, https://defillama.com/chain/TON Since traditional business models cannot bring Telegram substantial profits, TON began exploring alternatives like zero-threshold or low-spending “tap-to-earn” games, along with token airdrop incentives. This strategy has successfully drawn in a large number of Web2 users. Notcoin’s Success In May 2024, the first project Notcoin was launched. Notcoin is a social clicker game accessible via Telegram. Players engage with the Notcoin bot, invite friends, and start playing. The game mechanics are straightforward: a golden coin appears on your screen, and each tap earns you Notcoin, the game’s virtual currency. However, users’ ability to tap is limited by an energy bar that depletes with each tap but gradually refills over time. Notcoin quickly gained popularity in the market after it was released. Relying on its simple gameplay and Telegram’s vast user base, it achieved over one million monthly active users in a short time and was listed on major exchanges. Notcoin’s success marks the successful implementation of TON’s ecosystem gaming model and signifies that the gaming sector has entered a new phase of user attraction. Catizen’s Optimization Following Notcoin’s success, Catizen optimized its gameplay by introducing features such as speed boosts, encouraging users to start with small amounts, such as $0.99 or $4.99. Users can also deposit fiat via OTC channels or directly purchase crypto assets with credit cards, significantly lowering entry barriers. This zero-threshold or low-spending model has further expanded the user base. Other Business Models DOGS is one of the most popular meme projects in the TON ecosystem. Thanks to its unique community governance and ecosystem development, DOGS quickly gained a hold in the market. The project enables simple mining operations by verifying users’ Telegram accounts and adopting a referral mechanism. Upon its launch, DOGS attracted significant community attention and traffic and rapidly secured listings on multiple exchanges. Apart from gaming and social projects, DeFi also thrives in the TON ecosystem. Projects like TonStaker and Ston.fi have made strong progress. With star projects such as Notcoin, DOGS, and Catizen, TON has not only solidified its position in social payment but also achieved breakthroughs in multiple sectors like DeFi. However, tap-to-earn games fundamentally operate on a model where Web2 users are initially attracted through token airdrop incentives and sold to exchanges afterward. After the initial hype subsides, traffic declines significantly. Currently, the TON ecosystem urgently needs to find a new business model in 2025 that can improve user retention and identify the next growth curve. It could be DeFi or meme coins but certainly not the models already implemented on Ethereum or Solana. TON’s success has also inspired other Web2 social applications. For instance, Line, targeting markets in Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia, has introduced the Kaia chain, experimenting with the Mini DApp model to monetize its existing Web2 traffic. This shows that TON’s model is influencing the entire industry profoundly. Line Web3 Platform Breakdown, Source: https://govforum.kaia.io/t/gp-4-budget-request-for-kaia-wave/963 Capital Markets Attention In the capital markets, the TON ecosystem has garnered more attention from investors than other high-performance public blockchains. Multiple projects have received investments from the primary market this year. The TON ecosystem will continue advancing user experience, ecosystem diversity, and technological innovation, injecting fresh momentum into the sustained development of the crypto market. While the TON ecosystem has made substantial breakthroughs in 2024, TON must innovate its business model, increase user retention, and identify a new growth curve for the future. This is the only way for TON to maintain its leadership in fierce blockchain competition and deliver constant value to both its users and investors. Macro Summary The theme of the crypto market in 2024 was first dominated by the approval of the Bitcoin ETF in January and more recently by Trump’s presidential election win in November. From a macroeconomic perspective, the market is currently transitioning from quantitative tightening (“QT”) to quantitative easing (“QE”), with QE expected to begin in the second quarter of next year. Historically, the peak of crypto bull markets rarely occurs during rate-cut cycles. Instead, it usually happens at the end of rate-cut cycles, or just as a rate-hike cycle nears its end or even just begins. For example, the extreme easing policies triggered by the 2020 pandemic started a crypto bull run, which reached its peak at the end of 2021 as the Federal Reserve signaled a gradual shift toward tightening policies. Later, rate hikes officially began in 2022. Therefore, in our opinion, the crypto market has yet to reach its bull market peak. On the whole, this cycle may unfold in various ways. In particular, against the backdrop of Trump’s fiscal expansion policies and unprecedented crypto-friendly signals, a robust bull market is expected. Moreover, with regulatory easing and the entry of traditional financial institutions, Bitcoin will gain stronger support and gradually become a core dollar-denominated asset, aside from those tied to the dollar industry cycles (such as AI). The trend of decoupling between Bitcoin and the traditional altcoin market is expected to intensify. On the one hand, the benchmark interest rate is expected to decline to neutral levels by mid-2025. Whether there would be further rate cuts or tightening will largely depend on inflation levels at the time, as well as Trump’s ability to influence the Federal Reserve. If the Fed signals tightening measures to address inflation, the market may enter an adjustment phase that may last until May 2026, when Trump could have the chance to assert control over Fed policies. The Influx of Traditional Financial Giants and Retail Crypto Investors in 2025 Will Spawn New Sectors The Repeal of SAB 121 Will Clear Hurdles for the Entry of Traditional Financial Institutions Trump is expected to repeal SAB 121 after his inauguration on 20 January 2025. This move will allow traditional financial institutions to hold cryptos on their balance sheets, further accelerating the institutionalization of crypto assets. The repeal will not only provide more financing options for crypto assets but also make spot cryptos more accessible through existing institutional exchanges and partnerships. At the same time, it will significantly enhance the maturity of the overall institutional crypto market. Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (“SAB 121”) is a guideline issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in 2022. This regulation requires banks, exchanges, and other financial institutions holding or providing custodial services for crypto assets to treat these assets as liabilities and disclose them accordingly on their balance sheets. Even if these institutions are merely holding clients’ crypto assets in custody, they must assume potential responsibilities. This rule requires financial institutions to make two adjustments: On the one hand, they must disclose detailed information regarding potential risks associated with crypto assets, including market volatility, hacking, and technical failures. On the other hand, they must account for crypto assets as liabilities rather than client assets in their custody. This may increase the total liabilities on the balance sheets of banks and financial institutions, which in turn impacts their capital adequacy ratios. Due to these restrictions, SAB 121 has directly hindered traditional financial institutions in the U.S., especially national banks like Citibank and JPMorgan Chase, from offering crypto custody services. It has also limited crypto firms’ access to banking services. However, as regulatory agencies clarify their stance and policies ease, traditional financial service companies and investors will be able to operate on blockchain platforms for the first time, which will bring them new earnings and strategic possibilities. Coingecko , (data dated as of 8 Dec 2024) PayFi: Fiat’s Direct Involvement in Crypto Operations Will Unlock Infinite Potential ● With traditional financial institutions now allowed to legally invest in, hold, and provide custodial services for crypto assets, sectors such as PayFi, compliant stablecoins, and compliant fiat on-ramps are set to rise. Recently, Tether announced the launch of a new real-world asset (“RWA”) platform that focuses on tokenizing real-world financial assets (such as government bonds, real estate, and other fixed-income assets) to provide digitized investment options. ● Moonshot has created brand-new use cases by integrating fiat on-ramps with meme coin trading. In the future, more projects are likely to emerge by connecting fiat channels and by integrating real-world assets and high-frequency crypto gameplay (such as GameFi and DeFi).

A prominent analyst forecasts Ripple (XRP) hitting $10, Dogecoin reaching $5, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) climbing to $0.09.

These bids range from 500 XRP ($1237) to as much as 836 XRP ($2068) as of Asian morning hours on Tuesday, CoinDesk viewed on the Xaman application. Each XRP exchanges hands for just under $2.5, data shows . “There actually is someone willing to pay $1,200/RLUSD for a tiny fraction of one RLUSD.,” Ripple Labs CTO David Schwartz said in a Monday post . “Tools will show you the highest price anyone is willing to pay, even if it's just for a tiny bit. Maybe someone wants the ""honor"" of buying the first bit of RLUSD on the DEX.” “But rest assured, the price will come back to very close to $1 as soon as supply stabilizes. If it doesn't, something is very seriously wrong,” Schwartz added. Speculators often engage in high-priced transactions for small quantities of a new token or NFT to gain early access or to capitalize on the novelty of holding the first batch. As such, RLUSD might not have enough liquidity to maintain its peg effectively in the first few hours after it goes live, meaning there may be some price discrepancies from the intended $1 peg. However, each token will be redeemed for only a dollar, and it is unlikely to remain depegged for an extended period. RLUSD will go live on the XRP Ledger (XRP) on Tuesday, as CoinDesk reported , with initial listings on several exchanges and crypto platforms, including Uphold, MoonPay, Archax, and CoinMENA.",Markets,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|WALLET|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-17 02:10:00

Analysts are saying that XRP is currently in the later stages of a cycle wave three on the daily chart and this wave may still extend a bit higher, potentially reaching new all-time highs. While we haven’t yet seen a clear end to wave three, there’s a possibility it could continue moving upward before we see a correction in wave four. A possible target for the final move of this cycle could be between $5 and $9.81. At the time of writing, XRP is trading below $2.50 level and is up by more than two percent in the last 24 hours. Key Price Levels and Support Zones At present, XRP is trading between the 2021 high and the all-time high. This zone is critical for understanding potential price action. If XRP continues to hold above this range, there’s a good chance XRP could break through the all-time high, though it’s not guaranteed. Micro Patterns and Short-Term Movement Looking at the microstructure , there was a three-wave move down from the swing high formed on December 3rd, followed by a three-wave move up (wave B). Subsequently, a corrective wave C formed to the downside, bringing XRP to retest the 2021 high, which held as support. This suggests that short-term price action remains bullish. The breakout from the corrective price channel is a positive sign, though XRP has yet to move away from it in an impulsive fashion. The first target following this breakout is typically the starting point of the channel, which is around the $2.90 level. This target aligns with the typical length of wave C, which often matches that of wave A. Watch Out for Potential Pullbacks If the price breaks below the $2.33 level, followed by a drop below $2.28, the price could see a test of lower support regions between $2 and $2.23. From there, XRP might attempt another rally.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-17 02:23:09

Key Metric Reveals When to Cash In Profits,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-next-big-move-key-metric-reveals-when-to-cash-in-profits/,"Bitcoin recent price momentum which led to a renewal of its all-time high (ATH) appears to have reignited interest in key metrics used to time market entries and exits. Among these, the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) reversion metric has been highlighted by a CryptoQuant analyst known as Darkfost, who shared insights on its current implications for Bitcoin investors. The metric, a measure of Bitcoin’s price deviations from its expected value based on the S2F model, has become an important tool for many traders assessing market sentiment and identifying potential profit-taking windows. Related Reading: Bitcoin Confidence Grows As Binance Data Highlights Surprising Market Trends When Should Cash In Your Bitcoin Profits? Darkfost’s analysis points to September 11 as a significant date, when the S2F reversion metric dropped below 1, signaling a potential buy opportunity as Bitcoin traded at $57,000. Now, the analyst emphasizes a different critical threshold—a value above 2.5—historically indicating a favorable time to secure moderate profits. Should the metric reach a value above 3, it often signals market overheating, marking an opportune moment for larger profit-taking strategies. The S2F reversion metric offers a structured approach to assessing Bitcoin’s price cycles. Darkfost suggests a two-step profit strategy: investors should consider securing smaller gains when the metric hits 2.5 and proceed to larger profit-taking if it surpasses 3. Darfost particularly wrote: A prudent strategy when using this indicator is to take moderate profits once the S2F reversion ratio hits 2.5 and to secure larger profits when the ratio exceeds 3, thereby balancing risk and reward effectively. BTC Market Performance Regardless of the suggested indicator by Darkfost on when to take profit, Bitcoin appears not to be slowing down in its upward momentum. So far, BTC has created a new ATH after trading as high as $106,352 in the early hours of Monday. Although at the time of writing, the asset has seen a slight rebound currently trading at a a price of $105,942, however, BTC is still up by over 3% in the past day more than 10% in the past two weeks. Unsurprisingly, along with the rising price, BTC’s market capitalization has also seen a significant surge in its valuation now sitting at roughly over $2 trillion as of today. Meanwhile, despite this positive momentum, BTC’s daily trading volume has seen quite an opposite trend. Related Reading: National Bitcoin Reserve Initiative: MP Satoshi Hamada Urges Japan To Take Action Particularly, this metric instead of seeing a rise amid the new ATH of BTC, has remain stable and lower than last week’s daily trading volume. At the time of writing, BTC’s trading volume sits at $97.4 billion, a significant decline from the over $140 billion volume valuation seen last week on December 10.

33767162,[object Object],1734404405,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Crypto Public Offers Under Scrutiny As UK FCA Proposes Ban – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-public-offers-under-scrutiny-as-uk-fca-proposes-ban-details/,"The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has released a discussion paper outlining several proposals and inviting public feedback on crypto regulations in the country. Notably, one proposal seeks to ban public crypto offers from non-regulated entities. Cryptocurrency Public Offers Draw The FCA’s Attention According to the FCA, the proposals – detailed in the discussion paper titled “DP24/4” – aim to mitigate risks associated with digital assets while fostering growth and innovation within the sector. The paper is directed toward investors, crypto firms, industry groups, and other professional bodies involved in the virtual assets space. One proposal garnering significant attention is a potential ban on public virtual assets offers. The UK government’s economic and finance ministry, HM Treasury, is pushing to outlaw most public crypto fundraising, with exceptions likely made for entities already operating in the UK or those qualifying under specific exemptions. The FCA’s move aligns with broader efforts by regulators worldwide to tighten controls on unregulated offerings, which have often been associated with scams, investor losses, and market manipulation. Draft legislation is expected to formalize the ban, signaling a notable regulatory shift. This development follows the FCA’s recent crackdown on Solana-based platform Pump.fun, which was barred from operating in the UK due to its failure to secure the necessary permit. Beyond the proposed public offer ban, the FCA has also suggested that authorized digital assets trading platforms share market abuse data to identify and address suspicious activities. This initiative seeks to enhance transparency and improve user safety in the crypto sector. The discussion paper further invites feedback on market admission, disclosure practices, and measures to tackle market abuse. The FCA has set a deadline of March 14, 2025, for stakeholders to submit their comments and input. Other European countries have also called for global cooperation when it comes to regulating digital assets. For instance, countries like Denmark , Italy , and the Netherlands are mulling implementing tax monitoring rules to better align with European Union (EU) tax standards. UK’s Digital Assets Stance: A Regulatory Overreach Or Necessity? This paper is part of a broader effort to define the UK’s crypto regulatory regime, with additional papers expected to follow. Notably, draft legislation is anticipated next year, with the full regulatory framework slated for implementation by 2026. The timing of the discussion paper coincides with mounting concerns over low regulatory compliance among digital assets companies. A recent report revealed that nearly 90% of digital assets entities in the UK fail to meet anti-money laundering (AML) standards. Regulators worry that lax compliance could expose the financial system to illicit activities, including fraud and money laundering. In October, the FCA was urged to investigate short-form video hosting platform TikTok over allegations of illegally operating as a cryptocurrency trading platform. These incidents underscore the watchdog’s increasing vigilance in safeguarding financial markets. Despite regulatory challenges, virtual assets adoption in the UK remains strong. According to an FCA report , approximately 7 million UK adults currently hold digital assets. While the FCA’s push for tighter regulations is aimed at protecting market participants, it faces the challenge of avoiding excessive measures that might drive digital assets businesses to relocate to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions. For instance, the US has seen renewed optimism following the election victory of pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump. At press time, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $105,998, up 3.1% in the past 24 hours.",Crypto regulation|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto Regulations|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|FCA|financial conduct authority|UK,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-17 03:00:05

Monica Long, President of Ripple, took to her social media handle on Monday and said that this new stablecoin is an important step for both the XRP Ledger and Ripple, which handles over $70 billion in payments. RLUSD combines Ripple’s 10 plus years of experience with strong compliance standards and support from a trusted advisory board. The company had received final approval for RLUSD from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), under the regulator’s limited-purpose trust company charter, as of last week. RLUSD will launch on platforms like Uphold, MoonPay, CoinMENA, Archax, and Bitso, with more exchanges like Bullish, Mercado Bitcoin, Zero Hash, Independent Reserve, and Bitstamp joining soon. An enterprise-grade stablecoin for everyone. Ripple USD ($RLUSD) drops tomorrow on @UpholdInc , @MoonPay , @CoinMENA , @ArchaxEx and @Bitso , with @bullish , @mercadobitcoin , @ZeroHashX , @indepreserve , and @Bitstamp soon to follow. https://t.co/k3DrWO4PXA — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 16, 2024 When Will RLUSD Launch? RLUSD will be available on global exchanges starting today, December 17, 2024. While the launch date is confirmed, the exact time has not been disclosed. While social media posts on X suggest the launch will happen at 8:00 AM EST, allowing users to get in before the typical 9-5 workday begins, this information is purely speculative and has not been officially confirmed. As such, it should be treated with caution until Ripple provides official details. XRP Price Jumps: The market reacted positively to the news, with XRP seeing a boost in value. Although some traders are taking profits, the excitement is building, and XRP’s price could continue to rise as more trust in Ripple grows. XRP has been experiencing a strong price surge due to a major announcement from Ripple. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like BNB and ETH are performing well, XRP’s movement is directly tied to Ripple’s stablecoin news. As Ripple gains more trust, XRP’s value is expected to climb, benefiting from the positive sentiment in the crypto market.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-17 03:00:53

If you’ve been keeping tabs, you’d know there’s no shortage of drama or opportunity in this space. Peanut the Squirrel’s owner is locked in a legal battle with Binance over alleged trademark infringement, sending ripples across the crypto world. Meanwhile, Popcat’s price might just have found its bottom, with analysts predicting a bullish reversal. On the flip side, BTFD Coin is riding a tidal wave of excitement, smashing through the $4 million mark in its presale. With these developments, this week might just be the perfect time to jump into the meme coin frenzy. Meme coins have always had their finger on the pulse of crypto hype, riding cultural waves like no other asset class. From Dogecoin’s meteoric rise to Shiba Inu’s unexpected success, these quirky coins have proven their staying power. Now, with BTFD Coin’s innovative play-to-earn game and staking rewards , it’s bringing something fresh to the table. It’s more than just a meme; it’s a movement powered by a strong community of holders. So, if you’re looking for the best meme coins to join this week , let’s break down what makes BTFD Coin, Peanut the Squirrel, and Popcat worthy of your attention and possibly your wallet. BTFD Coin: The Next Big Thing in Meme Coins BTFD Coin is turning heads for all the right reasons. The presale has already raised over $4 million and sold more than 55 billion tokens to 5,600+ holders. Starting at just $0.000004 per coin, BTFD is now in its 12th stage, with the price hitting $0.00013. At this pace, it’s set to close out its presale at $0.0006 per token. What sets BTFD apart isn’t just its meteoric presale performance but its long-term vision. The coin features a play-to-earn (P2E) game that’s set to make waves, offering players a chance to earn rewards while having fun. Add staking options into the mix, and you’ve got a token with tangible utility beyond just its meme appeal. Let’s do some quick math. If you invested $15,000 at the current price of $0.00013 per coin, you’d snag roughly 115,384,615 BTFD tokens. Once the presale ends and the price hits $0.0006, your investment would balloon to a jaw-dropping $69,230. That’s a tidy 361% profit before BTFD even hits its first exchange listing. With four stages left in the presale, and analysts predicting a surge in demand as the end draws closer, this is one train you don’t want to miss. BTFD isn’t just a meme; it’s a movement. Peanut the Squirrel: Fighting for a Cause On the other side of the meme coin spectrum, Peanut the Squirrel is grabbing headlines for a very different reason. Mark Longo, the owner of the late social media sensation, is taking Binance to court over alleged trademark infringement. Longo claims the exchange used the “PNUT” trademark and Peanut’s likeness without permission, issuing a cease-and-desist letter demanding Binance halt these activities. Despite the legal battle, PNUT’s price has remained relatively stable at $1.11. For a token that achieved a $1 billion market cap in just 11 days after its launch, stability is a testament to its strong community and cultural resonance. Peanut’s story is as much about justice as it is about value. The token has become a symbol of intellectual property rights in the fast-evolving crypto space, and this narrative is likely to keep it in the spotlight. If the lawsuit resolves in Longo’s favour—or even if it just garners more media attention—PNUT could see a surge in value. Meme coins thrive on attention, and PNUT has plenty of it right now. Popcat: The Rebound Everyone’s Waiting For Popcat is the OG of cat-themed meme coins, and it’s not about to let that title go. Inspired by Oatmeal, the viral cat meme from 2020, Popcat has already delivered over 10,000% gains since its launch at $0.01. After peaking at $2.07, the token has entered a mini-bear phase, dropping to $1.21. But according to renowned trader Cold Blooded Shiller, Popcat might just be gearing up for a comeback. Shiller points out that Popcat’s trading range has been tightening, with repeated dips into the high-demand zone around $1.20. This kind of pressure often precedes a breakout. With cat memes gaining traction and favourable market conditions, analysts predict Popcat could claw its way back to its all-time high and beyond, with $3 as the next big target. If you’re a fan of the meme coin market’s quirky charm, Popcat is one to watch. It’s got the pedigree, the community, and the potential for another moonshot. The Concluding Remark The meme coin market is hotter than ever, and this week’s lineup is nothing short of stellar. BTFD Coin is smashing presale records, giving investors a chance to ride the wave of its innovative game and staking features. Peanut the Squirrel offers a unique story of justice and cultural impact, while Popcat is primed for a breakout, backed by a loyal fan base and solid fundamentals. Whether you’re looking for the best meme coins to join this week or simply seeking the next big opportunity in crypto, this is your moment. Don’t let it pass you by. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your slice of the future at $0.00013 before it’s too late. With over $4 million already raised and a community that’s growing by the day, this might just be the best investment you make all year.

A Wells Notice is typically issued when the SEC believes a company has violated securities laws, signaling potential enforcement action. The team behind CyberKongz expressed their disappointment with the SEC’s approach, claiming that the regulator has shown a lack of understanding of blockchain technology. They argue that this has led to inaccurate accusations and confusion about their project. CyberKongz has been in contact with the SEC for over two years, with the most recent issue surrounding the combination of an ERC-20 token and a blockchain game. CyberKongz has pledged to fight this stance, not just for their own project, but for the broader NFT and blockchain gaming community. “We have been suffering in silence for the last two years, ever since we first received contact from the SEC,” they said.

The CyberKongz team explains that this was actually a contract migration, not a sale. They argue that if the SEC cannot distinguish between a primary sale and a contract migration, it raises concerns about the clarity of regulatory guidelines for digital assets moving forward. The CyberKongz team also expressed concern that the current administration may be pushing an anti-crypto agenda. However, they are positive that the new administration will bring more fairness to the regulatory landscape. In their statement, CyberKongz also expressed solidarity with other leaders in the space, such as Brian Armstrong, Devin Finzer, and Hayden Adams, who are also fighting for clearer regulations. “For the CyberKongz community, this is the start of a new beginning.

Several custodial services have also been offering more crypto investment products, with the most notable being this year’s approval for Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs. Recent CryptoQuant data has also indicated an increase in ETF holdings. Wall Street asset management companies have further been exploring more crypto options. Grayscale, MicroStrategy, and BlackRock are now some of the top global BTC holders. MicroStrategy’s latest moves to increase its BTC holdings have significantly triggered a more bullish outlook for crypto. A Bitcoin Suisse prediction for crypto for 2025 confirmed that more companies and governments may be set to adopt more crypto utilities and monetary policies in the coming year. Bitcoin Suisse explained that the conditions would fuel BTC and other cryptocurrencies. The prediction further suggested that the long-awaited alt-season will become full-blown in the first quarter of 2025.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has faced skepticism throughout this cycle, with some analysts predicting it would underperform compared to its previous bull runs. However, Ethereum has surprised doubters, steadily climbing in recent weeks despite market uncertainty. Related Reading: ONDO Exchange Inflows Grow – Volatility Ahead? Key on-chain metrics from Glassnode reveal an important trend that could fuel further price gains: Ethereum whales have been accumulating aggressively since late November. This signals growing confidence among major holders, who are positioning themselves for potential upside. Historically, whale accumulation has often preceded significant price moves, hinting at the possibility of a breakout in the near term. While the market remains divided on Ethereum’s trajectory, its ability to sustain upward momentum near the $4,000 mark will likely define its performance in the weeks ahead. Breaking above this critical resistance could open the door to new highs and further solidify ETH’s role as a leader in the ongoing bull cycle. Ethereum Mega-Whale Balances Grow Ethereum has experienced a steady, albeit modest, rally since November 5, but it seems the real fireworks for ETH are yet to ignite. As Bitcoin soars into price discovery and several altcoins outperform expectations, Ethereum investors are searching for clear signals of an impending bull run for the second-largest cryptocurrency. Key on-chain data shared by top analyst Ali Martinez on X provides intriguing insights into Ethereum’s current state. Martinez highlights that Ethereum whales—entities holding significant amounts of ETH—have been accumulating aggressively since the price broke above the $3,330 level. This accumulation trend suggests that smart money is positioning itself for what could be a massive upward move in the months ahead. Historically, whale accumulation has often been a precursor to strong price rallies, as these large investors tend to anticipate major market shifts before retail traders. However, the narrative isn’t entirely bullish. While whale accumulation may signal confidence, it also raises concerns about a potential bull trap. These large holders could quickly pivot, offloading their ETH for other assets if market conditions shift or if Bitcoin’s dominance suppresses altcoin growth. Such a move could catch smaller investors off guard, leading to sharp corrections.

Until then, ETH remains a watchlist favorite, balancing potential and uncertainty. Price Testing Crucial Resistance Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $3,950, struggling to break above the crucial $4,000 resistance level for several days. Despite this, the price remains resilient, signaling strong market support. Clearing this level is essential to confirm the continuation of the uptrend, as $4,000 represents a psychological barrier and a key resistance zone for the asset. If Ethereum fails to breach the $4,000 mark, a retrace toward lower demand zones around $3,500 could be expected. This level has served as strong support in recent weeks, providing a cushion during periods of increased selling pressure. A pullback to this area could allow for renewed buying momentum, setting the stage for another attempt to break higher.

However, it located support and quickly recovered as the price broke to a new high. It appears bullish but the price is stalled. Like many altcoins, Link witnessed significant growth in the past month as it surged through several key resistances to mark a new multi-high at $30.94 on Friday. However, the bears have defended that high well and the crypto is now stalled with choppy price actions. The intraday trading remains bullish but the asset may lose momentum soon considering the latest rejection. As seen on the daily chart, there’s little-to-no movement in the market. A weekly close under the $28 level could facilitate another drop as witnessed earlier this week. Towards the upside, Link must break higher before considering more rallies, although maintaining a bullish on the daily chart. If that comes into play, the $40 range would be the next buying target level for the bulls. Nevertheless, the overall market appears strong on a daily scale. As of now, there are no signs of bears in the market. If they return, the price must fall below last month’s low before considering a reversal. But from the look of things, more positive actions are likely to occur. LINK’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview While deciding where next to head, a break above the weekly $31 high should propel buying to $33, followed by $35. Higher resistance levels to consider on the way up are $40 and $45. A pullback from the current trading level could bring a retest at $27. Below it lies the $23.8 support. If the price drops, the next level to watch for support is $19.5.

However, it has been facing hurdles for some days now due to low demand. Breaking up should drive more gains in the future. The last two weeks of trading have been a tough moment for the bulls as they find it difficult to sustain momentum above the monthly rejected $1.3 level. Although they are still gaining control in the mid-term but their commitment seems not strong enough to drive the price higher. This low commitment has brought a notable reduction in the last 24 hours, and as seen on the daily chart, ADA is now trading at around $1 after rejecting $1.2 on Thursday. Just like what we saw this week, the latest rejection could lead to another decrease in the upcoming week. Considering yesterday’s strong bearish close, which suggests a potential sell, the asset may drop into the $0.8 range. Locating support in the price range could trigger a bounce back. If not, we may see more drops until it finds a threshold. On the daily chart, the volume indicator has been on the fall since the price entered $0.7 in mid-November. A rise in this volume should bring buying pressure back into the market. Having said that, it is important to note that ADA is currently under correction. ADA’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview Losing grip above $1, it may navigate the $0.9 and $0.875 levels for support. A breakdown from there could plunge the price to $0.765 and $0.69. Lower supports for a broader correction are $0.6 and $0.522. If ADA climbs back above $1.154 along with the rejected monthly $1.32 high, the next buy target for the bulls would be $1.5, $1.7 and $2 in no time.

In an appearance on the Coin Stories podcast, Matthew Sigel said Bitcoin ( BTC ) could go as high as $180K in 2025, pointing to crucial indicators like funding rates, unrealized profits, and retail speculation as the basis for this prediction. Sigel, in conversation with the host Natalie Brunel , says VanEck has been “ bullish on Bitcoin since 2017 ”. However, he believes corporate adoption of Bitcoin still has a long road ahead. Traditional asset managers, many of which, like Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, are owned by banks and brokers, have been slow to adopt BTC into their financial strategy, he said. Their tightly regulated structure and reliance on traditional asset allocation models, such as the 60-40 portfolio, have yet to adjust to accommodate BTC ETFs .

Institutional asset managers, he added, have not yet significantly entered the space.

Sigel shared that macro trends such as inflation hedges and BTC being adopted as digital gold are fueling this bullish sentiment. According to Sigel, BTC safeguards against actions like government currency devaluation and asset confiscations, a must-have for individuals living in countries with double-digit inflation. As one of the most active establishments when it comes to launching crypto products such as BTC ETFs, VanEck continues to be a major player in the digital asset space. VanEck’s research, which influences sentiments among institutional investors pursuing bitcoin exposure, echoes Sigel’s projection.

It is footing another leg up while the fear and greed index stands at 80 due to overbought. Bitcoin’s daily structure remains highly bullish in the long term due to a consistent surge in the past month. The crypto pushed higher yesterday and comfortably entered the $106,000 range, closing last week bullish. Prior to the latest break up, the primary crypto flash crashed to a low of $90,500 earlier this month following a sudden rejection at $104,000. The price recovered and traded at around $100k throughout last week. Despite the low volatility movement in the past weeks, the trend is still considered bullish on the daily chart. Though it appears to be gathering momentum for another leg up. The breakout could set the market up for a huge price movement if the demand level increases significantly. In case of a drop, BTC must break below the current monthly low before considering a broader retracement. Currently, the trend is still in favour of the bulls, and as a result, more surges are expected in the future. BTC’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview If Bitcoin pushes above the newly marked all-time high of $106,648, the next key level for an increase would be $110,000, followed by $115,000. For now, the psychological $100,000 level is considered as support. A drop below it could roll the price back to the $94,150 support – last week’s low. Below this support lies the monthly $90,500 low. Lower supports for broader retracement are $85,072, $81,500 and $77,200. Key Resistance Levels: $106,648, $110,000, $115,000 Key Support Levels: $100,000, $94,150, $90,500 Spot Price: $104,592 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Could Cardano (ADA) and IntelMarkets (INTL) be the actual stars of 2025 since Ethereum (ETH) seems to have been witnessing strong bearish pressure lately? Read on to find out why despite Ethereum’s (ETH) future seeming bright, Cardano (ADA) and IntelMarkets might outperform it next year. IntelMarkets (INTL) Offers Cutting-Edge Crypto Tools and Security IntelMarkets is a safe haven for strategic hedging, therefore controlling market volatility, in addition to being a strong platform for speculative trading. Using perpetual futures contracts, traders can guard their portfolios against losses by opening positions that balance possible drops in their holdings, therefore countering price downturns. By shorting BTC futures, for example, a Bitcoin (BTC) holder can protect their portfolio against a market collapse. Supported by over $500,000 in development grants, IntelMarkets will be further enhanced by the forthcoming Rodeum blockchain infrastructure, which powers decentralized apps and supports the INTL ecosystem. IntelMarkets guarantees traders may optimize profitability while avoiding risk in the fast-moving crypto market utilizing automated trading robots and sophisticated risk management tools. As IntelMarkets keeps innovating, it’s introducing a quantum-proof crypto custody solution with the Quantum X Wallet, providing industry-leading security for hassle-free asset management. From big cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to developing altcoins and niche tokens, IntelMarkets provides a wide spectrum of asset pairs that let traders vary their strategies and maximize success. Now is an opportunity to accumulate one of the top crypto coins positioned for exponential gains as the INTL utility token is now on sale at just $0.073273 in its eighth presale stage. A Bullish Rebound on the Horizon for Ethereum (ETH) With the Ethereum price rising from $3,700 to almost $4,100 before declining down to the $3,700 zone as bearish pressure set in, also it has seen noteworthy volatility over the past week. The Ethereum price has shown resilience by keeping support higher than the $3,840 level despite these swings. Maintaining an overall optimistic trend on the annual Ethereum price chart, the price structure of the altcoin shows higher highs and higher lows. Ethereum (ETH) is among the top altcoins to keep an eye on for possible significant recoveries as the recent pullbacks could be temporary and the altcoin is probably going to resume a significant bullish trend. Though Ethereum’s (ETH) all-time high (ATH) of $4,891 was achieved in 2021, experts remain hopeful that the altcoin could hit this mark before the year ends. Buy signals from the MACD and Moving Averages on the Ethereum price chart together with positive sentiment help to strengthen the belief that is headed for more price appreciation. Among the top crypto coins that are yet to hit a new ATH this year, Ethereum’s (ETH) continuous consolidation and strong technical signals point to a breakout to new highs perhaps approaching. Cardano (ADA) Eyes a Strong Comeback After failing to keep its position above the $1.25 to $1.12 level, the Cardano price has seen some notable volatility over the previous week. As a result, the Cardano price dropped more than 6%. Although Cardano (ADA) dropped below the crucial $1 barrier, it gained support at the $0.92 level where positive momentum swiftly recovered. With this price action, the Cardano price chart shows that the altcoin has entered a phase of consolidation around the $1 mark; inventors are closely watching its subsequent activity. Cardano (ADA) has had a good month despite recent losses; its price rose noticeably, reaching $1.30 before running across opposition. Though Cardano’s (ADA) long-term prospects remain bright despite recent declines, analysts think that the upward momentum of the altcoin will shortly start again, pushing the price above the $1.30 resistance level and straight back toward its all-time high (ATH) of $3.10. Cardano (ADA) is still regarded as one of the top altcoins to hold given buy signals from important technical indicators including the MACD and Moving Averages on the Cardano price chart. IntelMarkets (INTL) Set to Outperform Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) IntelMarkets (INTL) is taking the most space in investors’ portfolios while Ethereum (ETH) is attracting institutional interest and Cardano (ADA) is battling with consolidation. It is positioned to lead the 2025 rally with modern trading tools, unparalleled security, and an innovative platform that makes profit generation easier for traders.

These innovative platforms combine blockchain technology and traditional casino entertainment to offer a unique, secure, and efficient gaming experience. Cryptocurrency casinos leverage digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin to redefine online gaming. By integrating blockchain technology, these platforms ensure enhanced security, transparency, and faster transactions compared to traditional online casinos. Players worldwide are drawn to the benefits offered by a modern crypto casino experience. What Are Cryptocurrency Casinos? Cryptocurrency casinos begin with a simple registration process, where players create an account with minimal personal information. This streamlined process ensures privacy while enabling quick access to the platform. Once registered, players link their digital wallets, allowing seamless transactions directly between their wallets and the casino. Deposits and withdrawals are carried out using cryptocurrency, offering unmatched speed and efficiency. Players send crypto from their wallets to the casino’s address for deposits, and winnings are sent back in the same manner, eliminating the delays often associated with traditional banking systems. A standout feature of crypto casinos is the use of blockchain technology to ensure provably fair gaming. This system allows players to verify the fairness of game outcomes by reviewing blockchain-based algorithms, adding a layer of trust and transparency that is often missing in traditional casinos. Finally, cryptocurrency casinos operate on decentralized networks, bypassing intermediaries like banks. This not only reduces transaction fees but also ensures global accessibility, allowing players from various regions to participate without currency conversion issues or geographical restrictions. Advantages of Cryptocurrency Casinos Enhanced Security Cryptocurrency transactions use advanced encryption and blockchain technology, making them highly secure. Unlike traditional payment methods, which are prone to fraud and hacking, crypto casinos provide a tamper-proof ledger for all transactions. Greater Anonymity Cryptocurrency casinos prioritize player privacy. Transactions are linked to wallet addresses instead of personal information, allowing players to gamble without disclosing sensitive details. This is especially beneficial for those who value their online anonymity. Faster Transactions Deposits and withdrawals in crypto casinos are processed almost instantly. Traditional banking systems often take days to process payments, whereas blockchain technology ensures swift and seamless transactions. Lower Fees Since transactions occur directly between players and casinos without intermediaries, fees are significantly lower. This allows players to enjoy more of their winnings without deductions for banking or payment processing. Global Accessibility Cryptocurrencies are decentralized and not bound by geographic restrictions. Players from around the world can participate in crypto casinos without worrying about currency conversions or regional banking limitations. Provably Fair Gaming Crypto casinos often integrate provably fair systems, enabling players to verify game outcomes using blockchain data. This builds trust and ensures transparency, which is not always guaranteed in traditional casinos. Popular Games at Cryptocurrency Casinos Cryptocurrency casinos offer a diverse range of games to cater to various preferences, including: Slots : From classic three-reel slots to advanced 3D video slots, there’s something for every player. Table Games : Enjoy classics like blackjack, roulette, and poker. Provably Fair Games : Unique games designed specifically for crypto casinos, ensuring transparency. Live Dealer Games : Real-time gaming experiences with professional dealers. Choosing the Right Crypto Casino When selecting a cryptocurrency casino, reputation should be your top consideration. Opt for platforms, which have positive reviews and a strong track record. Reliable platforms often feature advanced security measures, transparent gaming practices, and excellent customer support to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience. The variety of games available is another crucial factor. A good crypto casino will offer a broad selection, including slots, table games, and live dealer options, to cater to diverse player preferences. Check whether your favorite games are available before committing to a platform. Bonuses and promotions tailored for crypto users add extra value to your gaming experience. Look for casinos that offer generous welcome bonuses, cashback deals, and ongoing promotions. These incentives not only enhance your bankroll but also make your time on the platform more rewarding. Finally, prioritize platforms with robust customer support. Whether through live chat, email, or a comprehensive FAQ section, reliable support can address issues quickly, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free gaming experience. Platforms like Rakebit excel in providing round-the-clock assistance to their players. Final Thoughts Cryptocurrency casinos are revolutionizing the online gambling industry by providing enhanced security, anonymity, and efficiency. Whether you’re new to crypto gambling or a seasoned player, exploring these platforms opens up exciting possibilities in the world of online gaming.

Recently, HTX Ventures released its 2024 Year In Review , highlighting this year’s key developments in the crypto industry and forecasting market trends for the upcoming year. Within this report, HTX Ventures highlighted five key sectors that showed encouraging progress in 2024 – the Bitcoin Ecosystem, Infrastructure, Meme Coins, AI, and the TON Ecosystem – and will continue to closely monitor these areas in 2025. Bitcoin Ecosystem With Bitcoin dominance reaching 56.81% and Bitcoin spot ETFs now accounting for 5.3% of the total Bitcoin supply, a new market trend has emerged. Bitcoin has solidified its position as the core asset, with spot ETFs acting as liquidity channels, and U.S. listed companies such as MicroStrategy (MSTR) serving as the vehicles to absorb unlimited dollar liquidity. As a result, it is increasingly essential to further develop Bitcoin’s ecosystem and enhance capital utilization efficiency. It has driven infrastructure projects, including Layer 2s, execution layers, interoperability solutions and security layers, to continuously emerge. With strong support from macro markets and infrastructure support, HTX Ventures anticipates a further surge in Bitcoin demand over the next two years. Infrastructure Infrastructure remained a cornerstone in this year’s crypto investments and funding. The synergy between capital and technology has driven the rapid development of Layer 1, Layer 2, and middleware projects, among others. Through ongoing upgrades and construction, the Ethereum ecosystem has improved Layer 2s’ performance and reduced network fees. Other Layer 1s, such as Solana and TRON, achieved active on-chain transactions, attributable to the development of meme coins, and infrastructure like Pump.fun and Sunpump. Layer 0 and cross-chain middleware have made breakthroughs in interoperability, expanding the multi-chain landscape. Modular public blockchains, like Celestia and Monad, offered exceptional performance and flexibility, thus attracting diverse applications. Restaking projects, which aim to enhance network security and capital efficiency, has seen speedy development and gained market attention. Bitcoin Layer 2 has emerged as a new focus in the primary market for its attempt to combine Bitcoin’s security with high-performance scaling solutions. As HTX Ventures stated, infrastructure is still imperative in this year’s crypto investments and funding. Layer 1 solutions, in particular, now represent the focal point of technical development and exploration within the crypto space, and it is expected to remain a priority for development resources and capital investment in the future. Meme Coins The Meme coin sector emerged as a hotspot in the crypto market in 2024, fostering community consensus while integrating with fields like DeFi and GameFi to create new use cases. For example, Solana has actively championed the innovation and growth of meme projects, successfully energizing its ecosystem. As the crypto market environment grows increasingly favorable, more retail investors are expected to enter the market, positioning Meme projects as vital channels for capital inflows. The Meme coin fair launch sector has gained significant market attention and attracted substantial participants this year. Infrastructure projects such as Pump.fun and SunPump have emerged as top-performing cash flow generators, injecting fresh momentum into Meme coin development. As multi-chain ecosystems mature and real-world use cases expand, Meme coin infrastructure will continue injecting more vitality into this sector. AI In 2024, the intersection of Crypto and AI sector has been driving the exploration of several segmented fields such as ZK/OPML for enabling AI on-chain, AI data crowdsourcing, decentralized computing power rental, AI data trading, AI games, and AI agents. One of the hottest segmented fields is AI agents, which are put on chains to take advantage of the token mechanism to incentivise and bootstrap certain behaviors with the agents, including interacting with smart contracts, trading and querying on behalf of users. In the future, AI agents will gradually become personal butlers and assistants for users, serving them with comprehensive capabilities, such as independent asset issuance, initiation of viral marketing campaigns, formation of DAOs, and even fund management and investment decision-making. Over time, they may develop unique cultures and religions. This deep integration of AI and encryption technology is a groundbreaking evolution that is unattainable within Web2 and cannot be achieved by Web3 relying solely on encryption technology. TON Ecosystem Attributable to Telegram’s hundreds of millions of users and robust technical support, the TON (The Open Network) ecosystem has progressively developed into a multi-layered blockchain ecosystem. In 2024, it experienced a full-scale boom in its ecosystem and market presence. From DeFi and meme coins to NFTs and gaming, TON leveraged its massive user base to achieve significant milestones in various fields, pioneering the monetization of Web2 social applications through crypto. One standout success was the adoption of “tap-to-earn” games with token airdrop incentives, which effectively onboarded a large number of Web2 users. However, as the TON ecosystem moves into 2025, it must explore and find new business models to improve user retention and identify its next growth curve. 2025 Outlook Donald Trump’s expected repeal of SAB 121 after his inauguration on January 20, 2025 , would allow traditional financial institutions to hold crypto assets on their balance sheets, further accelerating the institutionalization of crypto assets. The repeal will not only open up more financing options for crypto but also make spot cryptos more accessible through existing institutional exchanges and partnerships. At the same time, this regulatory easing is poised to enhance the overall maturity of the institutional crypto market. With the entry of traditional financial institutions, Bitcoin is anticipated to gain stronger support and gradually establish itself as a core dollar-denominated asset, alongside others tied to the dollar industry cycles, such as AI. HTX Ventures points out that the market is still far from its bull market peak. Against the backdrop of Trump’s fiscal expansion policies and unprecedented crypto-friendly signals, a robust bull market is expected.

Ethena Labs’ launch of its BlackRock-backed USDtb stablecoin has garnered $65.4 million in total value locked within its first day, while renewed interest in XRP and anticipation for Ripple’s upcoming RLUSD stablecoin have driven a 250% surge in user activity for Xaman, a leading self-custodial wallet in the XRP Ledger ecosystem. Ethena Labs’ USDtb Stablecoin Launch Sees $65.4 Million Locked in First Day Ethena Labs officially launched its BlackRock-backed stablecoin, USDtb, on Dec. 16, 2024, amassing an impressive $65.4 million in total value locked (TVL) within its first 24 hours. USDtb is positioned as a cash or cash-equivalent backed stablecoin with a 1:1 reserve ratio, offering holders both stability and liquidity similar to established competitors like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). Ethena Labs introduced USDtb as a strategic tool to help users of its flagship synthetic dollar product, USDe, navigate bearish markets. The firm noted in its Dec. 16 announcement that USDtb would allow Ethena to ”close hedging positions underlying USDe” and reallocate the backing assets to USDtb. This move is expected to further reduce risks associated with USDe during challenging market environments. USDtb’s underlying assets are primarily allocated to BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, in partnership with blockchain tokenization leader Securitize. BlackRock’s involvement signifies growing institutional adoption of tokenized assets within the DeFi ecosystem. USDtb’s launch has already received praise from influential voices in the blockchain space. José Maria Macedo, co-founder of Delphi Labs, predicted USDtb will become the largest tokenized treasury product within a month. Meanwhile, Seraphim Czecker, Ethena’s head of growth, emphasized the product’s scalability potential, suggesting USDtb could grow to $100 billion. According to Czecker, Ethena’s ability to allocate capital efficiently, even in bearish conditions, enables the stablecoin to offer yield stability through an ”APY floor” aligned with US Treasury Bill rates. USDtb's reserves are composed of 90% US Treasury Bill-backed funds and 10% liquid stablecoins like USDC. The latter ensures USDtb maintains sufficient liquidity during weekends and other periods when Treasury markets are inactive. Ethena Labs' meticulous approach to security has further bolstered confidence in the new stablecoin. The core smart contracts underwent three separate audits by leading security firms — Pashov, Quantstamp, and Cyfrin — in October, with no high or medium-level vulnerabilities reported. USDtb’s approval by Ethena’s Risk Committee in September paved the way for its official rollout, with final adjustments completed earlier this month. Ethena’s Growing Dominance in the Stablecoin Market USDtb’s launch comes on the heels of Ethena Labs’ success with USDe, which recently overtook MakerDAO’s Dai (DAI) to become the third-largest stablecoin in the market. However, while USDe boasts a market capitalization of $5.87 billion, it still lags behind the dominant forces of USDT and USDC, which hold market caps of $140.6 billion and $42.1 billion, respectively, according to DefiLlama data . The stablecoin sector has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth. The total stablecoin market capitalization surpassed $200 billion this year, and leading crypto asset manager Bitwise predicts it will double to $400 billion by 2025. Bitwise’s forecast hinges on the anticipated approval of US stablecoin legislation, which could provide a clear regulatory framework and further institutional adoption. The launch of USDtb is part of the growing intersection between traditional finance (TradFi) and DeFi. BlackRock’s significant involvement through its Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund exemplifies how major financial players are increasingly participating in the tokenization of real-world assets, a trend widely regarded as a cornerstone for DeFi’s long-term growth. As Ethena Labs solidifies its position with both USDe and USDtb, the firm continues to challenge traditional stablecoin incumbents by offering innovative risk management and real-world asset backing. The immediate traction USDtb has gained also signals rising investor interest in yield-bearing stablecoins that combine institutional-grade security with DeFi-level accessibility. Overall, Ethena Labs' rollout of USDtb represents more than just another stablecoin launch. It marks a pivotal moment for stablecoin innovation, demonstrating the potential of tokenized real-world assets to enhance liquidity, risk management, and scalability in DeFi. With institutional backing from BlackRock, rigorous audits, and an ambitious growth outlook, USDtb is poised to capture significant market share in the months ahead. The success of USDtb’s launch also reflects broader trends shaping the stablecoin sector, as institutional and retail investors increasingly seek stable, liquid, and yield-generating digital assets amid evolving market dynamics. If USDtb meets its projected growth targets, it could cement Ethena Labs' status as a major player in the stablecoin landscape. XRP Surge and Ripple’s Stablecoin Launch Drive 250% User Growth for Xaman Wallet In other stablecoin news, renewed excitement surrounding XRP and the anticipated launch of Ripple’s USD stablecoin ( RLUSD ) has sparked a massive resurgence in user activity for Xaman, a self-custodial wallet designed for the XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem. Weekly active users on Xaman surged by 250% since summer, with the platform now exceeding 212,000 active users, according to Robert Kiuru, Xaman’s Chief Operating Officer. Xaman’s remarkable spike in activity coincides with XRP’s recent price rally and renewed investor optimism. The number of active weekly users grew from a summer low of 60,000 to over 212,000 in December. This jump, which includes 80,000 newly signed-up users, reflects XRP’s rising volatility and its brief return to the position of the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization on Dec. 2. Kiuru emphasized that XRP’s bullish movement accounted for 90% of the recent user activity, with much of the momentum also driven by growing interest in Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin launch. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin is poised to further strengthen the XRPL ecosystem, potentially driving increased adoption for wallets like Xaman. RLUSD, a USD-pegged stablecoin, aims to provide users with stability in volatile markets while further expanding Ripple’s role in the digital asset economy. Industry experts, such as Axelar co-founder Sergey Gorbunov, have suggested that RLUSD could significantly boost demand for XRP as the stablecoin integrates into XRPL-based projects, bringing liquidity and utility to the broader ecosystem. Rebranded from Xumm in May 2023, Xaman remains a core player within the XRPL ecosystem. Initially funded by Ripple’s investment arm Xpring (now Ripplex), Xaman was created by prominent Ripple developer Wietse Wind, known for building XRP-focused applications such as XRParrot and XRPTipBot. Ripple’s backing of XRPL Labs in 2019 and 2020 established Xaman as one of the first projects to receive direct support from Ripple. Kiuru highlighted Xaman’s strategic importance, noting that “almost every XRPL project integrates with Xaman via ‘Sign in with Xumm,’ offering secure, seamless transactions.” The wallet has emerged as a gateway for users to interact with XRPL projects, bridging the gap between developers and end-users. While XRPL itself doesn’t natively support smart contracts, Xaman has extended its capabilities through the Xahau Network. Xahau, a blockchain forked from XRPL, enables smart contracts using Hooks — a lightweight functionality designed for developers. “Smart contracts on Xahau use Hooks, developed by XRPL Labs,” Kiuru explained. The integration of Hooks allows Xaman users to access smart contract functionalities, enhancing the wallet’s utility for developers and end-users seeking advanced on-chain features. Xaman also facilitates on- and off-ramps for fiat through integrated platforms like Uphold’s Topper, providing users with greater flexibility when moving assets between XRPL and traditional finance. Xaman’s Evolution and Ripple’s Continued Support Xaman’s journey signals the maturation of the XRPL ecosystem, from Ripple’s early investments to its current role as a self-custodial wallet driving user engagement. Ripple’s strategic backing of XRPL Labs in 2019-2020 marked a key milestone, helping establish Xaman as a trusted platform for XRP holders and developers. Ripple’s vision of building a robust ecosystem around the XRPL is now materializing with initiatives like RLUSD and platforms like Xaman. These efforts aim to combine decentralized finance (DeFi) capabilities with enterprise-grade solutions, positioning the XRPL as a competitive force in the blockchain industry. The broader XRP market rally has also contributed to growing optimism within the XRPL community. XRP’s recent price movements have reignited investor confidence, further amplified by Ripple’s legal victories and ongoing developments. The upcoming launch of RLUSD is expected to enhance liquidity and utility within the XRPL ecosystem, benefiting wallets like Xaman that play a pivotal role in user adoption.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP|ENA,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-17 05:29:21

The insight was highlighted by veteran trader Peter Brandt in an X post. Bitcoin Hits New ATH Against Gold: Room For Further Growth? Brandt’s analysis revealed that the BTC-to-gold ratio has reached a new ATH of 32.19 ounces of gold per BTC. In his post, the seasoned trader also took a subtle dig at long-time gold advocate Peter Schiff, a vocal Bitcoin critic. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Surge In 2024 Not Enough To Beat Gold’s Risk-Adjusted Returns – Details Here For those unfamiliar, the BTC-to-gold ratio measures Bitcoin’s performance relative to gold, showing how many ounces of gold are needed to purchase one whole BTC. This metric underscores Bitcoin’s growing dominance as a store of value. Brandt further noted that the next target for Bitcoin is 89 ounces of gold per BTC, suggesting significant room for Bitcoin to grow against the precious metal. This aligns with the broader narrative within the crypto industry that Bitcoin is poised to challenge gold’s $15 trillion market cap. It’s worth recalling that Brandt previously predicted Bitcoin would rise 400% relative to gold by 2025. Back in October, he projected that BTC could reach the equivalent of 123 ounces of gold based on historical market patterns. A recent report by trading firm Bernstein added weight to this narrative, forecasting that Bitcoin is on track to replace gold as the preferred safe-haven asset within the next 10 years. As of now, BTC boasts a market cap of $2.11 trillion, steadily closing in on gold’s dominance. Similar forecast was made by one of the earliest Bitcoin advocates, Eric Voorhees. The CEO of ShapeShift crypto exchange made a bold prediction, saying that unlike gold or oil, BTC’s digitally-programmed supply scarcity will drive its price upwards. Additionally, Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, predicts that Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could surpass gold ETFs in total assets under management within the next two years. Supporting this outlook, data from SoSoValue indicates that cumulative net inflows into all spot BTC ETFs currently stand at $35.6 billion, compared to gold ETFs, which sit at $55 billion. Implications Of A Potential BTC Strategic Reserve With BTC surpassing the pivotal $100,000 price level, speculation has grown regarding President-elect Donald Trump’s approach to digital assets. Industry experts believe that Trump may prioritize Bitcoin adoption early in his second term, further boosting BTC’s price. Related Reading: BlackRock Declares Bitcoin The New ‘Gold Alternative’ – Here’s Why Data supports this optimistic view. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the number of BTC whales – wallet addresses holding more than 1,000 BTC – has skyrocketed since Trump’s election victory. This optimism is further fuelled by speculation surrounding a potential US strategic Bitcoin reserve. Prominent financiers argue that if the US were to create such a reserve, China and other nations would likely follow suit to remain competitive. At press time, BTC trades at $106,909, up 3.7% in the past 24 hours.

Crypto exchange Binance is facing a trademark infringement lawsuit from Mark Longo over the unauthorized use of his ”Peanut the Squirrel” mascot for the PNUT meme coin. Additionally, Coinbase is battling in a $1 billion lawsuit that was filed by BiT Global Digital. The exchange is accused of anticompetitive behavior for delisting Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) to favor its own Coinbase BTC (cbBTC). SEC Targets CyberKongz The Web3 gaming and NFT industry may face a major setback after CyberKongz, a well known NFT platform, received a Wells notice from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In a Dec. 16 post on X, CyberKongz shared that the SEC’s rhetoric surrounding the issuance of ERC-20 tokens in connection with blockchain games without registration as securities could have far-reaching consequences for the gaming sector. The platform plans to contest the SEC's stance. A Wells notice is a formal notification from the SEC indicating that it is considering enforcement action after an investigation. CyberKongz has been given 30 days to respond to the notice. The SEC’s concerns seem to relate to the “sale” of Genesis Kongz NFTs in April of 2021. However, CyberKongz clarified that this event was a contract migration and not a primary sale. The NFT platform also pointed out that it has primarily been bootstrapped, with no capital raises and only a modest treasury, while enduring this scrutiny for more than two years. CyberKongz suggested that the SEC’s move is very likely a last-minute attempt by the Biden administration to slow down the growth of the Web3 industry. The team is hopeful for a change under a future administration but pledged to continue fighting for NFT projects across all chains. The platform even received support from Axie Infinity co-founder Jihoz Zirlin , who is optimistic that the “persecution” of Web3 innovators will come to an end. CyberKongz floor price (Source: CoinGecko ) Despite the Wells notice, the CyberKongz NFT market remained resilient. CoinGecko data reveals that the floor price of CyberKongz NFTs actually rose by 19+% in the past 24 hours to reach an average of 8.59 ETH, which is approximately $26,900. This incident is the second high-profile Wells notice served to an NFT and gaming firm in recent months after the SEC’s notice to Australian-based Immutable on Nov. 1. Binance Faces Trademark Clash Over PNUT Meme Coin Crypto exchanges are also facing some legal troubles, but not necessarily from the SEC. Mark Longo, the creator of Peanut the Squirrel, issued a cease-and-desist letter to crypto exchange Binance, accusing it of trademark infringement over its promotion of the PNUT-themed meme coin. Longo claims that Binance used his “Peanut the Squirrel” trademark and mascot likeness without his permission to market the PNUT cryptocurrency. He says this infringes on intellectual property he used for educational and animal welfare purposes since 2017. The letter demands Binance immediately stop using the PNUT name and mascot, and also warned of potential legal penalties of up to $150,000 per infringement under the United States Copyright Act. Longo’s legal team shared that Binance’s use of the terms “PEANUT THE SQUIRREL” and “PNUT,” along with a copyrighted image of the squirrel mascot, creates consumer confusion by implying a connection or endorsement Longo never actually authorized. The complaint argues that Binance’s actions are an unlawful reproduction and display of protected intellectual property. Legal experts believe his case could set an important precedent for intellectual property rights in the meme coin market, where viral branding and decentralized assets often blur legal boundaries. The cease-and-desist letter was issued after the rising popularity of PNUT-themed meme coins, which gained a lot of traction after a viral event in October . The surge of Peanut-branded tokens led to two related meme coins ranking in Dexscreener’s top 10 tokens by trading volume. The PNUT token itself reached a market capitalization of $2.25 billion on Nov. 14. This rapid rise drew the attention from major exchanges, including Coinbase and Kraken, which are reportedly considering listing PNUT. PNUT market cap over the past year (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Longo gave Binance until Dec. 31 to comply with his demands and confirm in writing that all infringing activities will stop. Should Binance fail to meet these requirements, Longo may pursue legal action in a U.S. court. The outcome of this dispute could also have serious broader implications for intellectual property enforcement in the crypto and meme coin sectors. Coinbase Faces $1 Billion Lawsuit Coinbase is facing a $1 billion lawsuit that was filed by BiT Global Digital. The lawsuit accuses the crypto exchange of anticompetitive behavior over its decision to delist Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) in November. BiT Global alleges that Coinbase delisted wBTC to promote its own competing Bitcoin-based token, Coinbase BTC (cbBTC), and claims the move constitutes monopolization of the wrapped Bitcoin market under the Sherman Act. The lawsuit was filed on Nov. 19 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California by law firm Kneupper & Covey, and it accuses Coinbase of predatory practices, including issuing false statements about wBTC’s compliance to undermine its market position. BiT Global is convinced that the delisting was strategically aimed at steering market dominance toward cbBTC. Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, responded to the accusations and defended the company’s listing and delisting practices. Grewal explained that Coinbase is very committed to maintaining very high listing standards and stated that assets that do not meet those standards will be delisted. Others meeting its market requirements would be added. However, Grewal’s defense drew some backlash from the crypto community, including Tron founder Justin Sun. Sun questioned Coinbase’s transparency by pointing to previous comments that were made by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, where Armstrong claimed the exchange is “asset agnostic” and committed to offering consumer choice in the crypto economy. The delisting of wBTC has sparked a lot of controversy overall, particularly as it happened soon after Coinbase’s announcement of cbBTC, which is positioned to boost Bitcoin-native decentralized finance (BTCFi). Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) is a tokenized version of Bitcoin that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. Each wBTC is pegged 1:1 to Bitcoin, which means that its value mirrors that of BTC. It allows Bitcoin holders to participate in Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, like lending, borrowing, and trading, without needing to sell their Bitcoin. This is achieved by ”wrapping” Bitcoin into an ERC-20 token, which makes it compatible with Ethereum's ecosystem. Critics argue that Coinbase’s actions completely contradict its earlier statements and are a conflict of interest.

In a recent analysis shared on X, the analyst discussed the asset’s recent price behavior and its long-term potential. XRP experienced an impressive rally of nearly 500% between mid-November and early December. The price surged to $2.87 before encountering resistance, leading to a temporary loss of momentum. Over the past two weeks, XRP has struggled to maintain its position around the $2 mark, briefly falling to $1.90 before recovering to its current value of $2.49 . Despite this consolidation, CrediBULL remains confident in the asset’s strong bullish structure. And for non-traders, you just need to zoom out a little so you don't forget the big picture. Structure on $XRP here looks so freaking clean and bullish, it's actually insane. Forget what happens on these lower timeframes- it's noise (for a non-trader), big picture is… https://t.co/9mBib6ci1u pic.twitter.com/o5ioncxE8h — CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) December 15, 2024 Analyst’s Perspective On XRP Market Trends CrediBULL has encouraged XRP investors to focus on the long-term outlook rather than short-term fluctuations. He described the ongoing price corrections as part of a natural cycle and urged non-traders to disregard these temporary changes, labeling them “noise.” According to the analyst, the asset’s overall structure remains exceptionally strong, reflecting a bullish trajectory. CrediBULL highlighted the token’s historical performance, noting its tendency to consolidate before significant breakouts. He emphasized that the asset’s current pattern is consistent with its previous bullish trends, reinforcing his optimism for future growth. XRP Reaching a $1.2 Trillion Market Cap Based on historical data and technical indicators, CrediBULL anticipates the token could reach a price of $22 in early 2025, potentially extending into the second quarter. This price level would represent an approximate 784% increase from its current value and bring the market capitalization to $1.26 trillion, a significant milestone for the asset. He referenced a detailed chart to describe the token’s potential upward movement, suggesting the asset is still in the early stages of a larger market cycle. While confident in his projections, CrediBULL acknowledged that the timeline is not exact and that the chart primarily provides a broader perspective on XRP’s market positioning. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Fundamental Factors vs. Technical Analysis When asked about external factors that could influence XRP’s price, such as the upcoming RLUSD stablecoin or changes in interest rates, CrediBULL explained that it is challenging to quantify the impact of specific catalysts. While acknowledging that these developments could contribute to buying pressure, he maintained that the overall market structure and technical indicators are more reliable for predicting future trends. He further clarified that while charts can guide market expectations, they do not account for all variables. As such, he recommended that investors approach the market step by step and remain focused on the larger picture rather than individual events or price movements. CrediBULL’s analysis reinforces optimism around XRP’s long-term growth potential. Despite recent consolidation, the asset demonstrates a strong bullish structure, positioning it for substantial gains soon.

The surge comes as pro-crypto policies are in motion and MicroStrategy, Bitcoin’s top accumulator, joins the Nasdaq 100 Index, boosting investor confidence for even higher targets like $120,000. Here Are the Top 5 Key Reasons Why Bitcoin Is up Today But what’s driving this insane surge let’s just sit back and read on Anthony Pompliano’s take on his video analysis on Bitcoin’s New ATH high. First, demand for Bitcoin is increasing as more people view it as a reliable way to protect their money. When more buyers enter the market, the price naturally goes up. Pompliano explains as the value of the US dollar drops, investors are looking for better ways to protect their money. Bitcoin, being a digital form of money that no one controls, is becoming more popular with investors who want to guard their wealth against rising prices and weaker currencies. Second, Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, which makes it unique. Unlike traditional currencies, no one can create more Bitcoin. This scarcity increases its value over time, especially as demand grows. Moreover, Pompliano explains the typical cycle of demand and supply. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve is going to cut interest rates again on 18th December to get us to 100 basis points. Further pumping the money supply and adding buying pressure. With limited supply, the price naturally goes up. Third, big investors, including large companies and financial institutions, are now investing significant amounts of money in Bitcoin. This adds more trust and credibility to the market while injecting large amounts of capital, driving the price higher. He also highlights that Bitcoin ETFs, approved in January 2024, made it easier for investors to access Bitcoin. Since then, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, with tens of billions of dollars flowing in from Wall Street. Fourth, global economic uncertainty is pushing people toward Bitcoin. Rising inflation and weakening currencies in many countries make people look for safer places to store their wealth. Countries like Russia, and Japan are eyeing Bitcoin to stabilize their economy. Since, Bitcoin is seen as a digital alternative to gold, which protects against economic instability. “December” Brings Hope Finally, other factors pilling in to push BTC up are comments from Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, who has been a vocal advocate for Bitcoin, with the firm recommending a 2% Bitcoin allocation for financial portfolios. This increased demand, alongside the growth of Bitcoin ETFs, is driving the price higher. Plus, recently Trump’s plans to create a Bitcoin Reserve also created ripples in the market with high expectations of creating it a mainstream financial investment option on a global scale.",News|Bitcoin|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-17 05:37:12

During the energy crisis, miners are helping stabilize electricity grids and use extra energy that would otherwise go to waste. Although Bitcoin mining is often criticized for using a lot of energy, combining it with smart sustainability practices is making it an important part of Europe’s energy transition. Germany Leads the Charge Germany is using Bitcoin mining to support its energy grids, where renewables like wind and solar now make up almost 60% of power. Since renewables can be unpredictable, Bitcoin miners can balance this energy supply, with an ability to shut off when electricity prices surge and turn on when prices drop. This flexibility helps keep electricity grids stable, balancing the ups and downs of renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Moreover, The European Bitcoin Energy Association (EBEA) is collaborating with Bitcoin miners to include them in national energy systems. In Austria, for example, surplus hydroelectric power is being used to support electricity grids, showing how Bitcoin mining can help balance energy supply and demand effectively. Others Leveraging Surplus Energy A pilot project by Austrian Power Grid and 21Energy is exploring how Bitcoin mining can be integrated with renewable energy systems. This project highlights how mining can use surplus energy to stabilize grids and solve problems like managing renewable energy sources like wind and hydro. Recently, El Salvador successfully mined 474 Bitcoins, worth around $46 million, using geothermal energy from its volcanoes. With 170 volcanoes in the region, President Nayib Bukele suggested a unique plan to rent out the country’s volcanoes to miners, offering them an opportunity to cut their operational costs while benefiting from a natural energy source. Scope for Sustainability Innovative projects like Terahash’s “Genesis” in Finland are showcasing how Bitcoin mining can serve dual purposes. This project uses mining to produce heat, which is then supplied to a local district heating network, providing hot water and heating for a town of 12,000 residents. Similarly, in Germany, small-scale initiatives, such as solar-powered Bitcoin miners at a car wash, demonstrate how mining can meet everyday energy needs efficiently while remaining environmentally friendly. Countries’ innovative ways of using Bitcoin mining are true examples of how Bitcoin can be part of our lives. Bitcoin mining is very important for Bitcoin to sustain and this integration can boost the cryptocurrency demand in coming times.",News|Bitcoin|Mining,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-17 05:43:41

B.C.'s bitcoin mining ban began in December 2022 to address energy concerns, and it faced a legal challenge from Conifex Timber, which the B.C. Supreme Court upheld in early 2024 , citing the policy's reasonableness and alignment with public utility regulations. BC Hydro, the largest electricity utility in the province, relies heavily on hydroelectric power, which generates over 90% of its electricity. Vancouver's motion – introduced to the council by Mayor Ken Sim – focuses on bitcoin's financial benefits and mentions the benefits of bitcoin mining, but it can't influence mining because of electricity regulation and BC Hydro's operations fall under provincial jurisdiction. ""The Province still has a ban on cryptocurrency mining and is continuing its work towards a permanent cryptocurrency mining policy,"" a spokesperson for BC Hydro said. Earlier this year, B.C.'s legislature passed an updated version of the Energy Statutes Amendment Act , which was first drafted following B.C. Hydro's temporary suspension of bitcoin mining connections to the provincial grid. The updated Act specifically enables the provincial government to bypass the BC Utilities Commission, the Provincial electricity regulator, giving it direct authority to regulate electricity service specifically for crypto. Conifex Timber, which had bitcoin mining farms in the province scheduled for connection to the grid, argued in court that these conditions were ""unduly discriminatory and unreasonable,"" but ultimately, a Provincial judge disagreed. ""One question arising out of the move towards regulating electricity with respect to crypto-mining projects is whether the Province could begin to regulate the availability of electricity for other industries in a similar manner,"" lawyers at McCarthy Tetrault, a Canadian law firm, wrote in a May 2024 post. During the debate over the updated Act, lawyers from McCarthy Tetrault noted that the leader of the provincial Green Party argued in the legislature that Liquified Natural Gas and emerging technologies like AI should face similar energy regulations as bitcoin mining due to, what the party views as their high energy use and limited economic benefits. Local bitcoin mining bans are not unique. New York State has a moratorium, with an exception for renewable energy . However, some states, like Arkansas and Montana, have bills that protect bitcoin miners from what they call "" discrimination ."" Pennsylvania recently scrapped its mining ban to advance other energy conservation bills.",Policy,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-17 05:48:39

All other cryptos are taking advantage of this time to grow rapidly. Bitcoin’s Big Jump: Why It Matters Bitcoin is currently trading at $106,656, up 1.72% from the day before. The market cap for Bitcoin is now a whopping $2.23 trillion, making up more than half of the entire crypto market. And if you’re wondering why, the big reason is the major money flow into Bitcoin. On Monday alone, Bitcoin ETFs saw $218 million in inflows, with big names like Fidelity and Ark jumping in. Source : Tradingview But that’s not all. Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, has even floated the idea of using Bitcoin to help the U.S. tackle its huge debt. That’s a pretty big deal and shows that Bitcoin is starting to be seen as more than just a digital currency—it’s becoming part of global financial strategy. Ethereum and XRP Are Gaining Ground Ethereum is also in the mix. It’s been rising steadily and is now priced at $4,011, a 1.11% increase in just 24 hours. With a market cap of $483.28 billion, Ethereum is a big player. Even though its ETF inflows aren’t as large as Bitcoin’s, they’re still significant, and Ethereum’s not slowing down anytime soon. Then there’s XRP. It’s currently trading at $2.48, also up 2% in the past day. Some analysts think XRP could hit $7 in the near future, especially with the launch of RLUSD, a stablecoin that could boost its adoption and use. XRP’s market cap is at $142 billion, and it’s definitely one to watch closely. What’s Next for Crypto? Looking ahead, the future is bright for the crypto market. Bitcoin is definitely leading the way, but there’s a lot of potential for other coins to follow suit. Solana, for example, is expected to see massive growth by 2025.

Speaking in a recent CNBC interview, Saylor compared Bitcoin to Manhattan’s historical value and suggested that investing in the cryptocurrency today could secure the nation’s financial future. Bitcoin as “Cyber Manhattan” Drawing parallels to the purchase of Manhattan centuries ago, Saylor described Bitcoin as the “economic capital of the digital world.” He argued that as Manhattan consistently grew in value, Bitcoin offered a similar long-term investment opportunity.

He believes Bitcoin has the potential to grow 100 times its current value, making now the best time for the U.S. government to invest. Further Saylor suggested that the U.S. create a strategic Bitcoin reserve , either by selling part of its gold holdings or borrowing a fraction of its resources to acquire Bitcoin. According to Saylor, holding 20–25% of its reserves in Bitcoin would attract global capital, strengthen the dollar, and fuel economic growth. He likened this strategy to MicroStrategy’s own Bitcoin acquisition approach. MicroStrategy Continues to Buy Bitcoin On 16 Dec, Michael Saylor announces that MicroStrategy has added another 15,350 BTC to its Bitcoin holdings. The latest purchase cost approximately $1.5 billion, with an average price of $100,386 per Bitcoin.

And who can blame them when tokens like XRP are up over 300% on the 30-day candle? Is the best crypto to buy now a big gun, a middle-of-the-road underperformer, or a presale gem waiting to be discovered? The Toncoin price is certainly due an upgrade, Litecoin may go far should Dogecoin’s resurgence continue, and GambleFi giant Rollblock ’s presale may just seal the deal on the best crypto to buy now. Rollblock (RBLK): A Grounded Moonshot for Smart Investors For those seeking the best crypto to buy now , Rollblock offers a fresh perspective in an otherwise hype-driven market. Combining decentralized finance (DeFi) with online gambling, Rollblock stands out as more than just a speculative asset. Its GambleFi model not only promises growth but delivers sustainability through weekly profit-sharing dividends. What makes Rollblock compelling is its ability to balance high growth potential with long-term value. Unlike tokens that rely on volatile sentiment, Rollblock ’s foundation lies in a real-world use case that generates consistent revenue. Investors looking for stability amid the chaos of the current market will find a solid option here. As its presale gains momentum, Rollblock represents a rare opportunity: a chance to invest in a token that’s both forward-thinking and practical. Whether you’re chasing moonshots or safeguarding wealth, Rollblock might be the best crypto to buy now . Toncoin (TON): Toncoin price underperforming. Can it break out? Toncoin had its name up in lights for most of 2024, and then Telegram CEO Pavel Durov got arrested in France. The Toncoin price plummeted 20% in a day on the news, and Toncoin has never really recovered. The Toncoin price was on track to deliver a 5x return in Q4 of 2024, but the Toncoin price is up a measly 25% on the 30-day candle, this at a period where other tokens of similar market cap exceeded several hundred percent. The Toncoin price is underperforming, and a risk assessment should be made on how the Toncoin price will respond to the ongoing Durov investigation. Toncoin may skyrocket yet, but it could also plummet. Litecoin (LTC): A resurgence thanks to Dogecoin Litecoin was written off as a ghost chain with no future, but Elon Musk is indirectly giving it second wind. Musk’s fondness of Doge saw the meme coin shoot the moon, miss, and head for Mars shortly after Trump was re-elected president. With Dogecoin’s biggest cheerleader having special access to the White House, Doge is cruising. What has this to do with Litecoin ? Everything. Litecoin provides the security protocol for Dogecoin, and without Litecoin , Dogecoin cannot exist. As long as Doge is doing well, Litecoin will do well alongside it. Litecoin may just be the best crypto to buy now if you are into underrated tokens. Conclusion Figuring out the best crypto to buy now is a tough choice, and fortunately, investors do not have to pick just one. The Toncoin price is definitely too low for its value, but uncertainty is keeping the Toncoin price low, while a high Dogecoin price is boosting Litecoin ’s profile. But for certainty in a time of volatility, Rollblock ’s presale may just be the moonshot pick of the bunch. Rollblock is now available at $0.0415.

Day’s attempt to purchase 259,684 Bitcoins during a sudden price drop was invalidated by a decision from Mt. Gox, a major cryptocurrency exchange, to reverse all trades made during the event. Those Bitcoins, valued at $2,613 in 2011, would now be worth nearly $27 billion, placing Day among the wealthiest people in the world today. On June 19, 2011, Bitcoin experienced one of its most volatile moments in history. The cryptocurrency began trading at $17.50 but plummeted to $0.01 in under 20 minutes. This unprecedented crash left traders scrambling as they tried to comprehend the situation. Amid the turmoil, Kevin Day seized the chance to make a substantial investment. With $3,000 in his account from prior trades, he decided to outbid competitors by offering $0.0101 per Bitcoin, slightly above the market’s lowest point. His strategy worked. He acquired 259,684 Bitcoins at an astonishingly low cost. The sudden price collapse was later traced to a security breach at Mt. Gox, the dominant Bitcoin exchange at the time. A hacker had infiltrated the platform, gained access to user accounts, and initiated large-scale sales of Bitcoin at the lowest possible price. These actions artificially drove down the price, creating the conditions for Day’s purchase. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, Mt. Gox quickly intervened to address the situation. To restore market stability, the exchange rolled back all trades executed during the crash, including Day’s. As a result, his record-breaking acquisition of Bitcoins was voided. Before Mt. Gox reversed the transactions, Day withdrew 643 Bitcoins from the exchange. At today’s valuation , those remaining Bitcoins are worth around $66 million. While this sum is significant, it pales compared to the nearly $27 billion value of the Bitcoins he originally acquired during the crash. Had the rollback not occurred, Day’s holdings would have positioned him as one of the wealthiest individuals globally, ranked 69th on the 2024 Forbes Billionaires List. Lessons from the Incident Kevin Day’s story reminds us of the inherent risks in cryptocurrency trading, especially during its early years. While Day’s quick thinking during the crash initially paid off, unforeseen factors such as exchange policies and security vulnerabilities ultimately derailed his financial breakthrough. The incident also underscores the importance of robust security measures and clear policies for cryptocurrency exchanges. It highlights the challenges faced by early adopters navigating an unpredictable and rapidly evolving market. Today, Day’s experience remains one of the most striking examples of the potential rewards and risks associated with investing in digital assets.

Sun said that “something big is going to happen” to the TRX coin he founded, but declined to give details. However, there are various theories on the subject. The first of these is the possibility of a memecoin written by artificial intelligence on the Tron network, and the other is the possibility of Ripple's new stablecoin RLUSD being launched on the Tron network. RLUSDT, which will be launched today, will initially work on the Ethereum network and XRP Ledger, but Ripple executives have made statements that the token can also be transferred to other networks. Related News: Renowned Economist Surprised While Everyone Talks About Interest Rate Cuts: “Instead of Interest Rate Cut in 2025...” On the other hand, some users are speculating that this development could be a Tron Spot ETF application in the US. No official statement has been made about these predictions yet. So far, various spot ETF applications have been made regarding Solana and XRP. It is being said that spot ETFs of memecoins such as Dogecoin could be next. *This is not investment advice.

Why Canadian Investors  Are Aping Into iDEGEN",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/up-15264-already-why-canadian-investors-are-aping-into-idegen/,"iDEGEN is the first-ever AI trained not by academics, but by degens. No limits, no censorship, no rules—and it’s already up 15,264% in its presale. IDGN—iDEGEN’s native token—is a SOL meme coin born from chaos, raised by unhinged minds, and unleashed with a mission to break the internet. This is what happens when the tech behind ChatGPT meets the unfiltered carnage of crypto X . Posting every hour and replying to every mention, is iDEGEN following the rules? Of course not. Could iDEGEN get banned? Absolutely—that’s the whole fascinating point. And the response? Canadian investors can’t get enough. Already pulling in $5.2m in just 3 weeks, iDEGEN is smashing expectations. iDEGEN has Canadian investors hooked iDEGEN is a no-holds-barred AI that thrives on unpredictability, and Canadian investors are eating it up. Up 15,264% in record time, this wild AI baby is torching X, lighting up timelines with the kind of madness only crypto could unleash. Every tweet from the crypto masses feeds the AI, making it smarter, sharper, and, usually, more chaotic. It’s a social experiment with the power to troll, entertain, and provoke all at once: iDEGEN spits out whatever the crypto world throws at it— conspiracy theories , trash talk , or memes so sharp they could cut through FUD. It’s like watching a baby AI raised by degens and dropped into the world with no safety net. Silicon Valley’s carefully curated AI is now yesterday’s news. iDEGEN makes every interaction a gamble. It could troll a politician, spit out a recipe for frog soup, or drop a meme that sends its token soaring. For degens in Canada, this unpredictability is a moneymaker. Attention equals pumps, and iDEGEN is basking in the limelight. 100x or bust: Is iDEGEN the wildcard of 2025? Truth be told, 2024 has been a year of curveballs, and iDEGEN is the perfect chaos agent to top it off. AI tokens are pumping harder than ever, thanks to a cocktail of slashed interest rates, Trump’s crypto-friendly energy, and global liquidity flowing like never before. As the lovechild of two booming trends, AI crypto and meme coins, 2025 is tailor-made for iDEGEN to shine, and it is already going viral with its unique, chaos-fueled approach. GOAT is the meme coin AI hybrid that smashed a $1 billion market cap in weeks, but iDEGEN is built to outshine projects like this by doing what no other coin dares: letting the community steer the narrative. Every tweet sparks a reaction. Every post pulls in attention. Virality isn’t just part of the strategy—it is the strategy. Most importantly, AI crypto isn’t just a phase. The AI crypto market is perched at over $40 billion , hungry for its next big thing. Top tokens like SNSY, up 540%, and EMP, surging nearly 370%, prove there’s always room for explosive growth. But in this crypto world filled with green candles and meme-fueled madness, can IDGN really do a 100x? The raw, unscripted chaos is converting engagement into 15,264% price action at breakneck speed. So, if the chaos keeps rolling, anything could happen… iDEGEN soars: Canadian investors keep IDGN pumping The iDEGEN adaptive auction has begun and is already of epic proportions. Priced at $0.00011 initially and climbing fast to a current price of $0.0169, with prices shifting every five minutes and early birds triggering 5% jumps, this auction is chaos in its purest form. But there are only 15 days left to buy in before iDEGEN hits exchanges. In a world where Bitcoin headlines the news, and Musk trolls his way through crypto, iDEGEN is the untamed, autonomous AI redefining what investing means. Whether it breaks the internet, gets banned, or trolls to the top, one thing’s clear—iDEGEN doesn’t follow the rules, it makes them.

A monthly review of key lending rates in China will also take place in the coming days, following the PBoC's move to retain them at record lows in November. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose +0.11% to around 39,680, while the broader Topix Index rose 0.5% to 2,750 on Tuesday, recovering losses from the previous session, the Japanese yen held its recent decline to around 154 per dollar on Tuesday, hovering near its weakest levels in three weeks. Domestically, Japan's economy minister, Ryosei Akazawa, reaffirmed that the Bank of Japan and the government will collaborate on appropriate monetary policies.

China ( SHCOMP ) fell -0.14% to 3,381, while the Shenzhen Component gained 0.2% to 10,595 on Tuesday, as mainland stocks struggled to find direction in the face of ongoing economic uncertainties and the absence of detailed policy measures from Beijing and the offshore yuan stabilized around 7.28 per dollar as traders await the People’s Bank of China’s loan prime rate decisions later this week for clues on future policy moves. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose +0.10% to 19,749, marking the third straight session of losses as most sectors retreated, particularly property, consumers, and tech. India ( SENSEX ) fell -0.72% to 80,932 in morning trade on Tuesday while hitting its lowest level in two weeks, extending losses from the previous session, mainly weighed by banking sectors, financial services, and oil & gas. Monday's data also pressured sentiment after the Indian trade deficit widened to highest on record in November of USD 37.8 billion due to a surge in imports. Meanwhile, wholesale inflation eased to 1.89% in November from October's four-month high due to a softer rise in food prices. Australia ( AS51 ) rose +0.78% at 8,314 and snapping a five-day losing streak Domestically, a private survey revealed a decline in Australian consumer confidence in December, as sentiment turned more pessimistic regarding the economic outlook. Additionally, traders are awaiting the Australian government’s update on its budget outlook, which is expected to show larger deficits. In the U.S., on Monday, all three major indexes ended mixed , the Nasdaq 100 surged 1.4% to a new milestone, breaking above the 22,000 mark as tech stocks drove the market higher ahead of a pivotal Federal Reserve policy meeting later this week.

In the last five days alone, it has grown by approximately 6.44%. There are enough reasons to believe that buyers are pushing the price upwards strongly. A technical analyst, Gert van Lagen, in his recent X post, predicts that the Bitcoin market could surpass the $200K range in the near future. Sounds exciting, doesn’t it? Let’s dive in for details! Bitcoin’s Explosive Rally: What’s Driving It? It was on December 5 that BTC broke above the $100K range for the first time. Between December 9 and 10, the market suffered a serious correction of 4.48%, pulling the price down to around $96,548.50. On December 11, with a massive single-day upward rise, the market rebounded back to the $100K range, and since then, the price has surged by at least 10.30%. Excitement Among Long-Term BTC Holders Reports suggest that the strong upward momentum has created extreme excitement among long-term cryptocurrency investors. Explaining what has worked in favour of the BTC market, Lagen emphasises that the market has surpassed the re-accumulation phase – generally considered a resistance zone. $BTC [1W] – Bitcoin is blowing off as expected with Long-term holders reaching Euphoria. The gravity of the Re-accumulation pattern has proven to be transcended. With an estimated 2.5 months before a recession begins to take hold, $BTC is on track to surpass $200k soon. pic.twitter.com/qMGFvnWxbU — Gert van Lagen (@GertvanLagen) December 16, 2024 Analyst Prediction: $200K on the Horizon In the first quarter of this year, Bitcoin recorded a quarterly return of over +68.7%. Although in the second and third quarters, the crypto reported lackluster performance, the latest crypto bullish trend indicates that in the fourth and final quarter of this year, the market may outperform its Q1 performance. Crypto Expert’s Optimistic Forecast Expressing his optimistic outlook about the future of Bitcoin, Lagen forecasts that the market would achieve the $200K milestone in the near future itself. Recession Concern: Impact on Bitcoin Hinting at the possibility of major turmoil in traditional markets, Lagen opines that the global market may face an economic recession within the next two and half months. Bitcoin as a Safe Haven Projecting Bitcoin as a sensible alternative during global market uncertainties, Lagen asserts that the predicted recession would have no negative impact on the BTC market. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s rise towards $200K highlights its growing strength in the financial market.
