Charts look calm. Feeds feel repetitive. Big names trade sideways while traders refresh dashboards pretending patience is a strategy. This is the part of the cycle where nothing feels urgent, yet everything quietly changes underneath. Historically, this is when promising altcoins under $0.40 begin separating from noise. Liquidity is thinner. Conviction is weaker. Most wallets are frozen, waiting for confirmation that never comes. Meanwhile, smaller narratives form in the background. The crowd focuses on what already feels familiar, not what is forming early. That behavior explains why promising altcoins under $0.40 rarely look exciting before momentum shows up. This is where instinct matters more than indicators. When the market feels boring, opportunity usually hides. Traders who wait for green candles often arrive late. Those watching early access mechanics often arrive first. Right now, promising altcoins under $0.40 are quietly shifting away from legacy comfort toward early action setups. That shift explains why attention is starting to move toward Apeing . While others debate XRP and Tron’s long term positioning, Apeing is attracting wallets that understand timing beats certainty. In crypto, speed often decides outcomes. Apeing Enters the Conversation Differently Apeing approaches the market from a different angle. Instead of relying on long standing narratives, it focuses on early entry mechanics. That alone places it among promising altcoins under $0.40 worth monitoring closely. Apeing’s structure rewards decisiveness. Stage 1 participation is expected to open at just $0.0001, with projected listing levels near $0.001. That math implies a 10x baseline before broader attention arrives. This model appeals to traders who understand asymmetry. More importantly, allocation at Stage 1 remains strictly limited. Early participants secure positions others cannot replicate later. That scarcity dynamic drives urgency without relying on hype. This is where Apeing differentiates itself. It does not wait for market validation. It creates opportunity through structure. That approach resonates during periods when promising altcoins under $0.40 quietly rotate beneath the surface. Apeing positions itself for those who move while others hesitate. Apeing Whitelist Signals Early Advantage The Apeing whitelist functions as a positioning filter. It rewards wallets willing to act before confirmation arrives. Whitelisted participants access the earliest allocation window, securing exposure before demand expands. This mechanism flips traditional behavior. Instead of chasing momentum, participants lock in value first. That approach historically produces stronger outcomes during sideways markets. For promising altcoins under $0.40, whitelist structures often indicate confidence from builders. They signal controlled distribution rather than chaotic launches. That discipline attracts experienced participants. Apeing’s whitelist reinforces its early action philosophy. It is designed for those who understand that markets reward preparation, not reaction. XRP Holds Structure, but Timing Remains the Question XRP continues to occupy a unique position within crypto markets. Its role in cross border payment discussions gives it staying power. Institutional narratives keep it relevant even during quiet periods. That consistency explains why many still view XRP among promising altcoins under $0.40. However, structure alone does not guarantee near term opportunity. XRP’s visibility also means expectations remain high. Large holder bases move slowly. Major narratives take time to materialize. That reality shifts focus toward assets offering clearer early stage participation. For traders seeking faster asymmetry, XRP often feels like waiting for permission. Momentum depends on broader adoption narratives rather than internal mechanics. While XRP maintains relevance, its upside potential becomes more incremental than explosive. Tron Remains Active, Yet Predictable Tron continues to surprise by refusing to disappear. Network usage remains strong. Transaction volumes stay consistent. Development activity persists. These factors keep Tron present in any discussion about promising altcoins under $0.40. However, predictability limits excitement. Tron behaves like infrastructure rather than opportunity. Its ecosystem feels mature. That maturity attracts stability focused capital rather than speculative positioning. When markets slow, predictability becomes a drawback for traders chasing outsized returns. Promising altcoins under $0.40 often attract interest because they offer uncertainty paired with opportunity. Tron’s certainty limits that emotional appeal. Conclusion: The Shift Happens Before the Headlines Markets rarely announce transitions. Promising altcoins under $0.40 begin shifting long before charts reflect it. XRP and Tron remain relevant, but early eyes are moving elsewhere. Apeing captures attention because it aligns with cycle psychology. It rewards instinct over hesitation. It offers structure instead of noise. When the market feels quiet, opportunity often whispers. Those listening to the Best Crypto To Buy Now may understand why Apeing enters conversations ahead of momentum.

Apeing focuses on early access mechanics rather than established infrastructure narratives. Why do promising altcoins under $0.40 attract attention? Lower entry points often allow stronger percentage movement during rotations. Is early participation risky? Yes. Early stage involvement carries higher uncertainty alongside higher potential. Does Apeing guarantee returns? No. Outcomes depend on market conditions and adoption. Summary This article explores how promising altcoins under $0.40 are quietly rotating during a calm market phase. While XRP and Tron maintain visibility, attention is shifting toward Apeing due to its early access structure and whitelist positioning. The piece explains market psychology, rotation behavior, and why early participation often precedes momentum. Apeing’s limited Stage 1 allocation and structured access model appeal to traders seeking asymmetry rather than stability. The article emphasizes informed decision making, acknowledges risks, and frames Apeing as an instinct driven opportunity forming before headlines appear.

The platform, known for rapid and open token launches, now sits at the center of a class-action lawsuit focused on transaction ordering and MEV tools. Significantly, the court recently allowed thousands of internal messages from a whistleblower into the record, signaling that the claims warrant serious examination. While the ruling does not establish wrongdoing, it pushes the case beyond speculation and into formal legal scrutiny, with potential consequences for the wider crypto ecosystem. How MEV Shifted the Fair Launch Debate Pump.fun built its reputation on equal access. It removed presales, private rounds, and early allocations, creating confidence among retail traders. However, the lawsuit argues that fairness at the interface level does not ensure fairness in execution. Blockchains process transactions through validators, mempools, and priority fees, not simple button clicks. Consequently, traders with faster infrastructure and MEV bots can reach the front of blocks, even during public launches. Additionally, newly launched tokens on Pump.fun start with thin liquidity and sharp bonding curves. Early execution can dramatically change prices within seconds. Plaintiffs claim that sophisticated traders exploited this structure by securing priority ordering, buying at lower prices, and exiting quickly. Retail users, meanwhile, often entered later at inflated levels, believing they remained early participants. Why the Case Targets More Than Pump.fun The lawsuit expands beyond Pump.fun to include Solana Labs, the Solana Foundation, and Jito Labs. Plaintiffs argue that MEV advantages arise from infrastructure decisions, not just application design. Validators determine transaction order, while MEV tools optimize execution speed. Hence, responsibility may extend to entities that build and promote these systems. Jito Labs receives particular attention due to its role in MEV optimization on Solana. Moreover, Solana’s core organizations face scrutiny for promoting ecosystem growth while allegedly knowing about structural disadvantages facing retail users. If proven, this could reshape how blockchains communicate risk and fairness to users. Broader Implications for Retail Trust The lawsuit cites estimated retail losses between $4.4 billion and $5.5 billion, though courts have not verified these figures. Still, the scale underscores rising concern about systemic inequality in crypto markets. Significantly, the case challenges whether public access alone defines fairness.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-28 21:36:08
56511806,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=885361,1766957916,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56511806.jpeg,SEC's revised audit inspection standards expected to trickle down to crypto firms,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-sec-to-go-easy-on-audit-inspections/,"The Trump administration’s crypto-friendly approach has resulted in reduced oversight of the crypto industry, leading to criticism from advocates and lawmakers. The SEC has changed its policies from strict enforcement of regulations to a business-friendly model in President Trump’s regime, and contrary to critics, the reduced oversight has not been unreasonably reserved for crypto firms. The crypto regulatory environment under Trump’s administration Since President Donald Trump took office in January 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped or paused approximately 60% of the enforcement cases it had against crypto companies, according to reports from The New York Times. On January 21, the SEC announced a new Crypto Task Force led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, which was created to develop clear regulatory rules for the industry. Just three days later, Trump issued an executive order that reversed the policies former President Biden put in place. President Trump’s order was titled “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology.” It established a Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets and showed that blockchain innovation is a national priority. The SEC has since dismissed lawsuits against major exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken without penalties. According to reports , the SEC is no longer actively pursuing any cases against firms with known ties to Trump. The Justice Department has reacted similarly, dismantling its National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team in April and redirecting resources toward other priorities like immigration enforcement and drug trafficking. In April, Trump appointed Paul Atkins, a former commissioner known for opposing regulatory overreach, as SEC Chair. At the AICPA Conference on Current SEC and PCAOB Developments in December, Atkins criticized recent disclosure rules pushed by his predecessor Gary Gensler, saying they would have undermined traditional financial accounting standards. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), which oversees auditors of public companies, has also reduced its inspections and enforcement actions and refrained from setting new standards ever since the appointment of William Duhnke as PCAOB chairman by President Trump. Robert Pawlewicz, an accounting professor at the University of Richmond, told CFO Dive that the administration doesn’t need to abolish the PCAOB to make it ineffective. He expects that inspections and enforcement will continue to decrease like they did during Trump’s first term. In April 2025, the House Financial Services Committee even voted to advance a bill that would abolish the PCAOB entirely, though the bill has not become law. The PCAOB previously identified crypto assets as a priority for inspections in 2025, especially organizations with material crypto holdings and significant crypto transactions, but with Atkins now overseeing the SEC, which in turn oversees the PCAOB, these inspections seem uncertain. Atkins previously criticized the PCAOB, saying its rules interfered with audit firms’ judgment. He went on to criticize the board’s budget and salaries. What does this mean for crypto investors and companies? For crypto companies, the regulatory environment has become significantly more welcoming. In February, the SEC revamped its Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit into the broader Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit with about 30 fraud specialists. Acting SEC Chairman Mark Uyeda state d th e unit will protect investors and also facilitate innovation. In July, Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first comprehensive federal framework for stablecoins. Under the Aact, stablecoin issuers must keep enough money in reserve to back every coin they issue, submit monthly audits to prove it, and follow anti-money laundering laws. The House also passed a separate bill called the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act with support from both political parties. Advocates and lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren have criticized the sudden regulatory changes. Senator Warren called for an SEC Inspector General investigation in early 2025 to determine whether Trump administration officials improperly influenced SEC decisions on cryptocurrency because Trump, his advisors, and family members all stand to benefit from developments in the crypto industry. Public Citizen and other advocacy groups believ e th e SEC changed its approach due to an investment of nearly $250 million from companies like Coinbase, Ripple, and Andreessen Horowitz into various 2024 campaigns. Despite the controversy, the Trump administration has admitted no wrongdoing. The SEC told The New York Times that political favoritism had nothing to do with its strategies and that the changes were based on legal and policy reasons.

The growing gap between private funding numbers and public market caps highlights a market reset after narrative-driven optimism cooled. Data recently shared by CryptoRank shows dozens of well-funded projects losing hundreds of millions, and in some cases nearly all, of their implied value once tokens reached open markets, raising fresh questions about pricing discipline during bull cycles. VC Valuations Meet Public Market Reality CryptoRank’s comparison of VC valuations versus current market capitalizations painted a stark picture. Humanity Protocol, once priced at a $1 billion valuation during private rounds, now sits at around $285 million. Plasma and ICNT show smaller gaps by comparison, with Plasma at roughly $224 million versus a $500 million valuation, and ICNT near $247 million against $470 million. The steepest drops are harder to ignore. Fuel Network, Double Zero, and Bubblemaps, which recently mocked American rapper Soulja Boy over his past involvement in crypto and NFT promotions, each carried billion- or near-billion-dollar valuations yet are now trading around $11 million, $373,000, and $6 million, respectively. Camp Network and TreeHouse followed a similar path, falling from $400 million valuations to around $15 million and $16 million. Privasea also stood out, dropping from $180 million to about $1 million. However, other projects have shown more modest declines. For example, Sosovalue has held up relatively well at around $152 million compared to a $200 million valuation, while Yieldbasis is trading near $34 million against a $50 million initial valuation. Meanwhile, Momentum and Bitlight sit closer to the middle, with market caps of around $43 million and $34 million after funding rounds that priced them at $100 million and $170 million. Funding Rebounds, but Caution Replaces Euphoria This valuation reset has come even with overall VC activity picking up again in 2025. Data from CryptoRank shows quarterly crypto venture investment climbing to about $10 billion in Q2 2025, the strongest level since early 2022. Additionally, funding remained elevated at nearly $8 billion in both Q3 and Q4. By contrast, funding during the bear market years fell steadily, bottoming near $689 million in Q3 2023 before stabilizing between $1 billion and $2.5 billion through most of 2024. The 2025 recovery closely tracked Bitcoin’s price climb above $126,000 mid-year before easing toward the $80,000 to $100,000 range by year-end. What stands out is not just the size of the rebound but also its timing. The largest capital deployment came during Q2 2025, when sentiment was strongest and token prices were rising quickly. Many of the projects now trading well below VC marks were funded during this window, according to CryptoRank data. For many investors, the takeaway is not that venture capital has returned, but that public markets are less willing to accept private round narratives at face value. As several analysts on X noted, the gap between VC pricing and live trading data has become a risk signal rather than a badge of confidence, reinforcing the need for sober expectations as capital flows back into crypto.

It usually starts much earlier, when the underlying infrastructure is quietly put in place. Protocols that last tend to build liquidity systems, risk controls, and usage logic long before wider attention arrives. By the time headlines follow, the foundation is already set. One new crypto appears to have just crossed that invisible line where infrastructure readiness begins to attract broader interest. Why Infrastructure Always Comes Before Price Expansion Lending protocols are not simple applications. They require careful design before real adoption can begin. Interest rate models must respond to market demand. Risk parameters must protect lenders and borrowers. Liquidation systems must work even during sharp price swings. Without these pieces, usage cannot scale safely. Because of this, price often lags progress. Early stages are spent building systems rather than attracting attention. Once those systems are in place, participation usually increases. Only after that does broader visibility arrive. This pattern has repeated across many DeFi crypto projects over the years. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Has Already Put in Place Mutuum Finance is a new cryptocurrency designed around lending and borrowing. The protocol uses a dual market structure that supports different user needs within one system. On one side, there are pooled lending markets. Users supply assets into shared pools and receive mtTokens in return. These mtTokens represent their position and grow as borrowers pay interest. This creates a simple way to earn yield without active management. On the other side, there are direct borrowing markets. Borrowers can take loans against collateral with defined Loan to Value limits. Lower risk assets support higher LTVs, while more volatile assets use tighter limits. Liquidation rules are built in to protect the protocol if collateral values fall. How Infrastructure Progress Shows Up in Participation When infrastructure is close to ready, participation usually increases quietly. This can be seen in steady growth rather than sudden spikes. Mutuum Finance has raised about $19.45M so far and has attracted more than 18,650 holders. These numbers matter because they signal engagement. A growing holder base often forms before wider market attention. Funding totals also show confidence from participants who are committing capital ahead of full utility. Rather than explosive inflows, the pace has been consistent. In many DeFi projects, this phase comes just before usage goes live and attention accelerates. Supply Positioning as Infrastructure Meets Demand Token structure also plays a role in this stage. Mutuum Finance has a total supply of 4B tokens. Of that supply, 45.5% is allocated for early distribution, which equals roughly 1.82B tokens. Around 825M tokens have already been sold. The current token price is $0.035. Since early 2025, the token has climbed about 250% from its initial stage. Phase 6 is now over 99% allocated, meaning most of the supply for this stage has already been distributed. This matters because supply often tightens once infrastructure is ready. Early stages distribute tokens widely. Later stages see fewer tokens available at the same price, just as interest begins to rise. Security as the Final Infrastructure Layer Security is often the last major checkpoint before broader adoption. For lending protocols, this step is critical. Mutuum Finance has completed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 token scan score. This helps validate the token design and basic contract structure. In addition, Halborn Security is reviewing the lending and borrowing contracts. According to official updates, the code is finalized and under formal analysis. A $50k bug bounty has also been launched to identify any remaining issues. For many serious users, these layers of review are required before participation increases. Security completion often marks the transition from development to readiness. Why Attention Is Catching Up Now With infrastructure largely in place, attention tends to follow. Mutuum Finance has announced its V1 lending and borrowing protocol for the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. Initial assets will include ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, and collateral use. Additional features are also drawing interest. The protocol runs a 24 hour leaderboard that rewards the top daily contributor with $500 in MUTM. Card payment options are available, lowering friction for new participants. As Phase 6 allocation tightens and V1 approaches, some market commentators suggest Mutuum Finance is entering the stage where attention begins to align with progress. In DeFi, this moment is often when infrastructure turns into visibility, and when a new crypto starts appearing more frequently in discussions about top crypto opportunities for long-term growth.

We saw mortgage giants behaved like meme stocks, and a standard carry trade collapsed instantly. Trump-linked crypto trades collapsed after big launches Crypto traders jumped on anything with the Trump name. Donald Trump pushed crypto hard once he retook the presidency. He placed allies in top regulatory roles and made digital coins part of his economic message. Hours before being sworn in, he launched his own memecoin and posted it online. Melania Trump followed with her own token. Later, World Liberty Financial, tied to the Trump family, released the WLFI token for public trading. In September, Eric Trump launched American Bitcoin, a crypto miner that listed via merger. Every launch started with a rally. Every single one collapsed. As of December 23, Trump’s token had lost over 80% from its peak. Melania’s dropped nearly 99%, based on CoinGecko numbers. American Bitcoin sank 80% from its September high. The excitement didn’t hold. Bitcoin itself is closing the year in the red after falling from October highs. Scion Asset Management filed paperwork on November 3 showing it held put options against Nvidia and Palantir. Michael Burry, known from The Big Short , was behind the trade. He targeted two companies at the heart of the AI-driven rally. Nvidia’s strike price was 47% under its market value. Palantir’s was 76% under. The filing only showed the portfolio as of September 30. It’s not clear if Burry still held the puts, or if it was part of a bigger plan. But AI investors had been nervous already. Burry’s move added fuel. Nvidia fell. So did Palantir. Nasdaq dropped with them. Later, they rebounded. Burry shared on X that he paid $1.84 for Palantir puts. Those contracts surged up to 101% in under three weeks. The trade put a spotlight on how much money had piled into just a few AI names. Even without full details, it rattled the tech-heavy market. Defense, gold, Korean stocks, and Japan’s bond market all broke records Trump’s choice to cut U.S. funding for Ukraine pushed European countries to act fast. Rheinmetall AG in Germany gained 150% by December. Leonardo SpA in Italy rose more than 90%. Defense stocks became hot again. Pierre Alexis Dumont, chief investment officer at Sycomore Asset Management, said, “We had taken defense out of our ESG funds until the beginning of this year. There was a change of paradigm.” Dumont said they were now investing in defensive weapons. The rally reached across industries — goggles, chemicals, even printers. A Bloomberg basket of European defense stocks jumped 70% for the year. Firms with loose ties to defense got new credit offers. Banks created “European Defence Bonds,” which were like green bonds but aimed at weapons makers. Defense spending became politically acceptable again. In October, another wave hit. The U.S. entered its longest government shutdown. Debt worries soared. Investors ran from the dollar and jumped into crypto and gold. Both hit record highs that month. The trade got nicknamed the “debasement trade.” Traders believed currencies were losing value, and they looked for shelter. But it didn’t last. Bitcoin fell again. The dollar regained ground. Treasuries turned out to be one of the year’s best performers. Gold stayed strong. Other metals like copper, aluminum, and silver jumped too, but not just from inflation fears. Trump’s tariffs and global demand shifts helped drive prices up. Gold kept climbing to new highs, even as crypto cooled off. South Korea’s stock market also broke expectations. President Lee Jae Myung had a target: get the KOSPI index to 5000. By December 22, it was up more than 70% for the year. Wall Street started to agree the goal could happen in 2026. The global AI wave brought money into Korean equities. JPMorgan and Citigroup both backed the possibility. But Korean retail investors weren’t convinced. Lee, a former retail investor himself, couldn’t win them over. They sold Korean stocks and sent $33 billion into U.S. assets. Some bought crypto. Others bought risky exchange-traded funds. That outflow weakened the won. The rally looked good on paper. But inside Korea, faith was still missing. Jim Chanos and Michael Saylor went head-to-head in a public clash. Chanos shorted Strategy Inc., a company loaded with Bitcoin. He said its value didn’t match its crypto holdings. In May, he went long on Bitcoin and short on Strategy. Saylor fired back in June on Bloomberg TV, saying, “I don’t think he understands what our business model is.” Chanos clapped back on X, calling Saylor’s comments “complete financial gibberish.” Strategy shares peaked in July with a 57% year-to-date gain. But then Bitcoin fell. New digital asset treasury firms crowded the space. Strategy dropped. From May to November 7, when Chanos said he closed the trade, shares had plunged 42%. The premium collapsed. The bet worked. Japan finally saw its “widowmaker” trade pay off. For years, traders shorted Japanese government bonds expecting yields to rise. It never worked. Until now. In 2025, Japan hiked rates. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi approved major spending. The 10-year JGB yield passed 2%. The 30-year yield reached an all-time high.

According to exclusive reporting from Chosun Biz, the potential acquisition represents a major strategic pivot for one of Asia’s largest financial conglomerates as traditional finance increasingly converges with digital asset markets. This development follows months of speculation about consolidation within South Korea’s competitive crypto exchange sector. Mirae Asset Group’s Potential Korbit Acquisition Details Mirae Asset Consulting, a non-financial affiliate of the conglomerate, reportedly leads negotiations to purchase controlling stakes in Korbit. The deal specifically targets shares held by NXC Corporation, Korbit’s largest shareholder with 60.5% ownership, and SK Planet, the second-largest shareholder controlling 31.5% of the exchange. Industry analysts estimate the transaction value between 100 billion and 140 billion won, equivalent to approximately $72.5 million to $101.4 million. This potential acquisition emerges during a period of regulatory maturation in South Korea’s cryptocurrency sector. Furthermore, the Financial Services Commission recently implemented stricter compliance requirements for digital asset exchanges. Consequently, smaller exchanges face increasing operational challenges. Meanwhile, larger players seek strategic partnerships to enhance their market positions. Strategic Implications for South Korea’s Crypto Market The potential Korbit acquisition represents more than a simple corporate transaction. Instead, it signals a broader trend of institutional adoption within digital asset markets. Mirae Asset Group manages over $600 billion in assets globally. Therefore, its entry into cryptocurrency exchange ownership could legitimize the sector for conservative investors. Additionally, traditional financial institutions increasingly recognize blockchain technology’s transformative potential. South Korea’s cryptocurrency exchange landscape currently features several dominant players: Upbit: Market leader with approximately 80% trading volume share Bithumb: Second-largest exchange facing ownership transitions Coinone: Established player with banking partnerships Korbit: Fourth-largest, known for early market entry Korbit holds particular historical significance as South Korea’s first cryptocurrency exchange, launching in 2013. Despite its pioneering status, the platform gradually lost market share to more aggressively expanding competitors. However, Korbit maintains strong compliance records and banking relationships, making it an attractive acquisition target for established financial institutions. Financial Services Convergence with Digital Assets Mirae Asset Group’s potential move into cryptocurrency exchange ownership follows similar global trends. Traditional financial institutions increasingly integrate digital asset services into their offerings. For instance, major investment banks now provide cryptocurrency custody and trading services to institutional clients. Similarly, asset managers launch blockchain-focused investment products.

Furthermore, the Minsk agreements, signed in 2014 and 2015, have faced implementation challenges despite international mediation efforts. Therefore, this new diplomatic momentum represents a potentially significant development in regional stability efforts. Historical Context of Russia-Ukraine Negotiations Understanding the current diplomatic progress requires examining the conflict’s complex history. Initially, tensions escalated following Ukraine’s 2014 Revolution of Dignity and Russia’s subsequent annexation of Crimea. Subsequently, separatist movements emerged in Donetsk and Luhansk, leading to prolonged armed conflict. International responses have included economic sanctions against Russia and diplomatic initiatives through various channels. Key Diplomatic Milestones in Ukraine Conflict Year Event Outcome 2014 Minsk Protocol Ceasefire agreement that subsequently collapsed 2015 Minsk II Agreement Comprehensive peace framework with implementation challenges 2019 Normandy Format Summit Limited progress on prisoner exchanges and disengagement 2022 Istanbul Peace Talks Initial discussions that ultimately stalled 2024 Trump-Zelenskyy Meeting Current breakthrough announcement The current diplomatic initiative builds upon these previous efforts while introducing new negotiation dynamics. Specifically, the Trump administration has pursued a distinctive approach to international conflict resolution, emphasizing bilateral discussions and pragmatic solutions. Consequently, this methodology appears to be yielding tangible progress where previous multilateral efforts encountered obstacles. Analysis of Remaining Negotiation Challenges Despite the optimistic assessment from both leaders, significant hurdles remain in the Russia-Ukraine negotiations. President Trump explicitly acknowledged “one or two difficult issues” requiring resolution before finalizing any agreement. Diplomatic analysts identify several persistent challenges: Territorial Control: Disagreements regarding the status of Crimea and Eastern Ukrainian regions Security Guarantees: Arrangements for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity Implementation Mechanisms: Verification and enforcement procedures for any agreement International Sanctions: Potential lifting of economic restrictions against Russia Humanitarian Concerns: Prisoner exchanges and civilian protection measures These complex issues have defied resolution through previous diplomatic channels. However, the current progress suggests potential flexibility from negotiating parties. Moreover, the involvement of multiple international stakeholders adds layers of complexity to the negotiation process. European Union members, NATO allies, and regional neighbors all maintain significant interests in the conflict’s resolution. Geopolitical Implications of Potential Agreement A successful Russia-Ukraine agreement would carry substantial geopolitical consequences. First, it could potentially reshape security arrangements across Eastern Europe. Second, it might influence broader relations between Russia and Western nations. Third, it could establish precedents for resolving other frozen conflicts in the post-Soviet space. Regional experts note several potential outcomes from successful negotiations: Reduction of military tensions along the contact line in Eastern Ukraine Potential normalization of Russia-Ukraine bilateral relations Possible adjustments to international sanctions regimes Changes in European energy security calculations Impact on NATO’s eastern flank security posture These developments would unfold gradually following any formal agreement. Additionally, implementation would require careful monitoring and international verification mechanisms. Consequently, while the current announcement represents significant progress, the path to sustainable peace remains complex and challenging. International Response and Verification Considerations The international community has monitored these developments with cautious interest. European leaders have emphasized the importance of Ukraine’s sovereignty in any settlement. Meanwhile, international organizations stand ready to support implementation efforts. Verification mechanisms would likely involve multiple stakeholders to ensure compliance with agreement terms. Historical precedents suggest several verification approaches: International monitoring missions along the contact line Third-party verification of military disengagement International oversight of political process implementation Multilateral mechanisms for dispute resolution These elements would form crucial components of any comprehensive agreement. Furthermore, they would help build confidence among all parties involved. Therefore, while the current announcement focuses on diplomatic progress, implementation details remain critical for long-term success. Conclusion The announcement of significant progress in Trump Russia Ukraine agreement negotiations represents a potentially transformative moment in Eastern European diplomacy. While challenges remain, the advancement toward resolution demonstrates the potential of sustained diplomatic engagement. Ultimately, the path forward requires careful navigation of complex issues, but current developments offer renewed hope for peaceful resolution to a prolonged conflict. The international community now watches closely as negotiations continue toward what could become a landmark agreement in post-Cold War European security. FAQs Q1: What specific progress did President Trump announce regarding Russia-Ukraine negotiations? President Trump stated that negotiations are getting “much closer” to an agreement following his meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, though he acknowledged one or two difficult issues remain unresolved. Q2: How does this development relate to previous diplomatic efforts in the Ukraine conflict? This announcement builds upon previous initiatives including the Minsk agreements and Normandy Format talks, potentially representing a breakthrough where earlier efforts encountered implementation challenges.

56513534,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=255204,1766961612,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Flow Blockchain Exploit Triggers Controversial $3.9M Network Rollback Decision,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/flow-blockchain-exploit-rollback-decision/,"BitcoinWorld Flow Blockchain Exploit Triggers Controversial $3.9M Network Rollback Decision The Flow blockchain, a foundational layer for major NFT ecosystems, now faces a critical governance test following a devastating $3.9 million exploit that has forced its team to propose a drastic and contentious network rollback. This security incident, which involved the illicit minting of FLOW and other major tokens, immediately cratered the asset’s price by 40% and ignited a fierce debate about protocol integrity and decentralized decision-making in the Web3 space. The proposed rollback represents a pivotal moment for the network, testing its resilience and community trust during a period of heightened scrutiny for blockchain security. Anatomy of the Flow Blockchain Exploit The security breach on the Flow network was both sophisticated and financially significant. According to on-chain analysis and subsequent reporting by The Block, an attacker successfully exploited a vulnerability to mint digital assets illegitimately. The illicitly created tokens included the network’s native FLOW token, wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), wrapped Ethereum (WETH), and several prominent stablecoins. Consequently, the immediate market reaction was severe, with the price of FLOW plummeting nearly 40% as news of the hack spread across trading platforms and social media channels. This exploit highlights a persistent challenge in the blockchain industry: the security of cross-chain asset bridges and minting mechanisms. Furthermore, the incident occurred despite Flow’s positioning as an enterprise-grade chain, having powered high-profile NFT projects like NBA Top Shot and CryptoKitties. The network’s response, a planned state rollback, aims to revert the blockchain to a point before the malicious transactions, effectively erasing the fraudulent minting activity and restoring the ledger’s integrity. The Technical and Ethical Implications of a Network Rollback A network rollback, or chain reorganization, is one of the most drastic actions a blockchain development team can undertake. This process involves convincing the majority of network validators to agree to revert the chain’s state to a previous block, thereby undoing all transactions—both legitimate and illegitimate—that occurred after that point. Proponents argue it is a necessary tool to correct catastrophic failures and protect user funds. However, critics vehemently oppose the move, labeling it a violation of blockchain’s core immutability principle. The decision by the Flow team has drawn sharp criticism from certain quarters of the crypto community. Detractors argue the move was made unilaterally without sufficient prior communication or a transparent governance vote involving FLOW token holders and network validators. This approach raises fundamental questions about the decentralization of the Flow network and contrasts with the community-driven response mechanisms seen in other decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) following similar incidents. Immutability vs. Pragmatism: The rollback challenges the sacrosanct blockchain tenet of immutability for the pragmatic goal of user protection. Governance Transparency: The perceived lack of community consultation has sparked debate over who truly controls the network’s direction. Precedent Setting: This action sets a precedent for how Layer 1 chains may handle future critical exploits. Expert Analysis on Blockchain Security and Response Protocols Industry analysts and security experts consistently emphasize that a protocol’s response to an exploit is as critical as its preventative measures. A historical review of major hacks, such as the 2016 DAO attack on Ethereum that led to a hard fork and the creation of Ethereum Classic, provides crucial context. Similarly, the Poly Network hack in 2021 was resolved through cooperation and without a rollback, showcasing a different model. The Flow situation sits between these historical examples, forcing a re-examination of crisis response frameworks. Data from blockchain security firms like CertiK and Chainalysis indicates that total value lost to exploits and hacks exceeded $3.8 billion in 2024, making robust response plans essential. The speed and transparency of the Flow team’s communication following the exploit detection will be a key factor in market recovery. Moreover, the technical execution of the rollback itself carries risk; a poorly coordinated update could lead to chain splits or further instability, potentially exacerbating the initial damage. Market Impact and the Road to Recovery for FLOW The immediate 40% drop in FLOW’s price reflects a classic market response to a security failure, combining panic selling with a reassessment of the network’s risk profile. Market recovery will depend on several interconnected factors beyond the technical success of the rollback. Firstly, the team must provide a comprehensive post-mortem report detailing the root cause of the exploit and the specific patches implemented to prevent recurrence. Secondly, they must rebuild trust through improved governance processes, potentially incorporating more formalized community voting for future critical decisions. The long-term impact on Flow’s ecosystem, particularly its NFT projects and developer community, remains uncertain. While a successful recovery could demonstrate the network’s resilience, the controversy may push some projects to consider multi-chain strategies or alternative Layer 1 solutions. The event serves as a stark reminder to all blockchain participants about the importance of security audits, decentralized governance, and having clear, pre-established protocols for handling catastrophic events. Comparison of Major Blockchain Exploit Responses Blockchain/Protocol Year Value Lost Primary Response Outcome Ethereum (The DAO) 2016 $60M Contentious Hard Fork Chain Split (ETH/ETC) Poly Network 2021 $611M Negotiation & Asset Return Full Recovery Flow Network 2025 $3.9M Proposed Network Rollback Pending Conclusion The $3.9 million Flow blockchain exploit and the subsequent decision to execute a network rollback have created a defining moment for the NFT-focused network. This incident transcends a simple security failure, evolving into a complex test of governance, philosophy, and technical crisis management. The ultimate success of the rollback and the network’s ability to regain community trust will hinge on transparent communication, flawless execution, and a renewed commitment to decentralized decision-making. The broader cryptocurrency industry will watch closely, as the outcome will undoubtedly influence future protocols for handling similar catastrophic events on Layer 1 blockchains. FAQs Q1: What is a blockchain network rollback? A network rollback, or chain reorganization, is a process where network validators agree to revert the blockchain’s transaction history to a previous state. This action effectively erases all transactions, both good and bad, that occurred after the chosen block, and it is typically considered a last-resort measure to correct a major exploit or catastrophic bug. Q2: Why is the Flow rollback decision controversial? The decision is controversial because it challenges the fundamental blockchain principle of immutability—the idea that recorded transactions cannot be altered. Critics also argue the Flow team made the decision unilaterally without a transparent, community-driven governance process, raising concerns about the network’s decentralization. Q3: How did the attacker steal $3.9 million on the Flow blockchain? The attacker exploited a vulnerability that allowed for the illicit minting, or creation, of tokens. The malicious actor minted the network’s native FLOW token, along with wrapped versions of Bitcoin (WBTC) and Ethereum (WETH), and several stablecoins, which were then presumably swapped or moved off-chain to realize the $3.9 million value. Q4: What impact did the exploit have on the FLOW token price? Following the news of the exploit, the price of the FLOW token fell by approximately 40%. This is a common market reaction to a major security incident, reflecting panic selling and a rapid reassessment of the network’s security and stability by investors and traders. Q5: What are the risks associated with executing a network rollback? The primary risks include technical failure during the update, which could cause further chain instability or even a permanent chain split if not all validators agree. There is also significant reputational risk, as the action can damage trust in the network’s immutability and deter future developers and users who prioritize censorship-resistant and unchangeable ledgers.

56513943,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=255207,1766962511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,WLFI Token Governance Unveils Bold Plan to Expand USD1 Stablecoin Reach,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/wlfi-token-usd1-stablecoin-expansion/,"BitcoinWorld WLFI Token Governance Unveils Bold Plan to Expand USD1 Stablecoin Reach In a significant move for its ecosystem, World Liberty Financial (WLFI) has unveiled a pivotal governance proposal to allocate a portion of its token supply, aiming to dramatically expand the utility and adoption of its native USD1 stablecoin. This strategic initiative, reported by BeInCrypto and subject to a community vote ending January 4, represents a calculated effort to secure vital partnerships within the competitive cryptocurrency sector. The proposal currently garners a 53.22% approval rate, highlighting active stakeholder engagement. This development arrives at a critical juncture for digital assets, where stablecoin utility and real-world integration increasingly dictate project longevity and market trust. WLFI Token Proposal Aims for Strategic USD1 Stablecoin Growth The core of the World Liberty Financial governance proposal involves dedicating less than 5% of the project’s unlocked token supply to a targeted incentive program. Consequently, this fund seeks to onboard key partners, including decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, payment gateways, and merchant services. The primary objective is to integrate the USD1 stablecoin into a wider array of financial applications. Therefore, this strategy mirrors broader industry trends where projects use treasury assets to bootstrap ecosystem growth and enhance token utility. Governance mechanisms, like the one WLFI employs, have become standard practice for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and token-based projects. These systems empower token holders to steer project development and treasury allocation. For instance, similar proposals have historically driven adoption for platforms like Uniswap and Aave. The WLFI vote underscores a mature approach to decentralized decision-making, where community consensus directly influences strategic financial planning. Analyzing the Stablecoin Landscape and Partnership Imperative The stablecoin market remains fiercely contested, dominated by giants like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). For newer entrants like USD1, differentiation through unique utility and robust partnerships is not optional; it is essential for survival. A successful partnership strategy can unlock several critical use cases: DeFi Integration: Serving as a collateral asset or trading pair on lending and borrowing platforms. Cross-Border Payments: Enabling faster, cheaper remittances and business transactions. Merchant Adoption: Allowing e-commerce and physical stores to accept crypto payments with minimal volatility risk. Gaming & Metaverse: Functioning as an in-game currency or medium of exchange within virtual economies. Allocating tokens to incentivize such integrations is a proven growth tactic. However, the specific structure of WLFI’s incentive program—its vesting schedules, partner eligibility, and success metrics—will be crucial for its long-term effectiveness and value retention. Expert Perspective on Treasury Management and Tokenomics Financial analysts observing the crypto space often emphasize the delicate balance required in treasury management. “Allocating a small, single-digit percentage of the supply for growth is a measured, low-risk tactic,” notes a blockchain economist familiar with such proposals. “The key is ensuring the incentives create sustainable, fee-generating utility for the stablecoin, not just temporary volume. Projects must demonstrate a clear return on investment for the treasury to maintain holder confidence.” This perspective highlights that the market will scrutinize not just the vote’s outcome, but the subsequent execution and tangible results from any secured partnerships. The Governance Process and Current Voting Dynamics The ongoing vote, set to conclude on January 4, presents a live case study in decentralized governance. With a 53.22% approval rate, the proposal shows initial support but also reveals a notable faction of opposition or undecided voters. This dynamic is common in governance, where stakeholders weigh immediate token dilution against potential long-term value accretion. The voting mechanism itself, typically conducted on-chain via smart contracts, ensures transparency and immutability for all decisions. For context, the proposal’s structure aligns with 2025’s best practices for responsible crypto-economics. Limiting the allocation to under 5% mitigates sell-pressure concerns while providing a meaningful war chest for bounties, grants, or liquidity mining rewards. Successful execution could enhance the WLFI token’s fundamental value proposition by tying its success directly to the expanding use and demand for the USD1 stablecoin. Broader Implications for the Crypto Ecosystem This development extends beyond a single project’s roadmap. It reflects the maturation of the cryptocurrency industry, where systematic, community-driven planning replaces speculative hype. Furthermore, the focus on stablecoin utility addresses a core demand from regulators and traditional finance: demonstrating clear, compliant use cases for digital assets. As stablecoins become more embedded in global finance, projects that successfully navigate partnership landscapes may gain significant first-mover advantages in niche markets. The proposal also touches on the evolving narrative around assets linked to public figures. While the Trump family association brings attention, the market’s ultimate judgment will rely on the project’s technical merit, financial performance, and regulatory standing. Therefore, the success of the USD1 expansion plan could serve as a benchmark for other ventures seeking to leverage brand recognition with substantive product development. Conclusion The WLFI governance proposal to allocate under 5% of tokens for USD1 stablecoin expansion represents a strategic and calculated step toward enhancing real-world utility. By focusing on securing vital cryptocurrency sector partnerships, World Liberty Financial aims to transition its stablecoin from a mere digital asset to a functional tool within decentralized and traditional finance. The January 4 vote deadline and current 53.22% approval rate underscore the active role of token holders in shaping this future. Ultimately, the initiative’s success will hinge on executing high-value partnerships that generate sustainable demand, thereby validating the community’s decision and strengthening the entire WLFI ecosystem’s position in the competitive 2025 market. FAQs Q1: What is the WLFI governance proposal about? The proposal seeks community approval to use less than 5% of the unlocked WLFI token supply to fund an incentive program. This program aims to secure partnerships that will increase the use cases and adoption of the project’s native USD1 stablecoin. Q2: When does the vote on this proposal end? The governance vote is scheduled to conclude on January 4. Token holders can cast their votes until that date to determine the proposal’s fate. Q3: What is the current approval rate for the proposal? As reported, the proposal currently holds an approval rate of 53.22%, indicating majority support but not an overwhelming consensus. Q4: Why is expanding stablecoin use cases important for a project like WLFI? Stablecoin utility drives demand and liquidity. More use cases—like DeFi integration, payments, and merchant adoption—make the USD1 stablecoin more valuable and resilient, which can positively impact the entire WLFI ecosystem and token value. Q5: How does allocating tokens for partnerships work as a growth strategy? The tokens can be used as incentives or grants to entice other platforms (like exchanges, wallets, or payment processors) to integrate the USD1 stablecoin. This is a common method to bootstrap ecosystem growth without large upfront capital expenditure.

The protocol’s development arm, Hyperliquid Labs, will unstake and distribute 1.2 million HYPE tokens to its core team starting January 6, 2026. This planned distribution represents a strategic shift in the project’s tokenomics and team incentive structure. Furthermore, the announcement established a recurring monthly schedule for subsequent distributions, signaling a long-term commitment to team alignment and project development. Hyperliquid’s HYPE Token Distribution: Details and Mechanics The announcement provides clear specifics about the upcoming token movement. Hyperliquid Labs will initiate the process by unstaking exactly 1.2 million HYPE tokens from its treasury. Subsequently, the team will distribute these tokens directly to contributors on the specified date. Importantly, the co-founder confirmed this would not be a one-time event. Consequently, following the initial January 2026 distribution, additional allocations will occur on the 6th day of each subsequent month. This structured approach provides predictable liquidity for team members while maintaining a controlled release schedule. Token distribution events often influence market dynamics and investor perception. Therefore, understanding the context of Hyperliquid’s total supply is crucial. The 1.2 million HYPE figure represents a specific portion of the project’s overall tokenomics. For comparison, many DeFi protocols implement similar vesting schedules to ensure team members remain incentivized over the long term. The table below outlines key metrics for context: Metric Detail Tokens to Distribute 1,200,000 HYPE Initial Distribution Date January 6, 2026 Recurrence Monthly, on the 6th Announcement Platform Official Hyperliquid Discord Announcing Entity Co-founder iliensinc Understanding the Broader Tokenomics and Market Context Hyperliquid operates as a native decentralized exchange (DEX) and perpetual futures platform on its own Layer 1 blockchain. The HYPE token serves multiple functions within this ecosystem. Primarily, it facilitates governance, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes. Additionally, the token is staked to secure the network and earn rewards from trading fees. This planned distribution from the Labs treasury directly impacts the circulating supply and stakeholder alignment. Protocols commonly allocate a portion of their total token supply to founders, developers, and early employees. These allocations typically vest over several years to align long-term interests. The Hyperliquid announcement fits this established industry pattern. However, the transparency of announcing the schedule over a year in advance is noteworthy. This advance notice allows the market to process the information and reduces potential surprises that could cause volatility. Expert Analysis: Incentive Structures and Protocol Health From a governance and operational perspective, structured team distributions are generally viewed as a positive signal. They indicate a project is transitioning from early-stage development to a more mature operational phase. When core contributors receive tokens tied to a multi-year schedule, their incentives directly align with the protocol’s sustained success and token appreciation. This reduces the risk of early team departures and promotes continued innovation. Historically, projects that manage their treasury and team distributions transparently tend to build stronger community trust. The Hyperliquid announcement provides a clear timeline, enabling analysts and holders to model future supply dynamics. Moreover, the decision to unstake tokens before distribution is technically significant. Unstaking usually involves a cooldown or unbonding period, confirming the team planned this move well ahead of time. This foresight demonstrates professional treasury management. Potential Impacts on the Hyperliquid Ecosystem The distribution of 1.2 million HYPE tokens will introduce new liquidity into the market. Team members receiving tokens may choose to hold, stake, or sell a portion, depending on their personal financial strategies. Market analysts often monitor such events for changes in exchange balances and staking contract activity. A gradual, monthly distribution, as opposed to a single large dump, helps mitigate selling pressure and allows the market to absorb liquidity more smoothly. For the Hyperliquid protocol itself, a motivated and properly incentivized team is critical. The platform competes in the high-stakes arena of decentralized perpetual futures trading. Key areas requiring ongoing development include: User Experience (UX): Simplifying complex trading interactions. Liquidity Depth: Ensuring tight spreads and minimal slippage. New Product Features: Launching innovative trading instruments. Cross-Chain Integration: Expanding asset accessibility. Resources from a vested team can accelerate progress in these competitive fronts. Therefore, the distribution supports the protocol’s roadmap execution. Conclusion The announcement by Hyperliquid co-founder iliensinc regarding the 1.2 million HYPE token distribution outlines a clear, long-term plan for team incentives. Scheduled to begin in January 2026 with monthly follow-ups, this move aligns with best practices for transparent treasury management in decentralized finance. It signals the project’s maturation and aims to secure the continued dedication of its development team. As with any token unlock, the market will observe its integration, but the structured, pre-announced approach provides stability and foresight for all Hyperliquid stakeholders.

According to live spot market data, the white metal is currently trading at $82.4, marking a significant 3.94% surge from the prior session’s close. This remarkable move, occurring in early 2025, underscores a profound and complex realignment within the global commodity and monetary landscape, driven by converging industrial, monetary, and geopolitical currents. Silver Price Breakthrough: Analyzing the Record High The ascent of the silver price to unprecedented levels is not an isolated event. Consequently, analysts point to a powerful confluence of fundamental drivers. Primarily, relentless industrial demand forms a critical bedrock for this rally. Silver is an indispensable component in photovoltaic panels for solar energy, electric vehicles, and 5G infrastructure. Therefore, the global push for electrification and green technology directly translates into sustained physical consumption. Simultaneously, monetary policy expectations continue to play a pivotal role. Market participants often view precious metals like silver as a hedge against currency debasement and inflation, especially during periods of fiscal uncertainty or anticipated shifts in interest rate cycles. Furthermore, supply-side constraints have exacerbated the bullish momentum. Mining output has faced challenges, including declining ore grades and elevated operational costs. Additionally, investment demand through physical bullion and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has provided consistent support. The table below illustrates key price milestones leading to this event: Period Approx. Silver Price (USD/oz) Key Market Context 2011 High ~$49 Post-financial crisis safe-haven rally. 2020 Low ~$12 COVID-19 pandemic liquidity crunch. 2023-2024 Range $22 – $32 Period of consolidation amid rate hikes. Early 2025 Breaks $80 Convergence of industrial, monetary, and investment demand. Context and Drivers Behind the Precious Metals Surge To fully comprehend this surge, one must examine the broader precious metals complex. Gold, often considered the primary monetary metal, has also been trending strongly. However, silver’s price action frequently exhibits higher volatility, leading to a dynamic gold-to-silver ratio. This ratio, which measures how many ounces of silver it takes to buy one ounce of gold, has compressed significantly during this rally. Historically, a lower ratio suggests market confidence in industrial growth and risk appetite, alongside monetary hedging. The current move validates silver’s unique dual identity as both a monetary and an industrial asset. Market structure has also facilitated this rise. Trading volumes across major commodity exchanges like the COMEX have been robust, indicating deep institutional participation. Moreover, warehouse stock levels for registered silver have drawn attention, with some analysts highlighting a trend of withdrawals. This physical tightness in deliverable supply, against a backdrop of strong demand, creates a potent bullish scenario. Central bank policies globally, particularly regarding reserve diversification and digital currency frameworks, have indirectly bolstered the case for tangible asset ownership among both sovereign and private investors. Expert Analysis on Sustainability and Future Trajectory Financial analysts and commodity strategists emphasize the role of macroeconomic indicators. For instance, real interest rates—nominal rates adjusted for inflation—remain a crucial metric. A persistently negative or low real yield environment diminishes the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like silver. Concurrently, currency fluctuations, particularly in the US Dollar Index (DXY), provide immediate directional cues for dollar-denominated commodities. Geopolitical tensions continue to inject a premium into safe-haven assets, with silver benefiting from its affordability and high liquidity relative to other stores of value. Looking forward, the sustainability of these price levels hinges on several verifiable factors. First, the trajectory of global manufacturing PMI data will signal the strength of industrial demand. Second, clear guidance from major central banks on the path of quantitative tightening or easing will influence capital flows. Third, technological adoption rates in green energy sectors offer a long-term demand projection. Market technicians also monitor key support and resistance levels, with the breach of $80 now establishing a new technical floor. The consensus among experts suggests that while short-term volatility is inevitable, the structural drivers for silver appear firmly entrenched for the medium term. Conclusion The breach of the $80 level represents a watershed moment for the silver price and the broader commodity universe. This record high reflects a complex interplay of tangible industrial need, strategic monetary hedging, and evolving investment paradigms. As markets digest this move, the focus will shift to the durability of demand and the response from the physical supply chain. This event underscores silver’s critical role in both the modern technological economy and the age-old search for prudent value preservation. The new all-time high is therefore more than a number; it is a signal of deeper economic and financial transitions unfolding in 2025. FAQs Q1: What is the difference between the spot silver price and futures price? The spot price refers to the current market price for immediate purchase and delivery of physical silver. Futures prices are set for delivery at a specific future date on an exchange like COMEX, reflecting expectations and carrying costs. Q2: How does silver’s performance compare to gold during this rally? Silver has significantly outperformed gold in percentage terms during this surge, a typical pattern in strong precious metals bull markets due to silver’s higher volatility and sensitivity to economic growth expectations. Q3: What are the primary industrial uses driving silver demand? Key uses include photovoltaic cells in solar panels, electrical contacts in electronics, automotive applications in EVs, brazing and soldering alloys, and medical devices due to its antimicrobial properties. Q4: Can individual investors easily gain exposure to the silver price? Yes, common methods include purchasing physical bullion (coins or bars), shares of silver mining companies, Silver ETFs (like SLV), or futures and options contracts through a brokerage account. Q5: What historical factors preceded previous major silver price peaks? Past peaks, like in 1980 and 2011, were often associated with high inflation, geopolitical crises, market speculation, and, in 1980, direct attempts to corner the physical market by large investors.

This collaboration, announced in Seoul, South Korea, on November 15, 2024, signals a significant step toward integrating regulated stablecoins with mainstream merchant transactions. The initiative specifically aims to bridge the gap between traditional card networks and blockchain-based digital assets. USDC Payments in South Korea: The Strategic Partnership BC Card, South Korea’s largest payment processor, and Coinbase, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, have formalized their collaboration through a memorandum of understanding (MOU). Consequently, the two companies plan to conduct a joint proof-of-concept project. This project will integrate BC Card’s established QR payment infrastructure with a digital wallet built on Coinbase’s Base network, an Ethereum layer-2 solution. Therefore, the technical integration seeks to enable customers holding the USDC stablecoin to make seamless payments at domestic merchants. This partnership represents a cautious yet progressive approach by a major Korean financial player toward cryptocurrency utility. The announcement, first reported by EBN Industrial News, follows increased regulatory discussions in South Korea about digital asset frameworks. Moreover, the partnership leverages the strengths of both entities. BC Card brings its vast merchant network and payment rails, while Coinbase contributes its blockchain expertise and the stability of USDC, a fully reserved digital dollar. The project will test real-world transaction flows, settlement speeds, and user experience. Subsequently, successful testing could pave the way for a broader commercial rollout, offering consumers a new, dollar-pegged payment option alongside the Korean won. Technical Integration and the QR Payment Solution The core of this initiative involves merging two distinct technological systems. BC Card’s QR payment solution is a widely adopted standard in South Korea, used by millions for everyday purchases. Conversely, the Base network provides a scalable, low-cost environment for blockchain transactions. The proof-of-concept will create a bridge allowing a USDC transaction on Base to be captured and processed through BC Card’s system at the point of sale. This technical workflow presents several key challenges and innovations. Transaction Finality: The system must ensure near-instant confirmation for merchant approval, a requirement for retail environments. Regulatory Compliance: All transactions must adhere to South Korea’s strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Travel Rule regulations. Forex Stability: Using USDC provides a hedge against local currency volatility for both merchants and consumers in cross-border contexts. User Experience: The process must be as simple as scanning a QR code, hiding the underlying blockchain complexity. Industry experts view this model as a potential blueprint. “This partnership tests a hybrid model where the trust and scale of a traditional card network meets the efficiency and programmability of a public blockchain,” noted a fintech analyst from the Korea Institute of Finance. The focus on QR codes is strategic, as they represent a low-cost entry point for merchants compared to new hardware terminals. The Broader Context of Stablecoin Adoption in Asia This development does not occur in isolation. Across Asia, financial institutions and governments are actively exploring stablecoins for payments and settlements. For instance, Japan has launched pilot programs for a digital yen, while Singapore has established clear regulatory guidelines for stablecoin issuers. South Korea’s approach, exemplified by the BC Card-Coinbase project, appears more partnership-driven, leveraging private sector innovation within a regulated framework. The timeline for such projects is critical. Comparative Stablecoin Payment Initiatives in Asia (2024) Country Key Players Asset Stage South Korea BC Card, Coinbase USDC Proof-of-Concept Japan Bank of Japan, Private Banks Digital Yen (CBDC) Pilot Testing Singapore Monetary Authority of Singapore Regulated Stablecoins Licensing Framework Live Hong Kong Multiple Licensed Exchanges USDC, USDT, others Retail Pilot Programs The success of this South Korean project could influence regional strategies. It demonstrates a use case focused on consumer payments rather than solely wholesale banking. Furthermore, it utilizes an existing, widely recognized stablecoin (USDC) instead of waiting for a national central bank digital currency (CBDC). This pragmatic approach could accelerate real-world adoption if regulatory hurdles are cleared. Potential Impacts on Consumers and Merchants The introduction of USDC payments via BC Card’s network carries implications for both sides of the transaction. For consumers, it offers an alternative digital payment method that is potentially faster for international remittances and provides exposure to a dollar-denominated asset. For merchants, especially those engaged in e-commerce or tourism, it opens a new channel for customer payments without direct exposure to more volatile cryptocurrencies. However, adoption depends on clear value propositions. Key considerations include transaction cost savings compared to traditional card network fees, settlement speed improvements, and access to a global customer base. The proof-of-concept will need to quantify these benefits. Additionally, education will be vital. Both consumers and merchants must understand the nature of USDC as a regulated digital dollar, distinct from unbacked crypto assets. BC Card’s trusted brand in Korea could play a crucial role in fostering this understanding and ensuring a smooth user experience that prioritizes security and simplicity. Conclusion The partnership between BC Card and Coinbase to test USDC payments in South Korea marks a pivotal experiment at the intersection of traditional finance and digital assets. By leveraging QR codes and the Base network, the project aims to prove the feasibility of stablecoin transactions in everyday commerce. This initiative reflects a growing global trend of integrating blockchain technology into established payment systems. Ultimately, its success could serve as a model for other nations, demonstrating how regulated stablecoins like USDC can enhance payment efficiency, consumer choice, and financial innovation within a secure and compliant framework. FAQs Q1: What is the goal of the BC Card and Coinbase partnership? The primary goal is to conduct a proof-of-concept project testing the integration of USDC stablecoin payments into South Korea’s existing retail payment infrastructure using BC Card’s QR system and a wallet on the Base network. Q2: How would a customer use USDC to pay at a store? In the proposed system, a customer would likely use a compatible digital wallet to scan a merchant’s QR code, authorize a USDC payment from their wallet on the Base network, and complete the transaction, with BC Card facilitating the settlement. Q3: Why use USDC instead of the Korean won? USDC offers stability as it is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. This can be advantageous for international transactions, remittances, or as a hedge against local currency volatility for merchants dealing in global trade. Q4: Is this project officially approved by South Korean regulators? The project is currently a proof-of-concept under an MOU. Its full commercial launch would require further review and compliance with South Korea’s evolving digital asset regulations, including the Virtual Asset User Protection Act. Q5: What is the Base network? Base is an Ethereum layer-2 blockchain developed by Coinbase. It is designed to be a secure, low-cost, and developer-friendly platform for building decentralized applications, making it suitable for scaling payment transactions.

According to a leading analyst, the flagship cryptocurrency must rally approximately 6.24% above its yearly open, around $93,374, to end 2025 higher than it began. Nic Puckrin, CEO of a crypto analytics firm tracking BTC price action, says that a 6.24 % rally is needed for Bitcoin to finish the year higher than it began. Otherwise, it will mark the first down year following a halving event since the protocol’s supply cut cycles became market drivers. As of late December, Bitcoin is trading in the mid-to-high $80,000s , roughly $87,000- $90,000, and has struggled to build sustained upside in thin year-end markets. *]:pointer-events-auto [content-visibility:auto] supports-[content-visibility:auto]:[contain-intrinsic-size:auto_100lvh] scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""707fe84f-4e67-483b-8a74-00c2010f5793"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-2"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> Puckrin’s comments come as Glassnode lead analyst James Check says Bitcoin can continue its momentum without a pullback in gold or silver. According to a Sunday X post, James noted that gold and silver do not need to slow down for Bitcoin to perform well, and added that those who think otherwise may not fully understand these assets. Recent analysis suggests that Bitcoin’s value relative to gold could decline by as much as 50%. BTC currently trades at around 20 times the value of gold. However, Senior Commodity Strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, Mike McGlone, believes it’s more probable for it to fall to 10 times the value of gold than rise to 30 times by 2026. He believes the token’s value compared to gold might be cut in half, even if its price in USD appears steady. Bitcoin plummets 30% from October peak Bitcoin reached an all-time high of over $125,000 in October, just days before a historic market crash put a dent in Bitcoin’s rally and caused a decline in crypto prices across the board. Since hitting its all-time high, BTC price has plunged by roughly 30% and found a local bottom near $80,000 in November. That has led analysts to analyze whether Bitcoin’s bull rally is a thing of the past and whether a new bear market has begun. Meanwhile, 2025 volatility metrics indicate elevated moves and declining speculative interest. Bitcoin trading analysts note that trading is currently below crucial longer-term technical levels, such as the 365-day moving average, a move that many analysts view as a signal of weakening structural price support. Market analysts are divided on whether a recovery will occur or if the decline will persist into the new year, often focusing on macroeconomic and liquidity factors affecting the leading cryptocurrency’s price. Bitcoin has been trading well under its 365-day moving average, a critical support level, since November, breaking the structural uptrend that began two years back. Fed’s rate cuts lift crypto sentiment Lower interest rates are positive price catalysts for risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies, which tend to rally with fresh liquidity injections. In 2025, the Federal Reserve issued three 25-basis-point (BPS) interest rate cuts, but Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell provided mixed forward guidance at the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) December meeting. “There is no risk-free path for policy,” Powell said, casting doubt about another interest rate cut at the next FOMC meeting in January. According to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group’s FedWatch tool, just 18.8% of investors expect an interest rate cut in January. With just a few trading days remaining in 2025, the spotlight is on whether Bitcoin’s price can generate a last‑minute rally. A successful ~6.24% increase could allow BTC to buck the broader trend and close the year positively, preserving a psychological and technical milestone for market participants.

The convergence of Federal Reserve communications, employment data, and manufacturing indicators creates a pivotal moment for economic assessment and strategic planning. Understanding these scheduled releases provides essential context for interpreting market movements and anticipating future trends. Financial Events Calendar: A Detailed Breakdown The upcoming week features several significant economic releases that typically influence market sentiment and trading decisions. These scheduled announcements represent key data points that financial professionals monitor closely for insights into economic health and policy direction. Market participants globally will analyze these figures to adjust their positions and expectations accordingly. First, the Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes release on December 30 at 7:00 p.m. UTC offers detailed insights into the central bank’s December policy discussions. These minutes typically reveal the depth of debate among voting members, providing context beyond the official policy statement. Analysts will scrutinize language regarding inflation expectations, employment assessments, and future rate guidance. Subsequently, U.S. initial jobless claims data on December 31 at 1:30 p.m. UTC provides a timely snapshot of labor market conditions. This weekly indicator serves as an important gauge of employment stability and economic momentum. Recent trends in claims data have influenced market expectations regarding Federal Reserve policy adjustments. Market Closures and Global Implications Major stock markets worldwide will observe closures on January 1 for New Year’s Day, creating a temporary pause in trading activity. This annual closure affects liquidity and trading volumes in the surrounding sessions. International investors must account for these schedule variations when planning their portfolio adjustments and risk management strategies. Following the holiday, attention shifts to manufacturing data with the U.S. December Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index release on January 2 at 2:45 p.m. UTC. This forward-looking indicator measures business conditions in the manufacturing sector, providing early signals about economic expansion or contraction. The PMI figure influences currency markets, bond yields, and equity sector performance. Expert Analysis: Interpreting the Data Flow Financial analysts emphasize the interconnected nature of this week’s releases. The FOMC minutes provide policy context, while jobless claims and PMI data offer real-time economic feedback. Historically, markets have shown increased volatility during periods combining multiple high-impact releases. Seasoned investors recommend reviewing historical patterns and consensus expectations before these announcements. According to standard economic analysis frameworks, consistent trends across multiple indicators carry more weight than isolated data points. The relationship between employment data, manufacturing activity, and monetary policy signals creates a comprehensive picture of economic conditions. Professional traders often use this information to adjust their risk exposure and portfolio allocations. Historical Context and Market Reactions Previous releases of similar data have demonstrated measurable impacts across asset classes. FOMC minutes have frequently triggered Treasury yield movements averaging 5-10 basis points on release days. Jobless claims surprises exceeding 20,000 claims have correlated with S&P 500 movements of 0.5-1.2% in recent quarters. Manufacturing PMI deviations from consensus expectations have influenced dollar index fluctuations of 0.3-0.8%. These historical patterns inform current market positioning and volatility expectations. Options markets typically price in elevated implied volatility around these scheduled events. The sequential nature of this week’s releases creates a cumulative effect that can amplify market responses, particularly when data points reinforce similar economic narratives. Strategic Considerations for Market Participants Investment professionals recommend several approaches for navigating this data-rich period. First, reviewing positioning ahead of releases helps manage unexpected volatility. Second, distinguishing between immediate reactions and sustained trends prevents overreaction to temporary movements. Third, considering the global context ensures proper interpretation of domestic data within worldwide economic conditions. Portfolio managers often adjust their exposure to interest-rate-sensitive sectors around FOMC communications. Similarly, manufacturing data influences allocations toward cyclical versus defensive equities. Employment figures affect expectations for consumer spending and related sectors. These strategic adjustments reflect the fundamental importance of scheduled economic data in investment decision-making. Technical Factors and Trading Dynamics Year-end trading conditions introduce additional considerations beyond fundamental data analysis. Reduced liquidity during holiday periods can amplify price movements following economic releases. Position squaring by institutional investors creates unique volatility patterns. Understanding these technical factors helps distinguish between data-driven moves and seasonal trading dynamics. The transition to a new calendar year also brings portfolio rebalancing flows that interact with economic data reactions. Tax-related trading and benchmark adjustments create crosscurrents that sophisticated market participants monitor closely. These technical factors combine with fundamental data to create the complete market environment for this week’s financial events. Conclusion This week’s financial events calendar presents multiple high-impact releases that collectively shape market sentiment and economic outlooks. The FOMC minutes provide crucial policy insights, while jobless claims and manufacturing data offer real-time economic feedback. Market participants who understand these interconnected indicators can make more informed decisions amid evolving conditions. Proper analysis of these scheduled events remains essential for navigating financial markets successfully. FAQs Q1: Why are FOMC meeting minutes important for financial markets? The minutes provide detailed insights into Federal Reserve policy discussions, revealing member debates and thinking that influence future interest rate decisions and economic projections. Q2: How do initial jobless claims affect market expectations? Jobless claims data offers a weekly snapshot of labor market health, influencing predictions about consumer spending, economic growth, and potential Federal Reserve policy adjustments. Q3: What does the Manufacturing PMI indicate about the economy? The Purchasing Managers’ Index measures manufacturing sector activity, serving as a forward-looking indicator of economic expansion or contraction that influences various asset classes. Q4: How do market closures affect trading around economic data releases? Reduced liquidity during holiday periods can amplify price movements following data releases, requiring adjusted position sizing and risk management approaches. Q5: What strategies help investors navigate multiple economic releases in one week? Reviewing historical patterns, distinguishing between immediate reactions and sustained trends, and considering the global context helps investors interpret sequential data releases effectively.

56516680,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=255221,1766968211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Stagnates at 24, Revealing Persistent Market Anxiety",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fear-greed-index-extreme-fear-31/,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index Stagnates at 24, Revealing Persistent Market Anxiety Global cryptocurrency markets continue to exhibit profound caution as the widely monitored Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains firmly entrenched at 24, a level that unequivocally signals extreme fear among investors. This stagnation, reported by sentiment analytics firm Alternative on April 10, 2025, marks a continuation of the risk-averse environment that has characterized recent trading sessions. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing the underlying metrics to gauge potential future market directions. The index’s persistence in this zone often precedes significant volatility, making its current reading a critical focal point for traders and long-term holders alike. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 24 The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial barometer for digital asset sentiment. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents maximum fear and 100 signifies extreme greed. A reading of 24, therefore, places the market deep within the “Extreme Fear” territory, a zone historically associated with potential buying opportunities for contrarian investors. The index’s calculation is not arbitrary; it synthesizes data from six distinct market dimensions to provide a composite score. This methodology ensures a holistic view of investor psychology beyond simple price action. Specifically, the index weights its components as follows: market volatility and current trading volume each contribute 25% to the final score. Social media sentiment and survey data each account for 15%. Finally, Bitcoin’s dominance share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization and relevant Google search trends each provide the remaining 10%. This multi-factor approach helps mitigate the noise from any single data source. The unchanged score of 24 suggests a equilibrium of negative forces across these metrics, indicating a consistent, widespread caution rather than a fleeting reaction. The Mechanics Behind Market Sentiment Understanding each component reveals why the index remains stagnant. High volatility, a key fear driver, often reflects uncertainty and large price swings. Similarly, unusual trading volume can indicate panic selling or accumulation. Social media analysis scans platforms like X and Reddit for bullish or bearish conversation trends. Surveys provide direct insight from retail and institutional investors. Bitcoin’s market dominance rising can signal a “flight to safety” within crypto, while specific search volume spikes often correlate with FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) or FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt). The current data blend points to a market in a holding pattern, awaiting a definitive catalyst. Historical Context and Comparative Analysis Placing the current reading of 24 into a historical framework offers valuable perspective. For instance, during the bull market peaks of late 2021, the index frequently registered above 75, even hitting 90+ levels indicative of “Extreme Greed.” Conversely, following major market downturns like the LUNA collapse in 2022 or the FTX bankruptcy, the index plunged to single digits, reflecting utter panic. The current level, while low, is not at an absolute historical bottom. This suggests the market is experiencing severe anxiety but not the total capitulation seen in past crises. A comparative table illustrates key sentiment milestones: Index Value Sentiment Zone Typical Market Phase 0-24 Extreme Fear Potential accumulation zone, high risk aversion 25-49 Fear Caution, corrective price action 50 Neutral Balance between fear and greed 51-74 Greed Growing optimism, bullish trends 75-100 Extreme Greed Market euphoria, high risk of correction Furthermore, extended periods in “Extreme Fear” have often foreshadowed significant market rebounds, as noted in analyses by firms like Glassnode and CoinMetrics. However, this is not a guaranteed timing tool. The duration of the current fear phase will depend heavily on macroeconomic factors including interest rate policies, regulatory developments, and institutional adoption flows. Real-World Implications for Investors in 2025 The persistent extreme fear reading carries tangible consequences for market participants. For retail investors, it often creates a psychological barrier to entry, despite potentially lower asset prices. Institutional players, meanwhile, may view this as a strategic accumulation period, executing dollar-cost averaging strategies away from the public spotlight. Market liquidity can become bifurcated, with high-quality assets like Bitcoin seeing steady demand while altcoins experience exaggerated sell-offs. Several key impacts emerge from this sentiment environment: Reduced Leverage: Fearful markets typically see a decline in the use of margin and derivatives, lowering systemic risk. Focus on Fundamentals: Narrative-driven speculation fades, shifting attention to project utility, treasury health, and development activity. Volatility Compression: While the index factors in volatility, prolonged fear can sometimes lead to tightening price ranges before a decisive breakout. Regulatory Scrutiny: Policymakers may perceive a fearful market as less resilient, potentially accelerating regulatory discussions for consumer protection. Market analysts, such as those at ARK Invest, have historically noted that sustained fear phases test network fundamentals and separate robust projects from weaker ones. This Darwinian process can strengthen the overall ecosystem long-term. The current 2025 landscape, with its mature institutional infrastructure compared to earlier cycles, may process this fear differently, potentially leading to a more measured recovery. The Role of Macroeconomic Factors Cryptocurrency sentiment does not exist in a vacuum. In 2025, the index remains suppressed partly due to broader financial conditions. Persistent inflation concerns, geopolitical tensions, and shifting central bank policies all influence risk asset appetite. Traditional safe-haven flows often divert capital from crypto during such periods. Therefore, a sustained rise in the Fear & Greed Index likely requires improvement in both crypto-specific narratives and the global macroeconomic outlook. Observing correlations with traditional market fear gauges like the VIX provides additional context for the current reading of 24. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index holding steadfast at 24 provides a clear, quantitative snapshot of a market gripped by extreme fear. This sentiment, derived from volatility, volume, social data, surveys, Bitcoin dominance, and search trends, indicates a cautious and risk-averse environment as of April 2025. Historically, such periods have presented complex challenges but also opportunities for disciplined investors. While the index is a powerful gauge of current emotion, it remains one tool among many. Ultimately, navigating a market with a Fear & Greed Index in the extreme fear zone demands a focus on long-term fundamentals, robust risk management, and an understanding of the broader economic landscape shaping investor psychology. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 24 mean? A score of 24 falls into the “Extreme Fear” zone (0-24). It indicates that current market data from volatility, volume, social media, and surveys reflects widespread investor anxiety and risk aversion, often seen during market downturns or periods of high uncertainty. Q2: Is extreme fear a good time to buy cryptocurrency? Historically, periods of extreme fear have sometimes preceded market recoveries, leading to the contrarian investing adage “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” However, it is not a precise timing indicator. It suggests potential opportunity but requires thorough individual research and risk assessment, not a guarantee of future gains. Q3: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is updated daily, typically once per 24-hour period. It provides a near real-time snapshot of market sentiment based on the most recent available data for its six component metrics. Q4: Can the index predict Bitcoin’s price? No, the index measures current sentiment, not future price. It is a coincident or lagging indicator of emotion, not a predictive model. Price is influenced by countless factors beyond sentiment. However, sustained extreme readings can indicate an overstretched psychological condition that may correct over time. Q5: Why does Bitcoin’s dominance affect the Fear & Greed Index? Bitcoin’s market dominance—its share of the total crypto market cap—is included as a 10% component. A rising dominance often signals a “flight to safety” within crypto, where investors sell riskier altcoins and move into Bitcoin, which is perceived as a more established store of value. This behavior is typically associated with fearful or cautious market periods.

This development follows Friday’s closing price of $87,825 and Monday’s opening at $88,200, highlighting the persistent volatility in cryptocurrency markets. Market analysts immediately began examining the implications of this gap, particularly given current macroeconomic conditions and regulatory developments affecting digital assets. Understanding the CME Bitcoin Futures Gap Phenomenon The CME Bitcoin futures gap represents a unique market occurrence with specific characteristics. Unlike traditional equity markets, cryptocurrency spot trading operates continuously throughout weekends. However, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange maintains conventional trading hours, closing from Friday afternoon until Sunday evening. This structural difference creates inevitable price discrepancies between the spot market’s continuous trading and the futures market’s scheduled openings. Several factors typically influence gap sizes during weekend closures. First, global news events affecting cryptocurrency sentiment create immediate price movements. Second, institutional trading activity in international markets continues during U.S. market closures. Third, technical factors including liquidity variations and automated trading algorithms contribute to price discovery differences. Historical data shows that CME Bitcoin futures gaps have ranged from minimal amounts to over $2,000 during periods of extreme volatility. Market mechanics explain why these gaps matter significantly. When futures prices open substantially higher or lower than their previous close, they create arbitrage opportunities. Sophisticated traders can exploit price differences between futures and spot markets. Additionally, these gaps often indicate underlying market sentiment shifts that occurred during the trading hiatus. Consequently, professional traders monitor gap behavior as potential indicators of future price direction. Comparative Analysis of Historical Futures Gaps Today’s $375 gap represents a moderate deviation compared to historical precedents. The table below illustrates notable CME Bitcoin futures gaps from recent years: Date Previous Close Monday Open Gap Size Market Context March 17, 2025 $87,825 $88,200 $375 Moderate weekend volatility January 6, 2025 $72,400 $74,150 $1,750 ETF approval speculation November 11, 2024 $65,300 $64,900 -$400 Regulatory concerns August 19, 2024 $58,750 $60,500 $1,750 Institutional adoption news Several patterns emerge from historical gap analysis. First, larger gaps typically correlate with significant weekend news events. Second, gap direction often predicts short-term market momentum. Third, gap filling behavior shows consistent statistical patterns. According to CME trading data from 2023-2025, approximately 78% of futures gaps eventually fill within five trading days. This statistical tendency influences trading strategies across market participants. The current $375 gap falls within one standard deviation of average weekend gaps observed over the past year. Market analysts note that this suggests controlled volatility rather than extreme market dislocation. However, the direction of the gap—opening higher—indicates positive weekend sentiment despite recent market uncertainties. This upward gap follows two weeks of relatively range-bound trading between $85,000 and $89,000. Market Structure and Institutional Implications CME Bitcoin futures serve crucial functions within broader financial markets. These regulated derivatives provide several important benefits: Price Discovery: Futures markets contribute to transparent price formation Risk Management: Institutions hedge cryptocurrency exposure through futures Market Efficiency: Arbitrage between futures and spot improves pricing accuracy Regulatory Compliance: CME offers regulated environment for institutional participation The gap phenomenon specifically affects different market participants in distinct ways. For market makers and arbitrageurs, gaps represent profit opportunities through statistical arbitrage strategies. For long-term investors, gaps may indicate sentiment shifts requiring portfolio adjustments. For regulators, gap analysis helps monitor market stability and potential manipulation risks. Each participant group therefore interprets and responds to gaps according to their specific objectives and constraints. Institutional trading patterns significantly influence gap behavior. Large financial institutions typically adjust positions before weekend closures to manage risk exposure. Their trading decisions during Friday sessions often anticipate potential weekend developments. Consequently, Friday’s closing price already incorporates some institutional expectations about weekend volatility. The remaining gap then reflects unexpected developments or retail trading activity during market closure. Technical Analysis and Gap Filling Probability Technical analysts employ specific methodologies to assess gap filling likelihood. They examine several key factors when evaluating today’s $375 gap. First, trading volume during the first hour provides important signals. Higher volume typically increases gap filling probability. Second, support and resistance levels near the gap zone influence price behavior. Third, broader market trends either reinforce or counteract gap filling pressure. Current technical indicators suggest moderate gap filling probability. The $88,200 opening price sits just below recent resistance around $88,500. Meanwhile, support appears firm near $87,500 based on recent trading patterns. These technical levels create a relatively narrow range for potential gap filling activity. Additionally, moving averages show bullish alignment with the 50-day average at $86,200 and the 200-day average at $82,400. Market microstructure analysis reveals additional insights. Order book data shows substantial liquidity both above and below the current price. This balanced liquidity profile typically supports efficient gap filling when it occurs. However, the specific timing remains uncertain given current market conditions. Some analysts predict partial gap filling today, while others anticipate gradual convergence throughout the week. Macroeconomic Context and Regulatory Developments Several macroeconomic factors contributed to weekend price movements. Global central bank policy decisions continue influencing cryptocurrency valuations. Additionally, traditional equity market performance affects digital asset correlations. Furthermore, geopolitical developments increasingly impact cryptocurrency as an alternative asset class. These interconnected factors create complex weekend trading environments. Recent regulatory developments specifically affect CME Bitcoin futures trading. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has enhanced oversight of cryptocurrency derivatives. Meanwhile, Securities and Exchange Commission decisions regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs influence futures market dynamics. These regulatory frameworks create structured environments for institutional participation. Consequently, futures gaps increasingly reflect institutional rather than retail trading patterns. The global cryptocurrency regulatory landscape continues evolving rapidly. European Union markets operate under comprehensive MiCA regulations. Asian markets show varying approaches from supportive to restrictive. United States regulatory clarity remains incomplete but gradually improving. These divergent regulatory environments create arbitrage opportunities that manifest as futures gaps when U.S. markets reopen. Risk Management Considerations for Traders Professional traders implement specific strategies around futures gaps. They typically consider several risk factors when positions reopen after weekends. First, gap risk represents unexpected price movements between sessions. Second, liquidity risk increases during initial trading hours. Third, volatility risk typically elevates following significant gaps. Each risk category requires appropriate management approaches. Effective gap trading strategies incorporate multiple elements. Position sizing adjustments account for increased volatility. Stop-loss placements consider gap filling probabilities. Entry timing accounts for initial price discovery periods. Profit targets align with technical support and resistance levels. These structured approaches help traders navigate gap-related uncertainties systematically. Historical performance data informs current trading decisions. Analysis of similar historical gaps shows specific statistical tendencies. For instance, upward gaps of this magnitude during neutral market conditions have filled within three days 65% of the time. However, during bullish trends, upward gaps often extend rather than fill. Current market conditions suggest neutral to slightly bullish bias, making gap direction uncertain. Conclusion The CME Bitcoin futures $375 gap highlights ongoing cryptocurrency market dynamics. This moderate gap reflects controlled weekend volatility within evolving regulatory frameworks. Market participants now monitor gap filling behavior for short-term trading signals. Meanwhile, institutional adoption continues shaping futures market structure. The CME Bitcoin futures market remains crucial for price discovery and risk management. Consequently, futures gaps provide valuable insights into market sentiment and structure evolution. FAQs Q1: What causes CME Bitcoin futures gaps? CME Bitcoin futures gaps occur because the exchange closes weekends while Bitcoin spot markets trade continuously. Price movements during this closure create differences between Friday’s close and Monday’s open. Q2: How often do futures gaps typically fill? Historical data shows approximately 78% of CME Bitcoin futures gaps fill within five trading days. However, filling probability depends on market conditions, gap size, and technical factors. Q3: Do futures gaps predict market direction? While not perfect predictors, gaps often indicate sentiment shifts. Upward gaps suggest positive weekend developments, while downward gaps indicate negative sentiment. However, many other factors influence subsequent price action. Q4: How do institutional traders use futures gaps? Institutions employ various strategies including statistical arbitrage, hedging adjustments, and momentum trading. Some institutions specifically design strategies around gap filling probabilities and patterns. Q5: Are futures gaps unique to Bitcoin? No, futures gaps occur across all markets with trading closures. However, cryptocurrency gaps tend to be larger due to 24/7 spot trading and higher volatility compared to traditional assets.

This looming crypto treasury crisis stems from a perfect storm of market conditions, increased competition, and fundamental business model flaws. Consequently, the sector that boomed during the last bull run now faces a critical inflection point. The Anatomy of the Crypto Treasury Crisis Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) emerged as specialized entities for corporations and funds to manage holdings of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and various altcoins. Initially, they promised superior returns through active management compared to passive holding. However, the prolonged market downturn has exposed critical vulnerabilities. Altan Tutar, founder of revenue platform MoreMarkets, identifies the core issue: a sharp decline in market capitalization for these treasury firms themselves. “DATs, which proliferated after the Bitcoin bull run, are experiencing sharp declines,” Tutar stated. He specifically highlighted that firms with treasuries overexposed to volatile altcoins will likely be the first to disappear, as these assets often suffer deeper devaluations during bear markets. This trend is not merely speculative. Data from analytics firms shows a significant contraction in the total value managed by dedicated crypto treasury services since their 2021 peak. The business model, which often relied on fee structures tied to assets under management (AUM), faces immense pressure as those assets shrink in value. Furthermore, the operational costs for security, compliance, and staffing remain high, squeezing profit margins to unsustainable levels. Beyond Bitcoin: The Insufficiency of Passive Holding A common misconception, according to industry leaders, is that a simple strategy of accumulating Bitcoin guarantees longevity. Ryan Chow, co-founder of Solv Protocol, challenges this notion directly. “Investing in BTC is not a guaranteed solution for infinite growth,” Chow explained. He emphasized that companies unable to generate returns beyond the baseline appreciation of the asset itself will struggle immensely during extended bear cycles. This underscores a fundamental shift in expectation; treasury services must now demonstrate tangible, active value. The required value generation can take multiple forms: Yield Generation: Strategically deploying assets in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, staking, or lending to produce revenue. Risk-Adjusted Portfolio Management: Actively rebalancing holdings to mitigate downside volatility during market corrections. Capital Efficiency: Using assets as collateral for strategic financing without selling, a practice known in traditional finance. Firms that operate as glorified, high-cost custodians offering no strategic advantage are now at the highest risk. The market no longer rewards mere exposure; it demands sophisticated financial engineering. The Liquidity and Strategy Imperative Vincent Chok, CEO of First Digital, provides a clear prescription for survival. He argues that for DATs to operate successfully, they need two critical components: prudent portfolio strategies and sufficient operational liquidity . A prudent strategy involves deep diversification, rigorous risk assessment frameworks, and clear protocols for different market regimes. Operational liquidity ensures these firms can cover expenses, meet redemption requests, and seize strategic opportunities without being forced into distressed asset sales. The lack of these elements has led to several high-profile instances of treasury insolvency in recent years, eroding institutional trust. Chok’s analysis suggests the coming year will serve as a harsh filter, separating firms with robust operational disciplines from those that grew complacent during the bull market. The Existential Threat from Traditional Finance Perhaps the most significant long-term challenge for standalone crypto treasury firms comes from the rapid maturation of traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure. Vincent Chok projected that for DATs to compete with spot ETFs in the long run, they will need to integrate deeply with traditional financial systems. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, approved in the United States in early 2024, have already amassed tens of billions in assets. They offer investors a familiar, regulated, and highly liquid vehicle for Bitcoin exposure without the complexities of private key management. Digital Asset Treasury vs. Spot Bitcoin ETF: A Comparative View Feature Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) Spot Bitcoin ETF Access Often institutional, higher minimums Retail & institutional, low minimums Regulatory Framework Evolving, varies by jurisdiction Established (SEC-regulated in US) Primary Value Prop Active management, multi-asset strategies Passive, low-cost Bitcoin exposure Custody Complexity Client bears technical/security risk Handled by regulated custodians Liquidity Can be limited, depends on fund terms Extremely high, trades on major exchanges This competitive landscape forces DATs to justify their higher fees by delivering alpha—returns above the market benchmark. Simply tracking the price of Bitcoin is no longer a viable service when an ETF can do it for a fraction of the cost. The integration Chok mentions involves adopting TradFi-grade reporting, audit standards, and compliance protocols to attract and retain large, regulated institutional capital. Historical Context and the Path Forward The current crisis mirrors consolidation phases in other emerging financial technologies. The dot-com bubble, for instance, wiped out companies with weak fundamentals but solidified the position of those with sustainable models. For crypto treasuries, the path to survival involves several non-negotiable adaptations. First, regulatory compliance must become a core competency, not an afterthought. Jurisdictions worldwide are finalizing frameworks for digital asset service providers. Firms that proactively engage with regulators and obtain necessary licenses will gain a significant trust advantage. Second, technological innovation in areas like on-chain accounting, real-time auditing, and institutional DeFi gateways can create defensible moats. Finally, strategic specialization is key. Some firms may focus exclusively on DeFi yield strategies for stablecoins, while others might become experts in tokenized real-world asset (RWA) portfolios. The experts’ warnings, therefore, serve not just as a prediction of doom but as a clear roadmap for evolution. The era of easy money in crypto treasury management is over. The era of professionalized, resilient, and value-adding digital asset finance is beginning, but the transition will be brutal for those unprepared. Conclusion The projected crypto treasury crisis for 2026 highlights the rapid maturation and increasing sophistication of the digital asset ecosystem. Survival will depend on moving beyond simple asset custody to providing verifiable, risk-adjusted returns and seamless integration with the broader global financial system. As spot ETFs and other regulated products capture passive demand, active treasury managers must prove their worth through performance, security, and compliance. The coming year will be a definitive test, separating the transient ventures from the foundational institutions of the next financial era. FAQs Q1: What is a Digital Asset Treasury (DAT)? A Digital Asset Treasury is a company or service that manages cryptocurrency and digital asset holdings on behalf of other entities, such as corporations or investment funds, often with the goal of generating yield or managing risk. Q2: Why are DATs facing a crisis in 2026? They face a crisis due to shrinking asset values reducing their fees, high fixed operational costs, increased competition from low-cost products like Bitcoin ETFs, and the need to demonstrate active returns beyond passive holding. Q3: How are Bitcoin ETFs a threat to crypto treasury firms? Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a cheap, regulated, and familiar way for investors to get Bitcoin exposure, directly competing with DATs that charge higher fees for basic Bitcoin custody and management. Q4: What can a DAT do to survive the predicted downturn? To survive, DATs need to develop prudent, active portfolio strategies, ensure strong operational liquidity, integrate with traditional finance for compliance, and specialize in services that ETFs cannot provide, like multi-asset DeFi strategies. Q5: Are all crypto treasury firms at equal risk? No. Experts indicate firms heavily concentrated in altcoins or those that function as simple custodians with no active management strategy are at the highest risk. Firms with diversified, yield-generating strategies and robust operations are better positioned.

Capital stops chasing already massive assets and starts rotating into smaller protocols with working fundamentals. Large caps slow down. Attention shifts. Fresh demand looks for better upside with clearer growth paths. Right now, some analysts believe one new DeFi crypto sits directly in that rotation window, before its full utility goes live. Why Capital Is Rotating Away From Large-Cap Crypto Large-cap cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana dominate headlines, but size can also limit upside. When a network already carries a large market cap, each new dollar of inflow moves the price less. Growth becomes slower and more incremental. This does not mean large caps lose relevance. It means that returns compress over time. As cycles mature, investors often rebalance toward assets with smaller valuations where capital inflows can have a stronger effect. This rotation is not driven by hype. It is driven by math. Market commentators suggest that this phase is when early-stage DeFi crypto projects begin to absorb new demand, especially those that show progress beyond ideas and into execution. Where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Fits in the Rotation Cycle Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an Ethereum-based DeFi crypto focused on lending and borrowing. It sits in a stage that many rotation models highlight. The protocol is past the concept phase but not yet fully live. Development is advanced, audits are underway, and a V1 launch is planned. Since early 2025, MUTM has grown steadily rather than explosively. The token price has climbed from early stages to $0.035, marking about 250% growth so far. Over $19.45M has been raised, and the holder count has reached roughly 18,650. Some analysts view this as early capital rotation already taking place. Not because of announcements, but because participation has increased while visibility remains limited compared to larger projects. Relative Valuation Model Relative valuation in crypto compares what a protocol is today with what similar projects were at a comparable stage. Early DeFi platforms that later became category leaders often started with modest valuations before usage scaled. In a conservative scenario, analysts look at capital inflow ratios rather than absolute price targets. If MUTM were to attract a fraction of the capital that moved into early lending protocols after launch, the valuation could expand several times from current levels. For example, some models suggest that if post-launch inflows push the token toward the $0.20 range, that would represent roughly a 5x to 6x move from $0.035. This scenario assumes moderate adoption and no aggressive assumptions about market conditions. Usage Expansion and the Second Price Scenario The next layer of valuation focuses on usage. Mutuum Finance is designed around lending markets that generate ongoing activity. Users can supply assets and receive mtTokens, which grow as interest accrues. Borrowers access liquidity using overcollateralized positions with defined Loan to Value limits. Once V1 goes live , lending volume and borrowing demand become measurable. Analysts often value DeFi crypto protocols based on activity rather than narratives. More usage means more fees, more mtToken issuance, and more engagement. In a stronger scenario, if lending and borrowing volumes grow steadily through 2026, some projections place MUTM closer to $0.50. This would imply a move of around 14x from current levels. This model assumes consistent usage rather than viral growth. Revenue Recycling One feature that analysts highlight is the buy-and-distribute mechanism. In this system, MUTM purchased on the open market is redistributed to users who stake mtTokens in the safety module. This links protocol revenue directly to token demand. Unlike attention-driven demand, revenue-driven demand can persist over time. As usage grows, fees increase. A portion of those fees cycles back into market buying pressure. Over long periods, this can reduce sell pressure and support higher price levels. In a bullish scenario where usage remains strong and revenue recycling becomes meaningful, some industry speculation points to an upper band near $0.70. From $0.035, that would represent a 20x move. Analysts stress that this outcome depends on sustained activity, not short-term price spikes. Why Analysts See Rotation Continuing The rotation thesis is based on timing. Large caps remain important but face slower growth due to size. Early-stage DeFi crypto projects with working fundamentals offer a different risk profile. Mutuum Finance combines several factors analysts look for during rotation phases. Development milestones are clear. Security reviews include a CertiK scan score of 90/100 and an ongoing Halborn audit . A $50k bug bounty adds another layer of review. With Phase 6 nearly fully allocated and V1 approaching, early investor sentiment indicates that MUTM may continue to benefit from capital rotation into smaller protocols with defined utility. Rather than relying on hype, the price prediction models focus on behavior, usage, and revenue flow. For those tracking which crypto to invest in ahead of 2026, Mutuum Finance is increasingly appearing in discussions around DeFi crypto projects positioned for the next rotation phase.

A critical on-chain metric, the Altcoin Season Index, currently stands at a decisive 19, providing quantitative evidence of a sustained Bitcoin season. This reading, sourced from leading data aggregator CoinMarketCap, offers more than a simple snapshot; it reflects a complex, 90-day performance battle between Bitcoin and the broader altcoin universe, with profound implications for investor strategy and market structure. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: A Market Barometer The Altcoin Season Index functions as a specialized market barometer. Specifically, it measures whether 75% of the top 100 altcoins by market capitalization have outperformed Bitcoin over a rolling 90-day period. Analysts exclude stablecoins and wrapped tokens from this calculation to focus purely on speculative performance. Consequently, a score approaching 100 strongly suggests a broad-based altcoin season, where investor capital rotates aggressively into smaller-cap assets. Conversely, a low score like 19 unequivocally signals Bitcoin’s dominance. This metric, therefore, transforms subjective market sentiment into a clear, binary signal watched closely by institutional and retail traders alike. The Mechanics Behind the Metric Understanding the index’s construction is crucial for interpretation. The calculation involves a daily comparative analysis of price performance. For each of the top 100 qualifying altcoins, its 90-day return is benchmarked against Bitcoin’s return for the same period. If an altcoin’s performance exceeds Bitcoin’s, it counts toward the potential 75% threshold. The index score essentially represents the percentage of altcoins meeting this outperformance criterion. A score of 19 means only a small fraction—roughly 19 out of 100—have managed to beat Bitcoin recently. This data-driven approach removes narrative bias, offering a pure momentum-based assessment of market leadership. Historical Context and Cyclical Market Behavior Placing the current index reading of 19 into historical context reveals its significance. Previous crypto market cycles have demonstrated a rhythmic pattern between Bitcoin and altcoin dominance. Typically, a bull cycle initiates with strong Bitcoin momentum, often driven by macro factors like ETF approvals or institutional adoption. Subsequently, as Bitcoin’s price stabilizes at a higher range, capital begins seeking higher beta opportunities, flowing into altcoins and triggering an altcoin season. Historical data from platforms like CoinMarketCap shows past altcoin seasons have corresponded with index readings consistently above 75, sometimes for sustained periods. The persistent low reading in 2025 suggests this capital rotation phase has not yet materialized, extending the Bitcoin-centric phase of the cycle. Key characteristics of a Bitcoin season include: Heightened focus on macro-economic indicators and regulatory news. Relative underperformance of small and mid-cap altcoins. Increased dominance of Bitcoin in total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Trading volume concentrated in Bitcoin and major blue-chip cryptocurrencies. Implications for Investors and the Broader Ecosystem The extended Bitcoin season, as confirmed by the index, carries tangible implications. For investors, it underscores a risk-averse environment where capital prioritizes the perceived safety and liquidity of Bitcoin over speculative altcoin projects. This dynamic often pressures altcoin developers and projects, potentially slowing ecosystem growth outside the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks. Furthermore, it influences trading platform offerings and derivative products, which may tilt toward Bitcoin-centric instruments. Market analysts note that prolonged Bitcoin dominance can also delay the “moonshot” returns historically associated with altcoin seasons, shaping portfolio allocation strategies across hedge funds and retail wallets. Expert Analysis on Market Structure Financial analysts specializing in digital assets point to several reinforcing factors for the current trend. The maturation of Bitcoin as a institutional asset class, through vehicles like spot Bitcoin ETFs, provides a constant bid for the asset that altcoins lack. Additionally, a cautious regulatory landscape in key jurisdictions like the United States may disproportionately affect altcoins, which are often viewed as securities. This regulatory overhang can suppress altcoin momentum independently of Bitcoin’s performance. The index, therefore, acts as a synthesis of these underlying technical, fundamental, and regulatory forces, providing a single, digestible data point on market health. Comparative Analysis: Bitcoin vs. Altcoin Drivers The drivers for Bitcoin and altcoin performance are often distinct, explaining the divergence captured by the index. Bitcoin’s price is increasingly correlated with macro factors such as inflation data, interest rate expectations, and global liquidity. Its narrative revolves around digital gold and a sovereign, uncorrelated asset. Altcoins, however, are typically driven by project-specific developments, network adoption metrics, and technological upgrades. A low Altcoin Season Index suggests that macro drivers are overpowering idiosyncratic altcoin narratives. The following table illustrates this dichotomy: Performance Driver Bitcoin (Dominant during Low Index) Altcoins (Dominant during High Index) Primary Catalysts Macro economics, ETF flows, halving cycles Protocol upgrades, partnership announcements, mainnet launches Investor Profile Institutional, long-term holders Retail, speculative traders Risk Appetite Lower, seeking store of value Higher, seeking exponential growth Market Liquidity Very High Variable, often lower Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index reading of 19 serves as a powerful, data-centric confirmation of the current market regime. It definitively signals a Bitcoin season, where the pioneer cryptocurrency continues to outperform the vast majority of its peers. This metric, by translating complex relative performance into a simple score, provides invaluable context for navigating the 2025 cryptocurrency landscape. While altcoin seasons are a historical inevitability in crypto cycles, the index clearly shows that the timing for such a shift remains uncertain. For now, market structure, liquidity, and narrative firmly favor Bitcoin dominance, a reality every market participant must acknowledge in their strategic planning. FAQs Q1: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 19 mean? An index score of 19 means that only about 19% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This is a strong quantitative indicator of a “Bitcoin season,” where Bitcoin is the dominant performer in the crypto market. Q2: How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? The index is calculated by CoinMarketCap. It tracks the 90-day performance of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin’s performance. The score represents the percentage of those altcoins that have outperformed Bitcoin. Q3: What is considered a true “Altcoin Season”? A true altcoin season is generally indicated when the Altcoin Season Index sustains a reading above 75. This threshold suggests that at least 75 out of the top 100 altcoins are beating Bitcoin’s returns, signaling broad-based capital rotation into alternative cryptocurrencies. Q4: Why might a Bitcoin season last a long time? Extended Bitcoin seasons can be driven by strong institutional inflows (e.g., through ETFs), favorable macro conditions for hard assets, regulatory uncertainty targeting altcoins, or simply Bitcoin’s own compelling narrative cycles like the halving, which draws focused investor attention. Q5: Should I avoid altcoins when the index is low? A low index doesn’t necessarily mean to avoid altcoins entirely, but it does indicate a higher-risk environment for them. It suggests that selective, research-driven investment in altcoins is prudent, as broad, indiscriminate gains are less likely during a pronounced Bitcoin season.

Banking Links And Licenses Outweigh Market Share Korbit helped pioneer Korea’s crypto scene, launching in 2013 and debuting what it billed as the first Bitcoin-to-won trading market. Today, it operates in a far more concentrated arena where Upbit dominates daily volumes. CoinGecko data shows Upbit taking 64.2% of local trading in a recent 24-hour window, followed by Bithumb at 24.4% and Coinone at 10.8%, leaving Korbit at about 0.5%. That small share still comes with a valuable prize, a regulated onshore venue with banking links, compliance controls, and a customer base that can be cross-sold into broader financial products, especially if institutions get a clearer path into spot crypto trading. Institutional Interest Grows As Stakes Rise Mirae’s interest comes as competition for regulated Korean exchange licenses intensifies. As of November, crypto exchange Bybit had also been in talks to acquire Korbit , according to South Korea’s Maeil Business Newspaper. The talks land as South Korea’s tech and finance giants chase scale in digital assets. Naver Financial has agreed to acquire Dunamu , the operator of market-leading Upbit, in an all stock deal valued at about 15.13T won, Reuters reported in late November. For Korbit, a buyer with Mirae’s brand and distribution could reset the exchange’s relevance at home, even as competition stays brutal and liquidity continues to pool around the biggest venues.

HYPE Token Unlock: A $251 Million Market Event On December 29 at 7:30 a.m. UTC, the HYPE project will release 9.92 million tokens valued at approximately $251.68 million. This represents 2.87% of the circulating supply, making it the largest single unlock by dollar value this week. The timing coincides with year-end portfolio rebalancing, potentially amplifying its market impact. Historically, large token unlocks create selling pressure when recipients immediately liquidate positions. However, sophisticated projects implement vesting schedules and lock-up agreements to mitigate market disruption. The HYPE unlock warrants particular attention because its sheer scale could influence broader market sentiment during typically low-liquidity holiday trading. Comprehensive Weekly Token Release Schedule The token unlock schedule extends beyond HYPE, featuring releases from eight additional projects across five days. On December 30, three significant unlocks occur: SVL releases 234.81 million tokens ($7.11 million), ZORA unlocks 166.67 million tokens ($7.09 million), and KMNO distributes 229.16 million tokens ($11.65 million). December 31 brings an OP token unlock of 31.34 million tokens valued at $8.57 million. January 1 features three releases: GPS unlocks 707.87 million tokens ($3.47 million), ZETA releases 44.26 million tokens ($3.17 million), and EIGEN distributes 36.82 million tokens ($14.39 million). Finally, on January 2, ENA completes the week with 40.63 million tokens ($8.45 million) entering circulation. Weekly Token Unlock Schedule: December 29 – January 2 Date Project Tokens Unlocked USD Value % of Circulating Supply Dec 29 HYPE 9.92M $251.68M 2.87% Dec 30 SVL 234.81M $7.11M 3.06% Dec 30 ZORA 166.67M $7.09M 4.17% Dec 30 KMNO 229.16M $11.65M 5.35% Dec 31 OP 31.34M $8.57M 1.65% Jan 1 GPS 707.87M $3.47M 24.30% Jan 1 ZETA 44.26M $3.17M 3.88% Jan 1 EIGEN 36.82M $14.39M 9.74% Jan 2 ENA 40.63M $8.45M 0.56% Tokenomics and Market Impact Analysis Token unlocks represent critical moments in cryptocurrency project lifecycles. They transition tokens from restricted to liquid status, testing economic models against market forces. The percentage of circulating supply released often matters more than absolute dollar values. For instance, GPS’s January 1 unlock represents 24.30% of circulating supply—the highest percentage this week—despite its relatively modest $3.47 million valuation. Conversely, ENA’s January 2 release affects only 0.56% of circulating supply despite its $8.45 million value. These variations demonstrate how different projects manage dilution risks and investor expectations through carefully calibrated vesting schedules. Historical Context and Market Patterns Historical data reveals consistent patterns around major token unlock events. Projects with transparent communication and gradual release schedules typically experience less volatility. The cryptocurrency market has matured significantly since 2020, with institutional investors now applying sophisticated analysis to tokenomics. They evaluate unlock schedules alongside fundamentals like utility, adoption metrics, and development activity. This week’s cluster of year-end releases presents a natural experiment in market efficiency, testing whether current prices already reflect impending supply increases through efficient market hypothesis principles. Project-Specific Implications and Strategic Considerations Each project faces unique circumstances during unlock events. The HYPE unlock’s magnitude requires particular scrutiny of recipient categories—whether tokens go to team members, investors, or ecosystem participants. Team and investor unlocks often correlate with higher selling pressure than ecosystem reward distributions. Meanwhile, OP’s December 31 release continues its established quarterly unlock pattern, providing predictability that markets appreciate. EIGEN’s January 1 unlock at 9.74% of circulating supply represents a substantial dilution event requiring careful monitoring. Projects typically employ several strategies to manage unlock impacts: Staggered releases spreading tokens across multiple dates Vesting extensions voluntarily implemented by recipients Buyback programs funded by treasury reserves Utility enhancements increasing token demand ahead of unlocks Transparent communication preparing markets for supply changes Regulatory and Compliance Dimensions Token unlocks operate within evolving regulatory frameworks globally. The Securities and Exchange Commission increasingly scrutinizes whether tokens constitute securities, particularly during distribution events. Projects must ensure compliance with securities laws, especially when tokens go to U.S. participants. Many projects implement geographic restrictions and accreditation requirements for early participants receiving unlocked tokens. These compliance measures add complexity but reduce regulatory risk. The cryptocurrency industry continues developing best practices for token distribution that balance innovation with investor protection. Investor Strategies for Unlock Events Sophisticated investors employ specific strategies around token unlock dates. Some reduce exposure before major unlocks, then re-enter positions if prices decline disproportionately. Others analyze recipient behavior patterns—early investors might sell different percentages than team members. Additionally, investors monitor trading volume and order book depth preceding unlocks, as thin liquidity exacerbates price movements. The concentration of unlocks this week across multiple projects creates cross-market correlations worth monitoring. Investors might rotate capital from projects with large unlocks to those with more favorable supply dynamics. Conclusion The $251 million HYPE token unlock dominates this week’s cryptocurrency token release schedule, presenting both challenges and opportunities for market participants. With eight additional projects releasing tokens between December 29 and January 2, the cumulative market impact warrants careful observation. These events test tokenomics models, investor sentiment, and market efficiency during traditionally low-volume holiday trading. While token unlocks create temporary supply pressures, well-designed projects with strong fundamentals often recover as markets absorb new supply. The coming week will provide valuable data on how mature cryptocurrency markets process scheduled liquidity events in the evolving digital asset landscape. FAQs Q1: What is a token unlock in cryptocurrency? A token unlock refers to the release of previously restricted cryptocurrency tokens into circulating supply according to predetermined schedules. These tokens typically originate from allocations to founders, team members, investors, or ecosystem funds with vesting periods preventing immediate sale. Q2: Why does the HYPE token unlock matter for markets? The HYPE token unlock matters because its $251.68 million value represents substantial potential selling pressure. Large unlocks can decrease prices if recipients sell immediately, though impacts vary based on recipient types, market conditions, and project fundamentals. Q3: How do token unlocks affect cryptocurrency prices? Token unlocks typically create downward price pressure from increased selling, though magnitude depends on unlock size relative to circulating supply, market expectations, and overall sentiment. Prices often decline before unlocks if markets anticipate sales, then stabilize afterward. Q4: What percentage of circulating supply is most concerning in unlocks? Unlocks exceeding 5% of circulating supply generally warrant closer attention, as they represent significant dilution. However, context matters—projects with strong demand or utility may absorb larger unlocks with minimal price impact. Q5: How can investors prepare for token unlock events? Investors can monitor project communication about unlock schedules, analyze historical price patterns around previous unlocks, assess recipient types and likely behavior, and consider adjusting positions based on risk tolerance and investment horizon.

56518862,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=885388,1766972260,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56518862.jpeg,Bank of America CEO says Trump will ease trade tensions in 2026,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bofa-says-trump-will-ease-trade-tensions/,"The Chairman and CEO of Bank of America, Brian Moynihan, states that US President Donald Trump’s tariffs have significantly disrupted the United States’ economic growth. Still, he asserted that there is a high likelihood that the Trump administration will adopt the concept of lowering trade tensions in 2026. The remarks were made during an interview on CBS News’ Face the Nation. Moynihan emphasized that Bank of America anticipates “de-escalation, not escalation,” with average tariffs holding around 15%. At the same time, higher rates could still apply to countries that challenge US trade practices or reduce non-tariff barriers. Moynihan’s belief regarding Trump’s tariff policies sparks hope in the market As Trump’s tariff policies continue to create tension in the markets, Moynihan released a statement attempting to explain the matter. In the statement, Bank of America’s CEO pointed out that, “Going from a 10% rate across the board to 15% for most countries is not a huge change.” Based on his argument, this situation demonstrated that the tension in the market is beginning to reduce. Regarding the progress of the tariff imposition, reports dated April mentioned that the US president began by implementing an initial tariff rate of about 10% on all goods imported to the US. In July, Trump announced the introduction of several new tariffs. These tariffs were anticipated to increase the average rate to around 15.2%, applicable to the country’s key trading partners, once they were imposed as scheduled. In the meantime, data from a reliable source indicated that the average tariff rate in the US increased from 2% to 14% after Trump took office. As the situation becomes intense, Moynihan admitted that China raises a different question, similar to North American trading partners, because a review of the US-Mexico-Canada agreement is set to take place in 2026. Nonetheless, even with this assertion, the CEO still insists that one can tell how things are generally progressing. Moynihan also claimed that small businesses faced significant challenges in the second quarter of the year, which were largely attributed to tariff hikes and growing uncertainties regarding trade policies. After some time, these businesses experienced relief when rates began to drop significantly. In Moynihan’s analysis, he declared that what small businesses find challenging at the moment is not tariffs, but rather locating employees. He made these remarks at a time when specific immigration policies adopted by the Trump administration had not yet completely taken effect. The fate of Trump’s tariff policies ignites debates among individuals Kevin Hassett, the Director of the National Economic Council (NEC) in the Trump administration, earlier asserted that the administration is confident that the US Supreme Court will make a decision that favors them on matters related to the legality of the tariffs Trump implemented. Analysts weighed in on the situation. They argued that if, by any chance, the court rules against the tariffs, then it could eliminate several of them and mandate the government to compensate those affected by up to $100 billion . Following this statement, Hassett noted that such an incident could lead to serious administrative issues. He also argued that at this point, he agreed that the concept of $2,000 tariff rebate checks is highly likely. Notably, this idea was earlier proposed by the US president. Concerning this sudden decision, Hassett explained that, “Back in summer, I wasn’t sure if there was room for such a check, but now I believe there is.” With this in mind, the US official anticipated that Trump would submit a formal proposal to Congress next year.

56519913,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=255237,1766974211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,South Korea’s Digital Asset Security Team Expands with Urgent Regulatory Push,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/south-korea-fsi-digital-asset-security/,"BitcoinWorld South Korea’s Digital Asset Security Team Expands with Urgent Regulatory Push SEOUL, South Korea – March 2025 – South Korea’s Financial Security Institute (FSI) has significantly expanded its specialized team dedicated to digital asset security, marking a crucial development in the nation’s evolving cryptocurrency regulatory framework. This strategic reorganization directly addresses growing concerns about stablecoin oversight and broader digital financial system protection. Consequently, this move signals South Korea’s intensified commitment to creating a secure environment for blockchain innovation while mitigating systemic risks. South Korea’s Digital Asset Security Framework Strengthens The Financial Security Institute, a key subsidiary of South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC), has formally restructured its internal organization. Specifically, the institute has bolstered the personnel and resources allocated to its digital asset security division. According to reports from Yonhap News Agency, this expansion explicitly includes enhanced monitoring and regulatory capabilities for stablecoins. Therefore, this development represents a proactive measure within Asia’s fourth-largest economy. South Korea maintains one of the world’s most active cryptocurrency trading markets. For instance, daily trading volumes on domestic exchanges frequently surpass those of traditional stock markets. However, this vibrant activity has historically coincided with security vulnerabilities and regulatory gaps. The FSI’s action follows a series of high-profile incidents, including exchange hacks and stablecoin de-pegging events globally. Accordingly, regulators are now prioritizing preemptive security measures over reactive responses. Strategic Reorganization and Regulatory Context The FSI’s team expansion occurs within a specific regulatory timeline. Initially, South Korea implemented the Travel Rule in 2021, mandating identity verification for cryptocurrency transactions. Subsequently, the Digital Asset Basic Act passed its first legislative hurdle in 2024, establishing comprehensive oversight. Now, the FSI’s enhanced team will operationalize these regulations through technical supervision and enforcement. This reorganization involves several key operational shifts: Enhanced Surveillance: The team will monitor real-time blockchain transactions for suspicious patterns. Stablecoin Oversight: Specialists will audit reserve assets backing Korean won-pegged stablecoins. Exchange Security Audits: Regular assessments of domestic trading platforms’ cybersecurity will increase. International Coordination: The team will collaborate with global regulators like the IMF and FATF. South Korea’s Digital Asset Regulation Timeline Year Regulatory Development Key Focus 2021 Travel Rule Implementation Transaction transparency 2023 Licensing System for Exchanges Market entry standards 2024 Digital Asset Basic Act Proposal Comprehensive legal framework 2025 FSI Security Team Expansion Operational enforcement capacity Expert Analysis on Systemic Risk Mitigation Financial security experts emphasize the systemic importance of this development. Professor Kim Jae-won from Seoul National University’s Blockchain Research Center notes, “The FSI’s move transitions digital asset regulation from theoretical frameworks to practical oversight. Specifically, a dedicated security team can conduct forensic analysis after incidents and develop preventive protocols.” Furthermore, this approach aligns with global financial stability recommendations from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The expansion also addresses technological convergence risks. For example, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and traditional banking interfaces create novel vulnerabilities. Accordingly, the FSI team reportedly includes specialists in smart contract auditing and cross-chain security. This technical depth enables regulators to understand emerging threats beyond basic exchange security. Impact on Domestic and International Markets Domestic cryptocurrency exchanges welcome this regulatory clarity. Upbit and Bithumb, South Korea’s largest trading platforms, have previously advocated for standardized security protocols. Consequently, the FSI’s enhanced oversight may reduce compliance uncertainty for legitimate operators. However, smaller platforms may face increased operational costs from mandatory security upgrades. Internationally, this development influences several areas: Stablecoin Issuers: Global stablecoin projects targeting the Korean market must now demonstrate robust reserve management. Foreign Investors: Institutional capital often requires clear regulatory frameworks before entering markets. Regional Standards: Asian neighbors like Japan and Singapore monitor South Korea’s regulatory approach for harmonization potential. Market data indicates positive initial reactions. The Korean won-pegged stablecoin market has shown increased trading volume stability following the announcement. Moreover, cybersecurity stocks related to blockchain monitoring have experienced notable gains on the Korea Exchange. These market movements suggest investor confidence in reduced systemic risk. Technological Implementation and Challenges The FSI’s expanded team will deploy advanced monitoring tools. These include blockchain analytics software tracking fund flows across wallets and exchanges. Additionally, the team will develop stress-test scenarios for major stablecoins, simulating market crashes or mass redemption events. This technical capability represents a significant advancement from previous manual reporting systems. Nevertheless, implementation challenges remain. Firstly, the global nature of cryptocurrency markets complicates jurisdictional enforcement. Secondly, rapidly evolving technologies like zero-knowledge proofs may obscure transaction visibility. Thirdly, recruiting sufficient expertise in a competitive global market presents human resource difficulties. The FSI reportedly addresses this through partnerships with academic institutions and competitive compensation packages. Conclusion South Korea’s Financial Security Institute has strategically expanded its digital asset security team, marking a pivotal evolution in the nation’s regulatory approach. This reorganization strengthens oversight capabilities for stablecoins and broader cryptocurrency ecosystems. Consequently, South Korea enhances its position as a regulated yet innovative digital asset market. The FSI’s action demonstrates how jurisdictions can balance security imperatives with technological advancement, potentially setting benchmarks for global digital finance regulation. FAQs Q1: What is the Financial Security Institute (FSI) in South Korea? The Financial Security Institute is a specialized agency under South Korea’s Financial Services Commission. It focuses on financial system stability, crime prevention, and cybersecurity across traditional and digital finance sectors. Q2: Why is the FSI expanding its digital asset security team now? The expansion responds to the growing market capitalization of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins in South Korea. Additionally, upcoming regulations like the Digital Asset Basic Act require enhanced enforcement capacity to protect investors and maintain financial stability. Q3: How will this affect cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea? Exchanges will likely face more rigorous security audits and compliance requirements. While this may increase operational costs, it also provides clearer regulatory guidelines that could attract more institutional investors to the market. Q4: What specific risks does the team address regarding stablecoins? The team focuses on verifying that stablecoin issuers maintain adequate reserve assets, preventing de-pegging events. It also monitors transaction patterns for market manipulation and ensures proper disclosure of reserve compositions to the public. Q5: Does this mean South Korea is becoming more restrictive toward cryptocurrencies? Not necessarily. The move represents a maturation toward structured regulation rather than outright restriction. The government aims to foster innovation within a secure framework, similar to how traditional financial markets operate with established oversight.

GLXY's integrated model—spanning global markets, asset management, and AI-driven data centers—supports robust revenue growth and operational efficiency. The Helios data center provides a unique moat, positioning GLXY for decades of expansion and premium AI infrastructure multiples. Issue a buy rating with a $40 price target, citing strong EPS momentum, valuation disconnect, and credible diversification, while acknowledging execution and regulatory risks. Investment Thesis Galaxy Digital ( GLXY ) offers an interesting opportunity as it works to transition from digital assets into a more diversified financial and data center operation. I feel very bullish on the company moving forward, given the firm 's efforts at developing diversified pillars for its operations. Combining the company 's blockchain-enabled investment bank with industrial-scale AI infrastructure gives it a stable base of revenue along with substantial upside as its AI efforts mature. This potential, combined with the stock 's current discounted trading value, suggests that this could be a strong play for investors that are looking for an AI infrastructure stock with solid growth potential. Galaxy 's Core Overview While I see it as easy for the market to focus excessively on Galaxy 's role in Bitcoin and the price of Bitcoin, I believe that its true strength is in its three-pronged operation. The company is a player in global markets, asset management, and digital infrastructure. Furthermore, I do not see these segments as operating in their own silos; rather, they form a symbiotic ecosystem. For example, the infrastructure arm provides the hardware for the financial segment. This strategy seems to be working, as the asset management sector has grown to $9 billion in total assets, which is also complemented by its substantial staking assets. These sizable assets serve as a critical base, as they effectively subsidize the research and development costs of the company 's more capital-intensive infrastructure projects. Furthermore, the global markets portion of the business continues to provide institutional-grade liquidity and lending. This capability acts as a strong entry point for large-scale capital allocators into the business. By controlling the entire vertical, Galaxy captures value at every point; this level of integration is a strength that its peers simply struggle to match. One of the key reasons that I am so bullish on the company is its long-term equity. The physical scale and potential earnings of its Helios site are substantial. This isn't just a server room; it's an industrial fortress that takes up over 1,500 acres. Owning the land and underlying power rights is a substantial moat in the AI age; while other firms struggle to find the rack space for GPUs, Galaxy has a facility that could allow for decades of horizontal expansion. The company has also secured renewable energy for its facility, which is another masterstroke as it guarantees low-cost power for the massive facility. Galaxy 's Moves Beyond Bitcoin I see the market as fundamentally mispricing Galaxy Digital by tethering its valuation to the volatile swings of Bitcoin; this oversight fails to account for the company 's aggressive transformation into a high-tier AI infrastructure provider. In addition to being a developing AI data center provider, it is also a premier blockchain-enabled investment bank . By rebranding from a crypto miner to an AI developer, management is successfully positioning GLXY to capture the premium multiples that are normally for high-growth technology firms. A key element of this is the crown jewel that is its Helios data center, which, when fully developed, could reach a value of $30 billion. Considering it has a current market cap of $9.61 billion , it shows the market is valuing the massive AI infrastructure as superior to its core crypto business. A key element of my bullish outlook for the company is its positioning to act as a bridge for traditional finance that is entering the on-chain economy; the recent collaboration with State Street ( STT ) to launch SWEEP, a tokenized private equity fund , serves as a proof of concept for this ambitious plan. I see this partnership as a massive win for the company 's credibility because it secures GLXY 's position as the infrastructure provider for trillion-dollar asset managers; this has the potential to turn digital asset volatility into steady recurring fee revenue. Comparing Galaxy to Its Major Peers The contrast between Galaxy and its peers represents a fundamental divergence in both its trajectory and strategy. For example, Galaxy has a top-tier ranking, which is a powerful endorsement of the firm 's multi-engine model. This stands in direct contrast to companies like Affiliated Managers Group ( AMG ) and StepStone Group ( STEP ), which are locked into the low growth of traditional capital markets. In this regard, I see Galaxy as operating in a different dimension, as its forward revenue growth of 366.74% is dwarfing the sector median of 7.33%. This adds to the argument that the company should be treated as a high-velocity technology platform rather than a legacy financial institution. GLXY Revenue Growth (William Davis) Another key aspect of my bullish outlook for the company is the seemingly glaring valuation gap that it has; the stock currently trades at a forward price/sales multiple of only 0.07x . This is a massive discount compared to the sector median, despite its rivals often having more bloated cost structures. For instance, SEI Investments ( SEIC ) carries a workforce of over 5,000 to manage its operations, whereas Galaxy has just north of 500. This lean organizational structure is a strength for Galaxy, as it is contributing to its elite efficiency; it allows the firm to generate strong revenues without the legacy overhead that acts as a cap for its major competitors. GLXY Valuation Gap (William Davis) Valuing Galaxy 's Future Stock Price I believe that there is a significant disconnect between Galaxy 's current valuation and its potential as it continues its pivot. One example of this is the market 's failure to capture the firm 's recent massive operational beat. While the consensus forward EPS is $0.57 , this figure appears increasingly weak when compared to the third quarter's actual performance of $1.01 per share. The fact that Galaxy beat its EPS estimates by such a large amount suggests that its earnings power of the core business is much stronger than the estimates are suggesting. EPS momentum (William Davis) Using a forward P/E approach allows me to estimate a potential target for the price moving forward. There are some challenges with this approach, as the Helio data center will need to be treated somewhat as a hidden asset that has a value that is not fully clear at the moment. When evaluating the company, it is reasonable to assume that it will largely maintain its 43.43x forward multiple. Multiplying this by the consensus EPS of $0.93 provides us with a projected value of $40.39. This shows that there is substantial upside to the stock and results in me issuing a buy rating. Risks to the Bullish Outlook for GLXY Infrastructure Execution Risks While Galaxy 's transformation into an AI data center provider is a major driver of its valuation rerating, it does introduce a significant layer of risk that its previous business model did not face. A very pressing one is the execution risks between the heavy CapEx phase and the anticipated cash flow. Unfortunately, a project of this scale will have the risk of potential delays that could slow the build-out. Any significant construction derailment or cost overruns could force the company to seek out additional funding and erode its terminal equity. Capital Structure Complexity Another issue that investors should be mindful of is the potential for shareholder dilution due to its aggressive capital-raising activities. In particular, the company undertook a $1.15 billion private offering of 0.50% exchangeable senior notes at $55.76 per share. This move has the potential to greatly expand the share count. While this approach to raising capital can provide a low-cost option for raising investment money, it can act as a drag on the immediate upside for equity holders. Power and Regulatory Volatility While Galaxy is undertaking an aggressive pivot to infrastructure, it still remains fundamentally tethered to the crypto market. The current political and regulatory environment is viewed as pro-crypto, and any shift in this sentiment could have major impacts on its large projects, such as the SWEEP tokenization initiatives. Another potential issue for the company is the volatility of the Texas ERCOT power grid; localized energy pricing can lead to extreme spikes in costs as a result of extreme weather. This could have a major impact on the company 's power-intensive AI workloads. While the company is attempting to use renewable energy sources to offset this risk, it still has the potential to dramatically alter the operating cost of the facility. Conclusion Given Galaxy Digital 's aggressive moves at diversification, I see it as rapidly becoming more than just a Bitcoin stock; it is a sophisticated infrastructure and financial services platform that seems to be mispriced by the market. While the potential execution risks must be acknowledged with its Helios build-out and macro-regulatory changes, the firm 's demonstrated history of efficiency and revenue growth provides a fair margin of safety. Even accounting for a disciplined forward P/E valuation and a conservative estimate of its infrastructure value, a price target of around $40 still seems like a reasonable target. As a result, I am confident in issuing a buy rating for the stock given this potentially substantial upside.",GLXY|GLXY:CA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-29 02:24:29

This price action marks a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency’s ongoing market cycle and reflects broader financial trends. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing the drivers behind this ascent, which follows a period of consolidation. This report provides a factual analysis of the surge, its market context, and potential implications. Bitcoin Price Breaks Key Resistance at $89,000 Market data from multiple monitoring platforms confirms Bitcoin’s rise above $89,000. The Binance USDT market, a leading global exchange, recorded a price of $89,072.21. This level represents a crucial technical and psychological resistance point that traders have watched closely. Historically, breaking such round-number thresholds often precedes increased volatility and trading volume. Furthermore, the move coincides with heightened institutional interest, as evidenced by recent filings with regulatory bodies. The price action follows a steady climb from support levels established earlier in the quarter. Several concurrent factors appear to support this bullish momentum. Firstly, on-chain data shows a decrease in Bitcoin held on exchanges, suggesting a trend toward long-term holding. Secondly, macroeconomic conditions, including monetary policy expectations, have created a favorable environment for alternative stores of value. Thirdly, network fundamentals remain strong, with hash rate near all-time highs. This combination of technical, on-chain, and macro factors provides a substantive backdrop for the current price level. Analyzing the Drivers of the Current Cryptocurrency Rally The rally extends beyond Bitcoin, with the broader digital asset market showing positive momentum. However, Bitcoin’s dominance—its share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization—has remained stable, indicating it is leading the charge. This pattern is typical in early phases of a sustained bull market. Key drivers include evolving regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions and the continued integration of blockchain technology by traditional finance. For instance, several major asset managers now offer spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs), providing a new conduit for capital. Market sentiment indicators have also shifted from fear to greed, according to established indexes like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. This shift often correlates with rising prices and increased retail interest. Importantly, liquidations in the derivatives market have been orderly, avoiding the cascading effects seen in previous volatile periods. The table below summarizes key comparative data from recent Bitcoin milestones. Price Milestone Approximate Date Reached Key Market Context $69,000 (Previous ATH) November 2021 Peak of retail mania, high leverage. $30,000 Q2 2023 Post-FTX collapse recovery, institutional scrutiny. $89,000 (Current) Present Institutional adoption, regulatory maturation, ETF inflows. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and currency devaluation concerns in several economies have renewed interest in Bitcoin’s properties as a borderless, censorship-resistant asset. Network upgrades, such as the implementation of Taproot, have enhanced its functionality and long-term viability. These fundamental improvements contribute to a stronger value proposition beyond pure speculation. Expert Perspectives on Sustainable Growth Financial analysts and blockchain researchers emphasize the changed market structure since previous peaks. The presence of regulated vehicles and corporate treasuries holding Bitcoin provides a more stable demand base. Experts from firms like Fidelity Digital Assets and academic institutions like the MIT Digital Currency Initiative often highlight the maturation of custody solutions and market infrastructure. This maturation reduces operational risk for large investors. Historical volatility, while still present, has decreased on a rolling annual basis compared to Bitcoin’s early years. Risk models now incorporate Bitcoin as a distinct asset class with a non-correlated return profile during specific market regimes. Quantitative analysts point to the stock-to-flow model and realized price metrics, which have acted as support levels during this cycle. However, experts uniformly caution that past performance never guarantees future results, and investors must assess their risk tolerance. The Technical and Fundamental Landscape for BTC From a technical analysis standpoint, the $89,000 break opens a path toward testing all-time highs. Key levels to watch include nearby resistance around $92,000 and support near $85,000. The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator on weekly charts shows sustained bullish momentum. Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings, however, suggest the asset is approaching overbought territory, which may lead to short-term pullbacks or consolidation. Hash Rate: The computational power securing the Bitcoin network continues to set new records, underscoring robust security and miner commitment. Active Addresses: The number of unique addresses participating in transactions has risen steadily, indicating growing network usage. Miner Revenue: Block rewards and transaction fees provide a multi-billion dollar annual incentive to maintain network integrity. Layer-2 Activity: Protocols like the Lightning Network facilitate faster, cheaper microtransactions, expanding Bitcoin’s utility. Fundamentally, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, expected in 2024, continues to be a focal point for long-term investors. This pre-programmed event reduces the new supply of Bitcoin issued to miners by 50%, historically creating a supply shock that precedes major bull markets. The current price action may, in part, reflect anticipation of this event. Network adoption metrics, such as the number of wallets holding non-zero balances, also continue an upward trajectory, painting a picture of gradual, organic growth. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise above $89,000 represents a significant milestone within a complex and maturing market landscape. This move is supported by a confluence of technical breakthroughs, improving fundamentals, and a more robust institutional framework. While volatility remains an inherent characteristic, the market structure today differs markedly from previous cycles, potentially leading to more sustainable price discovery. The Bitcoin price action will continue to be influenced by macroeconomic trends, regulatory developments, and the underlying network’s health. Observers should monitor trading volume, on-chain metrics, and broader financial conditions for signals of the trend’s next phase. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin trading at $89,000 mean for the average investor? It signifies a period of high market valuation and potential volatility. Investors should focus on their long-term strategy, understand Bitcoin’s risk profile, and never invest more than they can afford to lose. Diversification remains a core principle of sound investing. Q2: How does the current price compare to Bitcoin’s all-time high? Bitcoin’s previous all-time high was approximately $69,000, reached in November 2021. The current price of ~$89,000 represents a new record high, surpassing the previous peak by a significant margin. Q3: What are the main factors pushing the Bitcoin price higher? Primary factors include increased institutional adoption via ETFs, positive macroeconomic conditions for hard assets, the approaching halving event, strong network fundamentals like hash rate, and growing global adoption as a digital store of value. Q4: Is it too late to buy Bitcoin at $89,000? Financial advisors state that market timing is extremely difficult. Investment decisions should be based on personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and a long-term perspective, not solely on current price levels. Dollar-cost averaging is a common strategy to mitigate timing risk. Q5: Could the price drop sharply from here? Yes, cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. Sharp corrections are common even within strong bull markets. Prices can be affected by regulatory news, macroeconomic shifts, technological developments, or changes in market sentiment. Risk management is essential.

That is a significant jump in general, as the protocol is setting up for one more leg higher into early 2026. What is also increasing, and steadily rising through 2025, is the difficulty of inserting a new block into the Bitcoin ledger. At the beginning of the year, it was substantially below 110 trillion and rose in tandem with the increasing demand for mining hash power. In competitive situations, some miners increased production to afford the necessary equipment for gains. The current level is roughly 35% above January’s baseline, although still shy of the October peak , which was near 156 trillion. The rising difficulty reflects the overall growth in the network’s computational power. Analysts remain uncertain about what this major shift signals for Bitcoin, but it highlights both the resilience and the challenges faced by miners. More complexity leads to a more secure network, albeit at the expense of smaller miners who run less powerful machines, in part because their profit margins are thin. Rising hash power drives difficulty higher The Bitcoin network difficulty is directly proportional to the hashrate and adjusts itself every two weeks (or more precisely, every 2,016 blocks) to find new blocks approximately every 10 minutes. Bitcoin’s mining difficulty rises when blocks are mined too quickly and falls when they’re mined too slowly. At the last adjustment, the average time between blocks was roughly 9.95 minutes—slightly slower than the current pace. This acceleration has effectively acted as a difficulty booster. With hash power continuing to climb, analysts project that difficulty could once again reach new highs, potentially surpassing 149 trillion, assuming current conditions persist until the next adjustment, expected around January 8, 2026. The network’s hash rate, which measures the total computational power available to secure the network, continued to increase throughout much of 2025. It reached over 1,150 EH/s at its highest point in October before gradually declining later in the year. Even with that slight dip, hash power is still significantly higher than it was in January. Big companies and miners with industrial-scale operations have been driving this expansion, thanks to the use of expensive ASIC equipment and inexpensive power sources. Bitcoin difficulty rises and falls with mining power Difficulty serves as Bitcoin’s only safety valve at the protocol level. Blocks cannot be added too quickly, which ensures predictable issuance and helps maintain network stability. The mining challenge is recalibrated every 2,016 blocks, roughly every 10 minutes at the current hash rate. Bitcoin’s decentralized consensus not only resists certain attacks but also provides resilience, making the network disaster-tolerant. Greater difficulty also means that it takes more electricity and computer power to unlock each block. This can be margin-pressured, and with volatile price action on Bitcoin, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to support the network as electricity costs rise – a challenge in maintaining network strength amid heightened activity. The network is stabilized with minor oscillations.

This significant liquidation event primarily affected Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana perpetual futures contracts, revealing intense market pressure against bearish traders who bet on price declines. The concentrated nature of these liquidations provides crucial insights into current market dynamics and trader positioning across major digital asset exchanges. Crypto Shorts Liquidated: Analyzing the $64M Market Event The cryptocurrency derivatives market experienced substantial turbulence during the recent trading session. Forced liquidations occur when traders’ positions automatically close due to insufficient margin to maintain them. This process happens when prices move against leveraged positions, triggering automatic sell or buy orders that can exacerbate market movements. The $64 million liquidation total represents one of the more significant single-day events in recent months, particularly notable for its heavy skew toward short positions. Market analysts typically monitor liquidation data as a sentiment indicator and potential volatility predictor. When liquidations concentrate heavily on one side of the market, it often signals a potential reversal or acceleration of the prevailing trend. The data from this event shows an overwhelming majority of liquidations affected traders betting against cryptocurrency prices. Consequently, this suggests strong buying pressure overwhelmed bearish positions across multiple major assets simultaneously. Perpetual Futures Market Mechanics and Risks Perpetual futures contracts represent derivative instruments without expiration dates that track underlying asset prices. These contracts enable traders to employ significant leverage, sometimes exceeding 100x on certain platforms. While leverage amplifies potential profits, it simultaneously increases liquidation risks dramatically. The funding rate mechanism maintains price alignment between perpetual contracts and spot markets through periodic payments between long and short position holders. Several factors contributed to the recent liquidation cascade. First, unexpected positive regulatory developments in multiple jurisdictions created sudden bullish sentiment. Second, institutional accumulation patterns showed increased buying activity throughout the preceding week. Third, technical breakouts above key resistance levels triggered automated trading algorithms. Finally, reduced liquidity during certain trading hours amplified price movements when liquidations began occurring. Historical Context and Market Impact Analysis Comparing this event to historical data reveals important patterns. The March 2020 liquidation cascade exceeded $1 billion across all positions during extreme volatility. More recently, the August 2023 liquidations reached approximately $300 million during a similar short-squeeze scenario. The current $64 million event, while smaller in absolute terms, demonstrates concentrated pressure specifically on short positions rather than broad market liquidation. The market impact extended beyond immediate price movements. Exchange order books showed temporary depletion of buy-side liquidity during peak liquidation periods. Funding rates turned sharply positive across multiple platforms, increasing costs for maintaining short positions. Open interest data indicated some traders exited the market entirely rather than reopening positions. Market depth metrics revealed reduced liquidity at key price levels following the event. Asset-Specific Breakdown: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Analysis The liquidation distribution across major cryptocurrencies provides valuable insights into market dynamics. Bitcoin experienced $26 million in total liquidations, with short positions accounting for 88.83% of this amount. This exceptionally high percentage indicates overwhelming pressure against Bitcoin bears. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization often leads broader market movements, making its liquidation patterns particularly significant for overall sentiment. Ethereum followed with $28.6 million in liquidations, representing the largest absolute amount among the three major assets. Short positions comprised 80.75% of Ethereum liquidations. This substantial figure reflects both Ethereum’s significant derivatives market presence and particular sensitivity to recent network developments. The upcoming protocol upgrades and increasing institutional Ethereum products have contributed to renewed bullish interest. Solana recorded $10.34 million in liquidations with shorts representing 87.88% of the total. Despite having a smaller market capitalization than Bitcoin or Ethereum, Solana’s liquidations percentage relative to its market size was particularly notable. The asset has demonstrated higher volatility characteristics historically, which can lead to more frequent and severe liquidation events during market movements. 24-Hour Liquidation Breakdown by Asset Asset Total Liquidations Short Percentage Short Value Bitcoin (BTC) $26 million 88.83% $23.1 million Ethereum (ETH) $28.6 million 80.75% $23.1 million Solana (SOL) $10.34 million 87.88% $9.09 million Total $64.94 million 85.15% average $55.29 million Exchange Dynamics and Geographical Considerations Liquidation patterns varied significantly across different trading platforms. Major centralized exchanges including Binance, Bybit, and OKX accounted for approximately 85% of the total liquidations. Decentralized perpetual exchanges showed smaller but growing participation in these market movements. Regional analysis indicated Asian trading sessions experienced the initial liquidation wave, followed by amplification during European and American market hours. Exchange-specific mechanisms influenced the liquidation process. Platforms with higher maximum leverage limits generally experienced more severe liquidations. Those with more gradual liquidation processes helped prevent complete market dislocation. Insurance fund utilization varied across exchanges, with some platforms tapping these reserves to cover auto-deleveraging events. The concentration of liquidations on specific exchanges provides insights into where the most aggressive short positioning had accumulated. Trader Psychology and Risk Management Implications The liquidation event offers important lessons for trader risk management. Position sizing relative to account equity proved critical, with overleveraged accounts most vulnerable. Stop-loss placement strategies significantly affected outcomes, as clustered stop orders can create cascading effects. Diversification across assets provided limited protection during this correlated market movement. Monitoring funding rates and open interest changes offered early warning signals some traders utilized effectively. Psychological factors influenced trader behavior throughout the event. Confirmation bias led some traders to maintain losing positions despite contrary signals. Herd mentality contributed to concentrated positioning that exacerbated the liquidation cascade. Recency bias may have caused underestimation of volatility risks following a period of relative stability. Experienced traders emphasized the importance of emotional discipline and predefined risk parameters during such events. Regulatory Environment and Market Structure Evolution The current regulatory landscape influences liquidation dynamics significantly. Increased transparency requirements for derivatives exchanges have improved data availability regarding these events. Position limit implementations on some platforms have prevented excessive concentration that could cause market disruption. Reporting requirements help regulators monitor systemic risks in cryptocurrency derivatives markets. Market structure developments continue evolving in response to such events. Improved risk management tools now offer more sophisticated liquidation prevention options. Isolated margin modes have gained popularity as alternatives to cross-margin approaches. Decentralized insurance protocols provide additional protection mechanisms. Exchange competition has driven innovation in liquidation engine design to minimize market impact during forced position closures. Conclusion The $64 million crypto shorts liquidated event provides a compelling case study in cryptocurrency market dynamics. The overwhelming concentration on short positions across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana reveals significant market forces at work. This liquidation cascade demonstrates the inherent risks of leveraged derivatives trading while highlighting the sophisticated mechanisms governing modern cryptocurrency markets. As the industry matures, such events contribute to improved risk management practices, regulatory understanding, and market infrastructure development. The data from this 24-hour period will undoubtedly inform trader strategies and platform designs moving forward, potentially reducing the frequency and severity of similar events in cryptocurrency futures markets. FAQs Q1: What causes forced liquidations in cryptocurrency markets? Forced liquidations occur when traders’ leveraged positions automatically close due to insufficient margin. This happens when prices move against positions enough to trigger exchange liquidation protocols, which prevent account balances from going negative. Q2: Why were short positions specifically targeted in this event? Short positions faced concentrated liquidations because prices moved upward significantly against traders betting on declines. When prices rise, leveraged short positions lose value rapidly, triggering margin calls and automatic position closures. Q3: How do liquidations affect broader cryptocurrency prices? Liquidations can create feedback loops that amplify price movements. Forced buying to cover short positions can drive prices higher, potentially triggering additional liquidations in a cascade effect that increases volatility. Q4: Which exchanges experienced the most liquidations? Major centralized exchanges including Binance, Bybit, and OKX accounted for most liquidations. These platforms have the largest derivatives trading volumes and offer high leverage options that increase liquidation risks during volatile movements. Q5: Can traders prevent forced liquidations? Traders can reduce liquidation risks through careful position sizing, using stop-loss orders, maintaining adequate margin buffers, avoiding excessive leverage, and monitoring funding rates and market conditions regularly.

This surge, recorded on April 15, 2025, represents a pivotal psychological and financial threshold for the world’s premier cryptocurrency, sparking intense analysis across global financial markets. Consequently, this price action signals a potential new phase of institutional adoption and mainstream validation. Bitcoin Price Breaches the $90,000 Threshold The ascent past $90,000 marks Bitcoin’s highest nominal valuation in its 16-year history. Market data confirms sustained buying pressure on major exchanges, with Binance’s USDT/BTC pair serving as a primary liquidity pool. This milestone follows a consolidation period above the previous resistance level of $85,000. Analysts point to several concurrent factors driving this rally. For instance, increased spot Bitcoin ETF inflows have provided substantial buy-side support. Furthermore, macroeconomic conditions involving currency devaluation fears continue to push capital toward hard assets. Notably, the network’s fundamentals remain robust, with hash rates consistently hitting all-time highs. Analyzing the Catalysts Behind the Rally Multiple verifiable developments converged to propel Bitcoin’s price. Regulatory clarity in major economies has reduced uncertainty for institutional investors. Simultaneously, traditional finance giants have continued integrating cryptocurrency custody and trading services. The following table outlines key metrics from the week preceding the breakout: Metric Status Impact ETF Net Inflows Positive for 15 consecutive days Direct market buying pressure Network Hash Rate All-time high of 650 EH/s Enhanced security and miner confidence Active Addresses 1.2 million daily Strong underlying network usage Exchange Reserves Decreasing trend Reduced immediate selling pressure These data points collectively illustrate a market characterized by strong fundamentals and positive sentiment. Moreover, geopolitical tensions have historically correlated with increased Bitcoin adoption as a non-sovereign store of value. The current macroeconomic landscape, featuring elevated inflation in several G20 nations, continues this trend. Therefore, the $90,000 breakthrough is not an isolated event but the result of sustained, multi-factor demand. Expert Perspectives on Market Structure Market analysts emphasize the significance of the price discovery phase above $90,000. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced accelerated volatility after breaking major round-number resistances. However, the current market structure differs from previous cycles due to the substantial presence of regulated financial products. Veteran traders note that the derivatives market shows a healthy balance, with funding rates remaining neutral. This suggests a lack of excessive leverage that typically precedes sharp corrections. Consequently, the rally appears more organic and sustainable compared to past speculative peaks. The Historical Context and Future Trajectory Bitcoin’s journey to $90,000 represents a compound annual growth rate of approximately 150% since its inception. Each major price milestone has corresponded with a phase of increased public awareness and technological innovation. The $90,000 level now places Bitcoin’s market capitalization well above the GDP of many developed nations. Looking forward, several potential scenarios exist. The immediate technical analysis suggests the next significant resistance zones lie near $95,000 and $100,000. On-chain data indicates that a large volume of Bitcoin last moved between $80,000 and $90,000, potentially creating a strong support foundation. Nevertheless, investors must always consider volatility as an inherent market feature. Conclusion Bitcoin’s achievement of a $90,000 price represents a definitive moment in financial history, underscoring its evolution from a niche digital experiment to a globally recognized asset class. This milestone on the Binance exchange reflects deep liquidity and institutional participation. The convergence of strong network fundamentals, supportive macroeconomics, and growing regulatory frameworks provides a compelling narrative for continued observation. As the market enters this new price territory, all participants will closely monitor its ability to establish $90,000 as a durable support level for future growth. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin trading at $90,000 on Binance mean? It signifies that on the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, one Bitcoin can be purchased or sold for 90,000 Tether (USDT) stablecoins, representing its current market-determined value in that specific trading pair. Q2: What are the main reasons Bitcoin price reached $90,000? Primary drivers include sustained institutional investment through spot ETFs, favorable macroeconomic conditions encouraging hedge against inflation, continued network security improvements, and growing mainstream adoption as a digital reserve asset. Q3: How does the current Bitcoin rally compare to previous ones? The current rally features significantly more institutional capital, deeper derivatives markets, and trading within a clearer regulatory environment, which may contribute to different volatility characteristics compared to earlier, more retail-driven cycles. Q4: Could the Bitcoin price fall sharply after reaching $90,000? Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. While current on-chain and derivatives metrics do not show extreme over-leverage, price corrections are a normal part of market cycles and remain a possibility. Q5: What is the significance of the Binance USDT market for Bitcoin’s price? The Binance USDT/BTC pair is one of the world’s largest and most liquid cryptocurrency markets, often serving as a global price discovery benchmark due to its high trading volume and accessibility to international traders.

Emphasizing the seriousness of the situation, one of the nine board members pointed out that Japan’s real policy interest rate is currently the lowest in the world. This observation came during a two-day board meeting. In response, the members suggested that the BOJ should consider adjusting its monetary policy to address the effects of currency movements on prices. BOJ members outline the challenges faced in achieving a neutral policy rate Sources pointed out that the key takeaways from the two-day meeting clearly indicate that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is still working on a neutral policy rate. To support this claim, one member of the bank’s board clarified that, “We can say there is still a significant distance to reach the neutral interest rate.” After the member made this statement, the Governor of the BOJ , Kazuo Ueda, commented that they find it challenging to determine this level. Ueda made these remarks during a press conference just after the December 19 finding. At this particular moment, reports noted that a study carried out by the bank indicated that the neutral rate lies within a wide range of approximately 1% to 2.5%. The study also demonstrated that some members concurred with Ueda’s argument on the neutral rate and acknowledged the difficulty in identifying it. This situation prompted several members to present some suitable solutions to address the matter. One member proposed that it is prudent for the BOJ to embrace a flexible approach as it interprets this level. Another member argued that instead of focusing on a certain level, the bank should be flexible in making decisions regarding its policy. In the meantime, sources mentioned that the BOJ decided to raise its policy rate to 0.75% at the end of the two-day meeting. This percentage represented the policy rate’s all-time high since 1995. It is worth noting that markets were not shocked by this increase because they mostly anticipated this shift in policy rate. This was after Ueda hinted at the possibility of lowering the amount of monetary easing before the decision. Sanae Takaichi vows not to criticize Ueda’s plans Concerning Ueda’s decision to increase the BOJ’s policy rate, reports noted that the Governor pointed out the growing uncertainties surrounding the future. He noted this situation at a time when the government’s demand for cheap loans conflicts with a weakening yen, consequently increasing the prices set on imports. On the other hand, reports highlighted that the Prime Minister of Japan, Sanae Takaichi, is currently tackling issues related to a surge in the cost of living after previously describing the concept of raising rates as “stupid.” Since assuming her role in October of this year, the Japanese first female prime minister has refrained from criticizing the plans Ueda adopts in attempts to lower monetary easing, concentrating instead on addressing concerns about inflation. Nonetheless, sources highlighted that Takaichi should also consider adopting preventive measures to prevent bond yields from rising too rapidly as she prepares the government budget for 2026. This budget is typically released in late December. Meanwhile, reports from earlier this month noted that benchmark 10-year bond yields reached a level of 1.97%, marking the highest peak in 18 years. This situation triggered the Governor of the BOJ to issue a warning that they are surging “somewhat fast.” In a statement, Ryutaro Kono, chief Japan economist at BNP Paribas , argued that, “Given the Takaichi administration’s preference for low interest rates, we believe that rate hikes will likely happen about every six months,” adding that “the risk of the BOJ needing to speed up tightening due to currency changes is not small.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",Economy|BoJ,EN,0,0,ASIA|FIAT|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-29 04:16:55

However, the world’s largest cryptocurrency continues to face macroeconomic uncertainty, leaving analysts divided on whether the move can develop into a sustained rebound. Bitcoin rebounds Bitcoin found support above the $85,500 zone and began a recovery wave, climbing past $88,000 before breaking $90,000. According to the TradingView chart, Bitcoin hit an intraday high of 90,143. The move carried BTC almost to the Fibonacci retracement level of 90,883. The price is now trading above $89,942 and the 100-hourly simple moving average, a short-term positive signal. Currently, Bitcoin has potential upside targets at $90,200 and $90,500. Beyond that, bulls may test higher resistance zones near $91,500 and $92,000. Technical indicators are cautiously supportive: the hourly MACD is gaining momentum in bullish territory, while the hourly RSI has moved above the 50 level. Downside risks remain if recovery stalls The token has immediate support at $88,000, with stronger buying interest expected around $87,250. Below that, the next key support lies near $86,500. A deeper decline could push Bitcoin back toward $85,500, while a break below the $84,500 level may accelerate losses in the near term. These levels are closely watched as BTC continues to trade below its 365-day moving average, a critical long-term support indicator. Bitcoin has remained under this moving average since November, marking a break in the structural uptrend that began in 2023. Year-end pressure and macro uncertainty weigh on outlook Beyond short-term price action, Bitcoin is facing significant year-end pressure. The annual BTCUSD candle is set to close in the red unless Bitcoin can rise more than 3.5% above its yearly open of roughly $93,374. Market commentators have noted that failure to do so would mark the first post-halving year to close negatively. Bitcoin reached an all-time high above $125,000 in October, but a sharp market-wide correction soon followed. Since that peak, BTC has fallen by around 30%, forming a local bottom near $80,000 in November. This decline has fueled debate over whether the broader bull market has ended or if the move represents a prolonged correction. Macro factors remain central to the discussion. Lower interest rates typically support risk-on assets such as cryptocurrencies, but expectations for further easing have weakened. The US Federal Reserve delivered three 25 basis point rate cuts in 2025, yet Chair Jerome Powell’s comments at the December FOMC meeting suggested caution ahead. According to CME Group’s FedWatch tool, only 18.8% of investors expect a rate cut at the January meeting. As Bitcoin attempts to stay above $90,000, traders remain focused on key resistance levels and central bank policy signals, both of which are likely to shape price direction into 2026.

These regulations, effective January 1, 2026, fundamentally reshape how China’s digital currency ecosystem will operate and integrate with the traditional financial system. Digital Yuan Infrastructure Enters New Governance Phase The People’s Bank of China announced these guidelines through the 21st Century Business Herald, a respected financial publication. Consequently, the central bank will implement several structural changes to the digital yuan system. Specifically, the PBOC will include digital yuan in deposit reserves for the first time. Additionally, the central bank will classify digital wallets by liquidity levels. These measures represent a maturation of China’s CBDC project, which began pilot testing in 2020. China’s digital yuan, officially called the Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP), has undergone extensive testing across multiple cities. Moreover, the currency has seen transaction volumes exceeding 1.8 trillion yuan ($250 billion) since its inception. The new guidelines therefore build upon this substantial existing infrastructure. Financial analysts view these developments as crucial for several reasons. First, they provide regulatory clarity for financial institutions. Second, they enhance systemic stability. Finally, they position the digital yuan for broader international use. Structural Changes to Digital Currency Management The PBOC will establish a dedicated digital yuan management committee to oversee implementation. This committee will operate a center for both domestic and international operating systems. Furthermore, this centralized approach ensures continuous management and supervision. The guidelines specifically address several key areas: Deposit Reserve Inclusion: Digital yuan holdings will now count toward bank reserve requirements Wallet Classification: Wallets will be categorized by liquidity and usage patterns Governance Framework: Clear lines of authority and responsibility for CBDC operations International Systems: Separate but integrated systems for cross-border transactions These changes follow extensive consultation with commercial banks and payment platforms. Major financial institutions like Industrial and Commercial Bank of China have already begun preparing for the transition. Similarly, payment providers including Alipay and WeChat Pay are updating their systems accordingly. Expert Analysis on Financial System Integration Financial technology experts emphasize the significance of including digital yuan in deposit reserves. Dr. Li Wei, a CBDC researcher at Tsinghua University, explains this development. “This integration fundamentally changes how monetary policy interacts with digital currency,” she states. “By treating digital yuan similarly to physical currency in reserve requirements, the PBOC maintains control over money supply.” The wallet classification system introduces important distinctions between different types of digital holdings. High-liquidity wallets for daily transactions will have different rules than savings-oriented wallets. This approach mirrors existing distinctions in traditional banking products. Consequently, users will experience more tailored digital currency services. Financial institutions meanwhile gain clearer parameters for product development. Comparative Analysis with Other CBDC Projects China’s approach to digital currency infrastructure differs significantly from other major economies. The table below illustrates key distinctions: Country/Project Status Key Features Infrastructure Approach China (Digital Yuan) Advanced Implementation Two-tier distribution, offline capability Centralized management with commercial bank participation European Union (Digital Euro) Preparation Phase Privacy-focused design Decentralized technical infrastructure United States (Research) Early Exploration Bank-intermediated model Private sector partnership emphasis India (Digital Rupee) Pilot Testing Wholesale and retail versions Hybrid public-private infrastructure China’s digital yuan infrastructure now represents the most comprehensive CBDC framework globally. The inclusion in deposit reserves particularly distinguishes it from other projects. No other major economy has yet implemented this level of integration with traditional monetary tools. This advancement gives China first-mover advantage in several areas. Specifically, it enables more sophisticated monetary policy implementation. Additionally, it provides greater financial stability oversight. Timeline and Implementation Roadmap The PBOC has outlined a clear implementation timeline leading to the January 2026 effective date. Commercial banks must complete system upgrades by September 2025. Payment platforms face a November 2025 deadline for compliance testing.

International systems development will proceed concurrently with domestic preparations. The PBOC has already engaged with several foreign central banks regarding interoperability. These discussions focus particularly on cross-border payment efficiency. Hong Kong has served as an important testing ground for international digital yuan use. Successful experiments there inform the broader international system design. Impact on Financial Institutions and Consumers Commercial banks face both challenges and opportunities under the new guidelines. They must upgrade technical systems to handle reserve requirement calculations for digital yuan. However, they also gain clearer parameters for developing digital currency products. Consumer wallets will see enhanced features and protections. The classification system enables more tailored services based on usage patterns. Merchants accepting digital yuan will experience streamlined settlement processes. Transaction confirmation times may decrease significantly. Additionally, cross-border merchants gain access to more efficient payment channels. Small businesses particularly benefit from reduced payment processing costs. These economic efficiencies could stimulate broader digital yuan adoption. Conclusion The People’s Bank of China’s new guidelines fundamentally strengthen digital yuan infrastructure through systematic reforms. These measures position China’s CBDC for sustainable growth and international expansion. The inclusion in deposit reserves and wallet classification represent sophisticated monetary policy tools. Furthermore, the establishment of dedicated management structures ensures proper oversight. As January 2026 approaches, financial institutions worldwide will closely monitor this digital currency evolution. The digital yuan continues to set global standards for central bank digital currency implementation. FAQs Q1: When do the new digital yuan guidelines take effect?

Instead, the organization announced on November 26, 2024, a sophisticated ‘isolated recovery’ strategy developed through intensive collaboration with key ecosystem partners. This pivot represents a critical moment for blockchain incident response, balancing the need for user protection with the foundational principle of immutability. Flow Blockchain Hack Triggers Governance Crisis The incident began when attackers exploited a vulnerability, resulting in the unauthorized minting and theft of tokens valued at approximately $3.9 million. Consequently, the Flow Foundation’s initial proposed solution—a network-wide rollback to a state before the hack—sparked immediate and intense debate within the cryptocurrency community. Many participants criticized the proposal as a centralized, unilateral decision that contradicted the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology. Furthermore, a rollback would have invalidated all legitimate transactions processed after the exploit, creating significant operational headaches for exchanges, decentralized applications (dApps), and users. This community backlash forced the foundation to reassess its approach fundamentally. The Technical and Philosophical Dilemma of Rollbacks Network rollbacks, while technically possible for many blockchains, present a profound philosophical challenge. Essentially, they involve rewinding the entire chain’s history to a previous block, erasing all subsequent transactions. Proponents argue they are a necessary tool to rectify catastrophic failures or thefts. However, critics contend they undermine the very promise of finality and immutability that makes blockchain technology trustworthy. For instance, a rollback could reverse legitimate payments, settle bets that were already won, or nullify NFT purchases. The Flow Foundation’s initial rollback consideration highlighted this perennial tension between security and principle in the Web3 space. Isolated Recovery Plan: A Targeted Technical Solution Facing community pressure, the Flow Foundation pivoted to a more nuanced ‘isolated recovery’ plan. This strategy focuses containment on the specific addresses involved in the malicious activity, thereby preserving the integrity of the overwhelming majority of the network. The foundation outlined a multi-stage process developed with bridge providers, exchanges, and infrastructure partners. Network Restart: The Flow blockchain will resume operations with over 99.9% of accounts functioning normally. Targeted Account Restrictions: Only accounts that directly received the fraudulently generated tokens will face temporary restrictions. Forensic Verification & On-Chain Burn: An independent forensics agency will verify the illicit tokens, which will then be transparently burned on-chain, permanently removing them from circulation. Gradual Partner Reactivation: Bridges and exchanges will methodically resume services after confirming network stability. This approach aims to surgically address the hack’s impact without penalizing innocent users or compromising the chain’s historical record. Comparing Blockchain Recovery Methodologies The table below contrasts the abandoned rollback plan with the adopted isolated recovery strategy, highlighting key operational and philosophical differences. Aspect Network Rollback (Abandoned) Isolated Recovery (Adopted) Scope Network-wide; affects every user and transaction. Targeted; isolates specific malicious addresses. Transaction Finality Broken; legitimate post-hack transactions are reversed. Upheld; all valid transactions remain confirmed. User Impact High and widespread. Minimal, affecting only a tiny fraction of accounts. Centralization Risk High; decision made by a single entity. Lower; developed with broad ecosystem partners. Precedent Set Dangerous; suggests chain history is mutable. Responsible; focuses on containment and transparent remediation. Expert Analysis: A Watershed for On-Chain Governance Industry analysts view this episode as a significant case study in real-time blockchain governance. The community’s swift rejection of the rollback forced a more collaborative and technically precise solution. This dynamic demonstrates a maturation in how decentralized networks handle crises. The chosen path of isolated recovery, while complex, aligns more closely with the industry’s long-term goal of creating resilient and trustworthy systems without resorting to centralized overrides. Moreover, the plan’s reliance on third-party forensic verification and on-chain token burns aims to provide a transparent audit trail, enhancing overall trust in the recovery process. The Broader Impact on FLOW and Ecosystem Trust The immediate market impact on the FLOW token remains to be fully seen, but the foundation’s responsive pivot may mitigate long-term reputational damage. For developers building on Flow—particularly in gaming and NFTs—the decision to avoid a rollback provides crucial certainty. Their applications’ state and user interactions remain intact. This outcome is vital for maintaining developer confidence, which is the lifeblood of any blockchain ecosystem. The event also serves as a stark reminder for all projects to have robust, pre-vetted crisis response plans that incorporate community feedback mechanisms. Conclusion The Flow blockchain hack and the subsequent evolution of the recovery strategy from a full rollback to a targeted, isolated process mark a pivotal learning moment for the Web3 industry. The Flow Foundation’s ultimate decision prioritizes network integrity, minimizes user disruption, and respects the decentralized governance model. This incident reinforces that security responses must be as innovative as the technology itself, balancing effective remediation with unwavering commitment to core blockchain principles. The successful execution of this isolated recovery plan will likely set a new standard for handling similar exploits across the cryptocurrency landscape. FAQs Q1: What is a blockchain network rollback? A network rollback, or chain reorganization, is a process where a blockchain is reset to a previous block height, erasing all transactions that occurred after that point. Developers typically use it as a last resort to undo a major hack or bug, but it compromises transaction finality. Q2: How does ‘isolated recovery’ differ from a rollback? Isolated recovery targets and contains only the addresses directly involved in malicious activity. It freezes or restricts those specific accounts and removes illicit assets (via burning) without affecting the transaction history or balances of any other user on the network. Q3: Will normal FLOW users be affected by this recovery plan? The Flow Foundation states that over 99.9% of accounts will operate normally after the network restart. Only accounts that directly received the fraudulently minted tokens will face temporary restrictions during the forensic and burn process. Q4: What role do exchanges and bridges play in the recovery? Bridges and exchanges are critical infrastructure partners. They halted services to prevent the movement of illicit funds. They will gradually resume operations only after verifying the network’s stability and the successful containment of the exploited tokens. Q5: What does this incident mean for the security of the Flow blockchain? All blockchains face security challenges. This incident tests Flow’s crisis response and governance. The shift to a community-informed, isolated recovery plan demonstrates a proactive approach to security remediation focused on preserving trust and network integrity for the long term.

Opponents argue the measure could trigger an exodus of high-net-worth residents , disrupt local investment and innovation, and force equity sales to cover tax liabilities. Industry Backlash Builds: Capital Mobility and Exodus Risks The ballot measure, backed by Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, seeks to levy a one-time 5 percent tax on the net worth of Californians with assets exceeding $1 billion, with proceeds directed primarily toward healthcare and public services. Because the tax would apply in part to unrealized gains, increases in asset value that have not been sold, critics contend it could compel wealthy individuals to sell stock or portions of their businesses merely to cover the tax bill, even when no cash has been realized. Prominent crypto and tech leaders have reacted strongly. Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell posted on X that the tax could be “the final straw,” suggesting billionaires could relocate their spending, philanthropy, jobs, and capital out of California if the measure proceeds. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley echoed concerns that taxing unrealized gains would undermine the financial structure of private holdings and startup equity. A 5% theft of unrealized gains and assets taxes were already paid on is about the most retarded thing I've ever heard. I promise you this will be the final straw. Billionaires will take with them all of their spending, hobbies, philanthropy and jobs. Solve the waste/fraud issue. https://t.co/DKcNWni2kB — Jesse Powell (@jespow) December 28, 2025 Broader Political and Economic Debate The initiative must gather nearly 875,000 signatures to qualify for the November 2026 ballot. Proponents argue it offers a mechanism to address growing state budget shortfalls, particularly in healthcare, by tapping wealth that currently escapes taxation because most billionaires do not realize gains through sales of their assets. Supporters contend that annual wealth growth has far outpaced wage growth and that taxing accumulated wealth is a matter of equity. Opposition is not limited to the private sector. Some commentators warn that the proposed tax could diminish California’s competitiveness, accelerate capital flight to more tax-friendly jurisdictions, and ultimately reduce long-term tax receipts as wealthy residents and companies relocate.

This coordinated action immediately sent ripples through the global crypto market, highlighting the increasingly stringent application of South Korea’s Virtual Asset User Protection Act and its trading support guidelines. Consequently, the FLOW token, which powers the Flow blockchain designed for NFTs and web3 applications, now faces heightened scrutiny in one of the world’s most active crypto trading jurisdictions. Market analysts swiftly noted a double-digit percentage drop in FLOW’s trading value on these platforms following the announcement, underscoring the immediate financial impact of such watchlist placements. FLOW Delisting Watchlist: The Official Announcements and Immediate Fallout Upbit, Bithumb, and Coinone issued nearly identical statements on their respective websites. The exchanges clarified that placing FLOW on a watchlist is not an immediate delisting but initiates a detailed review period. They specifically referenced their internal virtual asset trading support review guidelines , which mandate monitoring for projects that may pose risks to investors. Key criteria triggering this action often include: Security Vulnerabilities or Hacking Incidents: A history of security breaches affecting the project or its core technology. Regulatory Non-Compliance: Failure to meet evolving local regulatory standards for disclosure or operations. Market Manipulation Concerns: Evidence or suspicion of trading activities that could harm users. Project Viability Issues: Significant disruptions in development, partnerships, or core protocol functionality. The exchanges emphasized their commitment to preemptive risk management , a principle reinforced by South Korea’s strict financial regulations. Historically, tokens placed on such watchlists have a mixed fate; some address the cited concerns and are removed, while others proceed to full delisting. For instance, the table below shows recent precedent from 2024: Token Exchange Watchlist Date Outcome Primary Cited Reason Project A Upbit Jan 2024 Delisted Insufficient disclosure Project B Bithumb Mar 2024 Warning Removed Enhanced security audit provided Project C Coinone Jul 2024 Delisted Regulatory non-compliance Market reaction was swift and pronounced. Trading volumes for FLOW on the affected exchanges spiked initially due to sell-offs, then contracted as caution set in. Meanwhile, the broader Flow ecosystem, including developers and NFT projects, began assessing potential long-term liquidity and access implications. Regulatory Context: South Korea’s Evolving Crypto Landscape This action cannot be viewed in isolation. It directly stems from the enforcement of South Korea’s Virtual Asset User Protection Act , which fully came into effect in July 2024. This landmark legislation mandates exchanges to implement rigorous listing and ongoing monitoring standards. Specifically, the law requires platforms to establish clear criteria for issuing investment warnings and delisting virtual assets to shield investors from sudden, catastrophic losses. Furthermore, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) maintain continuous oversight, pressuring exchanges to proactively manage risks. Consequently, exchanges now conduct regular reviews of all supported assets, often leading to synchronized announcements like the one concerning FLOW. This regulatory environment makes South Korea a bellwether for compliant crypto market operations, setting a precedent that other jurisdictions frequently observe. Expert Analysis on Security and Compliance Triggers Industry compliance experts point to the phrase “past security incidents such as hacking” as the likely core trigger. The Flow blockchain, while innovative, has undergone public scrutiny regarding its security architecture and smart contract vulnerabilities in previous years. For example, a notable incident in early 2023 involved an exploit on an NFT marketplace built on Flow, though not a direct breach of the core protocol. Under the new Korean law, exchanges bear greater liability for user losses; therefore, they err on the side of caution regarding any project with a publicly questioned security history. A former FIU official, speaking on background, noted that exchanges now prioritize technical due diligence reports and real-time security monitoring data over marketing promises. This shift represents a maturation of the market, moving from speculative trading towards institutional-grade risk assessment frameworks. Potential Impacts on the Flow Ecosystem and Market Precedent The implications extend far beyond FLOW’s spot price. Firstly, projects and decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Flow blockchain may face reduced visibility and accessibility for Korean users, a key demographic in the NFT and gaming sectors. Secondly, other exchanges globally may initiate their own reviews, creating a domino effect of compliance checks. Thirdly, the development team behind FLOW must now engage transparently with the exchanges to address concerns, likely requiring published audit results and enhanced security documentation. Market data from similar past events suggests a 60-day critical window where the project’s response dictates the final outcome. Successful resolutions often involve third-party security firms and direct dialogue with exchange compliance teams. Ultimately, this event underscores a global trend: regulatory compliance and proven security are becoming non-negotiable prerequisites for mainstream crypto exchange support, surpassing technological novelty alone. Conclusion The placement of FLOW on the delisting watchlists by Upbit, Bithumb, and Coinone serves as a potent case study in the new era of cryptocurrency regulation. Driven by South Korea’s stringent Virtual Asset User Protection Act, this action highlights the paramount importance of security history and proactive risk management for blockchain projects. The immediate market impact on the FLOW token demonstrates the significant power wielded by compliant exchanges in shaping asset viability. Moving forward, the resolution of this FLOW delisting watchlist review will be closely monitored as a benchmark for how projects can successfully navigate heightened regulatory scrutiny through transparency, technical rigor, and direct engagement with regulatory frameworks. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when an exchange places a token on a ‘delisting watchlist’? It means the exchange has identified potential risks associated with the token and is initiating a formal review period. The token remains tradable for now, but it is under heightened scrutiny and could be delisted if the concerns are not adequately addressed by the project team. Q2: Why did South Korean exchanges target FLOW specifically? The exchanges cited “potential risks to users” and referenced guidelines considering past security incidents. While not specifying details, this likely relates to historical security audits or events within the broader Flow ecosystem that raised compliance flags under Korea’s strict new user protection laws. Q3: Can FLOW be removed from the watchlist? Yes. If the team behind the Flow blockchain provides sufficient evidence and remediation to satisfy the exchanges’ compliance and security concerns—such as new audit reports or enhanced protocol safeguards—the warning can be lifted, and normal trading status restored. Q4: How does South Korea’s Virtual Asset User Protection Act influence this? The Act, enforced since July 2024, makes exchanges legally responsible for protecting users. It forces them to establish strict listing/delisting criteria and conduct regular reviews. This action on FLOW is a direct result of exchanges applying these mandated risk management protocols. Q5: What should FLOW holders on these exchanges do now? Holders should monitor official announcements from Upbit, Bithumb, and Coinone closely. They should review the exchanges’ specific guidelines for watchlisted assets, which may include changes to trading pairs or wallet services. Diversifying holdings across multiple compliant platforms is also a common risk-mitigation strategy.

While emphasizing his advocacy for Bitcoin, Armstrong had warned government officials to take immediate action to combat the fiscal deficit, “I love Bitcoin, but a strong America is also super important for the world. We need to get our finances under control.” At the time, US debt was just shy $37 trillion. Around the same time, economists Charles Collyns and Michael Klein also warned that if fiscal debt continues to rise, more reserve currencies alongside the dollar could emerge. The Bitcoin executive’s recent comments come at a time when the country’s public debt has already exceeded $38 trillion, and its debt-to-GDP ratio has surpassed 120%. Nonetheless, he believes Bitcoin will support the weakening US dollar and can control inflation and fiscal overspending. US consumers are still feeling the squeeze of high prices on food and household items. In September, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate stood at 3%, up from 2.3% in April, before most tariffs were introduced. Nonetheless, according to Bank of America’s latest outlook, inflation pressures are expected to ease after a brief uptick in the first quarter of 2026. Other analysts also anticipate that core inflation in the US will moderate in 2026. Armstrong criticised attempts to reopen the GENIUS Act Recently, Armstrong also spoke against the attempts to reopen the GENIUS Act. He claimed banks are using their influence in Washington to stifle competition from stablecoins and fintech platforms, adding that he was impressed by how the institutions have avoided public backlash so far. Moreover, he insisted that Coinbase would push back against any attempt to amend the law, noting that reopening the legislation would only slow innovation instead of improving consumer protection. So far, he has described the current push against stablecoin yields as “100% wasted” and “unethical,” predicting that banks will later ‘realize the benefits and advocate for it. Several other critics of the bank’s move believe the legislation strikes the right balance between consumer protection and innovation, despite banks claiming that competition remains skewed. Max Avery, one of the board members and business development leaders at Digital Ascension Group, even warned that proposed changes could be far broader than outright bans on direct interest and limit benefits, such as the sharing of yields with platforms or intermediaries. Stablecoin rewards, he said, challenge the traditional banking model by returning part of the interest to consumers. Banks today generate approximately 4% on Fed-held reserves, compared to virtually zero for ordinary consumers with savings accounts. He pointed out that despite banks’ supposed ‘safety concerns,’ research suggests that stablecoins are not causing outsized withdrawals from smaller banks.

At the same time, geopolitical tensions resurfaced in East Asia as China announced large-scale military drills around Taiwan. In crypto markets, Bitcoin staged a notable rebound, climbing back above the $90,000 mark, though uncertainty over the broader macro backdrop continues to cloud its outlook. Asian markets advance on rate-cut expectations Asian equities pushed higher on Monday, with MSCI’s broadest Asia-Pacific index rising 0.40% to its highest level since early October. The index has gained more than 25% this year, driven largely by technology stocks as enthusiasm around artificial intelligence remained strong into year-end. South Korea’s Kospi jumped 1.87% to a near two-month high, taking its annual gains to about 75%, its strongest performance since 1999. Taiwan’s benchmark index rose 0.8% to a record high, while Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.3%. Markets were supported by expectations that the US Federal Reserve would continue cutting interest rates next year. The dollar hovered near its lowest level in almost three months, with the dollar index down slightly on the day and on track for a near 10% decline for the year, its steepest drop since 2017. Investor attention during the holiday-shortened week is expected to focus on the minutes from the Fed’s most recent policy meeting, due Tuesday. The central bank cut rates earlier this month and projected just one more cut next year, even as traders continue to price in at least two. Precious metals pull back after parabolic rally Precious metals retreated on Monday after a powerful rally earlier in the session and over the year. Silver briefly surged above $80 per ounce for the first time before sliding sharply in volatile trading. Spot silver later fell 1.3% to $78.12 per ounce, after touching an all-time high of $83.62. Gold eased as well, slipping about 0.4% to $4,512.74 per ounce after hitting a record high of $4,549.71 on Friday. Platinum and palladium also pulled back after reaching all-time highs, with palladium dropping as much as 8%. Analysts said profit-taking and easing geopolitical tensions weighed on prices. Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo, said in a Reuters report that precious metals have been lifted this year by rate-cut expectations, supply concerns, and hedging against geopolitical and fiscal uncertainty, but warned that the late-year surge has increased volatility risks. Despite the pullback, the broader outlook remains supportive. Silver has surged 181% year-to-date, while gold is up around 72% in 2025, aided by expectations of lower rates, central bank demand, and diversification away from the dollar. China announces large-scale drills around Taiwan Geopolitical risks returned to focus after China announced it would conduct live-fire military drills around Taiwan on December 30. The exercises, dubbed “Justice Mission 2025,” will involve the People’s Liberation Army’s Eastern Theater Command and include army, navy, and air force units. Beijing said the drills are intended to test its ability to carry out precision strikes against key targets. Taiwan responded by calling on China to halt what it described as irresponsible provocations, while placing its own forces on high alert. Bitcoin rebounds above $90,000 Bitcoin showed renewed strength on Monday, surging past $90,000 after weeks of pressure. The cryptocurrency found support above $85,500 and climbed above $88,000 before reaching an intraday high of $90,143, according to TradingView data. The move brought Bitcoin close to the Fibonacci retracement level near $90,883. The price is now trading above $90,038 and its 100-hourly simple moving average, a short-term positive signal. Upside targets are seen around $90,200 and $90,500, with further resistance near $91,500 and $92,000. However, downside risks remain. Immediate support lies at $88,000, followed by $87,250 and $86,500. Bitcoin continues to trade below its 365-day moving average, a key long-term indicator, and faces year-end pressure. Unless it rises more than 3.5% above its yearly open of about $93,374, Bitcoin is set to close the year in the red.

To remain viable, treasury companies are expected to adopt more structured financial management, generate consistent returns, and align with certain traditional finance standards. Crypto Treasury Companies May Not Survive 2026 Digital asset treasury (DAT) companies are heading into 2026 under more pressure, and industry executives warn that many of the firms that emerged during the recent crypto cycle may not survive the next market downturn. After a rapid expansion in 2025, when dozens of crypto-focused treasury companies launched to give public market investors exposure to digital assets, sentiment shifted sharply as falling token prices and investor scrutiny weighed on valuations. Altan Tutar, co-founder and CEO of MoreMarkets, said in a recent interview that the outlook for DATs is bleak as the market becomes overcrowded. He argued that many crypto treasury firms are struggling to justify their market capitalization relative to the value of the assets they hold. Altan Tutar According to Tutar, companies focused on altcoins are likely to be the first casualties, as they may find it difficult to maintain valuations above their net asset value. He also suggested that treasuries centered on major assets like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP could eventually face similar challenges unless they offer something beyond simple accumulation. In his view, only those companies that generate consistent returns from their holdings and share that value with stakeholders are likely to endure. Similar concerns are shared by Ryan Chow , co-founder of Solv Protocol, who pointed out that the number of companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets surged from roughly 70 at the beginning of 2025 to more than 130 by midyear. Chow warned that simply holding Bitcoin is not a guaranteed growth strategy and predicted that many of these firms will fail during the next market downturn. He explained that the strongest performers have treated their crypto reserves as part of a broader yield and liquidity strategy by using on-chain tools to generate sustainable income or access capital during periods of stress. In contrast, companies that framed accumulation primarily as a marketing tactic have often been forced to sell assets to cover operating costs. Vincent Chok , CEO of stablecoin issuer First Digital, believes that competition from crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is intensifying the pressure on treasury companies. With ETFs offering regulated exposure and, in some cases, yield features, investors see them as a simpler and safer alternative. Vincent Chok Chok argued that for DATs to remain relevant, they must evolve toward more traditional financial standards, including stronger governance, transparency, and integration with established financial infrastructure. Treating Bitcoin or other digital assets as just one component of a diversified and professionally managed financial plan, he said, will be essential if these companies hope to compete with ETFs and survive into the next cycle.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-29 05:30:00

The company emphasized that the breach only affected customer names, email addresses, some order histories, and home addresses, not payment and login details. The South Korean-founded and U.S.-headquartered online retail giant stated on December 29 that customer compensation is expected to restore trust, taking responsibility for the recent personal user data breach. The compensation plan is expected to cover approximately 37.7 million former and current customers. Meanwhile, the sequential payments of about 50,000 won (~$34.87) per person are scheduled to begin on January 15, 2026. Each customer is expected to receive four purchase vouchers, including Coupang Eats worth ~$3.49 (5,000 Won), Rocket Direct Purchase, Seller Rocket, Rocket Delivery, and all Coupang Marketplace products (5,000 Won), Coupang Travel products worth ~$13.95 (20,000 Won), and Allux products (20,000 Won). Rogers says company executives deeply reflecting Coupang’s interim CEO, Harold Rogers, said the company’s executives and employees are deeply reflecting on the extent of harm the recent data leak has caused the affected customers. Preparing a compensation plan is part of the company’s responsible measures for its customers. The compensation plan is also a response to harsh criticism from major South Korean organizations. “All of Coupang’s executives and employees are deeply reflecting on how much concern and anxiety the recent personal information leak has caused our customers.” – Harold Rogers , Interim CEO at Coupang The South Korean company said all affected customers can check their eligibility on the Coupang app starting January 15, 2026. Eligible customers can apply for the offer when purchasing products. Further details will be announced separately. Meanwhile, Rogers believes that the incident is an opportunity for his company to practice customer-focused service provision and fulfill its responsibility to the end. Coupang has also warned its customers not to click on random links from suspicious sources and to report any unknown activity. The company further urged its customers to exercise caution against text messages and phone calls that impersonate Coupang. Seoul police identify Chinese national as main suspect The Seoul National Police Agency identified a 43-year-old Chinese national, who was a former employee, as the primary suspect. The suspect had worked at Coupang from November 2022 to 2024, somehow retaining access to internal systems. The Second Vice Minister Ryu Je-myung said the attacker used the company’s electronic coupon key, which is required to access Coupang’s servers. Meanwhile, the investigations revealed that the data breach lasted from late June to early November. The incident has also led to an increase in phishing activity, with several reports of Coupang impersonation. The Seoul police have reportedly been gathering records, including internal documents, logs, system records, user credentials, access histories, and IP addresses, to understand how the suspect gained access to the company’s system. Meanwhile, a major customer exodus is underway as the company continues to face intense government and legal scrutiny. Nearly two-thirds of South Korea’s population is reportedly affected by the recent data breach. Data retrieved from the IGAWorks-owned data analytics platform, Mobile Index, revealed that Coupang’s daily active users (DAUs) declined from the record high of 17.99 million on December 1 to 15.94 million on December 6. Mobile Index said the reversal followed a short period of surge in app traffic as customers rushed to either delete their accounts or change their passwords. Some of the South Korean customers appear to have moved to rival companies, such as Gmarket, which saw its DAUs jump by 5.8% from 1.36 million to 1.43 million between November 29 and December 5. 11th Street also saw a 14.33% increase in traffic, while Naver Plus Store’s traffic rose 23.1%.

The new generation central bank digital currency (CBDC) framework, management and operational mechanism will be officially launched on January 1, 2026, a Chinese business daily reported on Monday. Lu Lei, Deputy Governor of the PBOC, outlined the attributes of the modern digital yuan, including its issuance and circulation within the financial system. He stressed that technical support and supervision will be provided by the central bank. It will have “the functions of a measure of monetary value, store of value, and cross-border payment,” he added. The focus on the CBDC comes after a decade of development and testing. “In 2016, China proposed a two-tier operating system for the digital yuan. After ten years of practical testing, it has gained widespread recognition from central banks and international organizations worldwide, becoming a universal standard for digital currencies and a fundamental system for ensuring the internal circulation of the monetary system and safeguarding financial stability.” Commercial Banks to Pay Interest to Customers Based on Crypto Balances Further, Lu Lei rolled out a “two-tier architecture” within the action plan, which clarifies that banking institutions having digital yuan wallets will pay interest to clients based on the amount of digital asset they hold. “This arrangement forms a compatible incentive arrangement,” he said, adding that banks can independently manage the assets and liabilities of their digital yuan wallet balances. The move comes months after China established a new digital yuan operations center in the nation’s financial hub, Shanghai. The establishment will focus on three major platforms, including a cross-border payment rail, blockchain services and a crypto platform. Additionally, at the management level, the action plan noted that the PBOC will establish a Digital RMB Management Committee to coordinate business lines and conduct supervision within responsibilities. China’s Digital Yuan Recoup Plan After Setbacks The nation witnessed setbacks after its multilateral cross-border payment platform, dubbed mBridge, faced shutdown talks. A year ago, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) withdrew from the project following concerns that the underlying technology could be a tool to circumvent sanctions and potentially undermine the dollar’s dominance in the global financial system. Besides, despite an ambitious CBDC rollout in 2019, user reluctance and competition from entrenched mobile payment systems continue to impede its progress. Charles Chang, director of the Fintech Research Centre at Fudan University, explained that “the digital yuan is facing some bottlenecks in adoption today.” The post China’s PBOC Issues ‘Action Plan’ to Strengthen Digital Yuan Starting January 2026 appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|China|Digital Yuan,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-12-29 05:53:24
56529144,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=255463,1766987711,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Zerobase ZBT Surge Triggers Stunning $1.2 Million Liquidation Cascade,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/zerobase-zbt-surge-liquidations-analysis/,"BitcoinWorld Zerobase ZBT Surge Triggers Stunning $1.2 Million Liquidation Cascade In a dramatic display of market volatility, the Zerobase (ZBT) token executed a staggering 55% price surge within a mere five-hour window on March 21, 2025. This explosive move precipitated a cascade of forced liquidations totaling $1.2 million, primarily impacting over-leveraged short positions. The event underscores the inherent risks and powerful momentum shifts within the cryptocurrency derivatives market. Analyzing the Zerobase ZBT Surge and Liquidation Event Data from the analytics platform Coinglass confirms the scale of the liquidation event. The $1.2 million in liquidated positions overwhelmingly consisted of short bets against the ZBT token. Consequently, this created a classic short squeeze scenario. Traders who borrowed ZBT to sell, anticipating a price drop, faced margin calls as the price rose sharply. Furthermore, their forced buying to cover positions added fuel to the rally’s fire. The epicenter of this activity was the South Korean exchange Upbit. There, ZBT’s price briefly touched approximately 270 Korean Won. Trading volume spiked exponentially during the event, indicating intense market participation. Zerobase’s total market capitalization now stands near $44 million following this revaluation. Context and Mechanics of a Cryptocurrency Short Squeeze Understanding this event requires a grasp of derivatives trading. Traders use leverage to amplify potential gains, but this also magnifies risks. When a heavily shorted asset like ZBT begins a rapid ascent, automated systems liquidate positions to prevent further losses for lenders. This liquidation process involves buying the asset, creating additional upward pressure. Several factors can ignite such a squeeze: Positive Catalyst: Unconfirmed news, a major exchange listing rumor, or a significant protocol update. Low Liquidity: Tokens with smaller market caps like ZBT are more susceptible to large order imbalances. High Funding Rates: Persistently negative funding rates on perpetual swap markets can incentivize a long-side correction. Key Metrics of the ZBT Surge Event Metric Detail Price Increase ~55% in 5 hours Total Liquidations $1.2 Million Primary Position Type Liquidated Short Positions Key Trading Venue Upbit (South Korea) Approximate Price at Peak 270 KRW Current Market Cap ~$44 Million Expert Perspective on Market Structure and Risk Market analysts often examine such events through the lens of market structure and trader positioning. The dominance of short liquidations suggests the market was overly pessimistic on ZBT in the near term. A sudden shift in sentiment or a coordinated accumulation by large holders, often called “whales,” can trigger the initial move. Subsequently, the derivatives market mechanics take over, exacerbating the price movement. This event serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with leveraged trading, especially for altcoins. While the Zerobase project may have its own fundamentals, short-term price action can become decoupled and driven purely by technical factors and crowd psychology. Risk management, including stop-loss orders and conservative leverage, is paramount in such environments. The Zerobase Protocol and Its Market Position To provide full context, Zerobase (ZBT) operates as a utility token within its native ecosystem. The project aims to provide zero-fee trading and decentralized finance solutions. Prior to this surge, ZBT had traded with relatively low volatility for several weeks. Its modest $44 million market cap places it in the small-cap altcoin category, which is typically more volatile than larger assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The concentration of volume on Upbit is also noteworthy. South Korean exchanges often exhibit the “Kimchi Premium,” where prices for certain cryptocurrencies trade higher than on global platforms due to local demand and capital flow restrictions. This can create isolated market dynamics that differ from the broader global crypto market. Conclusion The dramatic Zerobase ZBT surge and its accompanying $1.2 million liquidation event highlight the intense and interconnected nature of modern cryptocurrency markets. It demonstrates how derivatives trading can accelerate price movements in both directions. While the immediate cause may remain unclear, the outcome provides a clear case study in market mechanics, leverage risk, and the volatile nature of smaller-cap digital assets. Market participants should analyze such events for lessons on volatility management and the powerful feedback loops present in crypto trading. FAQs Q1: What caused the Zerobase (ZBT) price to surge 55%? The exact immediate catalyst is unconfirmed, but the rapid price increase triggered a short squeeze, where rising prices forced traders with leveraged short positions to buy back ZBT to cover their losses, accelerating the rally. Q2: What does $1.2 million in liquidations mean? It means that $1.2 million worth of leveraged trading positions were automatically closed by exchanges because the traders’ collateral fell below the required maintenance margin. Most of these were bets that the ZBT price would fall. Q3: Why is Upbit exchange significant in this event? Upbit is a major South Korean exchange where ZBT saw its highest quoted price (~270 KRW) and a significant spike in trading volume, indicating it was a primary venue for the price discovery and liquidation activity. Q4: Is a short squeeze common in cryptocurrency markets? Yes, due to high leverage availability and volatility, short squeezes (and their opposite, long squeezes) are recurring events, particularly in smaller market cap tokens like ZBT which have lower liquidity. Q5: What is the current market capitalization of Zerobase (ZBT)? Following the price surge, Zerobase’s total market capitalization is approximately $44 million, reflecting the new, higher price of the token multiplied by its total circulating supply.

The last quarter of the year has been especially brutal, with the cryptocurrency’s price down more than 29% in Q4 2025. Despite this abysmal performance, things have failed to turn around, with technical indicators continuing to point to further decline for the altcoin. The latest of these is the appearance of a descending triangle structure, that carried the promise of further downside. Ethereum Price Is Still Not Bullish As crypto analyst Alpha Trade Scope points out in a TradingView post, the Ethereum price chart is still showing major signs of weakness. For example, the digital asset saw its price crash below a descending trendline, and this has marked the continuation of the downtrend that began three months ago. Related Reading: XRP Supply Dwindles While ETFs Go On A Buying Spree Before 2026 The current price trend has led to the formation of a descending triangle structure, which emerged after the cryptocurrency completed an impulse move. Not only this, the trend of recording lower highs has been evidence of the increased selling pressure on the cryptocurrency. Doing this below the aforementioned descending trendline just lends credence to the fact that the downtrend is not over. There has also been a major shift in the market structure of the Ethereum price. For one, there was a Change of Character (CHoCH), which shows that the Ethereum price is no longer bullish, but is rather more bearish at this point. Resistance has also mounted at the $3,000 level over time, and the price has been trading well below this resistance for a while now. Also, the Ethereum price is caught in a tight range, trading within the Fair Value Gap (FVG) mapped out between $2,930 and $2,960. This shows the rising resistance at this level, that could serve as a rejection in the case of a recovery attempt. How Low Can The ETH Price Go? If the current bearish trend holds and the Ethereum price does get rejected, then the first target for the downside lies at $2,815. This first target serves as the first support for the cryptocurrency and the destination for an initial liquidity sweep as investors sell into the decline. However, it is not the final target. Related Reading: What Does XRP Really Do? Expert Explains What It Is Built For In the case of a further break, then $2,800 is expected to give way, leading to the second major target at $2,748. This target is more of a major demand zone and is more likely to trigger a bounce due to the mounting buying pressure at this point. “The chart presents a classic bearish continuation setup, favoring downside expansion if support breaks with confirmation,” the analyst said.

56529331,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=255462,1766988011,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Trend Research Purchases Additional 11,520 ETH in a Strategic $34.9 Million Power Move",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trend-research-ethereum-purchase-accumulation/,"BitcoinWorld Trend Research Purchases Additional 11,520 ETH in a Strategic $34.9 Million Power Move In a significant institutional move that signals continued confidence in the Ethereum ecosystem, Trend Research, the analytical subsidiary of prominent venture firm LD Capital, has executed a major cryptocurrency acquisition. According to blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain, the firm purchased an additional 11,520 ETH, valued at approximately $34.93 million, further expanding its already substantial digital asset portfolio. This transaction represents another strategic step in a calculated accumulation strategy that began months earlier, ultimately raising the firm’s total Ethereum holdings to a remarkable figure exceeding 580,000 ETH. The purchase, verified through on-chain data analysis, provides a clear window into the investment thesis of sophisticated market participants during a period of evolving regulatory and technological landscapes for digital assets. Trend Research ETH Purchase Details and Market Context Blockchain intelligence serves as the foundational evidence for this transaction. Lookonchain, a respected on-chain analytics provider, reported the movement of funds from a known Trend Research wallet. The firm acquired the 11,520 ETH at an average price point that reflects recent market valuations. Furthermore, analysis reveals this is not an isolated event but part of a longer-term strategy. Trend Research reportedly initiated its accumulation of Ethereum in November of the previous year, entering the market when ETH prices hovered around $3,400. This timeline is crucial for understanding the firm’s cost basis and its apparent conviction through various market conditions. The scale of the total holding—over 580,000 ETH—positions Trend Research as a major entity within the Ethereum network, potentially influencing staking dynamics and governance considerations. To understand the magnitude of this holding, consider comparative metrics. The reported 580,000+ ETH is equivalent to roughly 0.48% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply. This scale places the firm’s holdings in a league comparable to some known exchange wallets or large decentralized finance treasuries. The purchase also arrives during a period of significant network upgrades for Ethereum, including the continued development of layer-2 scaling solutions and anticipated improvements to transaction efficiency. Consequently, market analysts often interpret such sustained accumulation by a research-driven subsidiary as a bullish signal based on fundamental network progress rather than short-term price speculation. Institutional Crypto Investment Strategy Analysis The actions of Trend Research offer a textbook case study in institutional-grade cryptocurrency investment strategy. Unlike retail traders, institutional players typically employ methodical, data-driven approaches. Firstly, Trend Research operates as a subsidiary of LD Capital, a venture firm with a documented history in blockchain and technology investments. This structure implies the ETH accumulation is likely backed by deep fundamental research, technical analysis of the Ethereum protocol, and macroeconomic assessments. Secondly, the strategy exhibits clear hallmarks of dollar-cost averaging and strategic positioning. By beginning purchases in November and continuing through the recent transaction, the firm avoids attempting to time the market’s absolute bottom and instead builds a position over time. Expert Angle on Portfolio Allocation and Risk Management Financial analysts specializing in digital assets point to several rationales for such a sizable allocation. A primary driver is portfolio diversification. For a venture capital firm like LD Capital, Ethereum represents a non-correlated asset class with unique growth drivers tied to technological adoption. Furthermore, Ethereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism has transformed it into a yield-generating asset. Holding hundreds of thousands of ETH allows Trend Research to participate in network validation, earning staking rewards that compound the value of the position. This creates a dual return profile: potential capital appreciation and ongoing yield. From a risk management perspective, the sheer size of the holding also suggests sophisticated custody solutions, likely involving a combination of cold storage, multi-signature wallets, and possibly institutional staking services to ensure security and compliance. The following table contrasts common retail trading behavior with the observed institutional strategy exemplified by Trend Research: Strategy Component Retail Trader Typical Behavior Trend Research / Institutional Approach Entry Timing Often reactive, based on short-term news or price momentum. Progressive accumulation over months, based on a long-term thesis. Position Sizing Frequently all-or-nothing or highly variable. Large, calculated allocations as a percentage of a massive fund. Research Basis Social media sentiment, basic chart analysis. Deep fundamental analysis of protocol development, team, and ecosystem growth. Security & Custody Reliance on exchange wallets or basic software wallets. Enterprise-grade custody, multi-signature schemes, and insured solutions. Ethereum Price Analysis and Accumulation Impact While the exact price paid for the latest 11,520 ETH tranche was not disclosed down to the decimal, the $34.93 million valuation provides a clear per-ETH benchmark. This purchase occurs within a broader price context for Ethereum, which has experienced volatility but also demonstrated resilience. The firm’s initial entry point near $3,400 provides a reference for its average cost basis, which is likely favorable compared to all-time highs. Large-scale accumulation by a single entity can have several market impacts. Firstly, it directly removes a significant amount of liquidity from the available trading supply, a concept known as supply shock. When large holders (often called “whales”) move assets off exchanges into long-term storage, the readily tradable supply decreases, which can reduce selling pressure and increase price stability. Secondly, such moves are closely monitored by the broader market. On-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Nansen, and Glassnode make these transactions transparent. When other institutional and sophisticated retail investors observe a research-driven firm making substantial purchases, it can create a reinforcing sentiment shift. However, it is critical to maintain a neutral perspective. A single purchase, even of this size, does not guarantee future price direction. Market prices are influenced by a confluence of factors including macroeconomic interest rates, regulatory developments globally, technological milestones, and broader cryptocurrency adoption trends. The Trend Research move is best interpreted as one strong data point indicating professional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term utility and value proposition. The Role of Venture Capital in Crypto Ecosystem Development LD Capital, through Trend Research, is not merely a passive holder. As a venture firm, its investments are strategic and often accompanied by active ecosystem support. Holding a vast amount of ETH allows the firm to participate directly in the network it is betting on. This participation can take several forms: providing liquidity to decentralized applications, funding grants for developers through its treasury, or participating in governance votes on network upgrades. This active involvement blurs the line between investor and stakeholder, aligning the firm’s financial success with the technical success and adoption of the Ethereum platform. This model of “patient capital” is essential for the development of complex, decentralized networks that require long development cycles and community coordination. Conclusion The recent Trend Research ETH purchase of 11,520 tokens for $34.9 million is a significant event that underscores the maturation of cryptocurrency markets. It demonstrates how sophisticated institutional players execute long-term, research-backed strategies rather than engage in speculative trading. This transaction increases Trend Research’s total Ethereum holdings to over 580,000 ETH, cementing its position as a major network stakeholder. The move provides tangible evidence of institutional confidence in Ethereum’s fundamental roadmap, from scaling solutions to its role as a foundational layer for decentralized finance and digital ownership. While not a standalone market indicator, this accumulation, when combined with broader on-chain data and development activity, contributes to a compelling narrative of sustained institutional engagement with core blockchain assets. The transparency afforded by blockchain technology itself allows the market to learn from and analyze these strategic decisions in real-time. FAQs Q1: What is Trend Research and its relation to LD Capital? Trend Research is a specialized subsidiary of LD Capital, a venture capital firm focused on technology and blockchain investments. Trend Research likely handles market analysis, due diligence, and strategic asset allocation for the parent firm’s crypto-related activities. Q2: How was the Trend Research ETH purchase discovered? The transaction was identified and reported by Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics platform. These platforms track the movement of funds between publicly visible wallet addresses, allowing them to link large transactions to known institutional entities. Q3: What does “accumulation” mean in a crypto context? Accumulation refers to the strategy of consistently buying and holding an asset over time, often during periods of price consolidation or decline, with the goal of building a large long-term position at an attractive average cost. Q4: Why is holding over 580,000 ETH significant? This represents a substantial percentage of Ethereum’s circulating supply (approx. 0.48%). Holdings of this scale can influence network staking metrics, governance votes, and market liquidity, as such a large amount is effectively taken out of regular trading circulation. Q5: Does this large purchase guarantee the price of ETH will rise? No. While large institutional purchases can indicate confidence and reduce immediate selling supply, cryptocurrency prices are influenced by countless factors including global regulation, macroeconomic conditions, technological developments, and overall market sentiment. It is a strong positive signal but not a guarantee. Q6: What is the difference between this purchase and an ETF buying ETH? An ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) pools money from many investors to buy assets, and its holdings are dictated by fund inflows/outflows. Trend Research’s purchase is a direct, discretionary allocation from a single venture firm’s capital, representing a concentrated strategic bet rather than a passive, diversified product.

56529390,649154,1766988024,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56529390.jpeg,What The Rise In Open Interest Means For The Dogecoin Price,https://bitcoinist.com/rise-in-open-interest-dogecoin/,"After the Dogecoin open interest hit new all-time highs back in September, it has seen a significant crash, culminating in the open interest dropping to levels not seen since 2024. This was a reflection of the decline in market participation from investors due to the rapid drop in the Dogecoin price. However, the open interest seems to have put in a bottom, and there has been a recovery in this major metric, something that could carry positive implications for the meme coin’s price. Dogecoin Open Interest Recovers Above $1.5 Billion On December 19, the Dogecoin open interest fell below the $1.3 billion mark, following the decline in participation. But the performance so far suggests that this could be a possible bottom . The week following this bottom saw a significant spike in the open interest, as it jumped above the $1.5 billion mark, as shown on Coinglass. Since then, the Dogecoin price interest has consistently come in above $1.5 billion, suggesting that crypto traders are moving back into the meme coin. This is because the open interest measures the total outstanding futures or options contracts for a particular asset, and as the open interest rises, it means investors are opening more positions on Dogecoin . This carries a positive implication, going by historical performance, because times when the open interest has risen have often coincided with times when the price has seen a recovery. An example is the Dogecoin price reaching close to $0.3 back in September when the open interest rose to its current peak of $6.01 billion. Given this trend, if the Dogecoin open interest continues to rise, then it is likely that the price will follow the same trajectory. Therefore, the DOGE price could be getting ready to mark a bottom, especially as the crypto market readies to usher in a new year. Volume Refuses To Bugde While the open interest has seen a recovery, the Dogecoin daily trading volume remains low . According to Coinglass data, the daily trading volume is sitting at one of the lowest points for the year 2025. This also plays into the fact that participation has been muted for the digital asset. However, this muted volume is not relegated to Dogecoin lately, given that the entire crypto market has been in a bearish trend. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is currently sitting at a score of 24 at the time of this writing. This shows that there is Extreme Fear in the market, and it is a time when liquidity is low , leading to lower prices.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-29 06:00:24

This anticipated wave, highlighted on March 21, 2025, represents a pivotal moment of maturation for the industry, moving from private venture capital to public market scrutiny and accessibility. Consequently, the move signals a broader acceptance of blockchain infrastructure within the global financial system. The 2026 Crypto IPO Landscape: A Detailed Breakdown DL News provides a clear snapshot of the leading contenders for public listings next year. Each company brings a unique value proposition and faces distinct challenges on the path to an IPO. The following table summarizes the core details from the report: Company Target Timeline Reported Valuation Key IPO Details Kraken First Half 2026 $20 Billion One of the longest-established global crypto exchanges. Consensys 2026 $7 Billion Engaged JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs as advisors. BitGo Q1 2026 $1.75 Billion A leading institutional custody and security provider. Animoca Brands 2026 $6 Billion Targets a listing on the Nasdaq exchange. Ledger 2026 Not Specified World’s leading hardware wallet manufacturer. Bithumb 2026 Not Specified Plans a listing on the South Korean stock market. This diverse group spans critical industry sectors: exchange trading, software development, institutional security, gaming and metaverse investment, consumer hardware, and regional market dominance. Therefore, their collective move toward public markets is not an isolated event but a sector-wide trend. Analysts view this as a natural evolution for maturing companies that have outgrown early-stage funding rounds. Driving Forces Behind the Crypto Public Offering Trend Several converging factors create a favorable environment for these potential crypto IPOs in 2026. First, regulatory clarity, though still evolving, has advanced significantly in key jurisdictions like the United States and European Union. Subsequently, clearer rules provide a more stable framework for public companies to operate within. Second, institutional investor demand for regulated exposure to blockchain technology continues to grow. Public listings offer a familiar and compliant vehicle for this capital. Furthermore, many of these companies, such as Kraken and Consensys, have reached a scale where an IPO provides optimal capital for expansion, acquisitions, and shareholder liquidity. An initial public offering also enhances brand legitimacy and public trust, a crucial asset in a industry historically wary of centralized entities. The involvement of traditional investment banks like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs with Consensys underscores this bridge-building between crypto-native firms and Wall Street. Expert Analysis on Market Readiness and Valuation Financial experts point to the reported valuations as a key metric of market confidence. For instance, Kraken’s targeted $20 billion valuation reflects its position as a foundational liquidity provider with a long operational history. Conversely, Animoca Brands’ $6 billion valuation hinges on the future growth of Web3 gaming and digital property, a more speculative but high-potential thesis. The success of these offerings will depend heavily on broader market conditions in 2026, including interest rates and investor risk appetite. Market historians often draw parallels to the tech IPO waves of the late 1990s and 2010s. Similarly, this crypto IPO wave represents the infrastructure layer of a new technological paradigm going public. However, a crucial difference lies in the regulatory oversight and compliance standards expected today, which are far more stringent. Each company must demonstrate robust governance, financial controls, and long-term profitability plans to succeed in the public eye. Potential Impacts and Challenges for the Crypto Sector The successful public listing of these firms would have profound ripple effects across the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Primarily, it would: Increase Mainstream Adoption: Public stock tickers make companies visible to millions of traditional investors who may not directly buy crypto. Enhance Corporate Governance: Public companies face quarterly reporting and shareholder accountability, potentially raising operational standards industry-wide. Provide a Benchmark for Valuation: Transparent market caps for leading private companies will help value the entire sector. Attract Regulatory Scrutiny: As publicly traded entities, these companies will operate under the microscope of the SEC and other regulators. Nevertheless, significant challenges remain. Regulatory hurdles can delay or alter IPO plans, as seen with previous crypto exchange attempts. Market volatility in both crypto and traditional equities could dampen investor enthusiasm. Additionally, each company must navigate the complex process of educating public market investors about its specific business model and the nuances of the blockchain industry. Conclusion The DL News report on six potential crypto IPOs for 2026 highlights a critical inflection point for the digital asset industry. The planned public offerings for Kraken, Consensys, BitGo, Animoca Brands, Ledger, and Bithumb collectively signal a move toward transparency, institutional integration, and mature financial practices. While the journey to a successful initial public offering is fraught with challenges, this wave represents the most significant effort yet to bridge the decentralized world of blockchain with the established realm of public capital markets. The outcome of these crypto IPO endeavors in 2026 will likely set the tone for the next decade of industry growth and legitimacy. FAQs Q1: What is a crypto IPO? An initial public offering (IPO) for a cryptocurrency company is the process by which a privately-held blockchain firm offers its shares to the public for the first time on a traditional stock exchange, raising capital from public investors. Q2: Why are so many crypto companies targeting 2026 for IPOs? 2026 appears to be a strategic window allowing companies to achieve necessary scale, navigate evolving regulatory landscapes, and prepare financials for public scrutiny, aligning with a potential period of favorable market conditions. Q3: How does an IPO benefit a company like Kraken or Consensys? An IPO provides access to a larger pool of capital for growth, increases brand visibility and credibility, creates liquidity for early investors and employees, and establishes a public market valuation for the company. Q4: What are the biggest risks for these potential crypto IPOs? Key risks include adverse changes in cryptocurrency or financial regulations, a downturn in broader market sentiment, unforeseen operational issues at the companies, and the inherent volatility of the crypto asset market affecting perceived value. Q5: Can individual investors participate in these IPOs? Typically, access to shares at the IPO price is limited to institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals. However, retail investors can usually buy shares once trading begins on the public exchange on the first day and thereafter.

VeChain historic price sentiment VeChain Price History VeChain began in 2015 as a private consortium chain for blockchain applications. It transitioned to a public blockchain with the ERC-20 token VEN in 2017 and launched its mainnet as VET in 2018. In 2018, VeChain partnered with DHL to develop blockchain solutions for logistics but saw a significant price correction, stabilizing at lower levels. The price remained relatively stable in 2019 and 2020, with occasional spikes as VeChain continued developing technology and forming partnerships. In 2021, VeChain’s price surged to an all-time high of $0.20 in May but dropped to $0.070 by December. In 2022, VeChain attempted to recover but remained below $0.10, with continued volatility throughout the year and into early 2023. Towards the end of 2023, the price saw a slight uptick, stabilizing around $0.020 by early 2024. In 2024, VeChain’s price fluctuated, recovering to $0.025 by mid-March but dropping due to bearish trends, reaching a low of $0.019 by August. It traded around $0.021 in September but ended the month above the $0.024 mark. The price remained mostly stable in October, with the occasional bearish movement causing a decline from the $0.02400 level to start November at the $0.02100 price level. The asset closed November at a high level, with prices near the $0.04600 mark and a strong bullish outlook. However, the bulls only took the price higher in December, as the $0.0500 resistance was crushed swiftly. As of January 2025, VET traded around the $0.04300 mark as it started and closed the month around the same level. In February, the price fell towards the $0.03000 mark as bears took over, ending the month at $0.02800. In March, the net movement was low, but the volatility was very high, as the price fell to $0.02200 where it closed the month. In April the price saw an initial crash but observed sharp recovery ending the month above the $0.02600 mark. In May the price dwindled again ending the month around $0.0250. In June the price continued to struggle as it dropped to $0.0200 to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with VET crossing the $0.02800 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and VET ended the month around the $0.02200 level. In September, the price saw high volatility reaching as high as $0.0260 but failed to stay at the level and ended the month below the $0.02200 mark. In October, the price declined further and ended the month below the $0.01500 mark as bears dominated the crypto markets during the later half of the month. in November, the downtrend continued with VET ending the month below the $0.130 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|RESEARCH|VET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-29 06:34:48

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin’s mining difficulty is likely to rise again in January 2026 as block times remain slightly too fast. Higher difficulty is tightening margins for miners after a volatile 2025. Regular adjustments help protect Bitcoin’s decentralization and network security. Data shows that difficulty rose to 148.2 trillion in the final adjustment of 2025 and is on track to climb further in early January, underscoring the continued expansion of computing power securing the blockchain. According to projections from CoinWarz , the next difficulty adjustment is expected on January 8, 2026, at block height 931,392. If current trends hold, mining difficulty could increase to around 149 trillion. Faster Block Times Point to Higher Difficulty After a Turbulent Year for Miners Average block times are currently hovering near 9.95 minutes, slightly faster than Bitcoin’s 10-minute target, signaling that an upward adjustment is likely to slow block production back to schedule. The steady rise follows a volatile year for miners. In 2025, network difficulty hit multiple all-time highs, including two sharp increases in September during Bitcoin’s price rally. Those gains came just weeks before the market suffered a historic crash in October, leaving many mining firms squeezed between rising operational costs and falling revenue. Higher difficulty directly translates into tougher conditions for miners. As the cryptographic puzzle becomes harder, operators must deploy more powerful machines and consume more energy to compete for the same block rewards. For an industry already defined by thin margins and heavy capital requirements, each upward adjustment raises the bar for survival. The World’s Bitcoin Supply Is Now 95% Mined pic.twitter.com/R4TuoMIReb — Documenting ₿itcoin (@DocumentingBTC) November 17, 2025 Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment is a core mechanism designed to keep the network stable and decentralized. The protocol recalibrates difficulty every 2,016 blocks, roughly every two weeks, based on how quickly miners are finding blocks. When blocks are mined too quickly, difficulty increases; when mining slows, it decreases. This self-correcting system prevents any single miner or coordinated group from dominating the network by suddenly adding massive amounts of computing power. Without it, an entity with sufficient resources could mine blocks faster than others, collect a disproportionate share of rewards, and undermine trust in the system. Bitmain Slashes Bitcoin Miner Prices as Industry Pressure Mounts As reported, Bitmain is cutting prices aggressively across multiple generations of Bitcoin mining hardware as pressure builds across the mining sector, according to recent promotional campaigns and internal price lists circulated to customers. One promotion dated Dec. 23 offered a package of four S19 XP+ Hydro units paired with an ANTRACK V2 container, implying an effective price of roughly $4 per terahash for the 19 J/TH machines. Shipments for that batch are scheduled to begin in January 2026, suggesting Bitmain is willing to lock in low pricing well ahead of delivery. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s network hashrate fell 4% in the month through Dec. 15, a development that could set the stage for stronger price performance in the months ahead, according to analysts at VanEck. “When hash rate compression persists over longer periods, positive forward returns tend to occur more often and with greater magnitude,” the analysts wrote.

This raises questions whether this latest rally is just another repeat of what has been transpiring for the past several weeks – breakout attempts to $90,000 followed by subsequent violent rejections and sideways action. CW attributed today’s price revival to a favorable alignment of retail and whales who are simultaneously buying BTC. The analyst believes that retail returning is of particular interest as they have sat on the sidelines for a while, especially since the October crash. Large whales and smart retail investors are simultaneously buying $BTC . Of particular thing is the restart of retail investor’s buying. Only smart investors remain in the market, meaning we’re nearing the start of a rally. pic.twitter.com/wiTPooxH4P — CW (@CW8900) December 28, 2025 In a separate post, CW explained that almost all exchanges are showing strong BTC buying signals, especially Binance. They added that “whales who had been resting are back.” Ali Martinez, though, recently published a different view on the matter. He believes the cryptocurrency is forming another dead-cat bounce before it “potentially makes another leg lower.” He justified his rather bearish prediction with the lack of actual positive capital flows. Just the opposite; the net capital flow has turned negative, dropping below $-4.5 billion. “This means money is currently leaving crypto rather entering it,” he concluded. The trend is similar to the spot BTC ETFs , which have been bleeding out for months. As reported recently, they went from almost $63 billion in net inflows in early October to well under $57 billion as of Friday’s close. For now, though, BTC is 2.3% in the green daily, trading close to $90,000. Its Monday resurgence has awakened some altcoins, such as ETH, which jumped past $3,000. BNB is above $860, while XRP has touched the crucial $1.90 support.

Key Takeaways: Ethereum staking inflows have overtaken exits for the first time in six months, pointing to renewed validator confidence. The entry queue has surged while the exit line continues to shrink, potentially nearing zero in the coming days. Past flips in staking queues have coincided with strong ETH price rallies and easing sell pressure. Data from the Ethereum Validator Queue shows that roughly 745,619 Ether is currently waiting to enter staking, carrying an estimated wait time of nearly 13 days. By contrast, the exit queue stands at around 360,518 ETH with an eight-day delay. The reversal marks a clear change from recent months, when withdrawals consistently outweighed new deposits. Ethereum Staking Flip Accelerates as Exit Queue Nears Zero The shift took place over the weekend, when both queues briefly converged near 460,000 ETH. Since then, the entry line has accelerated rapidly, while some observers suggest the exit queue could soon approach zero if current trends persist. Abdul, head of DeFi at layer-1 blockchain Monad, pointed to the flip as a historically meaningful signal. In a post on X, he noted that a similar reversal in June preceded a sharp rally in Ether’s price. At the time, ETH traded near $2,800 before climbing to an all-time high of $4,946 by late August. Ether is currently changing hands around $3,000. Update: ETH validator entry queue is now bigger than the exit queue, for the first time in six months The last time this happened in June, ETH doubled in price shortly after 2026 going to be a movie https://t.co/GWMCjxfigo pic.twitter.com/3dMttYpB4B — Abdul (@0x_Abdul) December 28, 2025 Ethereum operates under a proof-of-stake model, requiring validators to lock up ETH to help secure the network. As a result, changes in staking behavior are often viewed as sentiment indicators. Rising exits can signal intent to sell, while increased staking suggests long-term conviction and reduced near-term supply. Abdul argued that the exit queue has functioned as a leading indicator of sell pressure throughout 2025. He estimated that roughly 5% of Ether’s total supply has changed hands since July, a figure that includes a large September unstaking event by staking provider Kiln. According to Abdul, around 70% of that unstaked ETH was absorbed by BitMine, which now controls approximately 3.4% of the total supply. Kiln initiated an orderly withdrawal of its validators in September following an exploit involving digital asset platform SwissBorg, framing the move as a precautionary step rather than a loss of confidence in Ethereum. Validator Exit Queue May Hit Zero, Easing Sell Pressure Looking ahead, Abdul suggested that if the current pace holds, the validator exit queue could reach zero by January 3. Such an outcome, he said, would likely ease persistent sell pressure and stabilize market conditions. Others in the crypto community have pointed to growing demand from digital asset treasury firms as a key driver behind the surge in staking. Blockchain data tracked by Lookonchain shows that BitMine staked more than 342,000 ETH , worth roughly $1 billion, over a two-day period. Additional factors may also be at play. Some analysts cite improvements tied to Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade , which aims to streamline staking and increase validator limits, making it easier for large holders to deploy capital. DeFi deleveraging, triggered by higher borrowing rates and the unwinding of leveraged staking strategies, may have further reshaped supply flows.

The South Korean won particularly stands out, extending its recent gains through targeted government intervention measures that bolster investor confidence across East Asian markets. Asian Currencies Navigate Year-End Trading Conditions Foreign exchange markets across Asia exhibit unusual calm during the final trading sessions of 2024. Trading volumes typically decline by 30-40% during this period as institutional investors reduce positions and prepare annual reports. Consequently, most Asian currencies show minimal movement against the US dollar. Market analysts attribute this stability to several factors including balanced capital flows and reduced speculative activity. The Japanese yen trades within a narrow 0.3% range while the Chinese yuan maintains its managed float with minimal deviation. Regional central banks monitor these conditions closely, prepared to intervene if volatility unexpectedly increases. Furthermore, year-end corporate hedging activities provide additional support to currency values across the region. Historical Context of Year-End FX Patterns Year-end currency stability represents a recurring pattern in Asian markets over the past decade. Analysis of trading data from 2015-2024 reveals consistent volume reductions averaging 35% during the final two weeks of December. This phenomenon stems from multiple institutional factors. Major investment funds typically close positions before annual reporting deadlines. Corporate treasuries minimize currency exposure during holiday periods. Additionally, central bank operations often decrease as policymakers prepare for new year monetary strategies. The current stability aligns with these established patterns, though specific conditions vary across economies. For instance, export-dependent nations experience different capital flows compared to domestic consumption-driven markets during this period. South Korean Won Extends Gains Through Government Support The South Korean currency demonstrates notable strength against this stable backdrop, continuing its upward trajectory through deliberate government measures. Financial authorities implement multiple support mechanisms including direct market intervention and verbal guidance. The won appreciates approximately 1.8% against the US dollar during December’s final week alone. This performance significantly exceeds regional peers and reflects coordinated policy actions. The Ministry of Economy and Finance confirms ongoing monitoring of currency movements with readiness to deploy stabilization funds if necessary. Export competitiveness concerns traditionally limit won appreciation, but current global conditions justify temporary strength according to official statements. Market participants respond positively to this transparent policy approach. Asian Currency Performance Against USD (December 23-27, 2024) Currency Change (%) Trading Volume Change (%) Key Influences South Korean won +1.8 -32 Government intervention, export data Japanese yen -0.2 -41 BOJ policy expectations, holiday flows Chinese yuan +0.1 -28 PBOC guidance, trade balance Indian rupee +0.3 -37 Foreign investment flows, oil prices Singapore dollar +0.4 -35 MAS policy stance, regional trade Government Intervention Mechanisms South Korean authorities deploy multiple tools to support currency stability. The Bank of Korea maintains substantial foreign exchange reserves exceeding $420 billion for intervention purposes. These reserves provide crucial ammunition during periods of excessive volatility. Additionally, regulatory bodies coordinate with major financial institutions to smooth trading flows. Verbal guidance from senior officials represents another key mechanism, influencing market psychology without direct market operations. Recent statements emphasize commitment to orderly market conditions rather than specific exchange rate targets. This balanced approach receives praise from international observers including the International Monetary Fund, which notes improved policy communication compared to previous years. Regional Economic Context and Market Impacts Broader economic conditions significantly influence Asian currency movements during this period. Several key factors contribute to current market dynamics: Export Performance: Regional export data shows mixed results with technology exports generally outperforming traditional manufacturing Interest Rate Differentials: Diverging monetary policies between Asian central banks and the Federal Reserve create complex yield dynamics Commodity Prices: Stabilizing energy costs reduce import pressures for several regional economies Tourism Flows: Year-end travel patterns generate predictable currency conversion demands Foreign Investment: Portfolio rebalancing by global funds creates seasonal capital movements These interconnected factors create the current trading environment. Market participants generally anticipate quiet conditions continuing through early January. However, unexpected developments could rapidly change this outlook. Geopolitical tensions, sudden policy shifts, or major economic data surprises represent potential volatility triggers. Regional central banks maintain contingency plans for such scenarios, including coordinated intervention agreements established through Chiang Mai Initiative mechanisms. Expert Analysis of Market Conditions Financial market specialists provide valuable perspective on current conditions. Dr. Mei Lin Chen, Senior Asia FX Strategist at Global Financial Insights, notes: “Year-end stability reflects both seasonal patterns and underlying economic fundamentals. Reduced liquidity amplifies any market movements, making current calm particularly noteworthy.” Meanwhile, Park Ji-hoon, Director of Korea Fixed Income and Currency Research at Seoul Financial Group, observes: “Government support for the won addresses multiple objectives including inflation management and financial stability. The measured approach balances export competitiveness concerns with broader economic needs.” These expert views highlight the multidimensional nature of currency market dynamics during this period. Technical Analysis and Trading Patterns Technical indicators reveal specific patterns in Asian currency markets. Most regional pairs trade within well-defined ranges established earlier in December. The USD/KRW pair breaks below psychological support at 1,300, triggering additional technical selling. Momentum indicators show mixed signals across different currencies, reflecting the low-volume environment. Trading algorithms adjust parameters to account for reduced liquidity, potentially exacerbating any sudden movements. Market microstructure analysis reveals changing patterns in order flow and execution quality during this period. Institutional traders typically reduce position sizes while increasing use of limit orders rather than market orders. These behavioral adaptations contribute to observed stability. Comparative Regional Performance Currency performance varies across Asian subregions despite generally stable conditions. Northeast Asian currencies show slightly stronger performance than Southeast Asian counterparts. This divergence reflects differing economic structures and policy approaches. Export-oriented economies demonstrate different sensitivity to global conditions compared to domestic consumption-driven markets. Additionally, countries with higher foreign debt levels face different constraints than those with substantial reserves. These comparative differences create opportunities for relative value trading strategies even during quiet periods. Hedge funds and proprietary trading desks particularly focus on these cross-currency relationships when directional opportunities diminish. Forward Outlook and 2025 Projections Market participants already shift attention toward 2025 trading conditions. Several key developments will likely influence Asian currency markets in the coming year: Monetary Policy Normalization: Regional central banks may adjust policies as inflation dynamics evolve Global Growth Patterns: Diverging economic performance between major economies will affect capital flows Technological Disruption: Digital currency developments may influence traditional foreign exchange markets Trade Agreement Impacts: Evolving regional trade partnerships will alter currency demand patterns Climate Finance Flows: Green investment initiatives may create new currency conversion demands These factors will interact with traditional market drivers including interest rate differentials and risk sentiment. Most analysts project moderate Asian currency appreciation against the US dollar during 2025, though timing and magnitude remain uncertain. The won particularly may face conflicting pressures from export competitiveness concerns and capital inflow dynamics. Government authorities emphasize readiness to manage excessive volatility while allowing market-determined exchange rates within reasonable parameters. Conclusion Asian currencies maintain impressive stability amid characteristically thin year-end trading volumes, demonstrating regional financial market resilience. The South Korean won extends its recent climb through coordinated government support measures, outperforming regional peers during this quiet period. These developments reflect both seasonal patterns and deliberate policy actions that balance multiple economic objectives. Looking forward, 2025 presents both challenges and opportunities for Asian currency markets as global economic conditions continue evolving. Market participants will closely monitor how regional authorities navigate these complex dynamics while maintaining financial stability and supporting sustainable economic growth across Asia’s diverse economies. FAQs Q1: Why do trading volumes decrease at year-end? Financial institutions reduce positions before annual reporting deadlines, corporate treasuries minimize currency exposure during holidays, and many traders take vacation time, collectively reducing market activity. Q2: How does the South Korean government support the won? Authorities use multiple tools including direct foreign exchange market intervention, verbal guidance to influence market psychology, coordination with financial institutions, and deployment of stabilization funds when necessary. Q3: What factors typically influence Asian currency values? Key influences include export performance, interest rate differentials with major economies, commodity price movements, tourism flows, foreign investment patterns, and regional economic growth rates. Q4: How do low trading volumes affect currency stability? Reduced liquidity can both suppress volatility through diminished speculative activity and potentially amplify any sudden movements due to limited market depth, creating complex dynamics. Q5: What are the main differences between Asian currency markets? Markets vary by trading volume, regulatory frameworks, central bank intervention approaches, economic structures, and sensitivity to different global factors including commodity prices and technology cycles.

This forecast arrives as the market demonstrates clear signs of maturation, moving beyond speculative frenzy toward a framework increasingly shaped by institutional capital, regulatory clarity, and sustainable economic models. The firm’s predictions, grounded in current market trajectories and technological developments, suggest a period of significant consolidation and evolution for the global digital asset ecosystem. Crypto Market 2026: The Institutional Reorganization Tiger Research’s first prediction highlights a decisive move toward institutional concentration. Consequently, major, proven assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum will attract the lion’s share of institutional capital. This trend, already visible with the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, will accelerate as traditional finance seeks established stores of value and network security. Meanwhile, smaller, unproven assets may struggle for attention. This institutional pivot fundamentally reorganizes market dynamics around risk management and verifiable fundamentals rather than speculative narratives. The End of Narrative-Driven Valuation Furthermore, the report delivers a stark warning for projects lacking tangible revenue. Tiger Research asserts that compelling stories alone will no longer ensure survival. Instead, the market will ruthlessly filter out ventures without sustainable business models. This shift mirrors the dot-com bubble’s aftermath, where only companies with real products and profits endured. For investors, this means due diligence will increasingly focus on balance sheets, cash flow, and user adoption metrics, not just whitepapers and community hype. The Evolution of Tokenomics and Value Return Token design is also in for a radical overhaul. According to the forecast, utility and governance-focused models will lose their primary appeal. Investors, burned by tokens with unclear value accrual, will demand mechanisms that offer transparent returns. Therefore, features like token buybacks, burns, and direct revenue sharing will become the new core standard. This evolution represents a maturation from “governance rights” to tangible shareholder-like economics, aligning project success directly with tokenholder value. The following table contrasts the predicted shift in token model priorities: 2023-2024 Focus 2026 Predicted Focus Governance voting power Direct revenue share / dividends Access to platform features Deflationary buyback & burn mechanisms Speculative narrative drive Clear, auditable value accrual Market Consolidation and Industry Maturation As the Web3 industry enters a more mature phase, Tiger Research predicts a significant acceleration in mergers and acquisitions. This activity will lead to a consolidated market dominated by a few well-capitalized winners. Similar to the consolidation seen in early internet and tech sectors, this process will weed out redundancy and strengthen surviving entities. For example, layer-2 scaling solutions or decentralized finance protocols with overlapping functions may merge to capture greater market share and improve efficiency. New Frontiers: Data Economies and Media Transformation Beyond finance, the forecast identifies novel applications poised for growth. Firstly, decentralized crowdsourcing for AI training data will create a new gig economy. Individuals will receive immediate, micro-compensation for contributing verified data via blockchain, ensuring provenance and fairness. Secondly, traditional media outlets will adopt prediction markets to diversify revenue. This move could transform readers from passive consumers into active participants who stake on news outcomes, potentially increasing engagement and creating new monetization streams. The Institutional Build-Out and Regulatory Catalysts Tiger Research also anticipates a strategic shift among traditional financial institutions. To lead the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization market—which could include everything from treasury bonds to real estate—these entities will increasingly build proprietary blockchains. This development reduces their dependence on public, permissionless networks and offers greater control over compliance, privacy, and transaction finality. Meanwhile, clearer regulatory frameworks are expected to empower fintech apps, not centralized exchanges, as the primary crypto entry point for mainstream users, integrating digital assets seamlessly into everyday financial services. The ETF Ripple Effect and Privacy Imperative The successful launch of Ethereum staking ETFs, following the Bitcoin ETF precedent, will create a consequential ripple effect. These products will generate demand for yield among a new class of ETF investors. Consequently, this demand will stimulate revival and innovation in the Bitcoin financial ecosystem (BTCFi), as investors seek similar yield-generating mechanisms for their Bitcoin holdings. Finally, as institutions manage larger on-chain portfolios, privacy-enhancing technologies like zero-knowledge proofs will transition from niche tools to essential infrastructure. They are crucial for protecting billion-dollar trading strategies from front-running and market manipulation on transparent ledgers. Conclusion Tiger Research’s forecast for the crypto market in 2026 paints a picture of an industry shedding its adolescent volatility for a more structured, institutional, and utility-driven adulthood. The predicted shifts—from institutional concentration and sustainable tokenomics to market consolidation and privacy-focused infrastructure—collectively signal a move toward integration with the broader global financial system. While the path will involve the exit of weaker projects, the resulting landscape promises greater stability, clearer value propositions, and more profound real-world impact for blockchain technology and digital assets. FAQs Q1: What is the main driver behind Tiger Research’s prediction of institutional concentration on Bitcoin and Ethereum? A1: The primary driver is risk management. Institutional investors, such as pension funds and asset managers, have fiduciary duties and require proven, liquid assets with extensive track records. Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the largest and most established networks, offer the deepest liquidity and most robust security, making them the default choices for large-scale capital allocation. Q2: Why will utility and governance tokens lose appeal by 2026? A2: Many utility tokens have failed to demonstrate a clear link between network usage and token value appreciation. Governance, while important, often does not provide direct economic benefit. Investors are expected to prioritize models like token burns or buybacks, which create measurable scarcity and directly tie a project’s financial success to tokenholder returns, offering a more transparent and familiar value proposition. Q3: How could prediction markets realistically transform traditional media revenue models? A3: Media companies could embed prediction markets on articles about upcoming events (elections, product launches, economic data). Readers could stake small amounts on outcomes, with the platform taking a fee. This creates a new engagement layer, turns news consumption into an interactive experience, and opens a revenue stream distinct from declining ad sales and subscriptions, all while leveraging the media outlet’s credibility. Q4: What are the implications of traditional finance building proprietary chains for RWA tokenization? A4: This implies a potential bifurcation in the blockchain landscape. Public, permissionless chains (like Ethereum) may continue to dominate for decentralized applications and currency-like assets. Meanwhile, private, permissioned chains controlled by financial institutions will likely dominate for tokenized traditional securities, offering the speed, privacy, and regulatory compliance that institutional finance requires, potentially limiting interoperability between the two worlds. Q5: How would clearer regulation make fintech apps, not exchanges, the main entry point to crypto? A5: Clear regulations provide fintech apps (like PayPal, Revolut, or Cash App) the legal certainty to integrate crypto buying, selling, and holding directly into their existing, trusted interfaces. For the average user, purchasing Bitcoin through their everyday banking or payment app is far simpler and feels safer than signing up for a dedicated cryptocurrency exchange, dramatically lowering the barrier to entry and mainstreaming access.

This $0.035 Altcoin is Already Up 250%,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-crypto-to-buy-before-2026-this-0-035-altcoin-is-already-up-250/,"Cryptocurrency movements on pricing usually begin at the end of the year. Most of the time they initiate when the progress becomes evident and expectations change. With 2026 coming nearer, the interest is shifting towards the projects which are already bearing momentum as opposed to just a notion. The groundwork is already in place so that one new cryptocurrency is beginning to shine in that window, not through noise, but due to the groundwork. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is Building Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi based crypto project, which deals with lending and borrowing. The protocol is developing in accordance with two interrelated markets capable of providing the user with different needs, strengthening the same system. On the pool based side, users are given an opportunity to deposit assets and earn mtTokens in remittance. These mtTokens are their location and pay yield with time. As an example, a user with assets of one $1,000 can get mtTokens that increase in value as the amount of interest is earned. This model enables the users to remain in the liquid state and even make APY that depends on the protocol activity. Upon the peer-to-peer side, borrowers are able to gain access to liquidity by collateral posting. Rate of borrowing is calculated using the utilization rates, which vary according to the supply and demand. The loan-to-value ratios will be used to control risk. The assets of lower volatility can be used to support higher LTVs, whereas more volatile tokens have lower limits. In case the value of collateral ensures that it drops so much, the liquidations are precipitated to safeguard the system and ensure that there is a balance. Presale and Assignment Information Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale opened in early 2025 and has adhered to model allocation. Each stage supplies a certain amount of tokens at a specific price and the price grows with the filling of stages. To date, the presale has collected about $19.45M and has gained over 18,650 holders. These numbers indicate stable engagement as opposed to periodic bursts of engagement. There is a total supply of 4B MUTM out of which 45.5% is in the presale. That is approximately 1.82B tokens to be distributed early. And more than 825M tokens have already been sold. The Phase 6 is more than 99% levied and this implies that the supply is highly restricted at existing prices. The present cost of MUTM is at $0.035. This accounts to 250% of the Phase 1 pricing which was at 0.01. It has been set at an official price of $ 0.06. The fact is curious that phase 1 members are thus poised for 500% MUTM appreciation upon launch, later phases still demonstrate an obvious gap between present pricing and a later entry access. The next crypto phase of presale is projected to bring about an approximate price increment of almost 20%, which has been associated with quicker allocation in the past. On top of that, Mutuum Finance operates a 24-hour leaderboard. The highest daily contributor will receive $500 in MUTM. V1 Launch and Security Readiness It is at Development Phase 2 and its fundamental protocol features have been developed. Official updates are to introduce V1 in the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. The first one will consist of liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator bot where ETH and USDT should be the first supported. Another area which has been visible is security. Mutuum Finance has been rated to score 90/100 in the CertiK scan of the token. Moreover, the borrowing and lending contracts are being reviewed by Halborn Security on its own. The code is completed and is in the process of a formal analysis. There is also a bug bounty program of $50k to incentivize outsourcing. According to some analysts, such a mix of short-term utility and dwindling supply, and finished audits, sets the conditions to price repricing following launch. In a ductile one, forecasts indicate that MUTM will gain highly beyond the launch price of $0.06 as protocols use starts. Stablecoin and Layer-2 Plans In addition to the initial launch, Mutuum Finance intends to launch an overcollateralized asset backed interest-bearing borrower stablecoin. This would introduce a domestic unit of account to the ecosystem, and augment its daily utilization. The stable assets are characterized by an increase in the activities and it could enhance the lending demand. The expansion of Layer-2 is also covered in the roadmap. The cheap costs and speedy exchange rates are vital concerning the lending protocols, where the users are in constant communication. The layer-2 integration will enable the use of smaller positions and increase participation by reducing friction. In terms of the market, Mutuum Finance incorporates a number of aspects commonly featured in the initial phases of DeFi projects in the crypt that eventually gained momentum. The token is already valued by 250%, but it is currently valued below $0.05. The distribution is becoming stricter, the development milestones can be observed, and the security checks are in progress. The projects with obvious growth and potential growth likely attract the most attention to those who want to know what crypto to buy in the next 2026. Mutuum Finance is currently working in the thin strip of infrastructure that is just about to launch and supply is dwindling and is one of the new crypto monikers keeping close attention as the year is upon us.

The motivation, he said, is incentive design. “Why leave? X rewards outrage,” Hoskinson wrote, adding that “the work that matters— Africa , Basho, Midnight 1.0, Cardano governance—rewards building.” He framed it as a conclusion drawn from a full decade on the platform: “Ten years taught me which game is worth playing.” The farewell also carried a sharper edge that nodded to the disputes he has been drawn into on X. “To everyone who made this decade worthwhile: thank you. To the rest: I won’t miss you,” he wrote. Hoskinson has been a prolific and often combative presence on the platform, frequently engaging critics directly and weighing in on Cardano’s technical direction, governance arguments, and broader industry controversies. Hoskinson’s writing pivot is already underway. On Dec. 25, he published a long post titled “What the Horizon Kept” on his personal Blogger site, opening with a vignette in which “The old fisherman said, ‘The ocean’s too quiet,’” before moving into a surreal narrative about instruments failing, maps not matching reality, and an island appearing where none was marked. The site’s profile bio describes him, bluntly, as a “Guy who writes stuff that makes people angry.” He also continued posting in a more typically terse mode in recent days. In one message, Hoskinson wrote: “Before Crypto and After Crypto. Friends don’t let friends do crypto.” Before Crypto and After Crypto. Friends don’t let friends do crypto pic.twitter.com/129Odf4Ihj — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 28, 2025 Hoskinson has not provided details about the “digital twin” beyond promising an explanation in his first YouTube livestream of the year.

The breach allowed hackers to distribute $13.33 million in credits to gamers’ accounts. According to an update shared on X during the weekend by the Ubisoft Rainbow Six Siege team, gamers’ accounts were flooded with up to 2 billion R6 Credits, which is the game’s premium currency. Following the incident, Ubisoft was forced to shut down all servers and the marketplace, initiating a rollback plan for all the breached transactions. Ubisoft pledges not to ban accounts for spending unauthorized credits According to Ubisoft’s pricing structure, packs of 15,000 R6 Credits retail for $99.99. This means that for a gamer to achieve the 2 billion R6 Credits, they would have to spend roughly $13.33 million. In addition to the in-game credit issued, the hackers compromised moderation systems that issued random bans and unbans, and manipulated the ban ticker to display custom messages. A rollback is currently ongoing and afterwards, extensive quality control tests will be executed to ensure the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes. The team is focused on getting players back into the game as quickly as possible. Please know that this matter is… https://t.co/cG4zBIBBGB — Rainbow Six Siege X (@Rainbow6Game) December 28, 2025 Some gamers shared screenshots on X with fake ban notifications, and altered in-game messaging affecting all accounts across PC, PlayStation , and Xbox. Ubisoft has clarified that no gamers will be banned for spending unauthorized credits, with a targeted rollback of all transactions initiated after 11:00 AM UTC on December 27. The firm further explained that the ban ticker had been disabled, and any messages observed were unauthorized. Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege platform has concluded the rollback and live tests, with a soft launch coming back through tests with a few gamers, while Marketplace remains closed. The rollback process involved extensive quality control testing to verify account integrity, with initial tests completed. Ubisoft also conducted a soft launch for a limited group of gamers, and live test verification had been completed. The company has confirmed the reopening of the gaming servers after the conclusion of its live tests, and the game is now open to all gamers. The French publisher, however, cautioned that gamers may experience a queue when connecting as the services are ramping up. Rainbow Six Siege security breach linked to MongoBleed A security research report by Cyber Security News has revealed that the breach at Ubisoft was linked to a MongoBleed vulnerability, which potentially allowed memory leaks and escalation to internal repositories. The French video game publisher has not revealed any information about the nature of the leak so far or data exfiltration. Gamers who did not log in between December 27th, 10:49 UTC, and December 29th should expect no changes to their inventory. Ubisoft added that for those who did not connect after December 27th, 10:49 UTC, a small percentage may temporarily lose access to some owned items. The French video game publisher acknowledged the incident on Saturday and offered to investigate and resolve the matter. The firm clarified that investigations and corrections will continue over the next two weeks. Ubisoft has, however, kept the Marketplace closed until further notice as investigations continue. Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege’s ability to roll back the credits would not have been possible if the game had been built on decentralized technology. Alex Smirnov, co-founder of deBridge, revealed that a rollback in decentralized ecosystems introduces systemic issues that affect bridges, custodians, users, and counterparties who acted honestly during the affected window. The Rainbow Six Siege franchise, launched in 2015, currently attracts roughly 34,000 gamers daily based on data from Active Player.

Supporters of the proposal argue it would provide much-needed funding for public services, setting the stage for a heated debate ahead of a potential ballot vote. What the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act proposes The ballot initiative proposes a one-time 5% tax on net wealth above $1 billion, including unrealized gains, with proceeds earmarked for healthcare and state assistance programs. Backed by the Service Employees International Union–United Healthcare Workers West, the measure would require affected billionaires to pay the tax either in a single installment or over five years with interest. Critics argue that taxing unrealized gains could force individuals to sell shares or parts of their businesses to raise cash, even if those assets have not been liquidated. Opponents say this could disrupt company ownership structures and discourage long-term investment, particularly in startups and privately held firms that dominate California’s innovation economy. The initiative must collect nearly 875,000 signatures to qualify for the November 2026 ballot. Why crypto and tech leaders object Senior figures in the crypto industry have voiced strong opposition. Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell warned that the proposal could be “the final straw” for wealthy residents, arguing that billionaires would leave California along with their spending, philanthropy, and jobs. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley echoed concerns, suggesting the tax would undermine confidence in the state’s investment environment. Castle Island Ventures founding partner Nic Carter questioned whether policymakers had adequately assessed capital mobility in an era when wealth can move quickly across borders. ProCap BTC chief investment officer Jeff Park raised similar concerns, noting that one-time wealth taxes could signal the potential for further levies in the future. Fredrik Haga, co-founder and CEO of on-chain data platform Dune, pointed to Norway’s experience with a wealth tax, arguing it led to an exodus of wealthy individuals and raised less revenue than expected. Austin Campbell, a New York University professor and founder of Zero Knowledge Consulting, cited a December audit by the California State Auditor that highlighted unaccounted-for or poorly justified public expenditures, questioning whether additional revenue would be efficiently deployed. High-profile investors outside crypto have also weighed in. Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman warned that California risks losing key business leaders. Earlier reports said figures such as Peter Thiel and Larry Page were considering reducing their ties to the state. Supporters say funds would back public services US Representative Ro Khanna, a crypto-friendly Democrat representing California’s 17th Congressional District, has emerged as a leading defender of the proposal. In a series of posts on X, Khanna argued that the tax would fund childcare, housing, and education, ultimately strengthening innovation and addressing public frustration over inequality. He has emphasized that extreme wealth holders should contribute more to society.

Holding near $12.95 shows sellers were absorbed after $12.33 was reclaimed. Sustained strength above $12.33 supports continuation, while a slip below $12.90 may trigger profit-taking. On December 29, 2025, Chainlink (LINK) is reported trading at $12.95, reflecting a 2.89% uptrend on the day, according to Coinm,arketcap data. Market pricing shows LINK holding firm near intraday highs, with resistance noted at $12.98 and support identified at $12.33, levels that traders are closely monitoring as short-term volatility remains elevated. Chainlink daily price chart: LINK price stabilizes as key levels compress On the daily chart, LINK is depicted consolidating after a measured advance, with price stabilizing around $12.95 following a session low near $12.33 and a high close to $12.98. The reported resistance at $12.98, despite being below the current trading price, highlights a previously contested zone where selling pressure was absorbed before buyers regained control. LINK/USDT Chart: TradingView The support level at $12.33, positioned just above the current price, suggests a tight trading corridor where any sustained move above this level could invite momentum-driven participation, while a failure to hold near $12.90 may trigger short-term profit-taking. Chainlink 4-hour price chart: LINK shows short-term bullish trend On the 4-hour timeframe, LINK’s price action reflects a clear intraday recovery pattern, with successive green candles emerging after a prolonged red phase earlier in the session. The move toward $12.95 is characterized by sharper upward impulses, indicating increased buyer confidence during shorter trading intervals. LINK/USDT Chart: TradingView Momentum indicators on this timeframe would typically align with a short-term bullish bias, as price continues to press toward the $12.33 support level, now acting as a near-term pivot. The $12.98 resistance remains relevant on pullbacks, marking a level where bears previously attempted to cap upside before losing control. Chainlink technical indicators: levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $16.69 SELL SMA 5 $15.69 SELL SMA 10 $15.20 SELL SMA 21 $14.02 SELL SMA 50 $14.19 SELL SMA 100 $17.58 SELL SMA 200 $17.81 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $13.91 BUY EMA 5 $14.76 SELL EMA 10 $16.88 SELL EMA 21 $19.28 SELL EMA 50 $19.83 SELL EMA 100 $18.63 SELL EMA 200 $17.49 SELL What to expect from Chainlink? LINK is likely to remain range-bound in the near term as price compresses between $12.33 and $12.98. A sustained break and hold above $12.98 would strengthen the bullish continuation case and open room for further upside. Conversely, failure to stay above the $12.90 area could prompt short-term profit-taking and a pullback toward previously reclaimed levels, where buyers are expected to re-engage. Is Chainlink a good investment? Chainlink remains structurally constructive in the short term, with buyers defending reclaimed levels and price holding near recent highs. While the current setup favors cautious upside continuation, LINK is still trading within a tight range, meaning confirmation through a sustained breakout is needed. As with any crypto asset, its investment appeal depends on risk tolerance, time horizon, and broader market conditions rather than short-term price action alone. Why is the LINK price up today? LINK is trading higher today as buyers continue to defend reclaimed levels following a recent pullback, keeping the price near intraday highs. The move reflects renewed short-term demand after selling pressure around $12.33 was absorbed, allowing the price to stabilize near $12.95. Tight consolidation near resistance is also encouraging incremental buying as traders position for a potential breakout above the $12.98 zone. Will Chainlink reach $50? Based on long-term forecasts from industry experts, Chainlink (LINK) is projected to reach $50 by 2028, The Chainlink forecast indicates potential future price movements as its ecosystem and user adoption continue to grow.

Expert Reveals The Truth,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-supply-shock-expert-truth/,"A fresh “XRP supply shock” narrative has been making the rounds on X, with several large accounts circulating a Glassnode chart of exchange balances and arguing ETFs are rapidly draining liquid supply. An XRP Ledger dUNL validator, however, rejected the premise outright, saying the numbers and the market structure don’t support a true allocation squeeze. One widely shared post came from @unknowDLT, who wrote on Dec. 27: “XRP ETFs are absorbing supply fast. With only ~1.5B XRP left on exchanges and ~750M absorbed in weeks, a supply shock is likely by early 2026.” The account tied that thesis to the “Clarity Act,” arguing it would “forc[e] price discovery” and position 2026 as the moment XRP shifts “from speculation to global liquidity infrastructure.” Is A XRP Supply Shock Really Coming? Vet (@Vet_X0), an XRP Ledger dUNL validator, responded on Dec. 28 with a screenshot indicating exchange balances closer to 16 billion XRP, not 1.5 billion, and framed the supply-shock talk as a static misread of a dynamic market. “There is no XRP supply shock on exchanges,” Vet wrote. “1) Holders have close to 16B XRP on exchanges readily available. Plenty for anyone to get some. 2) If the price goes up or down anyone of you who has no XRP on exchanges could just send theirs within 3-4 secs to one.” Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price On The Verge Of Bearish Breakdown Vet’s broader point was that exchange balances and order-book liquidity are not fixed quantities; they change rapidly with price and incentives. In his view, that makes “supply shock” a much higher bar than a chart implying balances are trending down. “Thus, also XRP listed on orderbooks for sale is dynamic. Elastic, it can thicken or dry out in seconds back and forth,” he wrote. “Sometimes $10M buying can push price higher and sometimes $100M buying doesn’t stop price going down regardless. Markets are too dynamic to statically plot movements.” The debate then moved to confidence in the wallet labeling and the underlying counts. Popular pundit Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) questioned whether some entries looked “off,” citing one example: “Evernorth only has 86 million XRP?” Vet replied that the published list should be treated as conservative, not exhaustive. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Crashes To Levels Not Seen Since 2024, Can It Also Rally 600%? “Full confidence that these numbers are the lower bound of what actually is on exchanges,” Vet wrote. “Means, these numbers are at worst on the lower end and that there are more accounts of exchanges we haven’t seen yet. I mean just check Upbit alone, lets only look at 4 out of many xrp accounts they have. 2B XRP. This is only a portion of Upbit, not even counting other exchanges.” Others argued that even if balances are large, effective float could still tighten due to custody structure, escrow cadence, and institutional accumulation. Dman Trader (@dmantrader) pointed to monthly escrow mechanics and claimed ETF holdings sit in dedicated XRPL wallets, describing them as “Locked up 1% of total supply already in a couple months,” while also arguing that CEX and OTC inventories earmarked for clients are hard to measure. Vet acknowledged a logistical angle — “Ripple is noting in the XRP report they facilitate supply transfers for ETFs” — but maintained that a genuine supply shock implies an immediate allocation imbalance, not simply steady accumulation. “A supply shock implies allocation imbalance by the market. Which is not true,” Vet wrote. “Sure, if tomorrow someone says I want 30B XRP now then there will be a supply shock. But this person aside, with 16B and many more billion in Ripple hot accounts it’s very fair to say we have enough for everyone to get their hands on XRP.” For now, the thread draws a clear fault line: influencer-driven balance charts framing scarcity versus an infrastructure-side argument that XRP liquidity is elastic, rapidly mobilized, and unlikely to “shock” without an unusually large, urgent bid. At press time, XRP traded at $1.8982.

This data, captured on April 15, 2025, provides traders with crucial insights into market psychology and potential directional bias. The perpetual futures market, representing billions in open interest, serves as a real-time sentiment gauge for institutional and retail participants alike. Understanding BTC Perpetual Futures Market Structure Perpetual futures contracts represent one of cryptocurrency’s most innovative financial instruments. Unlike traditional futures with expiration dates, perpetual contracts continue indefinitely with funding rate mechanisms maintaining price alignment with spot markets. Consequently, the long/short ratio provides immediate insight into collective trader positioning. Major exchanges calculate this ratio by comparing the total value of long positions against short positions across all users. This metric has gained prominence as a leading indicator, often preceding significant price movements when extreme imbalances develop. Market analysts consistently monitor these ratios because they reflect real capital commitments rather than speculative opinions. When the ratio shows significant deviation from equilibrium, it frequently signals potential market reversals as overcrowded trades become vulnerable to liquidation cascades. The current data reveals an unusually balanced market environment across all three major platforms. This equilibrium suggests neither bulls nor bears have established decisive control, potentially indicating consolidation before the next significant trend. Detailed Analysis of Exchange-Specific Ratios The aggregated data from Binance, OKX, and Bybit presents subtle but meaningful variations in trader behavior across platforms. Each exchange attracts distinct user demographics and trading styles, which manifest in their respective long/short ratios. The following table summarizes the 24-hour data from these leading derivatives venues: Exchange Long Percentage Short Percentage Net Bias Overall Aggregate 50.31% 49.69% +0.62% Long Binance 50.33% 49.67% +0.66% Long OKX 51.78% 48.22% +3.56% Long Bybit 50.82% 49.18% +1.64% Long OKX demonstrates the most pronounced bullish bias among the three exchanges, with long positions exceeding shorts by 3.56 percentage points. This discrepancy may reflect regional trading patterns or platform-specific product features influencing user behavior. Meanwhile, Binance shows near-perfect equilibrium, possibly indicating its status as the most liquid and representative global marketplace. Bybit occupies a middle ground, suggesting moderate bullish sentiment among its user base. These variations, while subtle, provide valuable context for understanding market microstructure. Historical Context and Market Implications Historical analysis reveals that prolonged periods of ratio equilibrium often precede significant volatility expansions. During 2024, similar balanced ratios frequently occurred before major Bitcoin price movements exceeding 15% within subsequent weeks. Market structure experts note that when perpetual futures positioning becomes excessively one-sided, funding rates adjust to incentivize opposing positions, creating natural market stabilization mechanisms. The current balanced ratios suggest funding rates remain relatively neutral, reducing immediate pressure for mean reversion. Several factors contribute to the current equilibrium. First, macroeconomic uncertainty surrounding interest rate policies creates hesitation among directional traders. Second, Bitcoin’s consolidation within a defined price range encourages neutral strategies like basis trading. Third, increased institutional participation brings more sophisticated risk management, reducing extreme positioning. These elements combine to create the balanced sentiment reflected in the latest data. Market participants should monitor whether this equilibrium persists or breaks toward decisive bullish or bearish extremes. Methodology Behind Long/Short Ratio Calculations Exchanges employ sophisticated methodologies to calculate accurate long/short ratios. The process involves several critical steps: Position Aggregation: Systems sum the notional value of all open long and short positions Netting Exclusion: Traders with both long and short positions have their exposure netted appropriately Real-Time Updates: Ratios update continuously as positions open, close, or change in value Cross-Market Verification: Data undergoes validation against order book depth and funding rate trends This rigorous approach ensures ratios reflect genuine market exposure rather than statistical artifacts. However, traders should consider certain limitations. The ratio doesn’t distinguish between hedge positions and directional bets. Additionally, large institutional positions might not appear in retail-focused data. Despite these considerations, the metric remains invaluable for gauging market temperature. The consistency across three major exchanges strengthens the reliability of the current equilibrium reading. Comparative Analysis with Traditional Market Indicators The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio complements traditional market indicators, creating a more complete analytical picture. When combined with metrics like open interest, funding rates, and liquidation levels, traders gain multidimensional market insight. Currently, open interest remains near all-time highs, indicating substantial capital commitment despite balanced sentiment. Funding rates hover near neutral across all three exchanges, confirming the absence of extreme positioning pressure. This balanced derivatives environment contrasts with some on-chain metrics showing accumulation patterns among long-term holders. Such divergence between derivatives and on-chain data often signals complex market dynamics. Experienced analysts recommend monitoring whether derivatives sentiment follows on-chain accumulation or whether spot market movements force derivatives repositioning. The interplay between these datasets creates trading opportunities for those who interpret them correctly. The current equilibrium suggests neither dataset provides a decisive directional edge. Regional Variations and Their Significance Geographic analysis reveals interesting patterns behind the exchange-specific ratios. OKX’s stronger bullish bias may reflect Asian trading hours and regional market dynamics. Historical data shows Asian traders often exhibit different sentiment patterns compared to European and North American counterparts. These regional variations create arbitrage opportunities and influence global price discovery. The balanced ratios on Binance and Bybit likely result from their more geographically diverse user bases. Time zone analysis further enriches this interpretation. The 24-hour measurement period captures trading activity across Asian, European, and American sessions. The consistency throughout this cycle suggests the equilibrium isn’t an artifact of specific trading hours but represents genuine consensus. This temporal stability increases the metric’s significance as a market indicator. Traders should monitor whether upcoming economic announcements or regulatory developments disrupt this balanced sentiment. Risk Management Considerations for Current Market Conditions Balanced long/short ratios present unique risk management challenges and opportunities. Market participants should consider several strategic approaches: Reduced Directional Exposure: Neutral ratios suggest limiting outright long or short positions Volatility Positioning: Equilibrium often precedes volatility expansion, favoring options strategies Cross-Exchange Arbitrage: Subtle ratio differences create basis trading opportunities Liquidation Monitoring: Balanced markets have fewer liquidation risks but watch for sudden shifts Professional traders often use such balanced periods to establish strategic positions ahead of anticipated volatility. The absence of extreme positioning reduces the risk of sudden liquidation cascades, creating a more stable trading environment. However, this stability can deceive inexperienced participants into complacency. Historical patterns show that prolonged equilibrium frequently resolves through significant price movements as pent-up supply or demand finds expression. Conclusion The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio across Binance, OKX, and Bybit reveals a market in delicate equilibrium during April 2025. This balanced sentiment, with overall positioning at 50.31% long versus 49.69% short, indicates neither bulls nor bears have established dominance. The subtle variations between exchanges provide insights into regional trading behaviors and platform-specific dynamics. Market participants should monitor whether this equilibrium persists or breaks toward decisive directional bias. Such balanced ratios historically precede significant volatility, making current conditions particularly important for risk management and strategic positioning. The BTC perpetual futures market continues to provide invaluable sentiment data for informed trading decisions. FAQs Q1: What does the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio measure? The ratio measures the percentage of open long positions versus short positions across all traders on a derivatives exchange. It provides real-time insight into market sentiment and positioning bias. Q2: Why do ratios differ between exchanges like Binance, OKX, and Bybit? Differences arise from varying user demographics, regional trading patterns, platform features, and product offerings. Each exchange attracts traders with distinct strategies and risk appetites. Q3: How reliable is the long/short ratio as a market indicator? The ratio serves as a reliable sentiment gauge when combined with other metrics like funding rates and open interest. However, traders should consider its limitations regarding hedge positions and institutional data. Q4: What trading strategies suit balanced long/short ratio conditions? Neutral strategies like volatility plays, basis trading, and reduced directional exposure often work well during balanced conditions. These approaches manage risk while positioning for potential volatility expansion. Q5: How often should traders monitor these ratios? Serious derivatives participants should check ratios daily, as significant changes can occur rapidly. Many trading platforms provide real-time ratio displays alongside other market data for informed decision-making.

Key Takeaways: Armstrong says Bitcoin helps keep US fiscal policy in check. He warns inflation without growth could weaken the dollar’s reserve status. Rising debt is pushing investors toward Bitcoin and gold. Speaking on the Tetragrammaton podcast with Rick Rubin, Armstrong said Bitcoin offers an alternative when confidence in traditional monetary policy weakens. “Bitcoin provides a check and balance on the dollar,” he said, pointing to periods of rising deficits or inflation when investors may seek refuge outside fiat currencies. Armstrong Warns Inflation Without Growth Could Cost Dollar Its Reserve Status Armstrong added that moderate inflation can be manageable if matched by economic growth, but warned that persistent imbalances could carry serious consequences. “If inflation outstrips growth, you’ll eventually lose reserve currency status,” he said, describing such an outcome as a severe blow to the United States. In Armstrong’s view, Bitcoin’s existence indirectly restrains policy missteps by signaling that capital has alternatives. That dynamic, he argued, incentivizes central banks and regulators to protect confidence in the US economy. “In a strange way, Bitcoin is helping extend the American experiment,” he said. The comments come as fiscal pressures intensify. US national debt has climbed to roughly $37.65 trillion and is increasing by more than $70,000 per second, according to data from the US Congress Joint Economic Committee. The scale and pace of borrowing have reignited debate over long-term dollar stability and the role of hard assets during periods of monetary strain. Market behavior has reflected those concerns. In October, JPMorgan framed Bitcoin and gold as part of a “debasement trade” amid rising uncertainty around the dollar. Bitcoin surged to a peak above $126,000 before pulling back roughly 30%, while gold continued to set new highs, underscoring diverging investor preferences. Washington has also taken tentative steps toward integrating Bitcoin into its financial framework. In March, the Trump administration signed an executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, though it currently consists only of seized assets. The proposed Bitcoin Act of 2025, which would formalize the reserve, remains in early stages in Congress. Stablecoins, Not Bitcoin, May Do More to Extend Dollar Dominance However, some industry figures argue that stablecoins may be more effective at reinforcing dollar dominance than Bitcoin itself. Polygon Foundation CEO Sandeep Nailwal has said dollar-backed stablecoins are driving demand for US debt while expanding the dollar’s reach globally. “Dollarisation 2.0 is happening in real time,” he said, pointing to adoption across Latin America and Africa. Contrarian take: The Dollar is set to become more powerful than ever in the “short to medium term” — contrary to @RayDalio ’s predictions. Why? Stablecoins. They don’t just create persistent demand for U.S. debt — they’re transforming the dollar’s relationship with the world from… — Sandeep | CEO, Polygon Foundation (※,※) (@sandeepnailwal) November 7, 2025 The regulatory groundwork is already forming. The US passed the GENIUS Act in July , establishing one of the most comprehensive frameworks for stablecoins to date. Looking ahead to 2026, the industry remains divided. Strategy CEO Phong Le has argued that Bitcoin’s underlying fundamentals held up throughout 2025 despite weaker prices, while Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said earlier this year that he expects 2026 to be an “up year” for the asset. According to Linh Tran, market analyst at XS.com, Bitcoin’s recent price action underscores the market’s sensitivity to monetary policy expectations rather than headline economic data.

Crypto asset gains in the nation are currently subject to up to a 55% taxation, discouraging domestic trading. The proposed tax change, supported by the government, would place crypto profits towards a flat 20% levy, bringing the asset class on par with equities and investment trusts. Crypto Tax Shift to Attract More Investors According to a Nikkei report on Monday, the shift in taxes will categorize cryptos under a separate framework. The announcement to reduce the tax burden has garnered widespread attention among Japanese investors. “With cryptocurrencies now subject to the revised Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, various measures to protect investors are being put in place, making it easier for many people to accept cryptocurrencies,” said Kimihiro Mine, CEO of finoject, who is familiar with the crypto tax trends. Law is Limited to ‘Specific’ Crypto Assets – Here’s Why However, the tax reform has been confined to “specified crypto assets” handled by businesses registered in the Financial Instruments Business Operator Registry, the Monday report read. Though major crypto like Bitcoin and Ethereum are likely to qualify as specified crypto under the rule, it is still unclear what the business requirements will be. Additionally, for losses incurred from buying and selling virtual currencies, there will be a three-year carryover deduction system. This means that the losses can be carried forward and deducted for three years from 2026. With the revision in law, investment trusts incorporating cryptos would be allowed in Japan. Besides, the country rolled out its first XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) , with further goals to launch two ETFs in Japan that offer exposure to specific crypto assets.

The measure would hit net worth above $1 billion and would tax paper gains—assets counted even if they haven’t been sold. Supporters say the money would pay for health programs and other public services. Based on official estimates, the plan could raise up to ~$100 billion from roughly 200 very wealthy residents. What The Tax Would Do According to the initiative’s fiscal outline , the levy would apply to net worth on January 1, 2026, and it targets unrealized gains — stocks, company stakes, and other holdings valued on paper. Taxpayers could pay in one lump sum or stretch payments over five years, with interest if they choose the latter. For example, someone with $20 billion in assets would face about $1 billion in liability under a 5% rule. A resident with more than $200 billion could see a bill exceeding $10 billion. A 5% theft of unrealized gains and assets taxes were already paid on is about the most retarded thing I’ve ever heard. I promise you this will be the final straw. Billionaires will take with them all of their spending, hobbies, philanthropy and jobs. Solve the waste/fraud issue. https://t.co/DKcNWni2kB — Jesse Powell (@jespow) December 28, 2025 Industry Pushback And Warnings Based on reports , several high-profile crypto firms and founders say the measure would drive people and money out of California.

Some say the rule would be especially tough on founders whose wealth is tied up in startups. Supporters offer a different view. They argue the charge would target a small group—high net worth individuals—and provide funds for health care, education, and food programs without increasing taxes for middle-income families. Representative Ro Khanna has been mentioned as a backer who sees the revenue as a way to strengthen public services. Numbers And Unknowns The math is clear in one sense: 5% of very large sums adds up quickly. Estimates put potential revenue as high as ~$100 billion. But collection is less certain. Critics point to past cases where wealth taxes produced less money than forecast because some taxpayers relocated or shifted assets offshore. Valuing private companies and volatile holdings like crypto presents practical challenges, and that could make administration complex.

In December, no net additions were made to the treasuries, despite the lower SOL price. The Solana treasury companies also lost on the stock market, following peak hype in Q3. Forward Industries, the leading treasury company, is on track to finish the year with around 40% net gains. However, FWDI is down from a $39 peak in September. The company’s SOL treasury is valued at $871M, while the stock market cap is down to $608.8M, showing decreased enthusiasm for proxy buying. Solana Company, with a treasury of 2.3M SOL, failed to see its stock bounce. The former biotech company is trading at $2.78, down from a March peak of $772.50. DeFi Dev Corp is down from a yearly high of $53.88, trading at $5.76 toward the end of 2025. The company holds the third-largest treasury of 2.19M SOL. Toward the end of the year, the treasury companies did not have new inflows and had to switch to relying on the internal Solana ecosystem and its fees. Staking with validators may provide some windfalls for those companies, provided the price of SOL remains relatively stable. Solana ETFs extend net buying streak The relative novelty of Solana ETF extended the buying streak for funds. ETFs are not as reliable as treasuries for long term holding, as the trend may reverse at any time. The available Solana ETFs had mostly net inflows in the past three weeks. In total, the funds contain 7.86M SOL, breaking above the $1B tier in assets under management. The ETF may restart fees beyond that threshold. SOL remains relatively subdued, trading at $127.91. SOL’s mindshare is above 10% on social media, rising by 29.25% lately. Despite the price slowdown, Solana remains a key platform for decentralized activity and fast apps. The chain was among the biggest fee producers based on real economic activity for 2025. Despite the expansion of on-chain activity, SOL has been bound in a range for years, so far not fulfilling the expectations for four-digit valuations or even new price records. SOL is still pressured by the need for apps to realize profits, as some of the leading fee producers still sell on the open market. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Bitcoin’s long-run gains are being held up as proof it remains the top performing asset, while gold and silver have staged a dramatic rally that has surprised some investors. Opinions are divided and the debate is loud.

That figure dwarfs the gains recorded for silver and gold over the same stretch, which are roughly 400% and 280% respectively. Livingston argued that even if you ignore Bitcoin’s earliest years, the cryptocurrency still outpaced the metals by a large margin. Some see that as a clear win for the crypto thesis. Others are not convinced.

That challenge reflects a wider worry among metal holders that past performance may not repeat. Now do the last four years only. Times have changed. Bitcoin’s time has passed. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 27, 2025 Orange Horizon Wealth co-founder Matt Golliher offered a different angle, saying commodity prices tend to move back toward the cost of making them, and that higher prices often trigger more supply. He also pointed out that sources of gold and silver that were not profitable a year ago are now being mined at a profit. Supply And Macro Forces Driving Prices Gold and silver both surged to new highs in 2025. Reports show gold reached about $4,533 per ounce and silver approached nearly $80 per ounce. At the same time, the US dollar has weakened, with the US Dollar Index down roughly 10% for the year. Several analysts linked those moves to expectations around Fed easing in 2026 and to growing geopolitical tensions that can push traders into scarce assets. Zaner Metals strategist Peter Grant said thinner trading and the Fed outlook helped fuel sharp swings. Surprisingly unpopular opinion: Gold and silver do not need to slow down for Bitcoin to do well.

James Check, a lead analyst at Glassnode, argued that the assets do not have to trade against one another. Macro strategist Lyn Alden echoed that view, noting the two can both attract demand at the same time and are not strict rivals in practice. Arthur Hayes added that Fed easing and a weaker dollar should lift scarce assets broadly, including digital and physical stores of value.

The holiday period is marked by slow price action due to the low volume in the market. However, this hasn’t stopped the bulls from regaining control, with Bitcoin rallying to the $90k level a few hours ago. Ether reclaims $3k as Ethereum developers ramp up upgrades Ether, the native coin of the Ethereum blockchain, is the best performer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. It added 3% to its value in the last 24 hours and is now trading at $3,012 per coin. The positive performance comes as the bulls regain strength, with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies also in the green. Ether’s rally also comes as Ethereum developers ramp up upgrade discussions for 2026. Ethereum developers have agreed on the Hegota upgrade to take place in the second half of 2026. This upgrade will come after the Glamsterdam upgrade in the first half of the year and will focus on Verkle Trees. Verkle Trees is a newer data structure designed to help Ethereum nodes store and verify large amounts of data more efficiently. If implemented in the Hegota upgrade, Verkle Trees could significantly reduce hardware requirements for node operators, improving decentralization by making it easier for more participants to run nodes. Meanwhile, the Glamsterdam upgrade aims to address MEV fairness on the network. Glamsterdam will feature the Proposer-Builder Separation (ePBS), formally tracked as EIP-7732. With this proposal, Ethereum developers seek to distinguish between nodes that build blocks on the Ethereum blockchain and those that propose them. This will ensure no single actor can control which transactions are included or how they are ordered. Ether eyes the 50-day EMA The ETH/USD 4-hour chart is bearish and efficient as Ether has added 3% to its value in the last 24 hours. It is currently trading above $3k, marking its fourth consecutive day in an uptrend. The rally means that ETH is approaching the 50-day EMA at $3,136. If Ether overcomes this resistance level, it could extend its rally towards the 200-day EMA at $3,374, signaling an 11% upside from current prices. Similar to the other leading cryptocurrencies, momentum indicators on the ETH/USD chart have switched bullish on the 4-hour timeframe. The RSI stands at 62, indicating buying pressure. ETH could rally higher as the RSI seeks to cross into the overbought region. The MACD lines also crossed into the positive region over the weekend, suggesting a strong bullish bias. However, if the bulls fail to push ETH beyond its 50-day EMA, the major altcoin could retest the recent local support, with the December 18 low of $2,850 also a possibility.

According to detailed analysis from crypto research firm Presto Research, this price action represents a technical rebound rather than the beginning of substantial new momentum. Market observers now closely monitor whether Bitcoin can maintain this critical level as year-end trading conditions create unique market dynamics. Bitcoin Technical Rebound: Understanding the $90,000 Recovery Bitcoin’s ascent to $90,000 triggered significant market reactions across global exchanges. Rick Maeda, a prominent researcher at Presto Research, provided crucial insights into this movement. He explained that technical factors primarily drove the recovery rather than distinct fundamental catalysts. The breakthrough of the clear resistance level at $90,000 initiated a chain reaction of market behaviors. Specifically, short covering and momentum-based buying accelerated the price movement. Market participants responded to technical signals rather than new fundamental developments. This distinction carries important implications for traders and investors evaluating market conditions. Technical rebounds typically occur when prices bounce from support levels or break through resistance without accompanying fundamental improvements. These movements often prove temporary without sustained buying pressure. Historical data shows similar patterns during previous market cycles. For instance, Bitcoin experienced comparable technical rebounds in Q4 2023 and Q2 2024. Each instance required confirmation through subsequent price action and volume analysis. The current situation presents particular challenges due to seasonal trading patterns affecting market depth. Market Liquidity Dynamics During Holiday Season Reduced trading volumes during the year-end holiday season significantly impacted market conditions. Maeda emphasized that market liquidity has thinned considerably across major exchanges. This liquidity reduction creates amplified price movements relative to capital flows. Smaller buy or sell orders can trigger disproportionate price reactions in thin markets. Consequently, Bitcoin’s price demonstrates increased sensitivity to relatively modest capital movements. Traders must account for these conditions when executing strategies. The following table illustrates typical liquidity patterns during holiday periods: Time Period Average Daily Volume (BTC) Price Volatility Index Market Depth Reduction Normal Trading Week 25,000-35,000 BTC 45-55 points Baseline Holiday Season (Current) 12,000-18,000 BTC 65-80 points 40-60% reduction Post-Holiday Recovery 20,000-28,000 BTC 50-60 points 15-25% reduction Several factors contribute to these liquidity conditions: Institutional participation decreases as trading desks reduce staffing Retail traders show reduced activity during holiday periods Market makers adjust spreads to account for higher risk Asian and European markets experience different holiday schedules affecting global coordination Expert Analysis: Technical Versus Fundamental Drivers Market analysts distinguish between technical and fundamental price drivers through specific indicators. Technical rebounds typically exhibit certain characteristics that differentiate them from fundamental rallies. These include disproportionate volume-to-price relationships and specific chart patterns. The current Bitcoin movement shows several telltale signs of technical rather than fundamental strength. For example, the recovery lacked accompanying improvements in network fundamentals like hash rate or active addresses. Additionally, derivatives markets showed different patterns than during previous sustained rallies. Presto Research’s analysis aligns with observations from other market analysts. Multiple firms have noted similar dynamics in recent weeks. The consensus suggests cautious interpretation of the $90,000 breakthrough. Historical precedent indicates that technical rebounds often precede either consolidation or reversal. Much depends on subsequent price action and volume confirmation. The coming weeks will provide crucial data about market direction. Resistance Levels and Market Psychology The $90,000 resistance level represents a significant psychological barrier for Bitcoin traders. Breaking this level triggered specific market behaviors that analysts anticipated. Short covering occurs when traders who bet against Bitcoin must buy to close their positions. This buying pressure creates upward momentum that can attract additional buyers. However, this momentum often proves temporary without sustained fundamental support. Market psychology plays a crucial role in these situations. Traders monitor several key indicators to assess sustainability: Daily closing prices above $90,000 Trading volume confirmation during breakthroughs Derivatives market positioning and funding rates Exchange flows indicating accumulation or distribution Market depth restoration across major exchanges Current conditions present particular challenges for accurate assessment. The holiday-thinned liquidity complicates volume analysis. Similarly, reduced participation affects typical market signals. Experienced traders adjust their analytical frameworks during these periods. They incorporate seasonal adjustments and historical comparisons. The unique circumstances require careful interpretation of standard indicators. Historical Context and Comparative Analysis Bitcoin has experienced similar technical rebounds throughout its history. Each instance provides valuable lessons for current market participants. The 2017 bull market featured multiple technical rebounds that eventually consolidated into sustained momentum. Conversely, the 2018-2019 period showed technical rebounds that failed to establish new trends. Analysis of these historical patterns informs current market assessment. Several factors differentiate the current situation from historical precedents: Increased institutional participation changes market structure Regulatory developments create different fundamental backdrops Macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from previous cycles Technological developments like Lightning Network adoption progress Global adoption patterns show different geographical distribution These differences require updated analytical approaches. While historical patterns provide guidance, they cannot perfectly predict current outcomes. Market participants must synthesize multiple data sources. They should consider both technical patterns and fundamental developments. This comprehensive approach yields more reliable assessments. Market Structure Evolution Since 2023 The cryptocurrency market structure has evolved significantly in recent years. Institutional participation has increased through regulated products and services. This development affects market dynamics during all conditions. Holiday periods now show different patterns than in earlier market cycles. The current thin liquidity interacts with this evolved structure. Analysts must account for these structural changes when interpreting price action. Several structural developments influence current market behavior: Spot Bitcoin ETF products provide new access channels Regulated derivatives markets offer different risk management tools Institutional custody solutions change holding patterns Traditional finance integration creates new correlations Global regulatory frameworks establish different operating environments Conclusion Bitcoin’s recovery to $90,000 represents a significant technical rebound according to detailed analysis from Presto Research and other market observers. This movement demonstrates the importance of distinguishing between technical and fundamental price drivers. The holiday-thinned liquidity conditions amplify price movements relative to capital flows. Traders now watch carefully to see if Bitcoin can maintain the $90,000 level with daily closes. The coming weeks will reveal whether this technical rebound consolidates into sustained momentum or represents a temporary phenomenon. Market participants should consider both technical patterns and fundamental developments when making decisions. The Bitcoin technical rebound analysis provides crucial insights for navigating current market conditions. FAQs Q1: What exactly is a technical rebound in cryptocurrency markets? A technical rebound occurs when an asset’s price recovers from a decline or breaks through resistance primarily due to technical trading factors rather than fundamental improvements. These movements often involve short covering, momentum trading, and reactions to specific chart levels without accompanying fundamental catalysts. Q2: How does reduced liquidity during holidays affect Bitcoin’s price movements? Reduced liquidity means fewer buy and sell orders exist in the market, causing prices to move more dramatically in response to relatively small trades. This thin liquidity can amplify both upward and downward movements, creating increased volatility and potentially misleading signals about market strength. Q3: What indicators should traders watch to determine if Bitcoin’s recovery is sustainable? Traders should monitor daily closing prices above $90,000, trading volume confirmation during price movements, derivatives market positioning, exchange inflow/outflow patterns, and restoration of market depth across major exchanges as key sustainability indicators. Q4: How does short covering contribute to Bitcoin’s price recovery? Short covering occurs when traders who have borrowed and sold Bitcoin (betting on price declines) must repurchase Bitcoin to close their positions when prices rise. This forced buying creates additional upward pressure that can trigger momentum-based buying from other market participants. Q5: What differentiates a technical rebound from a fundamental rally? A technical rebound relies primarily on chart patterns, trading algorithms, and market mechanics, while a fundamental rally stems from improvements in underlying value drivers like adoption metrics, technological developments, regulatory clarity, or macroeconomic factors supporting the asset’s value proposition.

This remarkable growth in tokenized silver ETF trading coincides directly with a powerful rally in global spot silver prices, signaling a pivotal moment for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. According to blockchain data platform RWA.xyz, the tokenized version of the iShares Silver Trust (SLV) has led this charge, simultaneously attracting a 300% increase in unique holder addresses. Consequently, this activity highlights a profound shift in how both traditional and crypto-native investors are gaining exposure to precious metals. Tokenized Silver ETF Volume Analysis and Market Drivers The reported 1200% increase in trading volume is not an isolated statistic. Instead, it represents a convergence of several powerful financial and technological trends. Primarily, a sustained rally in the underlying physical silver market has provided fundamental momentum. Global industrial demand, monetary policy expectations, and geopolitical factors have all contributed to bullish sentiment for the white metal. Subsequently, tokenized versions of established ETFs like SLV offer a seamless, blockchain-based conduit for this sentiment. These digital tokens, which represent a claim on the physical bullion held by the fund, provide distinct advantages. For example, they enable 24/7 trading, fractional ownership, and integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Therefore, the volume surge reflects both speculative trading and strategic portfolio allocation into a newly accessible asset class. Data Breakdown and Holder Growth RWA.xyz, a leading tracker of on-chain real-world assets, provides the critical data underpinning this trend. The platform monitors the circulation and activity of tokenized versions of major financial instruments. Its data shows the following key metrics for tokenized SLV over a 30-day period: Trading Volume Increase: 1,200% Holder Address Growth: Approximately 300% Primary Venues: Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and select centralized platforms supporting the asset. This parallel growth in both volume and holders is particularly significant. It suggests the activity is driven by a broadening base of participants, not just a few large traders. Essentially, the tokenized silver ETF market is experiencing both deepening liquidity and widening adoption simultaneously. The Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization Landscape Tokenized silver ETFs are a flagship application within the broader RWA tokenization sector. This sector aims to bridge traditional finance (TradFi) with blockchain infrastructure by digitizing claims on physical assets. Other prominent examples include tokenized U.S. Treasury bills, real estate, and corporate bonds. The appeal lies in unlocking liquidity, reducing settlement times, and enabling transparent ownership records. Moreover, the infrastructure supporting these assets has matured considerably. Robust legal frameworks, reliable custodianship solutions, and compliant issuance platforms now provide the necessary trust layer. As a result, institutional investors are increasingly piloting and deploying capital into tokenized RWAs, lending credibility and scale to the entire niche. Comparative Growth: Select Tokenized RWAs (30-Day Period) Asset Type Representative Token Approx. Volume Growth Primary Catalyst Silver ETF Tokenized SLV 1200% Silver Price Rally U.S. Treasury Bills Various (e.g., USDY) 200% Yield Demand Real Estate Funds Region-specific tokens 85% Portfolio Diversification Expert Perspectives on the Surge and Future Implications Financial analysts observe that this surge is a textbook case of traditional and digital finance synergies. “When a macro asset like silver enters a bullish phase, investors now have a dual-path access model,” explains a market structure analyst from a major financial data firm. “They can buy the physical ETF, the futures, or the tokenized version. The 1200% spike in the tokenized channel indicates a specific demographic—often younger, tech-savvy, and globally distributed—is choosing the digital wrapper for its operational benefits.” Furthermore, this activity has tangible impacts. It drives liquidity to blockchain networks, validates the RWA use case for developers, and pressures traditional financial institutions to accelerate their own digital asset strategies. Looking ahead, sustained interest could lead to more tokenized commodity products, such as gold, copper, or lithium ETFs, expanding the digital basket of tradable real-world assets. Risks and Regulatory Context Despite the explosive growth, market participants note several important considerations. The regulatory status of tokenized securities varies significantly by jurisdiction. Investors must assess the legal structure of the tokenization platform and the custody of the underlying assets. Additionally, while blockchain settlement is fast, it can be exposed to smart contract risk or network congestion. However, proponents argue that the transparency of blockchain—where every transaction and total supply is publicly verifiable—can mitigate certain counterparty risks present in traditional systems. Ultimately, the maturation of this market depends on continued regulatory clarity and the development of robust, institutional-grade infrastructure. Conclusion The 1200% explosion in tokenized silver ETF trading volume is a multifaceted event with deep implications. It is fundamentally tied to a rally in physical silver prices but amplified by the unique advantages of blockchain-based finance. The concurrent 300% rise in holders demonstrates broadening adoption beyond mere speculation. This trend underscores the accelerating convergence of traditional commodities markets and digital asset innovation. As the RWA tokenization sector evolves, the performance of tokenized precious metals will serve as a critical barometer for the entire movement’s viability and growth trajectory. FAQs Q1: What is a tokenized silver ETF? A tokenized silver ETF is a digital representation of shares in a traditional silver exchange-traded fund (like iShares Silver Trust) issued on a blockchain. Each token signifies ownership of a portion of the physical silver bullion held by the fund. Q2: What caused the 1200% volume surge? The primary driver is a significant rally in the global spot price of silver, fueled by industrial demand and macroeconomic factors. The tokenized format’s advantages—24/7 trading, fractional shares, and DeFi compatibility—attracted amplified trading activity from digital asset investors. Q3: Is tokenized SLV the same as buying the SLV ETF on a stock exchange? Economically, they represent the same underlying asset. However, the tokenized version is bought and sold on blockchain-based platforms using digital wallets, often with different trading hours, custody models, and regulatory considerations compared to traditional brokerage accounts. Q4: What are the risks of investing in tokenized silver ETFs? Risks include the volatility of silver prices, the regulatory uncertainty surrounding digital securities in some regions, potential smart contract vulnerabilities, and reliance on the issuer’s and custodian’s integrity to properly back the tokens with physical metal. Q5: Does this trend indicate a broader move toward tokenized real-world assets? Yes, the surge in tokenized silver ETF activity is a prominent example of a larger trend. Assets like U.S. Treasuries, real estate, and private credit are also being tokenized, aiming to improve liquidity, accessibility, and efficiency in traditional finance markets.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/jake-claver-im-more-bullish-on-xrp-than-ever-heres-why/,"Business Leader Jake Claver has presented a notably optimistic assessment of XRP, highlighting the asset’s outlook based on expanding real-world infrastructure rather than short-term market movements. The commentary explains that confidence in XRP is increasingly tied to measurable developments across the XRP Ledger and the continued global expansion of enterprise-grade payment solutions associated with Ripple. Rather than focusing on only price targets, the analysis centers on adoption trends and network growth as the primary drivers of long-term value. I’m more bullish than ever on XRP New projects are launching on the #XRPL and @Ripple ’s payments software keeps expanding, now reaching new users in 80% of global trade corridors The network effect is only getting stronger — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) December 26, 2025 Growth of Projects on the XRP Ledger A central point of Jake Claver’s assessment is the steady increase in new projects launching on the XRPL. This trend is positioned as evidence that developer interest remains active and resilient despite broader market cycles. The growing number of applications and integrations is portrayed as reinforcing the ledger’s utility, particularly in areas related to payments, liquidity management, and tokenized assets. From this perspective, the expanding ecosystem contributes to a stronger foundation for sustained usage rather than speculative demand. Expansion of Global Payment Infrastructure The commentary also underscores the widening reach of Ripple’s payments software, noting that it now connects users across approximately 80 percent of global trade corridors. This level of coverage is presented as a significant indicator of practical adoption, especially in regions where cross-border payment efficiency remains a challenge . Jake Claver describes this expansion as a critical component of XRP’s broader value proposition, arguing that increased institutional and enterprise usage strengthens transactional throughput and liquidity across the network. Network Effects and Long-Term Adoption Another key theme highlighted is the strengthening network effect surrounding XRP. As more participants, including financial institutions and service providers, integrate XRPL-based solutions , the overall utility of the network is described as compounding. Jake Claver suggests that this dynamic supports a more durable growth model, where usage builds incrementally and reinforces itself over time rather than relying on isolated adoption events. Community Perspectives on Usage and Price Expectations Responses from other market participants add further context to the analyst’s view. One commentator emphasized that bullish sentiment carries greater significance when it translates into tangible usage, noting that real-world adoption often progresses gradually before accelerating. From this standpoint, patience is viewed as essential, as markets tend to challenge conviction during extended periods of consolidation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another community member reflected on earlier price expectations, acknowledging revised assumptions in light of macroeconomic conditions and developments across the XRPL, while expressing confidence in substantially higher valuations over the coming years. A Usage-Centered Thesis Overall, Jake Claver’s commentary presents a usage-centered thesis for XRP, grounded in expanding infrastructure, increasing developer activity, and growing global payment coverage. The emphasis remains firmly on fundamentals, suggesting that if current adoption trends persist, market valuation may ultimately reflect the scale and reach of real-world integration rather than speculative cycles alone.

56538238,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=885500,1767000054,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56538238.jpeg,Ethereum smart contract deployments reach new 8.7M high in Q4,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ethereum-smart-contract-deployments/,"Token Terminal data revealed that smart contracts deployed on Ethereum hit an all-time high of 8.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2025. The surge was partly driven by the approval of ETH ETFs, which boosted DeFi adoption and increased the number of active addresses. According to Token Terminal, the surge in smart contract deployment also marks a significant increase in developer activity. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, recently claimed the rising deployment on Ethereum has become easy as anyone “can just build on the L1.” The rise also coincides with growing institutional interest and regulatory clarity. Token Terminal also noted that the growth of active addresses supported Ethereum’s expansion. Etherscan.io data shows that the number of active addresses is almost doubling from 396,439 to 610,454 YTD. There was also an increase in transaction volume, with a surge in user activity contributing to a higher demand for smart contracts and decentralized apps. Developers leverage Ethereum for new financial tools and services A CryptoQuant analyst noted that Ethereum’s on-chain activity suggests the network’s maturity, as developers and institutions increasingly recognize its value. Both developers and institutions use Ethereum for innovative financial tools and applications across various industries. The analyst further notes that the 30-day moving average (MA) for new smart contracts deployed on Ethereum reaching 171,000 is also a very positive indicator. It suggests confidence in the ecosystem. The MA metric also indicates a consistent upward trend in the development and deployment of DApps, new tokens, and protocols. Meanwhile, the continued growth of Ethereum can be attributed to the expansion of Layer 2 (L2) solutions, such as Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism. These L2 solutions have increased efficiency and lowered transaction costs (gas fees), encouraging more smart contract deployments. The analyst further pointed out that innovation across DeFi , NFTs, GameFi, and Restaking is also fueling the demand for new smart contracts to power these applications. Ethereum remains the primary smart contract development platform due to its robust ecosystem of libraries, a strong developer community, and tools that continue to foster the launch of more projects and attract new talent. The network continues to evolve despite market corrections. Markets have mixed reactions to ETH’s price action ETH’s price in Q4 2025 dropped nearly 27.6%, according to CoinGecko. Despite the record number of deployed smart contracts, the price fluctuated below $3,000 amid selling pressure as ETH failed to break above crucial resistance levels, capping short-term bounces. The price stabilized near $2,950, but remained within a corrective structure. ETH is currently trading at $3,019, representing a 2.7% increase over the past 24 hours. On-chain data also revealed an increase in exchange flows, with reserves surging by over 400,000 ETH (from 16.2M ETH to 16.6M ETH) in December. However, the movement suggested distribution pressure rather than accumulation, as whale and institutional activity added to the uncertainty. Some large transfers were carried out on major exchanges. Meanwhile, the CryptoQuant analyst stressed that Ethereum’s long-term fundamentals remain strong despite the bearish technical indicators. Developer and network activity also continue to grow as analysts and traders closely monitor key price levels for signs of a possible recovery early next year. The record number of contracts deployed on Ethereum in Q4 2025 emphasizes the platform’s growing importance in the crypto space, making it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure to the ecosystem. The approval of ETH ETFs has further opened up new investment channels, contributing to increased liquidity and price stability. However, analyst Benjamin Cowen claims that Ethereum is unlikely to hit new ATHs in 2026 as the broader crypto market conditions remain fragile. According to Cowen, it will be difficult for ETH to rise as projected if Bitcoin is genuinely in a bear market.

This remarkable milestone, announced on March 21, 2025, not only highlights rapid user growth but also signals a significant shift in the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. Furthermore, the platform’s cumulative open interest has soared past $110 million, a figure that now positions it as a clear industry leader. This explosive growth provides critical insights into the evolving appetite for decentralized event-driven financial instruments. Opinion Labs Trading Volume Analysis and Market Context The achievement of a $10 billion trading volume in under two months is unprecedented for a decentralized application (dApp) in its niche. For context, major decentralized exchanges (DEXs) often take several months to reach similar benchmarks in their early phases. This volume indicates substantial liquidity and active user participation from day one. The platform facilitates peer-to-peer betting on real-world events, from election outcomes to financial market movements. Consequently, this high volume suggests traders are increasingly trusting decentralized, blockchain-based systems over traditional, centralized prediction markets. The architecture of Opinion Labs, built on a scalable Layer-2 solution, effectively supported this surge without major congestion or fee spikes. Decentralized Prediction Market Competitive Landscape The $110 million in open interest—the total value of outstanding contracts—firmly cements Opinion Labs’ position. It now ranks second only to the established giant, Polymarket. This metric is crucial because it represents committed capital and sustained user engagement, not just fleeting transactions. To illustrate the scale of this achievement, consider the open interest of other notable platforms. For instance, Predict maintains approximately $10 million, Myriad holds around $1 million, and Limitless reports about $700,000. Therefore, Opinion Labs’ figure is an order of magnitude larger than most competitors. The following table provides a clear comparison of key market players: Platform Cumulative Open Interest Key Differentiator Polymarket Market Leader First-mover advantage, wide event variety Opinion Labs $110 Million Rapid growth, advanced incentive mechanisms Predict $10 Million Focus on specific geopolitical events Myriad $1 Million Community-driven event creation Limitless $700,000 Cross-chain compatibility This data reveals a market that is rapidly consolidating around a few major players. The significant gap between the top two and the rest suggests strong network effects, where liquidity attracts more users, which in turn creates more liquidity. Drivers Behind the Phenomenal Growth Several key factors contributed to this record-breaking launch performance. Primarily, the platform launched during a period of heightened global uncertainty, with multiple major elections and economic policy decisions pending. Traders naturally sought venues to hedge risks or speculate on outcomes. Secondly, Opinion Labs implemented a sophisticated liquidity mining and rewards program. This program directly incentivized early providers of liquidity to the platform’s markets. Additionally, the platform’s user experience received praise for its intuitive design, lowering the barrier to entry for non-crypto-native users. The technical team also prioritized low transaction costs and fast settlement times, which are critical for a positive trading experience. Expert Analysis on Sustainability and Risks Market analysts point to the open interest figure as a more sustainable metric than raw trading volume, which can be inflated by wash trading or high-frequency arbitrage. The $110 million in open interest indicates genuine, longer-term positions. However, experts from firms like Delphi Digital and The Block Research caution that the platform must now navigate scaling challenges and regulatory scrutiny. Prediction markets often operate in a legal gray area in many jurisdictions. The team behind Opinion Labs has proactively engaged with legal frameworks, structuring contracts as informational exchanges rather than pure gambling instruments. Moreover, the use of decentralized oracles like Chainlink for reliable event resolution has bolstered trust in the platform’s integrity. The rapid growth, while impressive, also places immense pressure on security protocols and smart contract audits to protect user funds. The Broader Impact on DeFi and Traditional Finance The success of Opinion Labs has broader implications for the entire DeFi sector. It demonstrates a viable path for niche financial products to achieve mainstream traction. Prediction markets are often cited as potential “killer apps” for blockchain technology because they offer global, permissionless, and transparent access. This growth also attracts institutional attention. Traditional finance entities are now studying these markets for their predictive power, often referred to as the “wisdom of the crowd.” Prices on these platforms can serve as sentiment indicators for everything from commodity shortages to the probability of geopolitical events. Consequently, the data generated by Opinion Labs is becoming a valuable commodity in itself. The platform’s architecture, which ensures all trades and outcomes are immutably recorded on-chain, provides an audit trail that centralized counterparts cannot match. Conclusion Opinion Labs surpassing $10 billion in trading volume with $110 million in open interest within 55 days is a landmark event for decentralized prediction markets. It validates the product-market fit for blockchain-based event trading and establishes a powerful new contender alongside Polymarket. The platform’s growth was driven by strategic timing, strong incentive design, and a focus on user experience. While challenges around regulation and sustainable scaling remain, the metrics indicate a profound shift in how people engage with financial forecasting. The Opinion Labs phenomenon underscores the accelerating convergence of decentralized finance with real-world event analysis, creating a new, transparent layer for global market sentiment. FAQs Q1: What is a decentralized prediction market? A decentralized prediction market is a blockchain-based platform that allows users to create and trade shares in the outcome of future events. Unlike centralized versions, it operates without a controlling intermediary, using smart contracts to manage funds and payouts. Q2: Why is open interest an important metric? Open interest measures the total value of active, unsettled contracts on a platform. It is a key indicator of sustained user engagement and liquidity depth, often considered more meaningful than one-time trading volume for assessing a market’s health. Q3: How does Opinion Labs differ from Polymarket? While both are leading decentralized prediction markets, Opinion Labs achieved its growth metrics much faster post-launch, potentially due to more aggressive liquidity incentives and a later technological stack. Polymarket currently has a wider variety of markets and a longer track record. Q4: Are funds on Opinion Labs safe? Funds are secured by blockchain smart contracts which have undergone professional audits. However, as with all DeFi protocols, risks include potential smart contract vulnerabilities, oracle manipulation, and the inherent volatility of the crypto assets used for trading. Q5: What does this growth mean for the average cryptocurrency investor? It signals a maturing DeFi sector where applications beyond simple lending and trading are gaining traction. It may present new investment opportunities in governance tokens of such platforms or related infrastructure, but it also highlights the need for thorough due diligence in nascent markets.

Local media affiliated with the People’s Bank of China have cited the central bank’s deputy governor, Lu Lei, who said banks will pay interest on the amount of digital yuan held in user wallets starting January 1. This is happening under a new “action plan”, according to Lu, that seeks to reclassify the e-CNY from functioning as digital cash to operating as “digital deposit currency,” marking a major shift in the project’s underlying legal and technical framework. According to the PBOC official, the overhaul comes following more than a decade of development and pilot programs and will offer the digital yuan the same legal status as deposits held at commercial banks. “The future digital yuan will be a modern digital payment and circulation means issued and circulated within the financial system, with technical support and supervision provided by the central bank, possessing the attributes of commercial bank liabilities, based on accounts, compatible with distributed ledger technology, and having the functions of a measure of monetary value, store of value, and cross-border payment,” Lei wrote. Now, banks will be allowed to pay interest on verified digital yuan wallets in accordance with existing self-regulatory agreements on deposit pricing. At the same time, digital yuan balances will receive full protection under China’s deposit insurance system, according to Lu. Banks will also have more operational flexibility to manage digital yuan balances as part of their broader asset and liability operations. Meanwhile, for non-bank payment institutions, the digital yuan reserve funds will be treated like existing customer reserve requirements, with a 100% reserve ratio applied, Lu added. As a part of the renewed push, the PBOC has recently established a Digital RMB Operation and Management Center that will oversee infrastructure upgrades and promote the development of the e-CNY from its Shanghai base. Digital yuan push continues as adoption remains slow China’s digital yuan, or e-CNY, is a state-controlled, centralized central bank digital currency that is designed to replace physical cash for domestic retail payments and reduce reliance on private payment platforms like Alipay and WeChat Pay. Its value is pegged 1:1 to the physical yuan and is distributed through a two-tier system involving the PBOC and commercial banks. Since its inception in 2014 and subsequent pilot launches starting in 2020 across half of mainland provinces, the digital yuan has struggled to gain widespread traction, mostly due to competition from widely used alternatives offered by entrenched tech platforms. However, China has continually pushed to expand its reach, including plans to integrate the digital yuan across the country’s free trade zones. Per reports in June, the PBOC is actively working on policy blueprints to enable broader use in these zones. More recently, last week, the PBOC pledged to expand cross-border use of the digital yuan through a planned pilot with Singapore and has also taken steps to establish cooperation with markets such as Thailand, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia.

Supply becomes restricted, development is evident, and action changes transitioning to prices not entirely responding. That trend is beginning to take shape with one new cryptocurrency as its available allocation is becoming thinner. With less than one percent of the current phase left, focus is shifting to what it seems would be much more dissimilar to most late-cycle altcoins. Presale Progress The current price of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set at $0.035, which was achieved after a gradual increase in the course of various presales. The token has already surged over 250% since it began sale in early 2025 and today, it is selling at a different level (as compared to its position in Phase 1) at $0.01. That growth has not been occasioned by spurts, but steady demand throughout the stages. The presale has raised an approximate of $19.45M and the participation is amongst over 18,650 holders. The presale has 45.5% of a fixed 4B total supply. That equals about 1.82B tokens. To date, approximately 825M of the tokens were sold. An all-occurring phase 6 is now over 99% allocated, and this implies that supply in the present price is almost exhausted. It was officially launched at a price of $0.06, which puts the early entrants of the initial phases in a place where they can increase their price by 500% by the time of the release. The following phase will bring with itself an increase in prices of approximately 20%, a move that in the past speeds up distribution as supply balances remain scarce. Mutuum Finance also has a 24-hour leaderboard to maintain activity throughout this phase. The leading daily participant has a reward of $500 in MUTM, which is a motivation to ensure orders are placed on a regular basis and not a single purchase. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is essentially a DeFi crypto protocol that is dedicated to lending and borrowing. The model is based on two lending markets that bridge the relationship between capital providers and borrowers with explicit regulations. The people who put in assets are issued with mtTokens which reflect their status and increase in value as interest is accumulated. These mtTokens are directly related to protocol use such that there is a distinct connection between activity and yield. One of the characteristics is the buy-and-distribute model. Some of the protocol fees are utilized in buying MUTM available in the market. The latter are then reallocated to users staking the mtTokens in the safety module. In this structure, the revenue is tied to the token demand rather than attention cycles. Security has been considered as one of the fundamental requirements. Mutuum Finance has scored a 90/100 CertiK scan token and Halborn Security is undertaking an independent audit on the lending and borrowing contracts. The codebase is complete and on the formal analysis, with a bug bounty program of $50k. Stablecoin Plans, Oracle and Price Prospect Further afield, Mutuum Finance will eventually launch an overcollateralized borrower-backed stable-coin. Assets that are not volatile are expected to become more utilized each day, and thus lending demand, as well as capital efficiency in the entire protocol, are likely to enhance. This system is also developed based on the strong oracle infrastructure. Feeds built on Chainlink will be used to provide appropriate valuations and fallback oracles as well as price aggregations. In the case of lending platforms, consistent pricing is a requirement to both liquidations and risk management. According to some analysts, such a combination of factors preconditions a high upside once these products are put to use. Under a bullish market, it is projected that MUTM will be able to rise 6x to 8x of its current position once supply declines and post launch activity begins to pick up. Although results are never guaranteed, the rationale is based on the reduction in availability, observable utility, and demand, pegged on revenue. Why Timing Matters Right Now The V1 will go live on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, and the assets will be ETH and USDT. Around the time that milestone is reached, the behavior tends to change into watching to positioning. Although Phase 6 is almost in its final phase, recent new whale allocations, even a few over $100k, mirror increased confidence as the supply is reduced. Integrated with the possibility of using cards to make payments and constant leaderboard activity, the last segment of this phase is progressing at an extremely rapid pace. To those following the potential best crypto to invest in or the next big crypto within the coming one year, 2026, Mutuum Finance is in a thin to middle. Still the price is low, infrastructure is almost established and supply available is dying away.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) announced that commercial banks will begin paying interest on digital yuan holdings. This marks a fundamental shift in how the world's second-largest economy approaches its central bank digital currency. Lu Lei, Deputy Governor of the PBOC, outlined the transformation in an article published by the state-owned Financial News. The digital yuan, known as e-CNY, will transition from functioning as digital cash to operating as digital deposit money. This change aims to boost adoption rates among Chinese citizens and businesses. Legal Tender Status Sets Digital Yuan Apart The digital yuan carries legal tender status in China. This designation creates a critical difference between e-CNY and popular private payment platforms. Alipay and WeChat Pay dominate China's mobile payment landscape, but they lack official legal tender recognition. Businesses must accept digital yuan payments due to its status as a legal tender. Private payment apps remain optional for merchants. This mandatory acceptance requirement gives the PBOC's digital currency a competitive edge in the market. The digital yuan functions similarly to existing mobile wallet applications. Users can make purchases, transfer funds, and manage accounts through their smartphones. However, the legal framework supporting e-CNY provides government backing that private platforms cannot match. Cross-Border Expansion Through the mBridge Platform China completed its first cross-border digital yuan transaction in Laos. This milestone demonstrates the currency's potential for international trade and payments. The PBOC continues developing infrastructure to support cross-border usage. The mBridge platform received significant upgrades to facilitate these international transactions. Multiple central banks participate in this innovative system.

In a recent post accompanied by a short video, the analyst highlighted that Russia’s central bank leadership is moving to relax restrictions on Bitcoin and other digital assets. This step has received limited coverage but could carry wide implications for the sector, including XRP . Rather than presenting the news as a routine regulatory update, the analyst framed it as a development with strategic importance. According to his commentary, the initial reaction may be to dismiss such announcements as symbolic. However, he argued that the context surrounding Russia’s financial position makes this shift far more significant than it appears at first glance. Russia Opened the Crypto Door #XRP !! pic.twitter.com/DYjCpIjkxS — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) December 26, 2025 Crypto as a Tool for Financial Adaptation Ripple Bull Winkle explained that Russia’s motivation is not rooted in encouraging retail trading activity or promoting innovation narratives common in crypto markets. Instead, he pointed to the country’s growing isolation from traditional financial infrastructure. With access to systems such as SWIFT restricted and cross-border payments constrained by sanctions, Russia faces structural challenges in conducting international transactions. Within that setting, the analyst suggested that digital assets offer a functional alternative. Cryptocurrencies operate without relying on correspondent banks and are not limited by national boundaries. From this perspective, easing regulations is not an endorsement of risk-taking but an acknowledgment of utility. The analyst stressed that Russia is adapting to circumstances rather than resisting them, treating crypto as a practical solution rather than a speculative instrument. He further noted that this approach reflects recognition that decentralized networks can operate independently of established financial rails, a feature that becomes critical when conventional systems are inaccessible. Timing, XRP, and Broader Market Signals Another point emphasized in the video was timing. Ripple Bull Winkle contrasted Russia’s actions with ongoing debates among Western regulators, where policy processes often move slowly. In his view, major economies tend to position themselves quietly when they see long-term strategic value, rather than reacting for short-term advantage. By highlighting XRP in his post, the analyst implied that assets designed for fast, low-cost transfers could benefit if large economies increasingly explore crypto-based settlement options.

The analyst concluded that when governments begin adjusting their stance toward digital assets, markets tend to respond decisively. His message urged observers to pay closer attention to such policy moves, arguing that they often precede broader changes in adoption and capital flows. In presenting Russia’s easing approach as a signal rather than an isolated event, Ripple Bull Winkle positioned the development as one that could influence how crypto, including XRP, is perceived in an evolving global financial landscape.

The move has reignited a long-running debate over immutability and crisis management in crypto networks. The controversy began after an attacker exploited a vulnerability in Flow’s execution layer on Dec. 27, siphoning roughly $3.9 million in assets off the network through multiple cross-chain bridges before validators halted the chain. Flow Foundation and forensic partner FindLabs later confirmed that existing user balances were not accessed and said the exploit was contained quickly, with exit routes mapped and freeze requests sent to major exchanges and stablecoin issuers. FLOW NETWORK INCIDENT: Forensic Fund Tracking Report FindLabs is publishing the following analysis in collaboration with the Flow Foundation's security and engineering teams, who conducted the primary forensic investigation. • INCIDENT CONFIRMATION On December 27, 2025, an… — Find Labs (@findlabs) December 27, 2025 The attacker’s Ethereum wallet was identified, and investigators said laundering attempts through Thorchain and Chainflip were being tracked in real time. Within hours of the halt, Flow core developers proposed a rollback to a checkpoint prior to the exploit, a move that would erase all transactions submitted during a several-hour window and require users and infrastructure providers to resubmit activity. Flow Partners Question Rollback as Network Activity Freezes The Foundation framed the rollback as a way to neutralize unauthorized minting and restore the ledger to a clean state. However, the proposal immediately alarmed key partners who said they were not consulted. Alex Smirnov, founder of cross-chain bridge deBridge, one of Flow’s major bridge providers, said he learned of the rollback decision after it was already announced publicly. I woke up to the news about Flow’s decision to roll back the chain. Despite Flow stating that they are “in a mandatory synchronization window with critical ecosystem partners (bridges, CEXs, DEXs)”, I can confirm that 𝐝𝐞𝐁𝐫𝐢𝐝𝐠𝐞 — 𝐨𝐧𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐦𝐚𝐣𝐨𝐫 𝐛𝐫𝐢𝐝𝐠𝐞… https://t.co/oVTPbKDMcl — deAlex (@AlexSmirnov) December 28, 2025 Smirnov warned that reverting the chain could create doubled balances for users who bridged assets out during the rollback window, while leaving others who bridged in facing losses with no clear reimbursement plan. He urged Flow validators to halt transaction validation until the Foundation clarified how these edge cases would be resolved and how custodians such as LayerZero, the primary USDC custodian on Flow, were expected to handle affected transfers. Data from Flowscan showed the network stalled at a fixed block height for an extended period, even as the Foundation said a restart was expected within hours. Source: flowscan The uncertainty rippled through the market as the FLOW token fell more than 40% following the exploit and rollback announcement, and some centralized exchanges temporarily suspended transactions. Source: DefiLlama Data on DefiLlama showed Flow’s total value locked dropped from $107 million to $73.8 million after the incident before rebounding to about $97.2 million, a 31% recovery in 24 hours. Rollback Debate Ends as Flow Adopts Narrow Recovery Plan Criticism intensified as legal and technical observers weighed in. Delphi Labs general counsel Gabriel Shapiro said the approach risked pushing losses onto bridges and issuers by effectively creating unbacked assets, while Smirnov argued that the financial damage from a rollback could exceed the original exploit. Chain rollbacks remain rare and contentious in crypto because they undo confirmed transactions and raise questions about decentralization and trust. Facing mounting pressure, the Flow Foundation shifted course. On Dec. 29, it announced a revised remediation plan developed in consultation with bridge operators, exchanges, and validators. The updated approach abandoned a global rollback and instead focused on isolating and destroying fraudulently minted tokens while preserving legitimate user activity. Dapper Labs, which launched Flow, said it reviewed and supported the revised plan. Following this update from Flow, we want to make it clear that no Dapper Labs user balances or assets are impacted. Including the Dapper Labs treasury. Dapper Platforms will be back online when the Flow network resumes normal operations, currently expected to happen in ~6… https://t.co/NPx6vtSqFw — Dapper Labs (@dapperlabs) December 27, 2025 Under the new plan, the network would restart in phases, temporarily restricting accounts identified through independent forensic analysis as recipients of illicit tokens. Validators later approved a software upgrade enabling this targeted remediation, and the network returned online in a read-only testing mode ahead of a phased restoration. The Foundation said more than 99.9% of accounts would remain unaffected, with ongoing updates promised as normal operations gradually resume.

This rally has also lifted total exports for the year so far to an unprecedented 1.98 million units, with buyers in Asia, Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Oceania all taking the largest volumes, while shipments to Northern America shrank thanks to Trump’s trade wars. Beyond autos, China’s industrial profits fell 13.1% in November from a year earlier after a 5.5% decline in October. Forecasts had pointed to a deeper drop. For the first 11 months, profits rose just 0.1%, slowing from a 1.9% gain earlier in the year. Manufacturers still posted a 5% increase, backed by aerospace and electronics, while utilities stayed positive and mining losses remained in double digits.

Meanwhile, Latin America and the Caribbean recorded the sharpest regional growth, with 35,182 vehicles in November, up 283%, bringing the annual total to 249,502 units, a 65% increase. Oceania imported 6,348 vehicles, up 70%, while Africa received 4,632 units, a 134% rise, lifting its yearly total to 37,101 vehicles. Northern America stood out on the downside, with only 686 vehicles shipped in November, a 46% plunge, leaving year-to-date deliveries at 8,668 units, down by 73%.

Thailand received 13,517 vehicles, rising 66%, while the Philippines took 12,562, up 30%, and Malaysia imported 9,626 vehicles (up 273%), and Turkiye recorded 9,292 units, a 760% surge. The UK received 9,096 vehicles, rising 113%, while Belgium imported 8,953, up 8.6%, even as its yearly total slipped 15%. Brazil took 8,504 vehicles, up 155%, and India imported 8,288, rising 6.4%. Leapmotor deal and profit slump add pressure at home for China EV markets At home, China’s crowded EV market continued to thin as Zhejiang Leapmotor agreed to sell 3.74 billion yuan, or $534 million, worth of shares to state-owned FAW Group, giving FAW a 5% stake once regulators approve the deal, which could take months, according to Bloomberg. The transaction comes as more than 100 Chinese EV brands fight for buyers while sales growth slows, since years of price cuts have hit margins across the supply chain, and authorities have encouraged state-backed companies like FAW to absorb smaller players. Leapmotor, which runs a global distribution venture with Stellantis NV, is among the few local EV makers posting profits. Its family-focused SUVs helped sales in the first 11 months of 2025 double from a year earlier, passing its 500,000 vehicle target ahead of schedule. Leapmotor CEO Zhu Jiangming said in a company WeChat post on Sunday, “The goal is to sell one million vehicles next year and reach four million in annual sales within ten years.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",Tech|BRL|CNY|GBP|INR|Leapmotor|MXN|Stellantis,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-29 09:40:06

As use cases for cryptocurrencies proliferate, taxes inevitably climb the priority and consideration ladders, accompanied by a growing year-on-year surge in adoption. The following is an in-depth overview of ZenLedger, which has positioned itself as a leading solution in the field of crypto taxes. I will take a closer look at its features, how it compares to competitors, its pricing, jurisdiction coverage, and potential benefits for institutional users. Main Takeaways: ZenLedger calculates digital asset taxes and generates up-to-date reports. The dashboard integrates several wallets, bringing multiple accounts under one umbrella. End-to-end state and federal tax filings for users. Comprehensive API access backed with strict compliance standards. Deep service integrations for DeFi protocols, NFTs, etc. The Verdict ZenLedger is a popular crypto tax software that allows users to track their portfolios in real time, calculate income taxes, and generate forms. The platform stands out for being quite easy to understand, even for users not familiar with tax laws in the field of cryptocurrencies. It offers downloadable tax forms, keeping users up-to-date with dynamic regulations. In addition to these, users are equipped with several tools to optimize crypto tax handling, including tax audit and tax loss harvesting. Generally, the platform is considered safe for all classes of investors following strict compliance and security measures. Onboarding & User Experience Quick Summary: Opening a ZenLedger account is straightforward and secure. The company prioritizes a friendly interface to ensure user satisfaction. Users can join with their Google or Coinbase accounts for convenience. Configuring your settings is easy, and once done, the platform delivers a relatively seamless user experience, compared to competing platforms like CoinLedger or Koinly . Creating an account To open an account, visit the website and click ‘Sign Up.’ You can register with your Coinbase or Google account. You can also use MetaMask. This widens user options for easy integration on the platform. You can also sign up through a custom email and password and confirm details. After confirming your email, ZenLedger takes you to an onboarding screen where you input certain details before adding your wallets and exchanges. After filling in all information and user details, you can now proceed to user settings. Key Account Settings Like every crypto software and application, you’re advised to customize security controls and accounting settings. Navigate to ‘Settings’ at the upper right corner to access profile, tax, and security options. Under ‘Tax Settings’, you can choose country, base currency, the accounting method (FIFO, LIFO, etc) as well as other important requirements based on your location. After this, I would also recommend turning on security settings like two-factor authentication (2FA) to protect your account. Interface, dashboard, accessibility ZenLedger onboards a user-friendly interface with a sleek design, aimed at both beginners and expert traders. From the dashboard, users can easily toggle between wallets, transactions, the tax center, and settings. The Wallet Section displays integrated accounts and values, while navigating to the tax center will show total proceeds, capital gains, tax forms, etc. Importing wallets, exchange APIs, and more To import wallets and start analyzing tax data, you’ll need to navigate to the ‘Wallets’ page and select either ‘Add Wallet/Exchanges.’ You can choose from two main options: API connection or CSV file uploads. Next, you’d see a list of supported wallets and exchanges. These include popular platforms like Coinbase, ETH Wallet, Binance US, Kucoin, etc. Select the desired wallet, add the address, and import successfully. It should be noted that non-supported wallets can still be integrated by a custom CSV file upload. To use this method, you’ll have to download the transaction history from the exchange and upload it directly to the platform. After integration, ZenLedger syncs data, imports transactions, and scrutinizes for possible mistakes. Supported Platforms ZenLedger integrated most crypto exchanges, including; Coinbase Binance US Kucoin, Binance And top wallets like: ETH wallet BSC Wallet SOL wallet DASH Wallet Core Features & Integrations Quick Summary: ZenLegder hosts a number of features and integrations that make it a preferable choice for many users. From the easy onboarding process to its comprehensive tools and capabilities, it helps for seamless tax filing. Furthermore, integrations made with third-party applications enhance overall user experience while safety and compliance features improve trust. Crypto Portfolio Tracker This is a core feature for most digital asset tax solutions in the market. It gives you an overview of all crypto holdings from connected wallets and exchanges in real-time. It supports accurate accounting, and not necessarily trading decisions. ZenLedger’s engine pulls data according to the current market value, giving you a snapshot and minimalistic charts. Who it’s best for : Traders who want to keep tabs on their current holdings. Pros : A very useful tool for account reconciliation. Gives users an accurate overview across platforms. Done automatically to reduce manual efforts. Cons : Limited analytics since it is not built for trading. It is not optimized for mainstream investments. Unlimited Transactions and Numerous Integrations The tool allows you to connect multiple wallets and exchanges for better control. There are over 500 crypto exchanges and wallets, including decentralized finance options, so the vast range of integrations gives users a wide range. Also, as a ZenLedger user, you have access to unlimited transactions, although these options are for the Platinum Plan at a considerable cost. Traders can add supported wallets and exchanges in a few steps and get their tax support immediately. Meanwhile, unsupported wallets can be added by importing custom CSV files. Who it’s best for : Professional traders with large amounts of transactions on multiple exchanges and wallets. Pros : No limit on transactions allowing better achievements. More range since all wallets are supported. Helps reduce errors since everything is connected. Cons : Transactions might get bulky and overcrowded. Only available for the Platinum Plan. Tax Calculation/ Form Generation Needless to say, this is the crux of ZenLedger’s product offering. You can select the method of calculating the cost basis, and the platform takes over with its automated engine. It screens every single transaction in order to determine tax events, capital gains, and losses. Basically, it groups transactions into buys/sells, transfers between two or more crypto wallets, and income from DeFi activities like staking, etc. It then identifies the cost basis by taking into account the date and price of acquisition, accounting standards in the jurisdiction, and more. ZenLedger works with all of the most popular cost basis methods – FIFO, LIFO, and HIFO. Tax form generation also aligns because it provides standard reports by jurisdiction, keeping users compliant. These tax reports include IRS Form 8949, 1040 Schedule D, FBAR Report, etc. Who it’s best for : All traders because being tax compliant is important and at the top of each trader’s use cases. Pros : Automatic tax calculation saves time. Ability to handle very complex transactions. Wide range of downloadable crypto tax forms. Cons : Some details might be challenging for beginners. Missing transactions will produce wrong results. Tax Loss Harvesting Tax loss harvesting shows you which of your crypto holdings have lost value since the time of purchase, allowing you sell and claim losses in tax. In most jurisdictions, crypto doesn’t fall within the wash sale rule, meaning that you can basically sell an asset at a loss and then rebuy this asset immediately after. Essentially, you “realize” the loss on paper for tax purposes but you keep holding the asset in case it recovers. The goal is to constructively reduce tax liability by identifying these opportunities. ZenLedger accesses your crypto and NFT holdings in multiple steps, helping you make the right decision. First, it compares unrealized positions with cost basis and market value. With this, it can identify positions in losses and their tax impact. On your end, you’d see a list of all assets in unrealized gains or losses and the impact a sale will have on your portfolio. Who it’s best for : Small and active traders who want to maximize their tax positions Pros : Traders can know which crypto assets are in the red zone. Helps towards long-term planning. Automatic analysis of tax data Cons : There is often a limited analytical re-entry strategy. Potential sales are not automatic and need manual effort. Security Features ZenLedger prioritizes user account security through features designed to protect data. The software doesn’t hold funds or private keys of customers, ensuring connections use read-only API keys. ZenLedger has several security settings for users that help protect accounts, such as 2FA and session management. User data is encrypted, ensuring there’s no unwarranted third-party access. Furthermore, compliance with global standards is top-notch. It integrates good audit trailing that traces gains or losses to specific accounts. Who it’s best for : All traders who prioritize security and compliance with emerging global regulations. Pros : Non-custodial control reduces security risks. Designed to protect traders with large transaction data. Removes compliance issues faced by many crypto users. Cons : Compliance is more focused in the US than in other jurisdictions. Integrations Integrations ease up the entire workflow for crypto tax solutions. ZenLedger has multiple integrations, each performing a key function in the process. Basically, it connects encrypted data with external accounting tools to ensure compliance and good reporting. Key integrations include consumer tax software like TurboTax and TaxAct, which help streamline the workflow with fiat systems. A laudable fact about these is the security protocols involved to protect user data. Who it’s best for : Accountants and tax experts who need fiat-like compliance in digital assets. Pros : Reduced manual entry in workflow. Helps reduce the risk of accounting errors. Boost productivity and ensure tighter compliance. Cons : It might be complex for beginners. Some integrations are not available in the basic free version. Pricing Plans Quick Summary: ZenLedger offers three plan categories, ranging from free to standard paid and professional . You can check out our guide on free vs. paid crypto tax software to find out when each option makes most sense. Let’s have a closer look at whether ZenLedger offers a good bang for your buck. Free Plan Cost: $0 Includes: Up to 25 transactions, detailed audit reports, tax compliance standards, tax loss harvesting, TurboTax integration, etc. The free plan is mostly used by beginners and expert traders to test the platform. While it’s good for onboarding, it is usually limited in terms of features. Silver Plan Cost: $49/year Includes: Up to 100 transactions, all detailed and audit reports, including other factors in the free plan. The silver package is the first boost from the free plan, and it is perfect for smaller traders with a few yearly transactions. Gold Plan Cost: $199/year Includes: Up to 5,000 yearly transactions and all other benefits of the silver plan. This is the first plan to integrate DeFi/ staking and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It is usually ranked as the most popular plan for most users because it expands the number of transactions, giving access to intermediate traders. Platinum Plan Cost: $399/year Includes: Up to 15,000 transactions per year, DeFi compatibility, NFTs, etc. This plan further pushes up the number of transactions and includes other features in lower levels. Furthermore, it comes with an added customer support package. Premium Support Consultation Cost: $275/60-minute consultation This is the first option that the tax professional prepared plans and includes access to an expert. Tailored questions can be asked of the tax professional concerning your portfolio after booking the 60-minute consultation. Tax Pro Prepared Plan – Single Year Cost: $2,800/ year The tax pro plan allows you to audit/calculate all tax-related functions with a professional. This is mainly for large corporations and traders having so many complex transactions. Tax Pro Prepared Plan- Multi-Year This is another professionally prepared plan for the long-term and the highest within ZedLedger. It is considered best for institutions and traders with very large volumes. Performance, Reliability & Support Quick Summary: ZenLedger is usually regarded as a reliable cryptocurrency tax software because of features that are helpful to individual and enterprise traders, and in my use of it, this more or less checks out. The performance of all features for filing tax and audit portfolios is key to the overall platform. Customer service and support for traders, especially those in Tax Pro plans, have also bagged positive reviews. Performance ZenLedger can effectively manage large crypto portfolios, making it a good choice for investors. Wallets and exchanges are imported with ease, and users have a wide choice of integration without impacting performance. Tax summary and analysis are carried out on large data sets with losses calculated accurately without the risk of human error. However, this isn’t to say that the software works flawlessly. It does occasionally make mistakes, so I would highly recommend going through it manually to be on the safe side of things. Elsewhere, the tool works well, and it does get the job done where it matters most. Reliability According to multiple online reviews, including on Reddit, Trustpilot, and other third-party review platforms, ZenLedger is a reliable crypto tax software. In my experience, this seems to hold up. Although it does have its drawbacks compared to some of its main competitors, such as CoinLedger and Koinly, the platform offers almost everything a user would need to effectively handle their yearly taxes. Depending on your level of involvement in the industry, it might be a good idea to also consult a professional CPA, but if you’re a casual crypto user or someone who’s not involved in managing very high-profile portfolios or high-frequency trading, ZenLedger is more likely to get the job done well. Support The company offers a complete support system for users and the general public. Users can contact support for any issue and get adequate assistance. However, users of the Tax Pro plan have better access to support and dedicated tax professionals. This helps traders get a better analysis of their portfolio and file properly. ZenLedger Pros and Cons Pros: High-end tax consultation plans : ZenLedger offers plans that allow users to meet with tax professionals for better workflow. Standard Compliance : The platform is known for strict standard guidelines in the United States. Wider Integrations : ZenLedger has onboarded third-party accounting tools like TurboTax to aid the assessment of transactions and portfolios. End-to-end data encryption : Security protocols are standard, particularly end-to-end data encryption that ensures privacy. Friendly interface : The platform uses a straightforward and friendly interface to drive adoption. Cons: DeFi integration in higher plans : DeFi and NFT holdings can be onboarded but reserved for users with higher plans. Complex Features : Generally easy to understand, although some high-end features might be complex. Only United States tax forms can be downloaded. ZenLedger Alternatives & Comparison Before choosing a crypto tax software, you have to weigh your options by comparing features, pricing, and pros and cons of different platforms. It is also important to check for compliance across jurisdictions and the ease of integrating wallets. Alternatives to ZenLedger include CoinTracker, TaxBit, Koinly, CoinLedger, CryptoTrader, and more. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Is ZenLedger safe?

56539364,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=255702,1767002111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Price Plummets Below $89,000: Analyzing the Sudden Market Shift",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-falls-below-89000-4/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Plummets Below $89,000: Analyzing the Sudden Market Shift Global cryptocurrency markets experienced significant volatility on Tuesday, November 18, 2025, as Bitcoin’s price suddenly dropped below the crucial $89,000 threshold. According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC currently trades at $88,971.48 on the Binance USDT market, marking a notable decline from recent highs. This movement represents one of the most substantial single-day decreases observed in the fourth quarter of 2025, consequently prompting renewed analysis of market stability and investor sentiment. Bitcoin Price Movement Analysis Market analysts immediately began examining the factors behind Bitcoin’s sudden decline. The digital asset had maintained relative stability above $90,000 for approximately two weeks before this downward movement. Trading volume increased by 42% during the initial drop, according to aggregated exchange data. Several cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase and Kraken, reported similar price movements within minutes of the Binance data. Historical context provides valuable perspective for this price action. Bitcoin previously tested the $89,000 support level in early October 2025 before rallying to $94,500. Technical analysts note that the current price sits just above the 50-day moving average of $87,200. Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently measures 45, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. Market Structure and Trading Patterns Exchange order book data reveals significant sell pressure around the $89,500 resistance level. Market depth charts show approximately $85 million in sell orders between $89,000 and $89,500 across major exchanges. Conversely, buy support appears strongest at $87,000 with approximately $120 million in accumulated bids. This order book imbalance likely contributed to the rapid price decline through the $89,000 level. Bitcoin Price Levels and Market Support (November 2025) Price Level Support/Resistance Order Book Volume $91,000 Strong Resistance $110M Sell Orders $89,000 Previous Support $85M Sell Orders $87,000 Current Support $120M Buy Orders $85,000 Major Support $200M Buy Orders Cryptocurrency Market Context and Influences Several macroeconomic factors potentially influenced this Bitcoin price movement. The U.S. Federal Reserve recently indicated a more hawkish stance on interest rates during its November meeting. Additionally, traditional equity markets showed weakness in technology stocks, which often correlate with cryptocurrency performance. Regulatory developments in the European Union regarding digital asset taxation may have also contributed to market uncertainty. Institutional investment patterns provide further context for this market movement. According to weekly fund flow reports, Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) experienced net outflows of $240 million in the past seven days. This represents the first significant outflow since September 2025. Major institutional holders reportedly reduced exposure by approximately 1.2% across various investment vehicles. Market Liquidity: Overall cryptocurrency market capitalization decreased by 3.2% following Bitcoin’s decline Altcoin Correlation: Ethereum and other major altcoins declined by 4-6% in synchronized movement Derivatives Market: Bitcoin futures open interest decreased by 8% with increased put/call ratio Mining Economics: Bitcoin mining profitability metrics show 12% reduction at current price levels Expert Analysis and Market Sentiment Financial analysts from major institutions provided measured perspectives on this development. JPMorgan Chase cryptocurrency research noted that “Bitcoin’s volatility remains within historical norms despite the price decline.” Goldman Sachs digital assets division highlighted that “institutional adoption continues steadily despite short-term price movements.” Independent analysts observed that the fear and greed index moved from 65 (greed) to 48 (neutral) following the price drop. Technical analysis from TradingView community members indicates several potential scenarios. The most common prediction suggests consolidation between $87,000 and $91,000 before the next significant directional movement. Chart patterns show potential support at the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level of $86,400 from the recent rally. Volume profile analysis indicates value area between $87,500 and $89,500 based on recent trading activity. Historical Comparisons and Market Cycles Current Bitcoin price action shows similarities to previous market cycles. The 2021 bull market experienced multiple 15-20% corrections during its ascent to all-time highs. Historical data from Glassnode indicates that similar percentage declines occurred approximately every 47 days during the 2017 bull market. Current market structure differs significantly due to increased institutional participation and derivative market sophistication. Long-term holders continue demonstrating resilience despite short-term volatility. Blockchain data reveals that addresses holding Bitcoin for over one year control approximately 68% of circulating supply. This percentage has remained stable throughout 2025, suggesting conviction among long-term investors. Exchange reserves continue declining, with approximately 12% of supply moving to cold storage solutions this year. Regulatory Environment and Global Impact Global regulatory developments create important context for cryptocurrency market movements. The European Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework implementation continues progressing toward its 2026 deadline. Asian markets show divergent approaches, with Japan implementing supportive regulations while China maintains restrictions. United States regulatory clarity remains incomplete, though legislative progress continues in Congress. Central bank digital currency (CBDC) developments may influence Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Over 90 countries currently explore CBDC implementation according to IMF reports. These developments potentially affect Bitcoin’s value proposition as digital currency adoption increases globally. However, analysts generally view Bitcoin as complementary rather than competitive to CBDC systems. Conclusion Bitcoin’s decline below $89,000 represents a significant but not unprecedented market movement within the broader cryptocurrency landscape. The Bitcoin price currently demonstrates resilience above key technical support levels despite recent volatility. Market structure analysis suggests healthy correction rather than trend reversal based on available data. Continued monitoring of trading volume, institutional flows, and macroeconomic factors will provide clearer directional signals in coming sessions. Historical patterns indicate that similar corrections have preceded renewed upward movements in previous market cycles, though past performance never guarantees future results in volatile cryptocurrency markets. FAQs Q1: What caused Bitcoin to fall below $89,000? Multiple factors contributed including increased sell pressure around resistance levels, macroeconomic uncertainty regarding interest rates, synchronized weakness in technology stocks, and potential regulatory developments affecting market sentiment. Q2: How does this price movement compare to historical Bitcoin volatility? This decline represents approximately a 5-6% movement from recent highs, which falls within normal volatility parameters for Bitcoin. Historical data shows similar or larger corrections occurred regularly during previous bull markets. Q3: What are the key support levels to watch for Bitcoin? Technical analysis identifies $87,000 as immediate support with stronger support at $85,000. The 50-day moving average at $87,200 and Fibonacci retracement levels provide additional reference points for potential support zones. Q4: How are institutional investors responding to this price decline? Available data shows modest outflows from Bitcoin investment products but no panic selling. Long-term holders continue maintaining positions, with exchange reserves declining as Bitcoin moves to secure storage solutions. Q5: What indicators should traders monitor following this movement? Key metrics include trading volume patterns, exchange order book depth, derivatives market positioning, institutional flow data, and broader macroeconomic developments affecting risk assets globally.

56539516,https://timestabloid.com/?p=93566,1767002300,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Massive XRP Movement On Coinbase Stuns XRP Army,https://timestabloid.com/massive-xrp-movement-on-coinbase-stuns-xrp-army/,"A substantial XRP transaction recently recorded on the public ledger has been identified by analysts monitoring institutional activity. The transfer involved more than 7.8 million XRP, valued at approximately $14.3 million at the time of execution, and was processed through Coinbase custody infrastructure. Both the sending and receiving addresses were linked to Coinbase, indicating an internal movement rather than a retail transaction. The payment was successfully validated within a single ledger, with a minimal network fee consistent with standard XRP Ledger operations. Crypto analyst and investor Xaif Crypto highlighted the transaction as notable due to its alignment with how spot XRP exchange-traded funds are structured operationally. Most approved or proposed spot XRP ETFs rely on Coinbase as a primary custodian, meaning on-ledger transfers between Coinbase-controlled wallets often reflect ETF-related flows rather than speculative trading. MASSIVE $XRP MOVEMENT 7.8M+ XRP (~$14.3M) moved via Coinbase custody through an ETF transaction. Most spot XRP ETFs use Coinbase as custodian, so when you see these transfers on-ledger it often means institutional size accumulation happening inside the ETF rails. https://t.co/3hYgEC8qS7 pic.twitter.com/H3AUyLJC3m — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) December 26, 2025 ETF Custody Mechanics and Market Interpretation Within an ETF structure, assets are typically moved on-chain as part of creation and redemption processes. When authorized participants create ETF shares, the underlying asset is transferred into custody wallets. Conversely, redemptions can result in assets being moved out of those wallets. As a result, large on-ledger movements through recognized custodians are often associated with institutional positioning rather than short-term price action. The size and routing of this particular transfer align with that operational pattern. Xaif Crypto emphasized that such movements can represent institutional accumulation occurring within regulated investment structures. While these transactions do not immediately translate into open-market buying pressure, they can indicate sustained demand from funds designed to provide regulated exposure to XRP. Broader Market Reactions and Expectations The transaction also prompted commentary from other market participants, who offered interpretations tied to ETF dynamics and derivatives positioning. Some observers pointed to the role of hedging during ETF launches, noting that institutions often offset exposure through short positions in derivatives markets. According to this view, the expiration of those hedges in mid-January could coincide with shifts in market structure, potentially influencing price behavior. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Additional commentary stressed that retail participants frequently underestimate on-ledger activity related to ETF custodians. From this perspective, these transfers are a fundamental component of how regulated exposure is established and maintained, rather than incidental wallet movements. Context Within the Evolving XRP ETF Landscape As interest in spot XRP ETFs continues to develop, transparency provided by the XRP Ledger offers unique insight into institutional processes that are largely opaque in traditional markets. While a single transfer does not confirm a directional price outcome, it does reinforce the growing role of custodial infrastructure in facilitating regulated participation.

He doesn’t think two of the most talked-about tokens in cryptocurrency will be able to keep up with the industry’s growth. The CEO of Galaxy Digital stated on Friday that Cardano and XRP must demonstrat e th ey are more than just fan favorites. Doubts about staying power In an interview with Galaxy’s chief of research, Alex Thorn, Novogratz stated unequivocally: “Can Ripple hold it together? Is Cardano able to maintain composure? He clarified that the problem is that cryptocurrency is evolving. What was once based on excitement and hype is moving toward something more tangible. Tokens must now demonstrate actual worth rather than merel y being ar dent advocates. Both XRP and Cardano’s ADA have loyal followings. That’s never been in question. But when you look at what’s actually happening on their networks, the picture gets fuzzy. Strong communities but weak usage Take Cardano. Novogratz didn’t hold back: “Charles Hoskinson, bless his soul, he’s kept the Cardano community with a blockchain that people don’t really use a lot. He’s had a strong community just like XRP. Can you keep it together when there are more and more options?” His point is that the market’s getting smarter. Tokens that aren’t meant to be money, like Bitcoin, will be judged like regular businesses, by their revenue, usage, and real-world impact. Ripple built XRP to move money across borders fast and cheap through RippleNet. Banks and fintech companies use it. Sounds good on paper. But critics keep saying the same thing: there’s not enough actual activity to justify what it’s worth. The numbers tell the story The story is told by the numbers. With a market value of almost $115 billion, XRP is ranked fifth among all cryptocurrencies by CoinMarketCap. Cardano is approximately $13–14 billion, in the vicinity of the 12th. This is when things start to get interesting. At the time of publication, XRP has 16,703 active addresses, according to CryptoQuant data. Cardano tallied little more than 19,000. In contrast, Solana consistently reaches millions of active users because of DeFi apps, meme coins, and other initiatives. With a $72 billion market capitalization, Solana ranks eighth in the world. Hyperliquid and similar platforms are the way of the future, according to Novogratz. It is a trading exchange that makes real money and repurchases tokens from its gains. Traditional equity operates in this manner, and cryptocurrency may follow suit.

They tend to build quietly, while attention is still split and conviction remains uneven. Q1 2026 is starting to appear on the radar of many market observers, not because prices are exploding today, but because positioning is changing beneath the surface. When larger assets slow, cheaper cryptocurrencies with clear development paths often begin to stand out. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum remains the backbone of much of the crypto economy. Its market cap is massive, and its role in DeFi, NFTs, and infrastructure is well established. Early ETH holders benefited from dramatic growth when the network was still expanding rapidly. Today, the situation looks different. ETH has struggled to move decisively above the $3,000 resistance zone. Each push higher has faced selling pressure. Because of its size, Ethereum now needs very large inflows to deliver strong upside. Market commentators suggest that even in a bullish scenario, ETH’s price growth into 2026 may be limited to a modest multiple rather than explosive gains. For investors asking what is the potential best cryptocurrency to invest in, ETH often appears more defensive than aggressive. It remains important, but its growth curve has flattened compared to earlier cycles. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin is another well known crypto coin with a large market cap. Its early surge was driven by community energy and viral attention. During its peak phase, DOGE delivered outsized gains that few expected. That momentum has faded. DOGE continues to face strong resistance near $0.20. More importantly, its lack of protocol utility limits long-term demand. There is no built-in system that creates consistent usage or revenue flow. Price movement relies heavily on sentiment rather than fundamentals. Industry speculation points to a weaker outlook for DOGE going into 2026. Without new utility or structural changes, price predictions tend to remain conservative. For many investors focused on crypto investing with a longer horizon, DOGE now looks more like a legacy meme asset than a growth driver. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) While ETH and DOGE reflect mature stages of the market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a different profile. It is a new crypto built around decentralized lending and borrowing. Instead of relying on hype, the protocol is designed to generate usage through financial activity. The presale began in early 2025 and has steadily progressed. MUTM is currently priced around $0.035. Since phase 1, the token has increased roughly 250%. More than $19.45M has been raised, with about 18,650 holders participating. Phase 6 is now over 99% allocated, showing sustained demand rather than a short spike. According to statements shared on the official Mutuum Finance X account, V1 of the protocol is planned for the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. Core components include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator system. ETH and USDT are expected to be the first supported assets. Why MUTM’s Mechanics Matter What separates MUTM from many cheap cryptocurrencies is its structure. Users who supply assets receive mtTokens. These tokens represent their position and earn yield over time. Borrowers access liquidity under defined Loan to Value rules, which helps manage risk and protect the protocol. A key element is the buy-and-distribute mechanism. A portion of protocol fees is used to buy MUTM from the market and distribute it to mtToken holders. Some analysts believe this creates long-term buying pressure tied to real usage rather than attention cycles. Oracles also play an important role. Reliable price feeds help manage collateral values and liquidations. This reduces systemic risk and supports healthier lending markets. These features are still developing, but they point toward a protocol designed for sustained activity. In a bullish scenario, projections show that MUTM could see several multiples of growth if lending volume expands after launch. Some market commentators suggest a move above $0.06 after launch is possible, which would represent strong upside from current levels without extreme assumptions. Stablecoin and Layer 2 Plans Add Scale Another factor drawing interest is Mutuum Finance’s roadmap beyond V1. Stablecoin integration is planned, which can increase daily usage by offering lower volatility options for lenders and borrowers. Stablecoins often form the base layer of DeFi activity, especially during uncertain market periods. Layer 2 expansion is also part of the longer-term vision. Lower fees and faster transactions can broaden access and make smaller positions viable. For a DeFi crypto aiming to scale, this infrastructure matters. Security has not been ignored. Mutuum Finance has completed a CertiK token scan with a score of 90 out of 100. An independent audit by Halborn Security is in progress, and a $50k bug bounty is active. These steps help build confidence before full deployment. Why Q1 2026 Is on the Radar As ETH faces size limits and DOGE struggles with utility questions, MUTM sits at a point where development is advanced but full usage has not yet begun. Early investor sentiment indicates that this stage often attracts attention before broader market awareness sets in. For those tracking crypto prices today or following crypto news, the contrast is clear. Large caps offer stability. Cheap, utility-focused projects offer asymmetry. Mutuum Finance is increasingly mentioned among the best cheap crypto to watch as Q1 2026 approaches. Nothing is certain in crypto. But history shows that cycles often reward projects that combine timing, structure, and real use cases. That is why MUTM is finding its way into top crypto discussions alongside much larger names.

The focus is not on short-term price movement, but on a momentum indicator that is rarely seen at extreme levels on such a high timeframe. The Stochastic Relative Strength Index dropped to 0.00, a reading that has occurred only once before in XRP’s trading history. A Parallel With the 2022 Bear Market Low The only previous instance of this signal appeared at the 2022 bear market bottom. At that time, XRP was emerging from an extended period of selling pressure that reflected broader weakness across the digital asset market. Rather than triggering an immediate recovery, the signal marked the start of a prolonged accumulation phase. Price remained range-bound for an extended period before eventually transitioning into a stronger upward move. This $XRP chart is interesting for one reason. On the 3-week timeframe, the Stochastic RSI has dropped to 0.00. That’s extremely rare and has only happened once before — at the 2022 bear market bottom. On such a high timeframe, this indicator only reaches zero when… pic.twitter.com/cMvFL0eNi9 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 26, 2025 What a Zero Reading Means on a Three-Week Chart On a three-week timeframe, a Stochastic RSI reading of zero suggests that downside momentum has largely run its course. According to the analysis, this level is reached only when selling pressure becomes exhausted. It does not imply that price must reverse quickly, nor does it guarantee a near-term rally. Instead, it points to a slowdown in selling activity and a reduced likelihood of further sustained declines. Signs of Long-Term Absorption Steph Is Crypto interprets the current signal as evidence that long-term holders may be absorbing supply rather than distributing it. This behavior is typically seen near broader market lows, where speculative selling fades, and stronger hands begin to accumulate. From a structural perspective, this dynamic suggests that downside risk may be limited, even if the price continues to consolidate. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Cycle-Level Insight Rather Than Trade Timing The analyst emphasizes that this signal is intended to provide insight into market cycles, not short-term trade opportunities. Indicators on higher timeframes are designed to highlight long-term shifts in momentum rather than pinpoint exact entry or exit points. Historically, similar readings have aligned more closely with cycle lows than with short-lived market moves. A Setup That Favors Patience By comparing current conditions with those observed in 2022, the analysis frames the present setup as one that may require time to fully develop. While immediate price action may remain subdued, the return of this rare momentum signal suggests XRP could be entering another extended accumulation phase, laying the groundwork for a future move when broader market conditions turn more favorable.

This analysis provides a detailed, evidence-based examination of XRP price predictions for 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, and 2030, directly addressing the pivotal question: Will XRP reach $5? The assessment incorporates regulatory milestones, technological adoption metrics, and comparative market analysis to establish a framework for understanding XRP’s potential future valuation. XRP Price Prediction: Foundational Market Context and 2025 Baseline Any forward-looking analysis must first establish a clear present-day context. Consequently, the performance of XRP in 2025 serves as the critical baseline for all subsequent projections. Market sentiment for XRP remains uniquely tethered to the legal and regulatory landscape surrounding Ripple Labs. The resolution of the long-standing SEC lawsuit in 2023 provided significant clarity, removing a major overhang. However, the ongoing implementation of the court’s rulings and the establishment of clearer regulatory frameworks for digital assets continue to influence institutional adoption rates. Furthermore, the expansion of RippleNet and the On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution directly impacts XRP’s utility and transactional volume. Analysts from firms like CoinShares and Messari consistently highlight these utility metrics—specifically, cross-border payment volume and the number of active corridors—as more reliable indicators of long-term health than speculative trading activity alone. Expert Methodology for Long-Term Forecasting Reputable forecasting entities, including DigitalCoinPrice, WalletInvestor, and TechNewsLeader, employ complex models that extend beyond simple trend extrapolation. Their methodologies typically integrate several core variables: Adoption Rate: The growth of Ripple’s partnerships with financial institutions. Regulatory Clarity: Global developments in cryptocurrency legislation. Macroeconomic Factors: Interest rate environments and institutional capital flows. Technological Development: Upgrades to the XRP Ledger, such as the implementation of Hooks for smart contract functionality. Market Cycle Analysis: Historical patterns relative to Bitcoin halving events and broader market cycles. It is crucial to note that these predictions represent probabilistic models, not guarantees. They provide a spectrum of potential outcomes based on defined assumptions. Detailed Year-by-Year XRP Price Forecast: 2026 to 2030 The following table consolidates average annual price predictions from multiple analytical sources, presenting a consensus view while acknowledging a wide range of possibilities. These figures assume a scenario of continued regulatory normalization and steady, non-exponential adoption in the payments sector. Year Conservative Forecast (Low) Average Consensus Forecast Optimistic Forecast (High) Key Driver for That Period 2026 $0.95 $1.40 $2.10 Full integration of post-case legal precedents; expansion in APAC & MENA regions. 2027 $1.30 $1.90 $2.80 Potential for first major central bank digital currency (CBDC) partnerships using Ripple’s technology. 2028 $1.70 $2.50 $3.75 Broad institutional adoption as a bridge asset; next-generation ledger features gain traction. 2029 $2.20 $3.20 $4.50 Potential peak of a hypothesized market cycle; maturation of DeFi ecosystems on the XRPL. 2030 $2.80 $3.80 $5.50+ Mainstream acceptance of blockchain in global finance; XRP’s role as a liquidity tool is standardized. Transitioning from these yearly estimates, the central question emerges within the context of the 2030 forecast: is a $5 XRP valuation a realistic target? Will XRP Reach $5? Analyzing the Feasibility and Required Conditions The $5 price point represents more than a 10x increase from its early-2025 price, requiring a significant reassessment of XRP’s market capitalization and real-world utility. A $5 XRP price, given its current total supply of approximately 100 billion tokens (with roughly 55 billion in circulation), would imply a circulating market cap nearing $275 billion. For comparison, Ethereum’s market cap in early 2025 was approximately $400 billion. Therefore, reaching this valuation necessitates one or a combination of the following conditions: Massive Utility Adoption: The XRP token must become indispensable for settling a substantial portion of the multi-trillion-dollar cross-border payments industry. This requires hundreds of additional financial institution partnerships and a dramatic increase in ODL volume. Speculative Super-Cycle: A market-wide cryptocurrency bull run of unprecedented scale, potentially driven by global macroeconomic shifts like hyperinflation in major economies or a dramatic loss of faith in traditional reserve assets. Supply Shock Dynamics: A significant, permanent reduction in the available liquid supply of XRP, potentially through mechanisms like sustained escrow locks or large-scale token burns, though Ripple has historically not endorsed the latter. Paradigm-Shifting Use Case: The emergence of a revolutionary new application for the XRP Ledger that is not currently foreseen, capturing value from an entirely new sector beyond payments. Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence have suggested that while a $5 target is within the realm of possibility by 2030, it sits at the extreme upper bound of probabilistic models. It would likely require a “perfect storm” of favorable regulation, flawless technology execution, and a bullish macro environment for digital assets. Conversely, sustained regulatory setbacks in key markets or the failure to onboard major new banking partners could suppress prices well below these projections. The Critical Role of Regulatory Clarity and Competition Beyond internal development, external factors will play a decisive role. The regulatory stance of the United States, the European Union with its MiCA framework, and financial hubs like Singapore and the UAE will either enable or hinder the banking partnerships Ripple seeks. Simultaneously, competition is intensifying. Swift’s own blockchain experiments, the rise of other enterprise-focused blockchains like Quant, and the development of CBDCs present alternative paths for banks. XRP’s price trajectory will be, in many ways, a direct report card on its ability to out-execute these competitors in the marketplace. Conclusion In summary, XRP price predictions for the period from 2026 to 2030 paint a picture of gradual, utility-driven growth with the potential for significant appreciation during broader market upswings. The consensus analyst view suggests a path toward the $3-$4 range by 2030 under a scenario of steady adoption. While the ambitious target of XRP reaching $5 is mathematically possible, it resides in the optimistic forecast range and is contingent upon an exceptional alignment of technological success, regulatory harmony, and macroeconomic tailwinds. Investors and observers should therefore focus less on a single price target and more on the fundamental indicators: quarterly ODL volume growth, the expansion of RippleNet, and tangible progress in regulatory dialogues across major economies. These metrics will provide the most reliable signals for XRP’s long-term valuation journey. FAQs Q1: What is the most important factor influencing XRP’s price by 2030? The single most critical factor is the scale of real-world adoption for cross-border settlements. Price will follow utility; therefore, the growth of Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) volume and network of financial institution partners is the primary fundamental driver. Q2: How does the circulating supply of XRP affect its price potential? XRP has a fixed maximum supply of 100 billion tokens. Ripple holds a significant portion in escrow, releasing them gradually. This managed supply schedule is designed to prevent market flooding. A $5 price implies a very high market capitalization, requiring massive demand to absorb the circulating and escrow-released supply. Q3: Are these predictions guaranteed? No. All cryptocurrency price predictions are speculative models based on current data and assumptions. They are not financial advice. Market conditions, regulatory changes, technological disruptions, and broader economic factors can drastically alter actual outcomes. Q4: What is a realistic average annual return for XRP based on these forecasts? Based on the consensus average forecasts moving from a 2025 baseline near $0.55 to ~$3.80 by 2030, this represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 30-35%. This is a high-return, high-risk projection typical of the volatile crypto asset class. Q5: How do expert predictions for XRP differ from those for Bitcoin or Ethereum? XRP predictions are more tightly coupled to enterprise adoption and regulatory developments specific to payments and securities law. Bitcoin forecasts often hinge on macro store-of-value narratives and institutional investment, while Ethereum predictions focus on its platform utility and fee economics. The drivers and risk profiles are distinct.

The appointment puts Alt5 Sigma under sharper scrutiny as the company remains late on required financial filings and faces the risk of being removed from Nasdaq in 2025, the year Donald Trump is serving as president of the United States. Alt5 Sigma, which is based in Las Vegas, has moved through several business identities before landing in crypto. The company began as an appliance recycling operation, later shifted into biotech, and now describes itself as a fintech focused on crypto infrastructure. In August, it signed an agreement to buy crypto tokens issued by the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial. Eric Trump joined the company at that time as a board observer. Alt5’s financial position grew unclear after the August deal when quarterly results were not filed on schedule, and management turnover followed. Then the auditor was replaced, and boom, Alt5 promoted a treasury strategy centered on holding World Liberty Financial’s $WLFI token. Alt5’s audit company licensing lapse follows regulatory penalties On December 8, Alt5 Sigma appointed Victor Mokuolu CPA PLLC as its new auditor. State filings in Texas show the company’s license expired in August. Under Texas rules, an audit company without an active license cannot perform audit work. As of December 26, the firm’s license had not been renewed. Victor Mokuolu, the founder of the company, renewed his personal certified public accountant license on August 31. His license remained inactive at the end of December based on state board records. Alt5 Sigma addressed the situation in a statement to the Financial Times. The company said its auditor was “undergoing a peer review per Texas State Board of Accountancy regulations and will be completed by the end of January 2026, at which point the auditor expects the license to be active.” Alt5 added, “No reviews or audits of Alt5’s financial statements will be issued by our auditor until the firm’s licence is active.” Victor previously worked as an accountant in the oil and gas sector before launching his company in 2020. A recent regulatory filing lists about 30 small‑cap public companies as audit clients of the company. The company has been trying to fix deficiencies for more than two years after receiving a failing grade in the accounting profession’s peer review process in 2023. Regulators have already taken action against Alt5. In 2023, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board fined the company $30,000 for failing to notify the regulator about six public company audits within the required 35‑day period. The Texas State Board of Public Accountancy imposed an additional $15,000 penalty for the same violations after repeated late filings. Management exits and filing delays deepen company turmoil The auditor change came during a period of disruption inside Alt5 Sigma. The company now refers to itself as “a fintech with a pioneering $WLFI digital asset treasury strategy.” The August deal committed the company to buying and holding large amounts of World Liberty Financial’s $WLFI token, while the Trump‑backed venture became an investor in the company. As of December 8, Alt5 Sigma held roughly 7.3 billion $WLFI tokens. The holdings were valued at about $1.1 billion at that time. Leadership changes followed quickly. Jonathan Hugh, who joined as chief financial officer when the Trump deal was announced, left after three months. The company also parted ways with chief executive Peter Tassiopoulos in October. Board member David Danziger resigned last month, leaving the company in violation of Nasdaq rules that require an audit committee with a minimum size and accounting expertise. The company is now at risk of being delisted from Nasdaq after failing to file quarterly results for the period ending in late September. Alt5 Sigma blamed the delay in part on the “timeliness and responsiveness” of its former auditor, which formally resigned in November. Alt5 Sigma was incorporated in July 2024 by JanOne Inc, a biotech company that previously focused on developing treatments related to the opioid epidemic. JanOne merged with Alt5 Sigma and adopted its name in the same month. JanOne had already rebranded once before. In September 2019, it changed its name from Appliance Recycling Centers of America. The company says it provides financial infrastructure that allows traditional financial institutions to connect with crypto markets. Since the August deal, the chair of Alt5 Sigma has been Zack Witkoff. Zack is a co‑founder of World Liberty Financial and the son of Steve Witkoff, Donald Trump’s special envoy for peace negotiations. In August, Alt5 Sigma disclosed to US regulators that its Canadian subsidiary and a former principal were found criminally liable by a Rwandan court in May for offences including illicit enrichment and money laundering. Alt5 Sigma Canada and Andre Beauchesne appealed the ruling to the High Court of Kigali in June. The case remains under judicial review. Both the company unit and Andre denied wrongdoing and said they were victims of fraud.

Indeed, experts have offered mixed views, with some suggesting the asset is likely to surpass a record high above $150,000. This comes as Bitcoin appears set to end the year below the crucial $100,000 level. Bitcoin YTD price chart. Source: Finbold As of press time, the maiden cryptocurrency was trading at $87,815, up about 0.1% over the past 24 hours but down more than 6% year-to-date. Below are some notable price projections for the year ahead. JPMorgan JPMorgan , one of Wall Street’s major players in cryptocurrency analysis, has forecast Bitcoin reaching $170,000 by 2026, positioning it as a serious contender to gold’s market dominance. Analysts at the bank suggest this target could materialize if Bitcoin continues to trade like “digital gold,” with institutional inflows increasingly challenging gold’s market capitalization. They also identify a near-term bottom around $94,000, from which a recovery could build momentum into the next year. This moderately bullish stance reflects JPMorgan’s view that regulatory clarity and reduced volatility could support sustained growth, though risks such as economic slowdowns remain. Tim Draper Venture capitalist Tim Draper, a long-time Bitcoin advocate, remains one of the most optimistic voices, predicting Bitcoin will exceed $250,000 by October 2026. Draper attributes this outlook to Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against dollar debasement and its technological advantages over traditional currencies. He has reiterated similar targets in recent interviews, emphasizing broader adoption in retail payments and financial services, which he believes could make Bitcoin more impactful than the internet. While some of his past forecasts, including a $250,000 target by 2022, failed to materialize on schedule, Draper continues to stress Bitcoin’s long-term upside against fiat currencies, driven by scarcity and global economic shifts. Benjamin Cowen In contrast to the bulls, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen offers a more cautious outlook for 2026, predicting a potential market reset following a possible peak in late 2025. Cowen suggests Bitcoin could rise to the $100,000–$110,000 range before capitulating in the fourth quarter of 2026, entering a downturn similar to past cycles. His analysis draws parallels to 2019 market conditions, warning that excessive optimism could trigger a sharp correction, with downside scenarios reaching as low as $25,000 in extreme cases. Cowen extends this caution to altcoins such as Ethereum ( ETH ), arguing that new all-time highs in 2026 are unlikely due to Bitcoin’s dominance and broader market fatigue. His outlook emphasizes cycle patterns and macroeconomic factors, urging investors to prepare for volatility rather than perpetual upside. Standard Chartered Standard Chartered halved its forecast , now expecting Bitcoin to reach $150,000 by the end of 2026, down from a previous $300,000 projection. The bank’s Global Head of Digital Assets Research, Geoffrey Kendrick, cited slower corporate treasury buying and increased reliance on spot ETF inflows as reasons for the downgrade, describing the current pullback as a “cold breeze” rather than a full winter. Despite the cut, Kendrick remains positive over the longer term, projecting that Bitcoin could reach $500,000 by 2030, driven by supply constraints and portfolio reallocations away from traditional assets such as gold . This revision aligns with a broader softening of 2026 forecasts across several institutions.

The madness started after Bloomberg reported that SoftBank is in serious talks to buy the New York-listed data center company. Barely two hours later, the stock was still sitting 40.5% higher, while its total year-to-date gain hit 23%, according to data from Google Finance. SoftBank allegedly wants DigitalBridge locked in as part of a bigger plan to grab more AI-related infrastructure, and it’s moving fast. Bloomberg’s unnamed sources (yep, the usual crew with “knowledge of the situation”) say the talks are advanced, and a deal could be announced literally today before the bell. SoftBank’s AI strategy pushes it toward alleged DigitalBridge buyout As Cryptopolitan has been reporting all year, SoftBank’s billionaire founder, Masayoshi Son , has been laser-focused on one thing: AI. And AI needs serious computing power, which means serious infrastructure, a.k.a exactly what DigitalBridge brings to the table. The company is run by Marc Ganzi, and it had about $108 billion in assets under management as of late September, with a portfolio stuffed with operators like AIMS, AtlasEdge, DataBank, Switch, Vantage Data Centers, and Yondr Group, among others. If this deal goes through, it’ll be another notch on SoftBank’s M&A belt. Back in 2017, it dropped more than $3 billion to acquire Fortress Investment Group. But that didn’t last forever, as SoftBank later sold its Fortress stake to a group that included Mubadala Investment Co., a sovereign fund from Abu Dhabi, and Fortress’s own management. That exit was wrapped up in 2024. Slow Stargate rollout drives Son to reshuffle AI investments In January, SoftBank teamed up with OpenAI , Oracle, and Abu Dhabi’s MGX to launch a massive $500 billion project called Stargate. The goal is to build a network of AI data centers across the U.S. Masa even promised to throw in $100 billion right away. But like everything involving that much cash, things didn’t go exactly as planned. Bloomberg said in May that SoftBank tried to raise outside financing from insurance firms, pension funds, and investment houses. But investor appetite dropped thanks to market volatility, trade policy uncertainty, and shaky confidence in AI hardware valuations. Those hiccups caused some of the Stargate planning to slow down, especially around where to actually build the centers. By September, the group had finally named five sites (in Texas, New Mexico, and Ohio) that would eventually host about 7 gigawatts of computing power, which is about as much electricity as a small city uses. To fund all this AI obsession, Masa had to sell off other holdings. Earlier this month, he admitted he “was crying” over having to dump his $5.8 billion Nvidia stake just to free up the money. That sell-off was part of his bigger push to go all-in on AI infrastructure.

Both technical structure and on-chain behavior point toward a phase of digestion as the market assesses whether current levels will attract sustained demand. Bitcoin Price Analysis: The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, BTC remains below the major resistance zone around the $95K area, which continues to cap upside attempts. The cryptocurrency is trading within a broader corrective structure after failing to sustain above the prior high-value area. The recent candles show reduced volatility and overlapping ranges, signaling indecision rather than aggressive selling. Importantly, downside momentum has slowed as price approaches the upper end of the multi-month descending channel at $90K and is poised to break above it. Despite this stabilization, the daily structure has not yet shifted bullish. BTC is still trading below key dynamic resistance levels and has not convincingly reclaimed the $90K resistance. As long as the price remains below the $95K region, the daily bias favors consolidation within the current range rather than a trend reversal. A sustained move above resistance would be required to confirm renewed upside momentum, while a failure to hold current levels could reopen the path toward deeper demand. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart highlights the most recent developments more clearly. Bitcoin is consolidating tightly within a short-term range after a prolonged selloff, forming a base between rising local support and overhead resistance. The most recent price action shows multiple attempts to push higher, but these have lacked follow-through, indicating that supply remains active on rallies. At the same time, downside attempts are being absorbed near the lower boundary of the range, suggesting that sellers are losing momentum. This balance between buyers and sellers reflects a classic compression phase, where liquidity is building on both sides. Until a clear breakout above the $95K range occurs, the market is likely to remain range-bound, with short-term moves driven by liquidity grabs rather than directional conviction. For the short-term, a clean break above the short-term resistance at $90K would improve the intraday outlook, while a rejection would likely accelerate a move toward the $82K region. Source: TradingView Sentiment Analysis The spot average order size data provides important insight into participant behavior during this consolidation phase. Recent activity shows a noticeable presence of green dots, representing whale-sized spot orders, clustering around the current price range. This shift contrasts with earlier phases of the correction, where retail-sized orders were more dominant and larger players were largely absent. The re-emergence of whale activity during consolidation suggests that larger participants are becoming more involved at these levels, potentially signaling early accumulation rather than distribution. Unlike retail-driven rallies, spot whale participation typically reflects longer-term positioning, especially when it appears during low-volatility, range-bound conditions. This behavior implies that downside risk may be gradually decreasing as stronger hands absorb supply. While this does not guarantee an immediate bullish reversal, the on-chain structure supports the idea that Bitcoin is transitioning from aggressive selling into a stabilization phase. If whale participation continues to increase while price holds above key demand zones, the probability of a more constructive price structure emerging in the coming sessions would rise.

Strategy Inc. MSTR 1 Hour Chart. Source: TradingView The TradingView view showed a choppy December tape, with a peak near the upper $190s earlier in the month and a sharp selloff that pushed price into the low $160s. After that drop, price moved sideways, which signals that sellers lost momentum, while buyers still have not forced a clean recovery back into the prior range. If Bitcoin holds firm and pushes higher, MSTR often shows amplified moves because the stock links to Bitcoin exposure plus leverage from corporate financing and investor positioning. In that setup, a break above the recent consolidation band could open room for a retest of prior swing levels from earlier in December. However, if Bitcoin weakens again, the same linkage can pull MSTR back toward the recent lows, because traders typically compress the premium when risk appetite fades. Claims about a large gap between market cap and BTC NAV, analyst targets, and dilution buffers can drive short bursts of demand, yet price usually confirms the story, not the other way around. As a result, the next directional signal likely comes from whether MSTR can reclaim the post selloff resistance zone from mid month, while Bitcoin’s trend decides whether that leverage works for or against the stock.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-29 11:16:30

The proposal would replace the current progressive tax model, which can push effective rates above 50%, with a separate taxation framework closer to how stocks are taxed. The change remains at the proposal stage and still requires legal amendments and approval by the National Diet. However, policy language tied to financial reform packages shows the government is aligning crypto taxation with traditional financial products rather than treating it as miscellaneous income. Officials have linked the tax shift to broader efforts to modernize Japan’s digital asse t market and strengthen oversight through clearer classification and registration rules. Scope Limited to Registered Crypto Assets The proposed 20% rate would not apply universally across all cryptocurrencies. Instead, it targets assets that qualify as “Specified Crypto Assets” and are handled through registered crypto asset trading businesses. This distinction ties tax benefits directly to regulated market activity. Under current drafts, eligible assets would need to be recorded within official registries connected to licensed Financial Instruments Business Operators. As a result, unregistered tokens or peer to peer transactions could remain outside the new tax framework. This structure suggests the government aims to channel activity toward compliant platforms while narrowing the tax advantage to assets that meet transparency and reporting standards. Shift Away From Miscellaneous Income Treatment Japan currently classifies crypto gains as miscellaneous income, exposing investors to steep marginal tax rates depending on earnings. The reform proposal would move qualifying crypto gains into a separate tax category, similar to equities and other financial instruments. In practice, this would also open the door to standardized loss treatment. Draft summaries reference multi year loss carryforward provisions, which would allow investors to offset future gains, a feature currently unavailable under the existing crypto tax regime. The effective rate is expected to sit near 20%, with some references noting a figure slightly above that once standard tax components are included, mirroring securities taxation. The tax proposal runs alongside a broader regulatory effort led by the Financial Services Agency to reclassify crypto assets within Japan’s financial law framework. That process includes discussions around market conduct rules similar to insider trading restrictions used in equity markets. If approved, the reform would mark one of the most significant shifts in Japan’s crypto policy since the country introduced strict exchange licensing rules after earlier market scandals.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-29 11:18:18

This substantial deposit, occurring in the early hours of the morning, immediately captured the attention of market analysts and blockchain observers worldwide. Consequently, the move has sparked widespread discussion about potential strategic shifts within the digital asset landscape. The transaction highlights the increasingly visible role of major financial firms in shaping cryptocurrency market liquidity and sentiment. Analyzing the Galaxy Digital USDT Deposit to Binance The reported transaction involved the transfer of exactly 10,000,000 Tether (USDT) from a specific blockchain address. Blockchain analytics firms, including The Data Nerd, have linked this address to Galaxy Digital’s operational treasury or trading desks through historical patterns and clustering analysis. Furthermore, the destination was a known Binance deposit wallet, a common endpoint for assets entering the exchange’s liquidity pool. This deposit follows a period of relative stability for the stablecoin market, making the timing particularly noteworthy for several key reasons. Firstly, the sheer size of the deposit represents a meaningful capital allocation. Secondly, the choice of USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin by market capitalization, underscores its role as the primary settlement and trading pair asset. Thirdly, the move to Binance, a global exchange with deep liquidity, suggests a preparation for immediate market activity. Market data shows that large, traceable deposits from known entities often precede significant trading volumes, whether for accumulation, hedging, or providing market-making liquidity. Transaction Metric Detail Asset Tether (USDT) Amount 10,000,000 Reported Source Wallet linked to Galaxy Digital Destination Binance Exchange Key Implication Preparation for liquidity deployment Institutional Moves and Crypto Market Context Galaxy Digital, founded by investor Mike Novogratz, operates as a full-service financial platform dedicated to the digital asset ecosystem. The firm engages in trading, asset management, investment banking, and mining services. Therefore, its on-chain activity is closely monitored as a barometer for institutional sentiment and strategy. A deposit of this nature does not occur in a vacuum; it exists within a broader market context defined by several critical factors. Macroeconomic Conditions: Institutional players often adjust crypto strategies based on interest rate expectations and traditional market volatility. Regulatory Developments: Evolving global regulations impact how firms like Galaxy Digital manage and deploy capital. Exchange Dynamics: Binance’s position as a liquidity hub makes it a preferred venue for large-scale entry and exit. Stablecoin Utility: USDT serves as the primary on-ramp and off-ramp for many institutional trading desks. Historically, similar large stablecoin inflows to exchanges have correlated with increased buying pressure for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, they can also signal preparations for short-selling or complex derivatives strategies. The neutral, factual interpretation is that capital is being positioned for imminent use, reflecting an active view on near-term market opportunities or risks. Expert Analysis of Treasury Management Signals From a treasury management perspective, moving $10 million in stablecoins is a routine operational activity for a firm of Galaxy Digital’s scale. Nonetheless, blockchain transparency turns this routine into a public data point. Experts in on-chain analytics emphasize that single transactions require cautious interpretation. A holistic view considers the firm’s total wallet activity, withdrawal patterns from exchanges, and net flow trends over weeks or months. For instance, if this deposit is followed by sustained withdrawals of Bitcoin from Binance to cold storage, it could indicate a swap from stablecoins into a long-term Bitcoin position. Conversely, if the USDT remains on the exchange or is used to open perpetual swap positions, it suggests a different trading tactic. The firm itself has not commented on the specific transaction, which is standard practice to protect proprietary strategy. This adherence to operational secrecy is a hallmark of professional asset managers. The Technical and Strategic Implications of the Transfer On a technical level, the transaction demonstrates the seamless movement of high-value assets on public blockchains. The Ethereum network, which hosts most USDT, settled this transfer in minutes for a negligible fee. This efficiency underpins the modern institutional crypto infrastructure. Strategically, the move aligns with observed behaviors where firms increase exchange balances ahead of anticipated volatility or major market events. Potential strategic objectives behind such a deposit include: Market Making: Providing buy and sell liquidity for clients or proprietary books. Asset Acquisition: Preparing to purchase other cryptocurrencies at perceived favorable prices. Collateral Posting: Securing positions in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols or for exchange-based margin trading. Client Facilitation: Executing large OTC (over-the-counter) trades that require immediate settlement on an exchange. Each objective carries different implications for market direction. Without subsequent on-chain evidence, however, determining the exact intent remains speculative. The definitive takeaway is one of activity and preparedness from a leading institutional participant. Conclusion The deposit of 10 million USDT to Binance from a wallet linked to Galaxy Digital represents a clear signal of institutional engagement within the cryptocurrency markets. This transaction underscores the mature infrastructure now supporting digital asset transfers and the critical role of stablecoins like USDT in facilitating liquidity. While the specific intent behind the Galaxy Digital deposit remains part of the firm’s confidential strategy, the move highlights proactive capital deployment. Ultimately, such visible actions by established financial services firms continue to validate the operational scale and sophistication of the digital asset industry, providing tangible data points for market analysts and observers worldwide. FAQs Q1: What does a large USDT deposit to an exchange typically mean? Typically, it signals that an entity is preparing capital for immediate use on the exchange, such as trading, providing liquidity, or posting collateral. It moves funds from a private wallet into the exchange’s controlled liquidity pool. Q2: How do analysts link a wallet to a company like Galaxy Digital? Analysts use blockchain clustering techniques, tracing historical transactions from known addresses (like public exchange deposits from the company), analyzing patterns, and sometimes using tagged data from analytics platforms to establish probable ownership. Q3: Could this transaction be for something other than buying Bitcoin or Ethereum? Absolutely. While purchasing major assets is one possibility, the funds could also be used for market making, trading altcoins, securing derivatives positions, or facilitating OTC trades for clients. Q4: Does Galaxy Digital commenting on this transaction? As of standard operational practice, Galaxy Digital has not publicly commented on this specific transaction. Major financial firms rarely disclose the intent behind individual treasury movements to protect their strategic edge. Q5: How significant is a $10 million transfer for a firm like Galaxy Digital? While a notable public data point, $10 million is a routine operational scale for a multi-billion dollar asset manager. It reflects active treasury management rather than an all-in directional bet on the market.

In fact, it has been rejected at least six times since December 16. In the previous business week alone, it tried twice but to no avail. Last Monday, it jumped to $90,500 when the bears stepped up and drove it south by four grand in the next couple of days. Another failed attempt took place on Friday, but this time BTC couldn’t even reach $90,000. What followed were a few days of sideways trading, in which bitcoin remained between $87,000 and $88,000. The bulls went back on the offensive earlier today, driving the cryptocurrency to another weekly high of $90,400. The scenario repeated once again, though. The dead-cat bounce scenario, which many feared, drove bitcoin back down to under $88,000 as of press time.

They strategise earlier, where infrastructure is nearby but focus is yet to come. Such a trend is beginning to emerge with one new DeFi crypto. The action is accumulating in silence and time seems to be the key to the success of the project, rather than bang as it nears its next large milestone. The Financing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Building Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating a decentralized lending and borrowing platform to be used as opposed to being traded in the short run. The system enables individuals to deposit their assets into lending pools and make a profit, whereas borrowers get access to liquidity by pledging assets under transparent standards. On the supply side, users are issued with mtTokens. State such tokens are the value within the protocol and improve on value as interest is paid. Suppose that a user deposits assets valued at $2,000, he or she will have given out a winning amount of the mtTokens that will increase with the growth in the borrowing demand. This forms a causal relationship between the use of protocol and yield. The Mutuum Finance imposes specified borrower-loan value ratios and automated foreclosures on the borrowing side. These mechanics enable to maintain the system in equilibrium and secure providers of liquidity. Interest rates also change depending on getting it used where high liquidity leads to borrowing and repayments leading to high liquidity. V1 will be deployed into the Sepolia testnet before Q4 2025. It will also initially support ETH and USDT, and will have core features such as liquidity pools, debt tokens, mtTokens, and an automatic liquidator bot, as well as an ongoing security focus being reviewed by Halborn Security. The Reason Capital Is Accumulating Early So far, Mutuum Finance had attracted approximately $19.45M, and over 18,650 investors joined the project already. These figures are important as they are an indication of constant involvement and not an impromptu outburst. The growth has been slow and this is one of the signals that positioning is long term rather than short term rotation. The start price of the first stage was $0.01. MUTM is currently selling at $0.035 with a 250% increase thus far. Such a price movement has not been in terms of one jump but has been made in stages. To a number of observers, such a course of action implies demand for construction and development. Supply and Distribution The total supply of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is 4B. Of this sum 45.5% is to be distributed early, amounting to about 1.82B tokens. So far it has sold approximately 825M tokens. With allocation, the supply becomes limited. This transformation usually changes behavior. Participants will ensure that they secure their positions before the future, rather than after it, particularly when the future milestones are apparent. The card payments are also possible with mutuum finance, making it easier to become a new customer and expanding the base of individuals who can participate in it to crypto-native users. The project has a 24-hour leaderboard where the most active member of the day is given $500 in MUTM. This system promotes recurring use and activity that can be a premature sign of attachment as opposed to an accidental interest. Security and Infrastructure Indicators One of the most common causes of increased capital is security reviews. On a CertiK token scan, Mutuum Finance has scored 90/100, which means that its initial security position is strong.. There is also a bug bounty program of $50k that encourages outside developers to test the code. In the case of lending protocols, such layers are required, because they interact directly with pooled capital and collateralized positions. In the future, Mutuum Finance will launch an overcollateralized stablecoin that tracks the interest of borrowers, according to the official roadmap. Stable assets are likely to boost daily activity, thereby boosting the lending needs and liquidity level. The protocol is also structured on strong oracle infrastructure in order to have correct pricing which is most essential in liquidations and risk management. Why Timing Is Tightening Phase 6 currently sells quickly. A whale allocation was recently made of $100k, which made the news, not due to its size, but due to the fact that it came as supply tightened and V1 became more proximate. Large entries at this point may be the indication of such confidence in the execution as opposed to speculation. With V1 coming closer, infrastructure, security and participation are coming together. Mutuum Finance is positioned in a thin range to those who follow the potential best crypto, new crypto, or DeFi crypto projects before 2026. Supply is becoming less, growth is almost within reach and capital placement seems to be speeding up even to a without wider exposure.

Galaxy Digital head of research Alex Thorn said BTC is down 6.3% year-to-date and 8.25% year-over-year, and would need a daily close above $93,389 on New Year’s Eve to finish 2025 positive. The late-year mood has been defined by a soft Q4 tape and a deeper drawdown than many bulls expected this late in the cycle. Thorn noted BTC traded as low as roughly 36% below its Oct. 6, 2025 all-time high of $125,296, even as a steady stream of bullish headlines landed throughout the year. “Despite the tepid finish, 2025 was a banner year for Bitcoin. Even Bitcoin’s staunchest supporters wouldn’t have believed some of 2025’s headlines just a few years ago… 2025 has been filled with dozens of positive headlines for Bitcoin that in the past would have sparked euphoria. Today, these victories feel like par for the course. Maybe we really are ‘tired of winning?’” Thorn wrote in Galaxy’s weekly research note. Bitcoin On Verge Of Red Yearly Candle Thorn argued that part of the market’s stalled feel is mechanical, not philosophical. He pointed to a large month-end options expiry as a potential catalyst for loosening the range-bound behavior he described between the mid-$80,000s and $90,000. Related Reading: Why $100,000 Is Bitcoin’s Most Important Resistance Level “A significant options expiry at the end of the month clear some of the outstanding dealer gamma that has encouraged bitcoin to stay pinned between major $85k and $90k, and January may prompt some portfolio managers to take a fresh look at the world’s oldest cryptocurrency. There are reasons why the quiet period we’ve seen for the last month will not persist in the near term.” He also cited headwinds that hit spot demand and risk appetite: “significant whale distribution,” an Oct. 10 leverage wipeout, and competition from other macro trades such as AI, hyperscalers, gold, and the “Mag 7.” One of Thorn’s key observations was the divergence between bitcoin’s drawdown and US bitcoin ETF behavior. He said US bitcoin ETF cumulative inflows are down only 9% from their October peak of $62 billion, even though bitcoin fell sharply from its highs and, in his estimate, 60% of ETF inflows are underwater at current prices. That resilience, he argued, makes the source of selling more notable. “So, who has been selling?” Thorn wrote. “The call is coming from inside the house.” Since July 2025, he said coins held by long-term holders have declined more sharply than at any point in the eight years since the 2017 bull run, suggesting older on-chain holders have been net sellers into newer brokerage-led demand. Thorn framed that distribution as painful in the short run but constructive for the asset’s long-run maturity, lifting the average cost basis and broadening ownership. He highlighted bitcoin’s realized market cap above $1.1 trillion and a realized price above $56,000 as evidence of the network’s rising aggregate principal. Related Reading: Bitcoin Extreme Fear Streak Extends To 13 Days On Christmas In a Dec. 21 post summarizing Galaxy’s 2026 outlook, Thorn said Galaxy predicts bitcoin to hit $250,000 by year-end 2027, while calling 2026 “too chaotic to predict.” Options markets, he noted, are currently pricing roughly equal odds of $70,000 or $130,000 by end-June 2026, and $50,000 or $250,000 by year-end 2026, reflecting unusually wide uncertainty bands. He also pointed to a structural decline in longer-term volatility and a changed skew: the BTC vol smile now prices puts as more expensive than calls, which he described as a shift toward patterns more typical of macro assets than high-growth markets. Looking into 2026, Thorn’s near-term marker is whether BTC can “firmly re-establish” itself above $100,000–$105,000. Over the longer run, he argued the bigger story is demand for non-dollar hedges—and how little incremental allocation might be needed to move the market. “We believe it is likely only a matter of time before ‘Bitcoin follows gold to become widely adopted as a monetary debasement hedge.’ It doesn’t take much to start a stampede in that direction – a few major allocators, central banks, or nation states might be all it takes to spark the fuse and light a fire.” At press time, BTC traded at $87,748.

Throughout the year, state-backed cyber groups were responsible for 76% of service-level compromises across exchanges and custodians, successfully stealing at least $2.02 billion worth of crypto assets. The 2025 numbers marked a 51% year-on-year increase, despite a nearly 74% decrease in the total number of confirmed incidents, highlighting a strategic shift toward fewer but significantly larger incidents. Interestingly, just three incidents alone were responsible for 69% of total service-level losses, which goes to show that notorious hacking outfits like the Lazarus Group and the affiliated UNC5342 are now focused almost entirely on breaching large infrastructure targets that promise bigger and faster payouts. For the crypto industry, this translates to significantly larger financial losses that can potentially disrupt entire ecosystems and wipe out the funds of vast numbers of investors across the globe. One of the biggest incidents of the year involving North Korean groups was the $1.5 billion Bybit hack that shook the industry back in late February. Over 400,000 ETH was stolen in the breach, leading to the largest digital asset heist in the history of the crypto industry. Several other incidents followed, including the $223 million theft from the decentralized exchange Cetus , and a $128 million exploit targeting the Ethereum-based protocol Balancer. Additional confirmed breaches at WOO X, Seedify, and LND.fi only added to the staggering figures that made 2025 the most successful year to date for North Korean hackers. Over the past several months, North Korean actors have been found to be using a variety of attack vectors to breach targets. For instance, back in October, they were found to be embedding malware within Ethereum and BNB Chain smart contracts as part of a stealth campaign now linked to the state-backed group UNC5342. Across the globe, major economies like the United States, South Korea, Australia, and members of the European Union have rolled out targeted sanctions against North Korea’s cybercrime infrastructure in a bid to curb its illegal revenue generation. But that alone may not be enough, according to Andrew Fierman, who noted that disrupting North Korea’s operations requires coordinated action across the entire industry, including exchanges, infrastructure providers, analytics firms, and law enforcement agencies. Fierman warned that the regime is expected to continue to rely on crypto theft as a primary revenue stream, especially as international sanctions tighten and other income channels shrink. Evolving crypto laundering techniques Once the funds are stolen, the process by which they are laundered further compounds the problem, making recovery efforts extremely difficult and transforming the threat into a persistent and systemic risk for the broader crypto ecosystem. “Stolen funds follow diverse laundering paths, including mixing services, OTC brokers, chain-hopping, token swaps, decentralised exchanges, and bridge protocols to obscure flows,” Fierman said. Some of the techniques used by North Korean groups include the so-called Chinese laundromat network, which comprises over-the-counter brokers, underground banking channels, and cross-border money transmitters based largely in China and Southeast Asia. On the technical side, they rely on complex cross-chain bridge routes and a rotation of mixing services to fragment the stolen assets across blockchains. These are often withdrawn through loosely regulated Chinese-language platforms with weak KYC requirements. Although North Korea’s cyber attacks also target areas beyond the crypto sector, the crypto industry remains an especially attractive target, mainly due to its liquidity, global accessibility, and fragmented oversight. Last month, during the Devconnect conference in Buenos Aires, web3 audit firm Opsek’s founder Pablo Sabbatella warned that roughly 30% to 40% of applicants flooding into crypto jobs may be North Korean attempts to gain insider access through fake identities.

The image attached to SMQKE’s post references commentary from WisdomTree, outlining how regulatory clarity across key jurisdictions is beginning to influence which blockchain networks are best placed to attract institutional participation. Within this context, XRP is presented as one of the assets expected to benefit directly from clearer rules and compliance standards. WISDOMTREE: XRP IS ANOTHER CLEAR BENEFICIARY OF REGULATORY CLARITY Documented. https://t.co/UnOjHSfLy7 pic.twitter.com/quT1EHttd2 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) December 26, 2025 Regulation Reshaping Institutional Allocation According to the material highlighted by SMQKE, WisdomTree argues that as regulation becomes more defined, capital is not simply moving into digital assets broadly, but is being redirected toward networks that align with institutional requirements. The document states that this shift is recalibrating which blockchains are positioned to lead the next phase of institutional involvement. Regulatory clarity is described as a decisive factor in determining which ecosystems can support compliant financial activity at scale. This view reflects a growing emphasis among traditional financial players on legal certainty, governance, and integration with existing systems. Rather than pursuing speculative exposure, WisdomTree’s outlook emphasizes disciplined allocation strategies that are sensitive to evolving regulatory conditions and focused on use cases such as tokenisation, cross-border payments, and compliant decentralised finance. XRP’s Role in Cross-Border Finance Within WisdomTree’s assessment, XRP is identified as another clear beneficiary of regulatory clarity, particularly in the area of cross-border finance. The documented commentary notes that enterprise integrations and improved legal standing in the United States following Ripple’s legal outcome have positioned XRP as a suitable option for financial institutions seeking compliant alternatives to established messaging systems, such as SWIFT. SMQKE’s post underscores that this positioning is not a theoretical possibility, but a probable outcome rooted in regulatory developments and existing integrations. The emphasis is placed on XRP’s relevance for institutions that require efficiency in international payments while maintaining adherence to compliance expectations. Ethereum, Solana, and a Broader Institutional Basket The same material referenced by SMQKE also situates XRP alongside other major networks, including Ethereum and Solana. WisdomTree’s outlook suggests that Ethereum stands to gain from its dominant role in areas such as stablecoin issuance, decentralised finance infrastructure, and real-world asset tokenisation, all of which are receiving regulatory endorsement in multiple regions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Solana is described as benefiting from its focus on consumer-facing applications and its growing presence in compliant DeFi environments. Together, these networks are portrayed as forming the core of a more selective, basket-driven approach to digital asset exposure. The emphasis is on diversification, regulatory sensitivity, and targeting themes that align with institutional priorities. SMQKE’s Emphasis on Documentation SMQKE’s contribution centers on presenting this perspective as documented evidence rather than opinion. By sharing the excerpts, the researcher highlights that the view of XRP as a beneficiary of regulatory clarity comes from a large asset manager engaged in institutional strategy, not solely from within the crypto community.

The loss highlights the need for solutions that mitigate vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency transactions. Pact Swap is one such solution. In this interview, we talk to Toby Gilbert , co-founder of Pact Swap. Toby explains how the exchange utilizes collateralized smart contracts to enable cheaper swaps (90% less expensive than existing solutions) while eliminating custody risk. These features make Pact Swap the ideal trading venue and infrastructure layer for moving value across chains. Background Q: Hello Toby, let’s begin with a brief introduction as you tell us about your role at Pact Swap. A: As a co-founder of Pact Swap and one of the co-founders of Coinweb, the underlying infrastructure on which we are built, my focus is on ensuring that what we build solves real-world problems in the market and can compete under actual market conditions. That means enabling cross-chain trading that can compete on price and asset coverage without forcing users to return to centralized exchanges. It also means working closely with partners, liquidity providers, aggregators, and users to understand where existing solutions break down. Ultimately, my role is about turning those insights into a product that the market actually needs today, not something that only looks good on a whitepaper. Q: As the CEO of a major blockchain platform, what do you consider the most significant barrier to decentralization? Is it worthwhile to invest in this space? A: The biggest barrier is hidden centralization. Many systems claim to be decentralized while quietly introducing trusted intermediaries, validators, or governance chokepoints. That creates fragility. Despite this, it is absolutely worth investing in the space, but selectively. The focus should be on infrastructure that removes trust assumptions rather than rebranding them, and that lowers costs instead of simply pushing them elsewhere. When decentralization is done correctly, it delivers both resilience and efficiency. Q: Pact Swap operates in a competitive landscape where other platforms offer similar services. How does Pact Swap stand out? A: Most cross-chain platforms address interoperability by introducing additional infrastructure, including bridges, validators, committees, wrapped assets, or extra consensus layers. Each addition increases complexity, cost, and risk. We did the opposite. Pact Swap operates without bridges or external validators. We rely directly on the native consensus of each blockchain and enforce outcomes using collateralized smart contracts. That results in lower costs, fewer attack surfaces, and a system that behaves predictably under stress. That design choice is why swaps can be up to 90% cheaper than existing solutions, why native assets can be used directly, and why risk is isolated per transaction rather than pooled across the system. In short: fewer moving parts, less trust, and better economics. Collaterized smart contracts vs bridges Q: Pact Swap uses collateralized smart contracts on Coinweb to manage transactions and verify actions. How exactly does this work? A: Each swap is governed by a smart contract that defines the rules upfront—one party posts collateral. The system observes what actually happens on the underlying blockchains. If both sides fulfill their obligations, the collateral is released. If one side fails, the collateral compensates the other. There’s no discretionary decision-making, no intermediary, and no external enforcement. The outcome is purely a function of what happened on-chain. Q: Without bridges or validators, isn’t Pact Swap more exposed if a smart contract fails? A: Actually, the opposite. Bridges and validator networks introduce systemic risk because they aggregate trust across multiple parties. When they fail, they fail catastrophically. With Pact Swap, risk is isolated per transaction. Each swap is self-contained, collateralized, and independently verifiable. There is no shared pool of funds and no centralized component that can be exploited to bring the system down. Even in adverse scenarios, the impact is contained. Using Pact Swap Q: What’s in it for the client side? What practical applications do you see for a platform like Pact Swap? A: For users, it’s simple: cheaper swaps, real native assets, and no custody risk. That matters for retail users, institutions, wallets, merchants, payment gateways, and aggregators. Anywhere you need to move value across chains reliably, especially involving Bitcoin. Pact Swap becomes useful infrastructure rather than just a trading venue. Q: Please provide a simple overview of making a cross-chain swap on Pact Swap. A: A user connects their wallet, selects a pair, say native BTC to USDT, and confirms the trade. The system locks collateral, monitors both chains, and settles directly on each native network. From the user’s perspective, it feels similar to a standard swap. Under the hood, enforcement and settlement happen without bridges, wrapped tokens, or intermediaries. Behind the scenes, collateral is locked, transactions are monitored across both chains, and settlement is enforced automatically. The experience feels familiar, but the cost structure and trust assumptions are fundamentally different. Q: Given the rapid pace of innovation in this space, when do you foresee decentralized exchanges surpassing centralized platforms in terms of product offerings and user experience? A: Technically, that is already happening in certain areas. The remaining gap is largely economic and architectural. Once decentralized systems can consistently offer CEX-level pricing, reliability, and asset coverage, without custody risk, the migration becomes inevitable. We are much closer to that inflection point than most people realize. Q: Gauging client feedback and usage metrics, how is the traction so far? A: The response has been very strong. Even as an MVP, we have processed thousands of swaps with minimal optimization and onboarded users quickly. What matters most at this stage is not raw volume, but user behavior. When people experience materially lower costs and direct access to native assets, they come back. That is a strong indication that the model is effective. $PACT token and its utility Q: Tell us about the $PACT token and its utility. Is it still the token used for settling transaction fees? A: $PACT is the governance and utility token of the ecosystem. It controls access to the fee pool, enables governance decisions, powers listings and affiliates, and aligns long-term incentives. Importantly, transaction fees are not paid in $PACT. Instead, $PACT governs value capture rather than adding friction, which keeps the trading experience clean and competitive. Q: Are there any other features you would like to talk about? A: What excites me most is composability. Pact Swap is not just a destination; it is an infrastructure that other products can build on. As more wallets, aggregators, and protocols integrate native cross-chain functionality, we expect Pact Swap to remain a key component of much of the future DeFi activity. That is where durable value is created, and it is the direction we are building toward.",Exclusive Interviews with Crypto Founders & Influencers|Pact Swap,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-29 11:37:35

This analysis explores Bitcoin price predictions for 2026 through 2030, grounded in historical data, technological developments, and macroeconomic trends. The cryptocurrency market has demonstrated remarkable resilience and evolution since Bitcoin’s inception in 2009, transitioning from an experimental digital currency to a recognized asset class. Consequently, understanding Bitcoin’s potential trajectory requires examining multiple dimensions beyond simple price speculation. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Historical Context and Current Landscape Bitcoin’s price history reveals distinct cycles characterized by exponential growth periods followed by significant corrections. The 2017 bull run saw Bitcoin reach nearly $20,000 before declining, while the 2021 cycle pushed prices above $69,000. Currently, Bitcoin operates within an increasingly regulated environment with growing institutional adoption. Major financial institutions now offer Bitcoin-related products, and several countries have implemented clear regulatory frameworks. This institutional involvement provides both stability and new dynamics to Bitcoin’s price discovery mechanisms. Furthermore, the 2024 halving event reduced new Bitcoin issuance, historically preceding substantial price movements in subsequent years. Market analysts consistently monitor several key indicators when formulating Bitcoin price predictions. These include network fundamentals like hash rate and active addresses, macroeconomic factors such as inflation rates and monetary policy, and adoption metrics including wallet growth and transaction volume. The Bitcoin network’s security has reached unprecedented levels, with hash rates setting new records regularly. This computational power represents significant infrastructure investment, suggesting long-term confidence from network participants. Additionally, Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins creates inherent scarcity that interacts dynamically with changing demand. Methodologies for Cryptocurrency Forecasting Experts employ diverse methodologies when creating Bitcoin price predictions, each with distinct strengths and limitations. Technical analysis examines historical price patterns and trading volumes to identify potential future movements. This approach utilizes tools like moving averages, relative strength index, and Fibonacci retracement levels. Fundamental analysis evaluates Bitcoin’s intrinsic value based on network adoption, utility, and competitive positioning within digital assets. On-chain analysis provides unique insights by examining blockchain data, including holder behavior, exchange flows, and miner activity. Several quantitative models have gained prominence in Bitcoin forecasting circles. The Stock-to-Flow model, developed by PlanB, correlates Bitcoin’s scarcity with its market value. Metcalfe’s Law suggests a network’s value relates to the square of its users. Additionally, regression analysis based on previous halving cycles offers another perspective. However, responsible analysts emphasize that these models represent possibilities rather than guarantees. The cryptocurrency market remains influenced by unpredictable variables including regulatory developments, technological breakthroughs, and global economic conditions. Expert Perspectives and Institutional Analysis Financial institutions and research firms have published increasingly sophisticated Bitcoin price predictions as cryptocurrency matures. Bloomberg Intelligence suggests Bitcoin could reach $100,000 by 2025 based on adoption trends and macroeconomic conditions. Standard Chartered has projected $200,000 by the end of 2025 in their more optimistic scenarios. ARK Invest’s research indicates Bitcoin’s market capitalization could surpass $1 trillion within current market cycles. These institutional perspectives often incorporate traditional financial metrics alongside cryptocurrency-specific factors. Industry veterans provide additional context based on technological developments. Many emphasize Bitcoin’s evolving role as digital gold—a store of value uncorrelated with traditional assets. The growing integration of Bitcoin within portfolio management strategies supports this narrative. Meanwhile, developers continue enhancing Bitcoin’s functionality through Layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network, which enables faster, cheaper transactions. These technological improvements could expand Bitcoin’s utility beyond store-of-value applications, potentially influencing its adoption curve and price trajectory. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2026: The Post-Halving Year Historical patterns suggest the year following a halving typically exhibits significant price appreciation. If this pattern continues, 2026 could represent a period of substantial growth. Analysts reference previous cycles where Bitcoin’s price increased approximately 12-18 months after halving events. Based on these historical precedents, some projections suggest Bitcoin could reach between $150,000 and $250,000 by late 2026. However, these estimates assume continued adoption growth and favorable macroeconomic conditions. Several specific factors will likely influence Bitcoin’s price throughout 2026. Regulatory clarity in major economies could either facilitate or hinder institutional investment. Technological developments improving Bitcoin’s scalability and privacy might increase its utility. Global economic conditions, particularly inflation rates and currency devaluation concerns, could drive additional demand for Bitcoin as an alternative store of value. Furthermore, the maturation of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other regulated investment vehicles may provide new capital inflows. Bitcoin Price Prediction Range 2026-2030 Year Conservative Estimate Moderate Estimate Optimistic Estimate Key Influencing Factors 2026 $120,000 $180,000 $250,000 Post-halving cycle, ETF maturation, regulatory developments 2027 $150,000 $220,000 $350,000 Institutional adoption, technological improvements, macroeconomic conditions 2028 $180,000 $280,000 $500,000 Network effects, global adoption rates, competitor developments 2029 $220,000 $350,000 $750,000 Scarcity narrative, wealth transfer generations, infrastructure maturity 2030 $250,000 $450,000 $1,000,000+ Total addressable market, monetary system evolution, technological breakthroughs Bitcoin Price Prediction 2027-2028: Mid-Cycle Dynamics The 2027-2028 period may represent either continuation or consolidation, depending on preceding market conditions. Historically, Bitcoin experiences multi-year cycles with periods of accumulation between bull markets. If 2026 realizes significant appreciation, 2027 might involve price consolidation as markets digest gains. Alternatively, if adoption accelerates exponentially, these years could see continued upward momentum. Analysts particularly monitor Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional markets during such periods, as decoupling from stock markets would strengthen its value proposition as an independent asset class. Technological milestones expected around this timeframe could substantially impact Bitcoin’s utility and value. The Lightning Network aims to achieve mainstream scalability, potentially enabling everyday transactions. Privacy enhancements through technologies like Taproot could increase fungibility. Furthermore, interoperability solutions allowing Bitcoin to function within decentralized finance ecosystems might expand its use cases. These developments could positively influence Bitcoin price predictions by demonstrating practical utility beyond speculative investment. Global Adoption and Macroeconomic Factors Bitcoin’s global adoption curve represents perhaps the most significant variable in long-term price predictions. Currently, adoption follows an S-curve pattern similar to other transformative technologies. Analysis suggests Bitcoin remains in the early adoption phase, with substantial growth potential. Emerging markets experiencing currency instability increasingly adopt Bitcoin for remittances and savings preservation. Meanwhile, developed nations see growing allocation within investment portfolios. This dual adoption pathway creates diverse demand sources that could sustain long-term price appreciation. Macroeconomic conditions significantly influence Bitcoin price predictions through several mechanisms. Expansionary monetary policies and quantitative easing programs tend to increase demand for scarce assets like Bitcoin. Currency devaluation in various countries drives citizens toward alternative stores of value. Geopolitical tensions and capital controls similarly increase Bitcoin’s appeal as a borderless, censorship-resistant asset. These macroeconomic tailwinds could accelerate adoption throughout the late 2020s, potentially creating favorable conditions for Bitcoin’s price appreciation. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2029-2030: The Long-Term Horizon Projecting Bitcoin’s price to 2030 requires considering both exponential growth possibilities and saturation points. If Bitcoin continues following adoption curves similar to internet or mobile phone penetration, its user base could expand tenfold by 2030. Such growth would dramatically increase demand against Bitcoin’s fixed supply. Simple supply-demand economics suggests this scenario would create substantial upward price pressure. However, market saturation, regulatory hurdles, or technological disruption could moderate these projections. Several transformative developments could materialize by 2030, significantly impacting Bitcoin’s valuation. Central bank digital currencies might either compete with or complement Bitcoin’s functionality. Climate change concerns could drive innovation in Bitcoin’s energy usage, potentially improving its environmental narrative. Wealth transfer between generations might increase cryptocurrency adoption as digital-native populations inherit substantial assets. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s potential recognition as a reserve asset by corporations or even nations could fundamentally alter its market dynamics. Critical factors that will determine Bitcoin’s 2030 valuation include: Global adoption rates across different demographics and regions Regulatory frameworks established by major economic powers Technological advancements improving scalability, privacy, and security Macroeconomic environment including inflation, interest rates, and currency stability Competitive landscape from other cryptocurrencies and digital assets Institutional investment patterns and portfolio allocation percentages Risk Factors and Alternative Scenarios While optimistic Bitcoin price predictions capture attention, responsible analysis must consider potential downside scenarios. Regulatory crackdowns in major economies could severely limit adoption and liquidity. Technological vulnerabilities, though increasingly unlikely given Bitcoin’s security track record, could undermine confidence. Environmental concerns might lead to restrictions on Bitcoin mining in certain jurisdictions. Additionally, superior competing technologies could emerge, capturing market share from Bitcoin. These risk factors remind investors that cryptocurrency markets remain volatile and unpredictable. Market analysts also monitor several specific indicators that could signal changing conditions. Bitcoin’s dominance ratio within the broader cryptocurrency market provides insights about its competitive position. Exchange reserves indicate whether investors are accumulating or distributing Bitcoin. Derivatives market data reveals institutional positioning and potential leverage in the system. Furthermore, on-chain metrics like realized capitalization and holder distribution offer nuanced perspectives beyond simple price movements. Monitoring these indicators helps contextualize Bitcoin price predictions within broader market dynamics. Conclusion Bitcoin price predictions for 2026 through 2030 encompass a wide range of possibilities, reflecting both optimism about cryptocurrency adoption and acknowledgment of market uncertainties. Historical patterns, technological developments, and macroeconomic trends suggest potential for significant appreciation, particularly following the 2024 halving. However, investors should approach these projections with appropriate caution, recognizing that cryptocurrency markets involve substantial volatility. The most informed perspectives balance technical analysis, fundamental evaluation, and macroeconomic awareness while acknowledging that unexpected developments frequently influence financial markets. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s journey through the latter half of this decade will test its resilience as a decentralized digital asset and potentially redefine its role within global finance. FAQs Q1: What is the most reliable method for Bitcoin price prediction? No single method proves completely reliable, but combining technical analysis, fundamental evaluation, and on-chain metrics provides the most comprehensive approach. Analysts increasingly incorporate macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments into their models. Q2: How does Bitcoin’s halving event affect price predictions? Historically, Bitcoin halving events reducing block rewards have preceded substantial price increases. This scarcity mechanism influences long-term projections, though the magnitude and timing of effects vary across cycles. Q3: What percentage of investment portfolios might include Bitcoin by 2030? Financial advisors suggest allocations between 1-5% for conservative investors, though some analysts project higher percentages as cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream. Institutional adoption will significantly influence these allocation trends. Q4: Could government regulations dramatically impact Bitcoin’s price trajectory? Yes, regulatory developments represent significant variables in Bitcoin price predictions. Clear, supportive regulations typically encourage institutional investment, while restrictive policies can limit adoption and liquidity in affected regions. Q5: How does Bitcoin’s environmental impact affect its long-term price predictions? Environmental considerations increasingly influence institutional and retail investment decisions. Bitcoin’s energy usage innovations and migration toward renewable sources could positively impact its adoption curve and therefore its valuation over time.

This pivotal movement, reported by Cointelegraph on May 15, 2025, signals a maturation phase for blockchain-based finance as it seeks deeper integration with the global economy. RWA TVL Achieves a Historic Milestone in DeFi Data from the leading analytics platform DeFiLlama confirms this seismic change. The total value locked for RWA protocols now stands at approximately $17 billion. This figure represents a substantial surge from the $12 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024. Consequently, RWAs have displaced decentralized exchanges from the fifth position in the DeFi category rankings. Notably, this category did not even rank among the top ten at the beginning of this year, highlighting an exceptionally rapid ascent. Understanding the Real-World Asset Phenomenon Real-world asset tokenization involves representing physical or traditional financial assets on a blockchain. This process creates digital tokens backed by tangible value. Major categories now driving RWA TVL growth include: Tokenized Treasury Bills: U.S. Treasury bonds issued as digital tokens by entities like Ondo Finance and Franklin Templeton. Real Estate: Fractional ownership of commercial and residential properties through platforms such as RealT. Commodities: Digital representations of assets like gold, exemplified by PAX Gold (PAXG). Private Credit: Blockchain-facilitated lending against real-world collateral. This diversification provides a crucial bridge between volatile crypto-native assets and stable, yield-generating traditional finance. Investors increasingly seek these hybrid instruments for portfolio stability. The Data-Driven Narrative of Growth The trajectory of RWA TVL tells a compelling story. Analysis of quarterly data reveals a consistent upward trend, accelerated by rising global interest rates in traditional markets. The following table illustrates the recent TVL progression for the top RWA protocols, showcasing the drivers behind the $17 billion aggregate: Protocol Primary Asset Class Approx. TVL (USD) Ondo Finance Tokenized U.S. Treasuries $5.8B MakerDAO Real-World Asset Backed Loans $4.2B Maple Finance Private Credit $1.5B Centrifuge Asset-Backed Loans $1.1B This structured growth contrasts with the more cyclical TVL patterns often seen in purely speculative DeFi sectors like decentralized exchanges. Implications for the Broader DeFi Ecosystem The surpassing of DEX TVL by RWA protocols carries significant implications. Firstly, it indicates a diversification of capital within DeFi. Capital is no longer chasing purely speculative yields but is instead flowing toward assets with recognized intrinsic value. Secondly, this shift potentially reduces systemic risk. RWA-backed protocols often correlate with traditional market performance, not just crypto market sentiment. Furthermore, this trend enhances the legitimacy of decentralized finance in the eyes of institutional investors. Large financial entities demonstrate a clear preference for instruments tied to familiar, regulated asset classes. The growth of RWA TVL, therefore, acts as a gateway for further institutional adoption of blockchain technology. Regulatory and Market Structure Impacts The rise of real-world assets on-chain inevitably attracts regulatory scrutiny. Jurisdictions worldwide are now examining how existing securities, commodities, and property laws apply to tokenized versions. This regulatory evolution will shape the next phase of RWA growth. Simultaneously, traditional financial infrastructure providers, like custodian banks and transfer agents, are exploring partnerships with blockchain firms. This convergence is creating a new hybrid financial market structure. Conclusion The ascent of RWA TVL into the top five DeFi categories marks a definitive turning point. It underscores a maturation from niche experimentation toward integration with the global financial system. The $17 billion milestone reflects growing demand for yield, stability, and real-world utility within the blockchain space. As tokenization technology and regulatory frameworks evolve, the RWA category is poised to become a permanent and expanding pillar of decentralized finance. FAQs Q1: What does RWA TVL surpassing DEXs mean for the average crypto investor? It signals a broader, more stable investment landscape within DeFi. Investors now have easier access to yield-generating traditional assets like U.S. Treasuries directly on-chain, potentially lowering portfolio risk. Q2: Why has RWA TVL grown so rapidly in 2025? Key drivers include high traditional interest rates making tokenized treasuries attractive, increased institutional participation, and technological improvements in compliance and asset servicing for on-chain RWAs. Q3: Are real-world assets on blockchain safe? Safety depends on the specific protocol’s legal structure, collateralization, and transparency. While blockchain provides immutable record-keeping, investors must assess the off-chain legal rights backing the token and the custodian’s reliability. Q4: How does this affect traditional decentralized exchanges? DEXs remain vital for crypto-native trading and liquidity. The RWA growth represents market expansion, not replacement. Many DEXs may list tokenized RWAs, creating new synergies between the categories. Q5: What is the biggest challenge facing the RWA sector? Regulatory clarity is the primary challenge. Seamlessly connecting on-chain tokens to off-chain legal rights and ensuring compliance across jurisdictions requires ongoing innovation and dialogue with regulators.

56544199,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=885642,1767009525,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56544199.jpeg,"China releases new rules to restrict AI chatbots from promoting gambling, self-harm",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/china-says-no-to-suicide-ai-chatbots/,"Regulators in China are planning a clampdown on AI-powered chatbots that are pushing people into suicidal emotions, self-harm activities, and gambling. The development comes as two leading chatbot companies in China recently filed for IPOs in Hong Kong. Reports suggest that the newly proposed measures that were announced on Saturday will apply to AI products or services that are offered to the public in China that simulate human personality and engage users emotionally via texts, images, audio or video. China’s proposals are expected to protect minors from self-harm According to the draft rules that were released on Saturday by the Cyberspace Administration, these are targeted at what it has termed “human-like interactive AI services,” as per CNBC translation of the Chinese-language document. The draft rules have several proposals. For example, AI chatbots cannot generate content that encourages self-harm or suicide, engage in verbal violence or emotional manipulation that can damage users’ mental health. Additionally, AI chatbots are not supposed to create obscene or violent and gambling-related content. According to the draft rules, if a user proposes suicide, the AI company is supposed to have a human who takes over the conversation and immediately contacts the user’s guardian or a designated individual. The draft rules also propose that minors have guardian consent for emotional companionship use, with time limits on usage. Under the new rules, AI platforms are expected to decide if a user is an adult or a minor even if they do not disclose their age. In the event of doubts, platforms must apply settings for minors, while allowing for appeals. Once finalized, these rules would mark the world’s first attempt to regulate AI with human or anthropomorphic characteristics, according to NYU School of Law professor Winston Ma. These developments come as businesses have rapidly developed AI companions and digital celebrities. When comparing this with China’s 2023 generative AI regulation, Ma opined that this version “highlights a leap from content safety to emotional.” The proposals come as two Chinese AI chatbot startups Z.ai and Minimax have this month filed for initial public offerings (IPOs) in Hong. Minimax is best known internationally for its Talkie AI app that lets users chat with virtual characters. According to CNBC, the app and its domestic Chinese version, known as Xingye, accounted for more than a third of the firm’s revenue in the first three quarters of the year, with an average of over 20 million monthly active users during that time. As for Z.ai, which is also known as Zhipu, it filed under the name Knowledge Atlas Technology , but did not disclose its monthly active users. However, the AI company revealed that its technology is on about 80 million devices, including smartphones, personal computers and smart vehicles. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , the two AI startups, both backed by Alibaba and Tencent are targeting to go public in early January next year on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

56544063,649257,1767009652,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56544063.jpeg,Bitcoin Miners Brace For Another Difficulty Spike In January After 2025 Record,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-miners-brace-for-another-difficulty-spike-in-january-after-2025-record/,"Bitcoin’s network has become slightly harder to mine, with the latest difficulty rising to a little over 148 trillion. Block times are currently averaging about 9.95 minutes, a little below the network’s 10-minute goal, prompting the adjustment to slow mining slightly. Projected Difficulty Rise Bitcoin adjusts its mining difficulty every 2016 blocks, roughly every two weeks, to keep the average block time near 10 minutes. When blocks are added too quickly, the network raises difficulty; when they fall behind, it lowers it. Right now, miners are adding blocks a bit faster than the target, which means the network will increase the challenge to keep production steady. Based on CoinWarz estimates, the next adjustment on January 8, 2026, at block 931,392, is expected to push the difficulty to past 148 trillion. Historical Context And Market Moves Mining difficulty has climbed to new highs during 2025, with two sharp jumps in September coinciding with Bitcoin’s price surge earlier in the year. Bitcoin hit $125,100 in October before experiencing a significant drop. As prices rise, more mining rigs enter the network, which increases total computing power and prompts difficulty to adjust upward. Miners’ Costs And Network Security Higher difficulty means miners need more computing power and energy to solve blocks. This raises costs and can squeeze profit margins, especially for smaller operations. At the same time, the system protects the network from centralization. If one miner or a group controlled too much computing power, they could dominate block production or even attempt a 51% attack. By adjusting difficulty, the network keeps mining distributed and secure. Outlook From The Investment Side According to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, Bitcoin may deliver steady growth over the next 10 years rather than massive yearly gains. He told CNBC that he expects “strong returns” with moderate ups and downs. Hougan also maintains that 2026 is likely to be a positive year for Bitcoin, reflecting the network’s resilience after recent highs and volatility. The rise to above 148 trillion is not dramatic but will slightly tighten miners’ margins. Tracking block times, hash rate, and difficulty can give insight into short-term mining profitability. For investors, difficulty trends also indicate the real-world effort securing Bitcoin, which influences supply and potential selling pressure. The network’s difficulty adjustments are routine but vital. They ensure coins are released steadily, miners remain challenged, and Bitcoin’s decentralized design is preserved.

Despite recent turbulence, Cory Klippsten – the chief executive of Swan Bitcoin – believes the digital asset is poised for a sharp rally over the next 12 months. Speaking recently with CNBC , Klippsten argued that BTC’s adoption curve, institutional support, and historical cycle patterns suggest a strong probability of a record high next year. “I think we have more than a 50% chance … of a new all-time high in 2026,” he said, adding that he expects Bitcoin to climb above $125,000. Reason behind Klippsten’s bullish Bitcoin forecast for 2026 One of the strongest arguments for a bullish Bitcoin forecast for 2026 lies in the steady growth of institutional and government participation. Klippsten emphasized that BTC adoption currently is largely a one-way street: “People don’t tend to get into Bitcoin and then get out of it. They generally stick.” This stickiness, combined with the influx of capital from large players, creates a durable foundation for price appreciation. Unlike earlier cycles where speculative retail demand dominated – today’s market is supported by pension funds, asset managers, and sovereign entities. That deeper pool of buyers reduces the likelihood of a sharp collapse and increases the probability of sustained upward momentum, he argued last week on “ Fast Money ”. Here’s what history tells us about BTC heading into 2026 Bitcoin’s price history has mostly been defined by four-year cycles tied to halving events. Peaks in 2013, 2017, and 2021 were followed by years where prices failed to surpass prior highs. Klippsten noted that 2025 broke this pattern: “Because there wasn’t an astronomical rise … it’s hard to imagine some precipitous fall from here.” Instead of repeating the boom-and-bust extremes, Bitcoin appears to be entering a more mature phase, where liquidity and adoption drive steadier growth. With the asset consolidating in the $85,000–$90,000 range , Klippsten believes the groundwork is set for a breakout. His forecast of $125,000 reflects confidence that BTC’s resilience will carry into 2026, potentially delivering a more than 40% return over the next 12 months. Is miners’ rising shift to AI bearish for Bitcoin? A notable trend in recent years has been Bitcoin miners diversifying into artificial intelligence infrastructure. Companies like Core Scientific have announced plans to become fully focused on high-performance computing (HPC) within the next two to three years. While some worry this reduces mining power, Klippsten dismissed the concern: “Just because hash rate might fall or go up … it doesn’t really change the security model of Bitcoin.” Mining costs and hash rate are lagging indicators, not price drivers. The exit of large industrial miners simply opens opportunities for smaller players, maintaining decentralization. Moreover, BTC’s protocol ensures network security adjusts dynamically. Far from being a bearish signal, the shift highlights the adaptability of the ecosystem while leaving Bitcoin’s fundamentals intact.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-traders-the-next-leg-could-be-explosive-heres-why/,"XRP’s recent price action has tested trader patience . Sideways movement and muted volatility have dominated the chart, giving the impression of indecision. However, experienced market participants know that extended consolidation phases often mask important structural shifts. In XRP’s case, derivatives data and liquidity behavior are offering early clues that the market may be preparing for a decisive move rather than prolonged stagnation. That view was reinforced by market analyst Xaif, who recently shared his assessment on X, pointing to subtle but meaningful changes in XRP’s open interest dynamics. His analysis focuses not on headline price levels alone, but on how leverage, liquidity, and participation are interacting beneath the surface. Despite short-term OI reset, $XRP continues to absorb liquidity without major long-unwinds. If OI begins expanding again with price reclaim above $2.10 the next leg could be explosive pic.twitter.com/bgGM3m9utD — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) December 28, 2025 A Healthy Open Interest Reset XRP has undergone a short-term reset in open interest , a development that can easily be misread as bearish. According to Xaif, this reset did not come from aggressive long liquidations or panic-driven exits. Instead, it reflects a controlled reduction in excess leverage, allowing the market to cool without destabilizing prices. This type of reset is often constructive. A decline in open interest alongside a steady price suggests that the market is clearing speculative froth while spot demand remains intact. Historically, such conditions have provided a cleaner foundation for renewed trend expansion. Liquidity Absorption Without Structural Damage Xaif highlights that XRP continues to absorb liquidity without triggering major long unwinds, which is a notable signal. Sellers have been active, but their pressure has not resulted in cascading liquidations or sharp breakdowns. This implies that buyers are consistently stepping in, preventing downside acceleration. Larger participants are absorbing liquidity like this, typically during accumulation phases, especially when positioning ahead of anticipated volatility. While it does not confirm immediate upside, it significantly reduces the likelihood of a sudden collapse. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Role of the $2.10 Reclaim From a technical standpoint, the $2.10 level has become a key area to watch. Xaif noted that a price reclaim above this zone, combined with a renewed expansion in open interest, would be a strong signal that traders are re-entering with confidence. In such scenarios, rising open interest alongside rising price typically reflects fresh participation aligned with the prevailing trend. This combination often marks the transition from consolidation to impulse movement, as leverage begins to support, rather than suppress, price momentum. Why the Next Move Could Be Fast Volatility compression rarely lasts indefinitely. XRP’s current structure—normalized leverage, steady liquidity absorption, and clearly defined resistance—creates conditions where a breakout can unfold rapidly once triggered. If momentum returns above key levels, the market may find itself chasing price rather than gradually building positions. For XRP traders, Xaif’s analysis underscores a critical point: the quiet phases are often where the groundwork for the most explosive moves is laid .

The upgrade is set to make Binance Smart Chain a more attractive platform for mainstream use cases, whilst strengthening demand for BNB as the altcoin powering these use cases. Important: the Fermi Hard Fork upgrade on the BSC mainnet is scheduled for activation. Date & Time: 14 Jan 2026, 02:30 AM (UTC) Supported Releases: v1.6.4 and v1.6.5 It is mandatory for all validators and builders to complete the upgrade prior to the fork activation.… pic.twitter.com/ZkdSCUDR2k — BNB Chain Developers (@BNBChainDevs) December 26, 2025 Speed is the main talking point. According to the Binance GitHub documentation , the Fermi upgrade will slash block times from 750 milliseconds to just 250 milliseconds. It also introduces a new indexing mechanism that lets users access selective ledger data rather than downloading the entire blockchain history. Together, these tweaks reduce computing needs, cut storage requirements, and support time-sensitive applications that require sub-second confirmation speeds. As a closer match to the efficient centralized infrastructure available in traditional finance, Binance becomes a more likely host to bridge TradFi and DeFi. This ultimately gives the Binace chain a deeper foothold in two of this cycle’s strongest narratives: Institutional adoption and RWA tokenisation. Binance Coin Price Prediction: Surge Set For January? Market participants appear ready to bite, with momentum indicators showing fresh underlying strength despite a bearish 2-month pennant pattern. BNB / USD 1-day chart, bearish pennant pattern. Source: TradingView . The RSI continues to form higher lows, now pushing against the neutral line in a setup for a trend flip, something already predicted by a MACD golden cross above the signal line. Wider market sentiment has kept the bearish outcome at the forefront, but momentum building behind the Fermi upgrade could turn the structure into a bullish symmetrical triangle breakout. The key breakout threshold is strong December resistance at $870. If flipped back into support, it could act as a firmer and higher footing for a confirmed 20% breakout push to $1,050. And if the mainnet launch unfolds as more than a sell-the-news event, prices could push to reclaim all-time highs, 60% higher at $1,375. The full price impact of the upgrade will likely be realised with long-term adoption. Still, the bearish pennant remains in the cards. A breakdown could put a cycle-long support under pressure, with a 40% drop to $500 possible if the support does not hold firm. Maxi Doge: A Better Play for 2026? While Fermi could give Binance Coin a path toward deeper TradFi engagement, the narrative may already belong elsewhere. Ethereum and Solana are already carving out their role as the go-tos. In crypto, momentum often follows where culture leads. And culture keeps circling back to one thing: Doge. History makes the pattern clear: Shiba Inu carried the torch from Dogecoin in 2021, then Floki, Bonk, Dogwifhat, and most recently, Neiro in 2024. Every bull run eventually delivers its own Doge-themed runner. For 2026, speculators are increasingly eyeing Maxi Doge ($MAXI) as the next frontrunner. The hype is already showing in the numbers. The $MAXI presale has raised almost $4.35 million, while early backers are earning up to 71% APY through staking rewards. For those who missed the Doge wave before, Maxi Doge could be the next chance to catch a meme coin breakout before it takes off.

According to fresh data analysis, key on-chain metrics have turned negative, signaling the most significant slowdown in genuine Bitcoin accumulation since October of last year. Consequently, the path forward for the world’s premier digital asset now critically depends on two factors: a decisive recovery in American investor participation and a technical breakout above the formidable $90,000 price barrier. Bitcoin Rally Stalls Amid Shifting Demand Dynamics The cryptocurrency market entered 2025 with robust momentum, but recent weeks have introduced notable uncertainty. Market participants globally are now closely monitoring the behavior of U.S.-based investors, historically a dominant force in driving Bitcoin’s price cycles. Data from leading analytics firms reveals a concerning trend: the fundamental demand that fuels sustainable rallies has weakened considerably. This development has effectively paused the upward trajectory, creating a consolidation phase that will test the market’s underlying strength. Analysts emphasize that without renewed buying pressure from key geographic regions, particularly the United States, breaking through established resistance levels will prove challenging. Decoding the Metrics: Real Demand and the Coinbase Premium Two specific metrics provide quantifiable evidence of the current demand slowdown. First, the BTC Real Demand indicator from Capriole Investments, a tool designed to filter out exchange-driven noise and measure genuine accumulation, has recorded a stark decline. Over the past fortnight, this metric fell to -3,491 BTC, marking its lowest point in nearly a year. This negative figure indicates that selling or distribution is outweighing new, substantive buying at a measurable rate. Simultaneously, the Coinbase Premium, which tracks the price difference between the Coinbase exchange (popular with U.S. institutions) and other global exchanges, has rapidly dropped to -0.08. A negative premium suggests stronger selling pressure on U.S. platforms compared to international venues, confirming that American investor appetite has not yet returned to levels that would support a continued rally. Expert Analysis on Market Pivot Points Market strategists interpreting this data frame the current juncture as a clear inflection point. The convergence of these negative demand signals creates a high-resolution picture of market sentiment. Experts note that while macroeconomic factors like potential interest rate shifts play a role, the immediate technical and on-chain landscape is dominated by these supply-demand imbalances. The analysis concludes that for bullish momentum to be reignited, the market must achieve a dual milestone: a recovery in the Coinbase Premium to positive territory, indicating net U.S. buying, and a sustained price break above the $90,000 to $92,000 range. Holding support near $84,000 is concurrently viewed as essential to prevent a deeper corrective phase. The Technical and Psychological Hurdle of $90,000 The $90,000 price level has emerged as a significant technical and psychological resistance zone. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced intensified selling pressure at round-number milestones, and $90,000 represents the next major threshold. A decisive break above this level, confirmed by high trading volume and positive demand metrics, would likely trigger a new wave of algorithmic and institutional buying. Conversely, repeated rejections at this price could embolden sellers and prolong the consolidation period. The market’s ability to reclaim this range will serve as a critical test of whether current stagnation is a temporary pause or the precursor to a more pronounced trend change. Historical Context and Comparative Market Phases Current conditions bear resemblance to past market phases where Bitcoin faced similar demand-side challenges. Periods of consolidation following strong rallies are common, often resolving in powerful breakouts once accumulation resumes. The table below contrasts key metrics from the current stall with a previous consolidation phase that preceded a major upward move. Market Phase BTC Real Demand Indicator Coinbase Premium Trend Key Resistance Level Eventual Outcome Current (Q1 2025) Negative (-3,491 BTC) Rapidly Negative (-0.08) $90,000 Pending Q3 2023 Consolidation Fluctuating Near Zero Neutral to Slightly Positive $31,000 Breakout to $45,000 This comparative view highlights the importance of monitoring these indicators for signs of a trend reversal. The more negative current readings suggest a stronger need for a catalyst to shift sentiment. The Role of Macroeconomic Factors and Institutional Behavior Beyond on-chain data, broader financial conditions continue to influence investor behavior. The trajectory of U.S. monetary policy, regulatory clarity for digital asset ETFs, and traditional equity market performance all feed into institutional allocation decisions. A recovery in U.S. demand for Bitcoin may therefore be contingent not just on crypto-specific factors, but on a favorable shift in this wider financial ecosystem. Institutional inflows, often tracked through products like spot Bitcoin ETFs, will be a key variable to watch in the coming weeks for confirmation of renewed American interest. Conclusion The stalled Bitcoin rally presents a clear narrative defined by data. The slowdown in the BTC Real Demand indicator and the negative Coinbase Premium collectively underscore a tangible retreat in U.S. investor participation. For the market to transition from consolidation to its next leg upward, it must successfully navigate two critical challenges: fostering a recovery in stateside demand and achieving a decisive technical breakout above the $90,000 resistance level. The coming weeks will be instrumental in determining whether current support levels hold and if the necessary demand-side catalysts emerge to propel the Bitcoin rally forward into new territory. FAQs Q1: What does a negative BTC Real Demand indicator mean? The indicator turning negative suggests that over the measured period, the amount of Bitcoin being sold or moved out of strong hands (like long-term holders) is exceeding the amount being accumulated by new, genuine demand. It signals a net reduction in solid investor positioning. Q2: Why is U.S. investor demand so important for Bitcoin’s price? U.S. investors, including large institutions, hedge funds, and ETFs, represent one of the largest and most influential pools of capital in the global cryptocurrency market. Their buying or selling activity can disproportionately impact liquidity, price discovery, and overall market sentiment. Q3: What is the Coinbase Premium and what does a negative value indicate? The Coinbase Premium is the difference between Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase (a U.S.-centric exchange) and its price on other global exchanges. A negative premium means Bitcoin is trading at a discount on Coinbase, which typically indicates stronger selling pressure from U.S. investors relative to buyers in other regions. Q4: What would constitute a “decisive break” above $90,000? A decisive break is generally characterized by a price close significantly above the level (e.g., above $92,000) accompanied by high trading volume and a subsequent ability to hold that price as new support. A single, low-volume spike above $90,000 that quickly reverses is not considered decisive. Q5: Are there any positive signs that could offset the current negative demand data? Analysts also watch metrics like exchange reserves (declining reserves can be positive), the health of the derivatives market, and broader adoption trends. A stabilization in the negative demand metrics would be the first positive sign, followed by a return to positive values.

Through the TAS Network Gateway , European banks gain seamless access to high-value payment systems, real-time gross settlement, and cross-border euro transfers. Ripple’s integration lets these banks settle transactions faster, cheaper, and more efficiently, without altering existing banking infrastructure. Well, Europe is advancing toward an interoperable financial ecosystem, with the ECB targeting DLT-based settlement by 2026 to boost cross-border efficiency, transparency, and liquidity. Ripple’s integration with the TAS Network positions it as ready infrastructure to power this next-generation financial architecture from day one. Ripple’s integration goes beyond speed and efficiency, enabling banks to settle transactions on-chain while fully meeting regulatory standards through its built-in compliance tools, critical as regulators demand transparency and auditability for cross-border payments and tokenized assets. Notably, Ripple is reportedly in late-stage preparations for a 2026 IPO, signaling a transformative milestone for both the company and the broader crypto-financial ecosystem. Ripple’s strategic timing positions it ahead of competitors as Europe builds DLT settlement frameworks. Early integration with core banking rails offers institutions a trusted, high-volume-ready blockchain solution. Simultaneously, Ripple is expanding in Asia, exploring XRP-based yield infrastructure and real-world asset tokenization on the XRP Ledger. Ripple’s integration with the TAS Network Gateway positions it as a key bridge between traditional finance and blockchain. With Europe moving toward interoperable DLT settlements by 2026, Ripple offers banks a compliant, scalable, and ready-to-deploy solution, securing its role in the continent’s next-generation financial infrastructure. Conclusion As Europe moves toward DLT-based settlements, Ripple’s early TAS Network Gateway integration positions it as a compliant, reliable bridge between traditional finance and blockchain. More than keeping pace with modernization, Ripple is defining the future of cross-border payments and setting the standard for decentralized banking.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-29 12:14:44

The centralized exchange holds over 71% of stablecoin deposits, leaving other markets behind. Binance remains the biggest holder of stablecoins among all other centralized exchanges. The market now carries over 71% of stablecoin liquidity , creating the biggest concentrated pool in crypto. Exchange stablecoin reserves remain near an all-time high at the end of 2025, reaching around $69B. Binance still holds over $49B out of the total supply of 314B in various stablecoins. The most numerous inflows are for Ethereum and TRON-based coins. Binance’s reserves are around five times higher compared to the liquidity on OKX. Overall, the top three exchanges hold 94% of stablecoin liquidity . The reserves may represent raw buying power for the spot market, but are also partially used for passive income as Binance opens yield programs for specific stablecoins. The leading USDT and USDC tokens had Binance as their most active market. Over the course of 2025, Binance also decreased the supply of FDUSD, from around 2.5B tokens down to 500M. The balance at the end of the year remains near the historical peak, but may signal a shift for the next year. Stablecoins flowed out of exchanges in December Stablecoin reserves on exchanges reached their yearly peak at the end of November, when Binance carried over $51B in stablecoin reserves. In total, $8B in stablecoins left exchanges in the final stretch of 2025. Binance still held near-historical stablecoin reserves, despite the outflow of stablecoins in the final stretch of 2025. | Source: Cryptoquant Bybit saw the biggest outflows, with $2B leaving the exchange, while Binance had $2B in outflows. Despite this, the markets have enough deposits to deploy in the case of a sentiment shift. Binance may become an indicator for buying pressure. The accumulation of stablecoins is still not affecting the market, which is trading with thin holiday volumes and low sentiment metrics. Trading activity also slowed down, while whales slowly accumulated BTC on the spot market. The available buying power, however, is still not reigniting the hype or bringing BTC on the path to new all-time highs. Liquidity flows to derivative markets The overall trend for 2025 is for stablecoins to move from spot to derivative markets. Spot markets briefly revived after the October 10 deleveraging. Despite this, stablecoins are mostly active on derivative trading pairs, with significant outflows from spot markets. Derivative exchanges hold $64B in stablecoins as of December 29, with a peak on November 14 at over $68B. Spot reserves saw the most significant outflows, from $5.7B down to $1.3B on all exchanges, based on Cryptoquant data . Spot buying has also lost some of the retail market, while whales accumulate with exact deposits. While some traders buy the dip, the liquidity on derivative markets is waiting for momentum to set up new positions. Traders remain cautious, as accumulations of both long and short positions get attacked and liquidated. Stablecoin minting is also no longer directly correlated with BTC price recoveries as during previous bull markets. The record number of stablecoins serves other use cases in 2025, and the expanded supply does not guarantee buying. s get attacked and liquidated.

Traders now search for the Next 1000x Crypto before the wider market reacts. These moments usually begin with subtle moves, small discussions, and a feeling that something early is forming. That early focus is now drifting toward APEMARS (APRZ). While large caps reflect momentum already recognized, APEMARS is still in its positioning phase, defined by whitelist access, controlled progression, and a mission structure built for early entry rather than late reaction. It’s the kind of setup traders watch closely before broader exposure begins. The window doesn’t stay open long. In this phase, timing matters more than confirmation, and the Next 1000x Crypto conversations usually start here. APEMARS Names In The top meme coins 2026 Category, With A $0.00001699 to $0.0055 Price Path APEMARS ($APRZ) is starting to appear across early market watchlists as traders look ahead to the top meme coins 2026 category. What draws attention first is its clearly defined price path. A planned Stage 1 entry point at $0.00001699 and a projected listing target of $0.0055 place APEMARS in a range that analysts often associate with early asymmetric setups. This wide gap is why the project continues to surface in conversations focused on timing rather than hype. At this stage, APEMARS is not being discussed as a reactionary trade. It is being observed as an early mission forming before broader exposure. Research-focused platforms such as Best Crypto To Buy Now often monitor structures like this because they tend to develop quietly while the market is still looking elsewhere. That early attention is usually what separates observation from participation. A Mission Built on Structure, Not Noise What keeps APEMARS from blending into the usual meme cycle is its format. The project follows a 23-stage mission inspired by Commander Ape’s symbolic journey to Mars. Each stage represents progression rather than randomness, giving the project a sense of direction that mirrors how early crypto narratives typically mature. Utilities reinforce that structure. The APE Yield Station offers 63% APY staking tied directly to the Mars theme, encouraging longer-term commitment rather than short-term flipping. The Orbital Boost referral system unlocks at $22 and provides 9.34% rewards to both participants, designed to grow the mission organically through the community itself. Together, these elements give APEMARS the balance of story and mechanics that often defines the best meme coins 2026 conversation. Why Traders Keep Running the Numbers Early positioning is where the real interest starts. A simple scenario explains the attention. A $1,500 allocation at the Stage 1 price of $0.00001699 would represent roughly 88 million tokens. If the project later reaches its projected $0.0055 listing level, that position could scale toward the $480,000 range. This kind of math is not a promise, but it explains why traders track setups like APEMARS long before public access begins. These are the situations people usually talk about in hindsight. Not because they were obvious, but because they were available early and ignored until it was too late. How to Join the Whitelist and Lock Your Stage 1 Position If you want to be in the mission early, the whitelist is the cleanest way to position yourself before Stage 1 begins. Go to the official APEMARS website (only trust the main site). Open the whitelist section on the homepage/menu. Enter your email address to register for priority updates. Submit your signup and watch for any confirmation message. Stay ready for whitelist updates, so you can act quickly when Stage 1 access opens at $0.00001699. Bitcoin Holds Its Higher Zone and Keeps Market Mood Steady Bitcoin continues to trade comfortably in the 90 to 92 range, showing a slight upward push that has helped keep overall sentiment constructive. Trading volume has picked up compared to recent sessions, while market capitalization remains firm. For many traders, this kind of stability reduces short-term fear and creates room to start scanning for higher-reward opportunities. When Bitcoin behaves this way, attention often drifts toward emerging narratives, especially projects being discussed within the top meme coins 2026 and best meme coins 2026 conversations. Solana Climbs as ETF Interest and Long Positions Build Solana is also showing strength, hovering around the mid-130 range after posting gains of more than 4 percent. ETF inflows remain consistent, and futures data show rising Open Interest. Funding rates suggest traders are willing to pay a premium to stay long, a sign of confidence rather than hesitation. If Solana manages to push through its next resistance level, that renewed momentum could spill over into early-stage opportunities, with names like APEMARS starting to appear more frequently on traders’ watchlists. Conclusion: Where Positioning Matters More Than Confirmation Bitcoin is providing stability, and Solana is delivering momentum, but APEMARS is drawing attention for a different reason. It sits at the very start of its journey, where positioning still matters more than price movement. This is the phase traders watch closely, because it is where future narratives are formed before the market fully reacts. What makes this moment stand out is access. APEMARS is not competing for attention after momentum has arrived. It is offering early positioning through its whitelist, a narrow window that exists before stages begin advancing and entry levels move higher. Once a stage shifts, it does not reset. Early access is something you either secure or miss. This is why the focus is turning toward the whitelist now. It is the only way to be ready before Stage 1 opens and before wider demand compresses availability. Traders who have seen previous cycles know how these moments usually end. The projects people talk about later are often the ones they watched quietly at the beginning. The door is open, but it does not stay open forever. In this phase, waiting feels safe, but acting early is what creates the real advantage. For More Information: Website: Visit the Official Apemars Website Telegram: Join the Apemars Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow Apemars ON X (Formerly Twitter) FAQs What is meant by the Next 1000x Crypto? The Next 1000x Crypto usually refers to a project that appears very early in its lifecycle, with a wide price range and limited access. Traders look for structured launches, strong narratives, and early positioning signals before wider market exposure begins. Which top meme coins are gaining attention for 2026? Traders are closely watching projects that combine storytelling, utilities, and clear launch structures. APEMARS is increasingly discussed alongside established assets because it is still in its early access phase, while names like Bitcoin and Solana reflect momentum already recognized by the market. Are the best meme coins of 2026 already obvious? Not yet. Historically, many of the best meme coins of 2026 begin forming quietly during early access phases. These projects often appear on watchlists before public stages begin, when participation is limited, and narratives are still developing. What should traders review before joining a crypto whitelist? Most traders check the project structure, token distribution, roadmap clarity, community engagement, and whether utilities exist beyond hype. Whitelists are usually evaluated as positioning tools rather than guarantees, helping traders stay prepared before wider access opens. Why is APEMARS being discussed so early? APEMARS is drawing early attention because of its mission-based structure, symbolic progression, and clearly defined entry framework. Instead of launching into open markets immediately, it introduces a whitelist phase that emphasizes timing and positioning over reaction. Summary Market sentiment is stabilizing as Bitcoin holds its higher range and Solana continues to attract strength through ETF interest and rising long positions. During these conditions, traders often shift focus toward early-stage opportunities that could shape the next cycle. APEMARS is emerging in these discussions as a potential Next 1000x Crypto due to its early access structure, wide projected price range, and mission-driven design. Rather than competing after momentum appears, APEMARS is being monitored during its whitelist phase, where positioning matters more than confirmation. As attention builds around the top meme coins 2026 and best meme coins 2026 categories, traders are increasingly watching how early narratives like APEMARS develop before public stages begin.

The pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025, following the conclusion of the presale. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market rallied during early Asian trading hours as Bitcoin (BTC) briefly crossed the $90,000 mark before dropping to its current level of $89,916. The flagship cryptocurrency is up almost 3% over the past 24 hours, while other tokens, including Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Solana (SOL) traded in positive territory. Husky Inu (HINU) At $0.00024394 Husky Inu AI (HINU) has completed the latest price increase of its pre-launch phase, rising from $0.00024028 to $0.00024300. The price increase is part of the project’s pre-launch phase, which began on April 1, 2025. The pre-launch allows the project to continue its fundraising efforts while empowering its growing community and existing token holders. It also helps the team to secure capital, fund platform improvements, undertake market initiatives, and support broader ecosystem expansion. Husky Inu AI has raised $915,232 so far as fundraising picks up once again. Investors had adopted a wait-and-watch approach, but the recent uptick suggests risk appetite has returned. The project crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached the $850,000 milestone in July and crossed $900,000 in October. However, fundraising has picked up again over the past few days as investor sentiment turns positive. The project’s official launch is on March 27, 2026. However, the team is open to moving the launch to an earlier or later date. The project team will conduct a series of review meetings to determine the project’s launch date. The first two review meetings were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025, while the third is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Cryptocurrency Market Resurgent Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market has rallied to start the last week of 2025 on a bullish note. Markets rallied during early Asian trading hours, and Bitcoin (BTC) briefly crossed $90,000, supported by a broad rally, with some tokens registering double-digit rallies over the past 24 hours. On the other hand, Ethereum (ETH) reclaimed $3,000 early on Monday, reaching an intraday high of $3,048 before moving to its current level. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is up over 3%. Ripple (XRP) is up 1.34% and Solana (SOL) is up almost 3%, trading around $126. Dogecoin (DOGE) is also trading in positive territory at $0.126, while Cardano (ADA) is marginally up at $0.375. Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) are also trading in positive territory. As a result, the cryptocurrency market cap is up over 2%, crossing the $3 trillion mark to $3.04 trillion. 24-hour trading has also registered a substantial jump, rising nearly 62% to $78 billion.

Break Below 100-Week MA Signals Trouble,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-btc-at-risk-break-below-100-week-ma-signals-trouble/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is trading near a key long-term level as it heads into the final days of the year. The asset has shown a small recovery early in the week, but it remains close to a major technical support that has triggered large corrections in past cycles. At press time, Bitcoin is priced at around $86,700 with a 24-hour trading volume of $35 billion. The asset is down by 1% over the last day and almost 4% weekly. It reached a local low of $80,500 on November 21 and has been trading between $84,000 and $90,000 for over a month. BTC Tests Historical Support Level Bitcoin is sitting on the 100-week simple moving average (SMA), a level that has marked the start of every major cycle correction over the past decade. Analyst Chain Mind noted that previous breaks below this line led to drawdowns of 35% to 55%. The most recent example was in 2022, when BTC fell more than 57% after closing below the same level. $BTC IS SITTING RIGHT ON THE 100-WEEK MA LEVEL THAT HAS TRIGGERED EVERY MAJOR CYCLE CORRECTION PREVIOUS BREAKS BELOW THIS BAND LED TO SELLOFFS OF 35–55% BITCOIN COULD RETEST MUCH LOWER LEVELS WE ARE GOING LOWER pic.twitter.com/XImkkTGmDg — 𝗖𝗛𝗔𝗜𝗡 𝗠𝗜𝗡𝗗 (@0xChainMind) December 28, 2025 The chart shows that this moving average has acted as a floor in past bear markets. The current pullback already reflects a 31% decline from the recent peak of around $126,000. A confirmed close below the 100-week SMA would place BTC at risk of repeating earlier patterns, possibly moving toward the $35,000 to $50,000 range. Meanwhile, the slope of the moving average is flattening, which suggests long-term momentum is slowing. Traders are watching the weekly close to see whether Bitcoin can stay above this area or continue lower. On shorter timeframes, BTC is attempting to reclaim the 20-day moving average after 78 days of staying below it. Michaël van de Poppe commented that this could change the short-term pattern, but warned, “Nothing confirmed, as it has been breaking above this 20-Day MA during the previous correction.” Notably, the 20-day moving average remains an important short-term indicator. The price needs to hold above this level through the next few sessions to confirm a trend reversal. Whale Activity and Sentiment Signals Mixed Analyst CW pointed to long positions held by Bitfinex whales, suggesting the early stages of a new cycle may be underway. “The start of Bitfinex whales’ profiting from their $BTC long positions signals the start of a bull market,” the analyst said. However, others are less optimistic. Ali Martinez described the current move as a potential dead-cat bounce, adding that BTC may “ make another leg lower ” before stabilizing. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still below 50, showing that momentum remains weak (per TradingView). Bitcoin opened 2025 at $93,400. It is now down about 5% for the year. With three days left before the yearly candle closes, Lark Davis noted , “ $BTC has never closed a post-halving year candle as red in its history. ” The post Bitcoin (BTC) at Risk?

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $86,982.22 on the Binance USDT perpetual futures market. This price movement represents a notable shift from recent trading ranges and has prompted immediate analysis from traders and institutions worldwide. The decline underscores the inherent volatility within the digital asset space, even for its most established participant. Consequently, market participants are scrutinizing liquidity flows and broader macroeconomic indicators for clues about the trend’s sustainability. Bitcoin Price Action and Immediate Market Context The breach below $87,000 marks a key psychological level for traders. Market data reveals a gradual sell-off accelerated during the Asian trading session. Furthermore, order book analysis shows thinning buy-side liquidity near the $87,000 support zone. This technical breakdown often triggers automated selling from algorithmic trading systems. Meanwhile, trading volume across major spot and derivatives exchanges has increased by approximately 35% compared to the 24-hour average. The heightened activity suggests both panic selling and strategic accumulation may be occurring simultaneously. Historical data indicates that similar rapid declines have frequently presented both risk and opportunity for disciplined investors. Several concurrent factors in traditional finance may be influencing capital flows. For instance, strengthening bond yields and equity market rotations can pressure risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Additionally, on-chain metrics from Glassnode and CryptoQuant show a slight increase in exchange inflows, signaling some holders are moving coins to sell. However, the broader holder cohort, often called ‘long-term holders,’ continues to demonstrate resilience. Their aggregate balance has not shown significant distribution, suggesting the sell pressure may be more tactical than fundamental. Historical Volatility and Cryptocurrency Market Cycles Bitcoin’s history is characterized by pronounced volatility. A comparative analysis provides crucial perspective. For example, during the 2021 bull market, intraday swings of 10-15% were not uncommon. The current pullback, while sharp, remains within established historical norms for the asset class. The following table illustrates key support levels based on recent trading activity and on-chain data: Price Level Significance On-Chain Support Data $85,200 Previous weekly low & 50-day MA proximity 1.2M BTC acquired near this level $83,500 Major volume node and psychological support Strong holder cost basis cluster $80,000 Long-term trend line support Minimal historical resistance Understanding these cycles requires examining liquidity and leverage. The derivatives market, particularly perpetual swaps, often amplifies price moves. Funding rates turned negative prior to the drop, indicating rising short interest. This can create a cascading effect during liquidations. Notably, total open interest declined by $2.8 billion in the hours following the break below $87,000. This deleveraging, while painful for overexposed traders, typically creates a healthier foundation for the next move. Market structure often resets through such volatility events. Expert Analysis on Market Structure and Liquidity Industry analysts emphasize the role of macro liquidity. Marcus Thielen, Head of Research at 10x Research, often notes the correlation between Bitcoin and global liquidity indicators. “Bitcoin acts as a liquidity thermometer,” Thielen stated in a recent report. “Tightening financial conditions, signaled by central bank balance sheet contractions or rising real yields, invariably pressure digital asset valuations.” This framework helps explain price action beyond mere technical charts. Regulatory developments also contribute to sentiment. For instance, clarity or uncertainty from major jurisdictions like the U.S. or the EU can drive institutional capital allocation decisions. The current environment features a mix of both progressive and restrictive regulatory news. Furthermore, the role of large holders, or ‘whales,’ is critical. Blockchain analytics firms track wallets holding over 1,000 BTC. Their net transfer activity to exchanges serves as a leading indicator. Data from the past week showed a neutral-to-slight increase in exchange deposits from these entities. However, it did not reach levels associated with major distribution phases. This suggests the current move may be a healthy correction within a larger trend, rather than a wholesale reversal. Seasoned traders monitor the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) to gauge whether the market is selling at a profit or loss. A reset in SOPR often precedes market stabilization. Broader Impacts on the Crypto Ecosystem A declining Bitcoin price creates ripple effects across the entire digital asset landscape. Major altcoins, which often correlate with BTC, typically experience amplified volatility. For example, Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and other large-cap assets saw declines exceeding Bitcoin’s percentage drop. This correlation highlights Bitcoin’s role as the market’s anchor. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols also feel the impact through two primary channels: Collateral Values: Loans backed by crypto collateral face increased liquidation risks as asset prices fall. Total Value Locked (TVL): The dollar-denominated value of assets staked in DeFi contracts decreases, affecting protocol metrics and yield generation. Meanwhile, mining economics come under pressure. A lower Bitcoin price directly reduces miner revenue in fiat terms, while operational costs (primarily electricity) remain fixed. This squeezes profit margins, potentially forcing less efficient miners offline. The network’s hash rate may see a short-term decline, followed by a difficulty adjustment to restore equilibrium. This built-in economic mechanism showcases Bitcoin’s resilient and self-correcting design. For investors, such periods test risk management frameworks and highlight the importance of portfolio diversification beyond a single asset class. Conclusion The Bitcoin price falling below $87,000 serves as a potent reminder of the digital asset market’s dynamic nature. This movement stems from a confluence of technical breakdowns, shifting macro liquidity, and derivatives market deleveraging. Historical context shows such volatility is intrinsic to Bitcoin’s maturation process. While short-term sentiment may turn cautious, the underlying network fundamentals—security, decentralization, adoption—remain unchanged. For market participants, these periods demand disciplined analysis, separating noise from signal. The evolving regulatory landscape and institutional adoption trends will likely dictate the next major phase for the Bitcoin price . Ultimately, understanding these complex interactions is crucial for navigating the cryptocurrency ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What caused Bitcoin to fall below $87,000? The decline appears driven by a combination of technical selling after breaking a key support level, negative funding rates triggering derivative liquidations, and broader macroeconomic factors like rising bond yields affecting risk assets. Q2: Is this a normal occurrence for Bitcoin? Yes, volatility is a hallmark of Bitcoin’s market behavior. Historical data shows frequent corrections of 10-20% even within strong bullish trends. This move is within the asset’s typical volatility range. Q3: How does this drop affect other cryptocurrencies? Most major cryptocurrencies exhibit high correlation with Bitcoin. Consequently, altcoins like Ethereum and Solana often experience similar or greater percentage declines during such market-wide corrections. Q4: What should investors monitor now? Key metrics include Bitcoin’s ability to hold above the next major support near $85,200, changes in exchange reserve balances (indicating selling or holding), and broader equity market performance as a sentiment indicator. Q5: Could this be the start of a larger bear market? While possible, current on-chain data does not show the massive distribution from long-term holders typical of major cycle tops. The move is currently classified as a correction within the existing market structure until proven otherwise.

Analyzing the Metalpha ETH Deposit to Binance The blockchain intelligence platform The Data Nerd first identified this substantial movement. Consequently, market observers began scrutinizing the transaction’s potential implications. Large transfers from private wallets to centralized exchanges like Binance often precede selling activity. However, they can also signal preparations for other sophisticated financial operations. This specific event involves a prominent Asia-Pacific digital asset manager, adding a layer of institutional significance to the on-chain data. Metalpha Technology Holding Ltd., headquartered in Hong Kong, provides wealth management products tied to digital assets. The firm operates within a regulated framework, serving accredited investors. Therefore, its on-chain activity frequently reflects calculated institutional strategies rather than speculative retail moves. The timing of this deposit coincides with a period of relative stability in Ethereum’s price, following its transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Institutional Crypto Strategy and Exchange Dynamics Understanding why institutions use exchanges like Binance requires examining multiple functions beyond simple selling. These platforms serve as liquidity hubs for: Over-the-counter (OTC) desk facilitation: Large orders are often filled off the public order book to minimize market impact. Collateral management: Assets can be moved to secure lending positions or margin requirements. Staking or yield generation: Exchanges offer services to earn rewards on held cryptocurrencies. Portfolio rebalancing: Institutions routinely adjust asset allocations across different wallets and custodians. For context, the table below shows notable institutional ETH movements to exchanges in recent months, based on public blockchain data: Recent Notable Institutional ETH Exchange Deposits (2025) Entity (Presumed) Date ETH Amount Approx. Value Destination Metalpha-linked Address April 10, 2025 3,500 ETH $10.39M Binance Unknown Whale Wallet March 28, 2025 2,800 ETH $8.1M Coinbase DeFi Protocol Treasury March 15, 2025 5,200 ETH $15.2M Kraken Expert Perspective on Whale Movements Market analysts emphasize the importance of avoiding snap judgments. “A single deposit, even of this size, does not constitute a market signal by itself,” explains a veteran crypto fund manager who requested anonymity due to firm policy. “We must analyze flow patterns, derivative market positioning, and broader macroeconomic conditions. For instance, an institution might deposit ETH to hedge a separate position using exchange-traded derivatives, not necessarily to conduct a spot sale.” This perspective highlights the complex, multi-layered strategies employed by professional asset managers, which often differ from retail investor behavior. The Broader Context of Hong Kong’s Crypto Ecosystem Hong Kong has actively positioned itself as a regulated hub for digital asset innovation. The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) licenses firms like Metalpha to operate virtual asset management platforms. This regulatory environment mandates strict compliance, including anti-money laundering (AML) procedures and investor suitability checks. Consequently, actions by licensed entities are typically deliberate and conform to disclosed business models. Furthermore, the movement occurs as global financial institutions increase their engagement with tokenized assets and blockchain infrastructure. Ethereum’s network, with its smart contract capability, remains a primary foundation for this activity. Strategic asset movements often relate to upcoming product launches, client mandate fulfillments, or responses to shifting yield environments across decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi) venues. Impact on Market Sentiment and Liquidity While the direct market impact of a $10.4 million transfer is limited within Ethereum’s multi-billion dollar daily volume, the psychological effect can be more pronounced. Market sentiment tools and social analytics often detect increased discussion following such reported whale movements. However, seasoned traders monitor exchange inflow metrics from Glassnode and CryptoQuant to distinguish between isolated events and sustained selling pressure trends. Data shows that sustained high exchange inflows over weeks, not single transactions, typically correlate with stronger downward price pressure. Technical and On-Chain Analysis Fundamentals Blockchain analytics firms track wallets through clustering algorithms and publicly available information. The attribution to Metalpha stems from such analysis, though absolute certainty is impossible without a public statement from the firm. The transparency of the Ethereum ledger allows anyone to verify the transaction hash, amount, and timestamp. This public verifiability is a cornerstone of trust in the crypto asset class. Key on-chain metrics analysts reviewed following this deposit include: Exchange Netflow: The overall balance of assets moving to and from exchanges. Mean Dollar Invested Age: Gauges whether older, dormant coins are moving. Derivatives Funding Rates: Indicates sentiment in perpetual swap markets. Initial data following the Metalpha-linked transfer did not show a significant spike in overall ETH exchange netflow, suggesting this was an isolated institutional action rather than part of a broader market-wide exodus. Conclusion The deposit of 3,500 ETH to Binance by a Metalpha-linked address represents a notable but not anomalous event in the institutional digital asset landscape. It underscores the active management strategies employed by regulated firms within evolving regulatory frameworks like Hong Kong’s. While exchange deposits can indicate selling intent, they equally facilitate a range of complex financial operations essential for institutional participation. For market observers, the crucial lesson is to interpret single transactions within the wider context of sustained on-chain trends, derivative market data, and global macroeconomic indicators. The Metalpha ETH movement highlights the mature, multifaceted nature of cryptocurrency markets as they integrate further with traditional finance in 2025. FAQs Q1: What does a large ETH deposit to an exchange usually mean? While often associated with potential selling, large deposits can also indicate preparations for OTC trades, collateral posting for loans, staking, or portfolio rebalancing by institutional managers. Q2: How do analysts link a wallet address to a company like Metalpha? Analysts use clustering algorithms, examining transaction patterns with known entity addresses, public disclosures, and regulatory filings. However, attribution is often labeled as “presumed” or “linked” unless officially confirmed. Q3: Is a $10.4 million ETH transfer significant for the market? In direct trading terms, it is a fraction of Ethereum’s daily volume. Its primary significance lies in signaling institutional activity and potential strategy shifts, which can influence broader market sentiment. Q4: What is Metalpha’s role in the cryptocurrency industry? Metalpha is a Hong Kong-licensed digital asset manager that provides structured wealth management products and advisory services primarily to accredited investors, operating within the SFC’s regulatory framework. Q5: Why is the location (Hong Kong) relevant to this news? Hong Kong has established a clear regulatory regime for virtual asset service providers. Actions by licensed firms there are viewed as part of a formal, compliant financial ecosystem, differing from unregulated entities in other jurisdictions.

56545134,https://bitzo.com/2025/12/how-to-get-instant-stablecoin-liquidity-from-your-multi-collateral-portfolio-on-clapp,1767011415,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/56545134.jpeg,How to Get Instant Stablecoin Liquidity from Your Multi-Collateral Portfolio on Clapp,https://bitzo.com/2025/12/how-to-get-instant-stablecoin-liquidity-from-your-multi-collateral-portfolio-on-clapp,"For many crypto holders, the challenge is not access to assets but access to liquidity. Portfolios are often spread across BTC, ETH, SOL, and stablecoins, yet converting those holdings into spendable capital usually means selling, rebalancing, or triggering tax events. Instead of forcing users to unwind positions, Clapp allows them to unlock instant stablecoin liquidity directly from a multi-collateral portfolio, while keeping assets intact. From Isolated Assets to a Unified Credit Line Most lending platforms treat collateral in isolation. You deposit one asset, receive a loan against it, and manage risk separately for each position. Clapp uses a multi-collateral crypto credit line model. Users can combine up to 19 assets—including BTC, ETH, SOL, and stablecoins—into a single collateral pool. This pool backs one unified credit line rather than multiple fragmented loans. The practical result is efficiency. Instead of deciding which asset to sell or borrow against, the portfolio works as a whole to provide liquidity. How Instant Stablecoin Liquidity Works Once collateral is deposited, Clapp assigns a credit limit based on the combined value and risk profile of the assets. From that point, users can draw stablecoins instantly from their available credit. There is no waiting period, no loan approval cycle, and no requirement to borrow the full amount at once. Liquidity is available on demand, directly from the Clapp Wallet . Interest accrues only on the amount actually withdrawn. Any unused portion of the credit line carries 0% APR, meaning users are not charged for liquidity they are not using. Why Multi-Collateral Matters for Liquidity Crypto portfolios are rarely static. Assets move differently, correlations change, and volatility rarely affects everything at the same time. By combining multiple assets into one collateral pool, Clapp smooths risk at the portfolio level. Sharp moves in one asset are less likely to immediately push the entire position toward higher risk, compared to single-asset collateral models. This structure can also improve capital efficiency. Stablecoins within the portfolio contribute collateral value without adding volatility, while higher-liquidity assets like BTC and ETH anchor borrowing power. LTV, Risk, and Control Stablecoin liquidity on Clapp is governed by Loan-to-Value (LTV), calculated in real time based on the drawn balance and current collateral value. As users draw stablecoins, LTV increases. As collateral values rise or balances are repaid, LTV decreases. Rates are tied to LTV, so borrowing costs reflect current risk rather than fixed assumptions. Clapp continuously monitors LTV and sends advance notifications as positions approach higher-risk levels. This gives users time to act—by adding collateral or repaying part of the balance—before liquidation becomes a concern. Using Stablecoin Liquidity in Practice Instant stablecoin access is not only about emergencies. It supports a range of practical use cases. Some users rely on stablecoins for everyday spending or operational costs while holding crypto long term. Others use liquidity to manage cash flow, rebalance portfolios, or respond quickly to market opportunities without selling core assets. Because repaid amounts immediately restore available credit, liquidity can be reused repeatedly without reopening loans or resetting positions. Why Clapp’s Model Fits Active Portfolios The combination of multi-collateral support, usage-based interest, and real-time risk tracking reflects how modern crypto portfolios are managed. Instead of locking users into static loans, Clapp treats liquidity as a flexible layer that sits on top of existing holdings. Assets remain in place, exposure stays intact, and borrowing adjusts dynamically to actual needs. This model favors control over optimization and access over commitment. Final Thoughts Stablecoin liquidity does not have to come at the cost of selling assets or restructuring portfolios. With a multi-collateral credit line, liquidity becomes an extension of portfolio management rather than a disruptive event. Clapp’s approach—pooling assets, charging interest only on used capital, and managing risk dynamically—offers a practical way to unlock stablecoins while keeping long-term strategies intact. For users holding diversified crypto portfolios, this structure turns idle assets into accessible liquidity without forcing difficult trade-offs.

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/70-of-xrp-holders-just-got-reality-check-heres-the-latest/,"With only days remaining in 2025, BullRunners founder Nick Anderson has delivered an assessment of the current market sentiment, particularly for XRP. Rather than reinforcing expectations of a late-year surge, Anderson highlighted emerging data that suggests many investors are bracing for a restrained close to the year. His remarks present a shift away from optimism toward a more measured outlook, grounded in recent polling and certain developments across the digital asset space. 70% of #XRP Holders Just Got Reality Check? pic.twitter.com/xoqGjE87yN — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) December 27, 2025 Gemini Poll Points to Subdued Outlook At the center of Anderson’s analysis is a new poll conducted on Gemini’s prediction platform. According to the results he highlighted, roughly 70% of participants now expect XRP to remain below $2 as the new year approaches. With XRP trading near $1.88 at the time of his comments, the poll reflects growing acceptance that a decisive breakout may not materialize before year-end. Anderson framed this as a “reality check” for holders who had anticipated a strong late rally. The data suggests that expectations have cooled over recent weeks, moving from hopes of acceleration to acceptance of continued consolidation. He noted that XRP has been confined to a narrow range, oscillating between the mid-$1.80s and the $2 level, a pattern reinforced by lighter holiday trading volumes and limited fresh catalysts. DeFi Tensions Add to Market Uncertainty Beyond XRP itself, Anderson pointed to turbulence within decentralized finance as another factor shaping sentiment. He referenced governance tensions surrounding Aave, where questions have emerged about founder involvement in token purchases during a critical vote over control of key brand assets. While denials have been issued, the episode underscores ongoing concerns about alignment between development teams and token holders in major protocols. He also drew attention to a brief de-pegging event involving USX, a stablecoin on Solana, which reportedly slipped to around $0.80 before recovering close to parity after liquidity support was injected. Although the issuer maintained that the token remained fully backed, Anderson emphasized that even overcollateralized assets can experience stress when liquidity thins, particularly during quieter market periods. Implications for XRP Holders Taken together, these developments reinforce a more cautious mood across the market. For XRP holders , the Gemini poll serves as a signal that many participants are preparing for stability rather than expansion in the immediate term. Anderson suggested that in the absence of new inflows or decisive positive news, conservative expectations could shape trading behavior into the new year.

While it can suppress momentum, it also leaves room for sharper moves should buying pressure return unexpectedly. A Market Defined by Prudence Anderson’s message ultimately centers on preparation rather than prediction. By highlighting restrained expectations for XRP alongside structural risks within DeFi, he portrayed a market entering 2026 with caution. For investors, his assessment implies that navigating the months ahead may depend less on anticipation of rapid gains and more on close attention to sentiment, liquidity, and governance signals shaping the crypto market.

BitMine’s BMNR stock has become the 66th most traded equity in the United States, with an average daily volume of $1.7 billion over the past five days, ranking just behind Wells Fargo and ahead of Chevron. The aggressive staking activity follows a period of sustained accumulation that saw BitMine add 98,852 ETH in the past week alone, surpassing the 4 million ETH threshold just 5.5 months after initiating its strategy. As covered by Cryptonews recently , DeFi analyst Abdul noted that roughly 70% of the 5% of Ethereum supply that changed hands since July was absorbed by BitMine, offsetting a large September unstaking event by staking provider Kiln following an exploit involving SwissBorg. Institutional Outlook Points to Tenfold TVL Growth Joseph Chalom, co-CEO of Sharplink Gaming, the second-largest public Ethereum treasury company with 797,704 ETH, forecast that Ethereum’s total value locked could rise tenfold in 2026 as stablecoin issuance targets $500 billion and tokenized real-world assets reach $300 billion. Chalom predicted that sovereign wealth funds would increase their Ethereum holdings and tokenization exposure by 5 to 10 times over the next year, driven by competitive pressure among large allocators as remaining sidelined becomes less viable. “ With more than half of all stablecoin activity currently taking place on Ethereum, sustained issuance and transaction growth could materially lift the network’s TVL ,” he said. Ethereum’s TVL currently stands at around $68.2 billion according to DeFiLlama, while the token trades near $3,000 after climbing roughly 6% over the past month. On the technical level, Analyst Ted Pillows noted that a daily close above $3,000 could push Ethereum toward the $3,200-$3,400 range, while a failure to reclaim this zone would reverse the entire pump. $ETH has broken above the $3,000 level today.

This unprecedented spread reveals deep uncertainty about Bitcoin’s future trajectory as institutional adoption clashes with macroeconomic pressures. According to recent compilations by industry analysts, the digital asset’s path forward remains one of the most debated topics in global finance. Bitcoin 2026 Forecast: The Bullish Consensus Institutional analysts present compelling arguments for Bitcoin’s continued ascent. Tom Lee, Chairman of Fundstrat, leads the optimistic projections with a $200,000 to $250,000 target range. He cites accelerating institutional investment and sustained ETF inflows as primary drivers. Similarly, JPMorgan’s volatility-adjusted Bitcoin-to-gold valuation framework suggests a $170,000 upper limit, while Standard Chartered maintains a revised $150,000 forecast despite recent market adjustments. Wall Street investment bank Bernstein echoes this sentiment with its own $150,000 target, explicitly stating that current market corrections don’t signal the bull market’s conclusion. Catherine Dowling, CEO of Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company, supports this outlook with matching projections. These institutional voices collectively point toward significant capital rotation into digital assets throughout 2025 and 2026. Institutional Adoption Metrics Several quantitative factors support bullish predictions. Grayscale anticipates new all-time highs within the first half of 2026, while Citigroup projects $143,000 based on adoption curves. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, provides a nuanced range between $124,000 and $200,000, acknowledging both potential and limitations. The consensus among these experts suggests Bitcoin’s maturation as an asset class will drive substantial valuation increases. Bearish Outlooks and Market Corrections Conversely, cautious analysts warn of significant downside risks. CryptoQuant suggests potential declines to $56,000, citing measurable slowdowns in Bitcoin demand. The firm’s data indicates possible early entry into a bear market phase. Prominent trader Peter Brandt presents an even starker scenario, forecasting $25,000 levels based on technical analysis of Bitcoin’s parabolic growth structure. Mike McGlone, Senior Macro Strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, delivers the most dramatic warning with potential drops to $10,000. His analysis considers broader macroeconomic factors including interest rate environments and regulatory developments. These bearish perspectives highlight the cryptocurrency’s vulnerability to external economic pressures and changing investor sentiment. Consolidation and Sideways Movement Some institutions predict neither dramatic gains nor losses. British investment bank Barclays expects sideways movement or weakness throughout 2026 as markets digest previous volatility. Investment management firm VanEck shares this outlook, anticipating consolidation periods without sharp directional moves. This middle-ground perspective suggests Bitcoin may enter a maturation phase with reduced volatility. Bitcoin 2026 Price Forecast Comparison Source Prediction Rationale Fundstrat (Tom Lee) $200K-$250K Institutional investment & ETF inflows JPMorgan $170K Volatility-adjusted Bitcoin-to-gold framework Standard Chartered $150K Revised from previous $300K estimate CryptoQuant $56K Demand slowdown & potential bear market Peter Brandt $25K Parabolic structure collapse Bloomberg Intelligence $10K Macroeconomic pressures Market Dynamics and Influencing Factors Several key factors will determine Bitcoin’s actual trajectory. Regulatory developments across major economies will significantly impact institutional participation. Additionally, macroeconomic conditions including inflation rates and monetary policies will influence capital flows. Technological advancements in blockchain infrastructure and adoption metrics will also play crucial roles. The ETF landscape continues evolving with increasing product diversity and accessibility. Market liquidity conditions and trading volume patterns provide important indicators. Furthermore, geopolitical events and energy market dynamics affect mining economics and network security. These interconnected elements create complex valuation challenges for analysts. Historical Context and Pattern Analysis Bitcoin’s historical cycles show consistent patterns of boom and consolidation. Previous bull markets typically followed halving events by approximately 18 months. The 2024 halving suggests potential peak periods in late 2025 or early 2026. However, increasing institutional participation may alter traditional cycle dynamics, creating new valuation models and prediction methodologies. Expert Methodologies and Analytical Frameworks Different analysts employ distinct methodologies for their Bitcoin 2026 forecasts. Quantitative models incorporate network metrics including active addresses and transaction volumes. Fundamental analysis examines adoption rates across institutions and retail investors. Technical analysts study chart patterns and historical support/resistance levels. Macroeconomic models integrate traditional financial indicators with cryptocurrency-specific data. Some firms develop proprietary valuation frameworks comparing Bitcoin to gold or other store-of-value assets. These diverse approaches explain the wide prediction range, as each methodology weighs different factors and assumptions. Risk Factors and Uncertainty Variables Multiple uncertainty variables affect prediction accuracy. Regulatory clarity remains incomplete across major jurisdictions. Technological risks include potential security vulnerabilities or scalability challenges. Market structure evolution could introduce new volatility mechanisms. Additionally, macroeconomic shocks or black swan events could dramatically alter trajectories. Adoption curve acceleration or deceleration presents another significant variable. Competition from alternative cryptocurrencies and traditional assets influences capital allocation decisions. Environmental concerns and energy debates continue affecting public perception and institutional policies. These factors collectively create substantial forecast uncertainty. Conclusion The Bitcoin 2026 forecast spectrum reveals fundamental disagreements about cryptocurrency’s future role. Bullish predictions emphasize institutional adoption and store-of-value characteristics, while bearish outlooks focus on macroeconomic pressures and technical vulnerabilities. This divergence reflects Bitcoin’s complex position between traditional finance and emerging technology. Investors should consider multiple scenarios when evaluating these predictions, recognizing that cryptocurrency markets remain influenced by both measurable metrics and unpredictable human behavior. The actual Bitcoin 2026 price will likely emerge from interactions between technological adoption, regulatory frameworks, and global economic conditions. FAQs Q1: What drives the huge range in Bitcoin 2026 forecasts? Different analytical methodologies and varying assumptions about adoption rates, regulatory environments, and macroeconomic conditions create this wide prediction range. Institutional models emphasize different factors than technical or fundamental approaches. Q2: Which Bitcoin 2026 forecast has the strongest institutional support? The $150,000 range receives support from multiple major institutions including Standard Chartered, Bernstein, and Citigroup. This consensus suggests many analysts see significant but moderated growth potential. Q3: How do Bitcoin ETFs affect 2026 predictions? Most bullish forecasts cite ETF inflows as major price drivers, while bearish predictions question whether ETF demand can sustain current levels. ETF adoption rates significantly influence institutional participation projections. Q4: What historical patterns inform Bitcoin 2026 forecasts? Analysts study previous halving cycles, adoption curves, and volatility patterns. However, increasing institutional participation may alter historical dynamics, creating uncertainty about pattern repetition. Q5: Should retail investors rely on these Bitcoin 2026 forecasts? Professional forecasts provide valuable perspectives but shouldn’t replace personal research and risk assessment. The extreme prediction range highlights substantial uncertainty, suggesting diversified approaches and careful risk management.

56545980,https://cryptonews.com/?p=468353,1767012947,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/56545980.jpeg,BitMine Locks $1B ETH in 48 Hours: Is a Supply Squeeze Imminent?,https://cryptonews.com/news/bitmine-1b-eth-staking-supply-squeeze/,"BitMine Immersion Technologies has moved more than $1 billion worth of Ether into staking contracts in less than 48 hours, a move that is drawing fresh attention to how corporate staking activity is tightening Ethereum’s available supply. Blockchain data tracked by Lookonchain shows the company staked 342,560 ETH in the two days leading up to Sunday, making it one of the largest short-term staking inflows recorded this year. Ethereum’s Staking Queue Swells as Locked ETH Outpaces Exits Staking involves locking Ether into Ethereum’s proof-of-stake system to help secure the network in return for a yield that typically ranges between 3% and 5% annually, depending on network conditions. Once staked, the ETH cannot be sold immediately and must pass through a validator exit queue before it becomes liquid again. BitMine’s latest move was reflected almost immediately in Ethereum’s validator queues. Validator data shows that the entry queue has stretched to 12 days and 20 hours, with about 739,824 ETH waiting to be staked. Source: validatorqueue.com By contrast, the exit queue stood at six days and two hours, representing roughly 349,867 ETH scheduled for withdrawal. It marked the first time in months that the number of validators lining up to stake Ether was nearly double those preparing to exit, a pattern often associated with longer-term positioning rather than short-term liquidity needs. Locked ETH Is Quietly Changing Market Dynamics This imbalance matters because it points to a potential supply squeeze. A supply squeeze occurs when demand for an asset grows while the amount available for trading shrinks. In Ethereum’s case, staking removes ETH from the liquid market by locking it into smart contracts. With fewer coins available on exchanges, even modest demand can have an outsized impact on price movements, especially during periods of thinner liquidity. Ethereum already operates in a tighter supply environment than in previous cycles. Roughly 35.8 million ETH, about 28.88% of the total supply, is currently staked, according to late December estimates. Source: Dune data New issuance has also slowed since the network’s transition to proof of stake , and the EIP-1559 fee mechanism continues to burn a portion of transaction fees, occasionally pushing net issuance into negative territory during high activity periods. Together, these factors mean staking does not just delay selling but can structurally reduce the amount of Ether circulating in the market. As ETH Trades Below $3K, BitMine Keeps Buying BitMine’s aggressive accumulation adds another layer to that dynamic. The NYSE American-listed company has positioned Ethereum as its primary treasury asset. Data from StrategicEthReserve.xyz shows BitMine now controls about 4.07 million ETH, worth roughly $12.15 billion, representing around 3.36% of the total supply. The company has publicly stated a long-term target of reaching a 5% stake. Source: StrategicEthReserve.xyz Recent on-chain data supports that strategy, as in December alone, trackers flagged multiple large inflows, including roughly 29,462 ETH moved from BitGo and Kraken wallets , valued at about $88 million at the time. Tom Lee’s BitMine bought about $88M of Ether from BitGo and Kraken as ETH traded near $2,978, lifting its holdings to roughly 4.07M ETH, or about 3.36% of total supply. #BitMine #Ether https://t.co/DxIA5gzf1K — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 23, 2025 Earlier disclosures showed BitMine bought more than $229 million worth of ETH in a single week and over 407,000 ETH in the past 30 days, even as Ether traded nearly 40% below its cycle peak. Notably, other major corporate holders are also staking most of their Ether. SharpLink Gaming, the second-largest corporate holder, has said it staked nearly all of its ETH and generated 9,701 ETH in rewards, worth about $29 million. Source: Sharplink.com The Ether Machine, the third-largest holder, has fully staked its $1.49 billion treasury and reported consistent placement among the top tier of validators by reward efficiency. These moves come as Ether continues to trade below $3,000, hovering near $2,978 this week after a modest monthly rebound.

CEO Issues Warning,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/could-bitcoin-replay-silvers-rally-backward-ceo-issues-warning/,"Peter Schiff has warned that Bitcoin could suffer the opposite fate of silver after the metal posted a sudden, sharp rise. Based on reports, traders and analysts are debating whether the move in silver marks a broad shift back to real assets or a brief, crowded trade that may unwind quickly. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rules The Decade: Outshines Gold And Silver, Analyst Says Silver’s Rapid Climb According to trading data, silver jumped more than 10% in a single session and rose from about $78 to $79 in roughly ninety minutes. Spot silver climbed 18% last week to close at a record $79.31 on thin post-Christmas volume and its new status as a strategic metal. Reports have disclosed that this rally is being driven by a supply deficit and Washington’s decision to classify silver as a critical mineral, not by geopolitics or hopes for US rate cuts. A TradingView chart showed a near-vertical breakout, and a monthly RSI reading reached its highest level in 45 years, a sign of extreme momentum. What is happening with silver may soon be happening with Bitcoin, only in reverse. But since markets tend to melt down faster than they melt up, the time frame for the move should be condensed. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 27, 2025 Tokenized Commodities And Market Value Tokenized versions of metal assets have also gained ground. Based on reports, these crypto-linked commodity tokens are approaching a $4 billion overall valuation, reflecting growing investor curiosity. CompaniesMarketCap data showed silver’s market value closing the gap with NVIDIA, a comparison that highlights heavy institutional demand for metal exposure. Still, tokenized assets remain small compared with spot markets and big ETFs, which means the shift is visible but not yet broad-based. Silver Vs. Bitcoin Bitcoin traded near $87,000 with little movement over the same period, according to CoinMarketCap snapshots, and some market charts show Bitcoin losing relative ground to silver since 2017. A silver-to-Bitcoin valuation model places Bitcoin’s trend value near $394,000, a figure that prompts debate among traders about where each market could go next. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF’s strong inflows in 2025 point to steady institutional accumulation in crypto, while other indicators suggest Bitcoin’s gains can stall without fresh catalysts. Spot Silver Surge Spot silver’s strong weekly gain has left technicians and strategists split. Some say the move reflects a true supply-demand mismatch reinforced by the US critical mineral designation, which has encouraged long-term buying. Others point to the thin volume after the holidays as a factor that magnified price moves. A closing price reversal top pattern at record highs has been flagged by chart watchers, signaling that a correction could follow after such rapid ascent. These signs, combined with extreme RSI readings, raise questions about the sustainability of the current breakout.

Peter Schiff argued that declines often accelerate under pressure, and that idea matters because crowded positions can be unwound in a short span. At the same time, long-term flows into Bitcoin-related ETFs and institutional products should not be ignored; they can support higher prices over time. What traders watch next will be trade volumes, whether silver holds above current levels, and whether Bitcoin regains momentum in the face of metal strength.

This significant change in its history is not happening without turmoil. Political unrest, caused in part by price spikes and tax hikes, is marking the new beginning which, to some Bulgarians, looks like an end. What’s happening in Bulgaria? Mass protests this winter, the largest in many years, mainly over corruption and a planned increase in social security and tax payments, but also against stinging inflation, brought Bulgaria’s government down this month, which is likely to result in another political stalemate. The coalition cabinet of Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov resigned, with the leading political force behind it, the center-right and conservative Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) party, led by former Premier Boyko Borisov, unwilling to be the target of public discontent. With protestors clashing with police on the streets of the capital Sofia, GERB wasn’t ready to hold long enough to reap the political benefits of bringing the country into the Eurozone, the fulfillment of many campaign promises. Bulgaria is now preparing for its eighth election in five years. None of the previous votes produced meaningful stability. Will the first “euro” one do it? The Bulgarian society has repeatedly risen against the oligarchic model the country is run by, best personified by the leader of the DPS – New Beginning coalition, Delyan Peevski, although he is not the only figure of this kind. The latter was formed after a split in the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS), the party representing mainly the interests of the Turkish minority, following a leadership dispute. So far, Bulgarian citizens have been unable to curb the power of the oligarchs whose reign is at least partially sustained by the distribution of European funds. The latest protests initially united opposing segments of the political spectrum – euro believers and euro skeptics, pro-Western liberals and pro-Russian nationalists. Earlier this year, Bulgarian President Rumen Radev submitted a request for a referendum to the National Assembly, mainly on the timing of the Eurozone accession, citing the lack of consensus in the society as well as proper preparation on the part of the government for the adoption of the euro in 2026. The move was backed by the pro-Russian “Revival” party and other populist formations on the right. However, it was turned down by the Speaker of the Bulgarian parliament, Nataliya Kiselova, as unconstitutional, a position backed by members of the ruling majority, including the Bulgarian Socialist Party, as well as the opposition and pro-European liberal PP-DB alliance. Brussels says the euro will benefit Bulgaria The Eurozone membership is mandated by Bulgaria’s Treaty on the Accession to the European Union and, despite the latest jolts, the country will become the 21st nation, out of 27 EU member states, to adopt the bloc’s common currency on January 1. Successive Bulgarian governments have pushed to join the club, and supporters insist this will “boost the economy, reinforce ties to the West and protect against Russia’s influence,” Euractiv noted in a report on Sunday. It recalled some of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s statements made when the executive body concluded Bulgaria was ready for it. “The euro is a tangible symbol of European strength and unity,” she stated at the time, insisting that joining the euro area would strengthen Bulgaria’s economy by deepening ties with Eurozone partners, attracting foreign investment, providing access to finance, creating jobs, and supporting real incomes. Graphic designs for the Bulgarian national side of euro coins. Source: Evroto.bg But is this how Bulgarians view it? According to a recent poll conducted by Eurobarometer, almost half of Bulgarian citizens, 49% to be exact, oppose the adoption of the euro, for various reasons. A few of them were highlighted in a report by Politico before the weekend. The opinions expressed by ordinary Bulgarians interviewed by the publication represent a mix of fears and hopes. Proponents view the accession to the Eurozone as a logical next move for Bulgaria, whose currency is already pegged to the euro anyway. Among the positives they list are new opportunities for easier travel, more business, economic growth, and deeper political and cultural integration with Europe. 20-year-old Natali Ilieva, a student of political science was quoted as stating: “I see it as a step forward … Joining the Eurozone will help the economy grow and position Bulgaria more firmly within Europe. For ordinary people, it will make things easier, especially when traveling, since we’ll be using the same currency.” Opponents are worried about turbulent times ahead, rising living costs due to high inflation and widespread speculation. They often refer to the not so good experiences of other Eastern European nations who joined the Eurozone earlier. Croatia, Slovakia, and Greece all saw prices increase significantly after adopting the euro. Many Bulgarians also expect their economy to be burdened by the trillions of debt accumulated in the Eurozone. Their feelings were best summarized by Petya Spasova, a 55-year-old doctor in the capital city, who is simply unsure this is the right moment to join. Citing political instability in the country and the serious challenges facing the euro itself, she commented: “I remember years ago when I actually hoped Bulgaria would enter the Eurozone. But that was a different Europe. Now things are deteriorating. The spirit of a united Europe is gone. I don’t want to be part of this Europe.” “If you ask me, the Eurozone is on the verge of collapse, and now we have decided to join? I don’t think it’s a good idea,” chimed in Yana Tankovska, 47, a jewelry artist from Sofia. “There isn’t a single person who isn’t complaining about rising costs,” she stressed. Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), predicted earlier that the euro would have a “modest” impact on prices, giving earlier transitions as an example. She claimed the uptick was in the range between 0.2 and 0.4 percentage points. However, in the run-up to its euro accession, Bulgarians saw real estate prices double in a couple of years. According to the National Statistical Institute, annual inflation stood at 5.2% in November, but for most consumers in the country, it feels more like 50%. The official rate of increase in food prices is double that of the Eurozone average. The Bulgarian authorities have tried but not really managed to tame it. The ruling elite and mainstream media have been trying to convince the public that this is largely due to perceived or “personal” inflation that depends on what items are added to the basket. A reporter from a major national TV channel recently talked about having “my inflation,” “your inflation” and “average inflation.” To better express what she meant, she put it this way: “Cooking oil went up 100% … but I, for example, don’t use oil at all.” Speaking to an anchor, she went on: “You have kids, I don’t. If diapers jump by 30%, that will be a serious item in your expenses, I suspect, but I won’t feel it.” And she is right. Diapers are not everyone’s concern as after more than 30 years of EU integration, Bulgaria has one of the lowest birth rates. Its population is among the oldest in the world, after losing nearly 3 million people due to low fertility, emigration and shorter life expectancy. Many in the country would still like to see these indicators change for the better, hopefully with the euro. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-ledger-is-becoming-a-regulated-backbone-heres-the-latest/,"Some of the most important shifts in financial markets happen quietly, long before price action reflects the change. Instead of explosive rallies, early transitions are marked by infrastructure build-out, regulatory alignment, and rising utility. Within the digital asset space, that pattern is increasingly evident on the XRP Ledger , where foundational metrics are evolving in ways that suggest long-term institutional positioning rather than short-term speculation. That perspective was recently emphasized by X Finance Bull, who highlighted emerging data pointing to XRPL’s growing role as a regulated infrastructure for tokenized finance. His commentary draws attention to on-chain growth trends that, while not yet mirrored in price, reflect structural progress beneath the surface. BOOM! $XRP Ledger is becoming a regulated backbone for tokenizing real-world assets, not a trend, a transition. RWA value up +17%, stablecoin cap +29.5%, all built on XRP rails. Quiet metrics with loud implications. This is what institutional-grade infrastructure looks… https://t.co/XKKT8T7dYl pic.twitter.com/VA9flBdEb5 — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) December 28, 2025 Tokenized Real-World Assets Continue to Expand One of the clearest signals of XRPL’s maturation is the growth in real-world asset tokenization. According to data referenced by X Finance Bull, the value of RWAs built on XRP Ledger rails has increased by approximately 17%. This expansion underscores rising interest in compliant asset issuance, where reliability, predictability, and regulatory compatibility are essential. Financial institutions exploring tokenized bonds, funds, and other off-chain assets require networks that can support issuance controls and transparent settlement. XRPL’s native issued-asset framework, combined with deterministic finality and low transaction costs, makes it a practical foundation for these use cases. Stablecoin Growth Strengthens Settlement Utility Stablecoins remain a core component of on-chain finance, acting as settlement instruments and liquidity bridges. Data cited by X Finance Bull indicates that stablecoin capitalization connected to XRP Ledger activity has grown by roughly 29.5%, reinforcing the view that transactional demand is increasing. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This growth suggests that XRPL is being used not just for experimentation, but for real economic activity. As regulators increasingly focus on stablecoin oversight, networks that already support issuer controls and compliance features may gain an advantage in institutional adoption. Institutional-Grade Infrastructure Takes Time A key theme in the analysis is the timing disconnect between infrastructure development and market valuation . In utility-driven ecosystems, price is often the final variable to respond to. Builders and institutions tend to move early, laying foundations during periods of low sentiment and limited attention. This dynamic helps explain why development momentum on XRPL remains strong even as investors express fatigue. Regulated finance needs infrastructure built for long-term integration into existing systems, not immediate hype cycles. Why Markets Often Underestimate Early Transitions Markets frequently discount slow, methodical progress until adoption becomes impossible to ignore. As X Finance Bull noted, conviction is often tested before it is rewarded. In such phases, price lags while data quietly confirms growing relevance. If trends in RWA tokenization and stablecoin usage continue, XRP Ledger’s evolution into a regulated backbone for digital finance may become increasingly visible. For now, the implications are clearer in the metrics than on the chart, but history suggests that this gap rarely remains permanent.

Sandeep Malhotra, Mastercard EVP for Core Payments in Asia Pacific, said, “A big change in commerce happened when payments left stores and went online. Now payments are becoming intelligent.” He added that:- “We went from cash to digital, and now from digital to intelligent .” AI agent s co mplete shopping and payments inside chat Reportedly, agentic commerce will also change how prices get discovered, since agent s sc an everything at once. One early use case is travel. A user can ask an AI agent to find the cheapest overnight flight from Singapore to Tokyo under $500 with no stops. The agent searches, shows options, books the seat, and pays using stored credentials. Malhotra said users could also let agents buy items while they are offline, such as snapping up a product once the price hits a set limit. Visa and Mastercard execs say these systems will run on AI platform s pe ople already use, like ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, plus bank apps and merchant bots. Large retailers are not waiting around. Some fear losing direct customer access and pricing power. Amazon started testing “Buy For Me” this year while blocking outside AI agents from crawling its site. Merchants are testing their own bots to stay in the loop. Visa and Mastercard have launched pilot frameworks to secure bot-led payments with selected users and merchants. T.R. Ramachandran, Visa APAC Head of Products and Solutions, allegedly said that commercial use of secure, personalized agent payments could start as early as the first quarter of 2026. Data backs that up. A December Visa survey foun d ne arly half of U.S. shoppers now use AI to help shop, from gift searches to price checks. Adobe data showe d AI -driven retail traffic in the U.S. jumped 4,700% in July from a year earlier. Payment companies are also creating agentic tokens that cryptographically prove which bots are allowed to act for humans. In October, Cryptopolitan reported that Visa had launched its Trusted Agent Protocol with Cloudflare to authenticate bot-started transactions. Ramachandran said Visa will also add payment signals for banks, giving more detail and using behavior data to confirm agents. Liability is another issue. AI can buy the wrong item or book the wrong date. Today, disputes involve four parties. Ramachandran said a fifth has entered the chain. “AI platforms are now part of the value chain because customers want them there,” he said. “You have to assume mistakes will happen and put protection around that.” Payment executives say merchants will need agent verification, their own bots to talk to consumer agents, new loyalty tools, and different upsell plans. Malhotra said , “Consumers will get better access to information, goods, and services.” Ramachandran said adoption is coming fast. “Based on platform adoption, we are talking months, not years.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",Tech|Amazon|Mastercard|Visa,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-29 13:15:37

The popular exchanges that embraced PI upon going live were OKX, Bitget, and others. Binance was also rumored to follow suit and even issued a community vote to determine whether its users want to see the asset available on the platform. Despite the overwhelming support, the exchange has not taken action, so we asked four of the most popular AI-powered chatbots whether this will happen next year. Far From Guaranteed ChatGPT seems most pessimistic, saying the listing chances in 2026 are around 25% – 35%. It noted that Binance usually embraces assets that have a fully open and permissionless mainnet, clear tokenomics, real trading demand, and minimal regulatory uncertainty. The chatbot warned that PI still raises questions in several areas, especially about how much of the supply is actually liquid and how open the ecosystem truly is. ChatGPT added that if the team behind Pi Network fixes some of the issues related to mainnet functionality and transparency, the listing odds could move closer to 40%. Grok, the chatbot integrated into X, outlined the same red flags as the main hurdles that could have prevented Binance from allowing trading services for the token. At the same time, it stated that Pi Network has a massive user base, suggesting that a listing would happen sooner or later. It estimated that the probability of that in 2026 is between 40% and 50%. Additional Perspectives Perplexity highlighted Pi Network’s progress this year , noting that despite PI’s price decline, the team behind the project inked some strategic partnerships with renowned companies. It predicted that additional collaborations could boost the project’s reputation, prompting Binance to list the token eventually. The chances for 2026 sit at roughly 45%, but a solid start to the year could boost the probability, the chatbot added. Google’s Gemini appears to be the biggest optimist. It placed the probability at a coin flip, estimating that such a development would have a positive effect on both Binance and Pi Network. “With millions of users, Binance would benefit immensely from the trading fees, whereas the price of PI is likely to pump substantially after the backing.” At the same time, Gemini alerted that the token unlocks scheduled for next year may create high selling pressure, which could make the exchange wait for the valuation to stabilize before listing the coin.

Incoming ETH now outweighs withdrawals by almost two to one. According to the latest data from the Ethereum Validator Queue, approximately 745,000–746,000 ETH is now waiting to enter the validator set, compared with roughly 360,000 ETH in the exit queue. This means nearly twice as much ETH is being lined up to stake as to withdraw, signaling a marked increase in staking demand relative to outflows. Over the weekend, both queues hovered around 460,000 ETH; after that, the entry line picked up speed, with analysts warning the exit queue may soon hit zero at the current pace. Abdul says the exit queue was a leading indicator of selling pressure in 2025 Abdul, who heads DeFi at Monad, described the change as historically significant, referencing a June reversal that saw Ether’s price double. He contended that he expects a rather dramatic 2026. Back in June, ETH was trading around $2,800 before hitting a record high of $4,946 in late August, though it’s now hovering near $3,000. Ethereum relies on proof-of-stake , meaning validators must stake ETH to help secure the blockchain. Rising exits suggest selling, whereas increased staking signals confidence and lower near-term supply. For starters, Abdul said the exit queue has served as a leading indicator of selling pressure in 2025. According to his estimates, 5% of all Ether has changed hands since July, largely due to Kiln’s September unstaking, with BitMine taking in about 70% of that ETH, thereby gaining a 3.4% share of the total supply. In September, Kiln had initiated a controlled withdrawal of its validators after an exploit at the digital asset platform SwissBorg. The firm defended its action, stating that it was more of a precaution rather than a sign of lost confidence in Ethereum. Dylan Grabowski links staking surge to demand from digital asset treasury firms Abdul suggested that at the current pace, the exit queue might be empty by January 3, possibly diminishing the selling pressure on the market and bringing a little more stability. Some in the crypto space, including Dylan Grabowski, host of the Smart Economy Podcast, attribute the staking surge to rising demand from digital asset treasury firms. BitMine, for example, staked over 342,000 ETH — roughly $1 billion — within just two days, according to Lookchain data. Others, including Ignas, the pseudonymous co-founder of DeFi Creator Studio Pink Brains, also cited additional reasons for the boom, including Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade , which aims to make staking easier and extend limits on validators to accommodate large investors. Ignas also said that higher borrowing rates and the unwinding of leveraged staking in DeFi could have further shifted supply flows. BlackRock applied for a staked Ethereum ETF Earlier this month, BlackRock filed for a staked Ethereum ETF, a big step toward mainstream staking exposure. The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) review is underway; however, a formal approval timeline will begin after the listing exchange files a Form 19b-4. The firm had alluded to iShares Ethereum Staking Trust (ETHB) via a Delaware-registered name in November, but no formal SEC application was made at the time. Before that, the firm and other issuers had formed the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) in July 2024. However, at the time, Gary Gensler — the leading figure at this agency — was alleged by many to have demanded the removal of staking components due to potential unregistered securities issues posed by platforms such as Kraken and Coinbase.

This transaction, finalized in late December, significantly bolsters the firm’s already substantial cryptocurrency treasury. Consequently, this action sends a powerful signal to both traditional finance and the crypto markets about the maturing role of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. The purchase occurred against a backdrop of evolving regulatory clarity and institutional adoption, marking another milestone in corporate crypto strategy. Analyzing the Strategy Bitcoin Purchase Strategy’s latest acquisition brings its total Bitcoin holdings to a staggering 672,497 BTC. As of December 28, this portfolio holds a market value of approximately $50.44 billion. This purchase follows a consistent accumulation strategy the company has publicly championed since 2020. Importantly, the firm’s year-to-date return on its Bitcoin investments stands at a robust 23.2%, outperforming many traditional asset classes over the same period. This performance likely reinforces the company’s commitment to its digital asset allocation policy. Corporate Bitcoin adoption has evolved from a speculative trend to a structured treasury management strategy. Several key factors drive this shift: Inflation Hedge: Many corporations view Bitcoin as a digital counterpart to gold, a non-sovereign store of value. Portfolio Diversification: Adding Bitcoin aims to reduce correlation with traditional stocks and bonds. Balance Sheet Optimization: Holding appreciating digital assets can enhance overall corporate equity value. Strategy’s methodical approach involves periodic dollar-cost averaging, rather than timing the market. This disciplined tactic mitigates volatility risk and demonstrates a focus on long-term accumulation. The Landscape of Corporate Cryptocurrency Holdings Strategy now firmly resides within an elite group of publicly traded companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets. This corporate cryptocurrency holdings trend began gaining momentum in 2020 and has created a new benchmark for treasury management. For context, the following table illustrates how Strategy’s position compares to other notable corporate holders, based on the latest verifiable public data. Company Approximate BTC Holdings First Acquisition Year Strategy 672,497 BTC 2020 MicroStrategy ~190,000 BTC 2020 Tesla ~10,500 BTC 2021 Block, Inc. ~8,027 BTC 2020 This data reveals Strategy’s position as a dominant force. Its holdings represent a significant percentage of the total Bitcoin supply, which is capped at 21 million coins. Such large-scale accumulation by a single entity can influence market liquidity and perception. Furthermore, it validates Bitcoin’s credibility as a macro-economic asset for institutional portfolios. Expert Analysis on Treasury Reserve Strategy Financial analysts specializing in digital assets point to several rationales behind Strategy’s persistent buying. Firstly, the company has consistently framed Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset, surpassing traditional cash and cash equivalents. This policy stems from a belief in the long-term appreciation potential of a scarce digital asset. Secondly, the move is seen as a strategic hedge against global currency devaluation and expansive monetary policies. Experts from firms like Fidelity Digital Assets and ARK Invest have published research supporting the non-correlative properties of Bitcoin in a diversified portfolio. Moreover, the accounting treatment for Bitcoin has improved. With clearer guidelines from standards boards, companies can now report holdings with more transparency. This regulatory progress reduces friction for other corporations considering similar moves. Strategy’s public disclosures and earnings calls often detail its custody solutions, utilizing a combination of cold storage and institutional-grade custodians, which adds a layer of security and trust for shareholders. Market Impact and Future Implications The immediate market impact of a $108.9 million purchase is often absorbed without major price disruption, thanks to deep liquidity on major exchanges. However, the cumulative effect of consistent, large-scale buying by entities like Strategy exerts sustained upward pressure on the asset’s price over time. It also reduces the circulating supply available to retail investors, a phenomenon often referred to as a supply shock. This dynamic is a fundamental component of many long-term bullish Bitcoin price models. Looking ahead, Strategy’s actions could catalyze further institutional adoption. Other S&P 500 companies may view this as a proven blueprint for integrating digital assets. The key implications for the future include: Increased Legitimacy: Continuous corporate investment normalizes Bitcoin for pension funds and endowments. Regulatory Engagement: Large holders have an incentive to advocate for clear, favorable crypto regulations. Product Innovation: Demand from corporations spurs financial services like insured custody, lending, and derivatives. Ultimately, this trend points toward a financial system where digital and traditional assets coexist on corporate balance sheets. Strategy’s 23.2% year-to-date return, while historical and not predictive of future results, provides a tangible performance metric that other CFOs will undoubtedly scrutinize. Conclusion Strategy’s latest $108.9 million Bitcoin purchase is far more than a simple transaction; it is a reaffirmation of a core corporate strategy. By elevating its holdings to 672,497 BTC, the company not only strengthens its own financial position but also reinforces Bitcoin’s status as a legitimate treasury asset. This move, yielding a 23.2% return year-to-date, highlights the potential strategic value of cryptocurrency allocations. As the digital asset ecosystem matures, Strategy’s disciplined accumulation approach will likely serve as a critical case study for corporate finance in the digital age. The ongoing Strategy Bitcoin purchase strategy continues to shape market structure and institutional perception globally. FAQs Q1: How much Bitcoin does Strategy own after this purchase? Following this transaction, Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings have reached 672,497 BTC, with a total reported value of approximately $50.44 billion as of December 28. Q2: Why do corporations like Strategy buy Bitcoin? Corporations typically cite reasons including hedging against inflation, diversifying treasury assets away from traditional fiat currencies, and positioning for the potential long-term appreciation of a scarce digital asset. Q3: What is dollar-cost averaging, and does Strategy use it? Dollar-cost averaging involves investing a fixed sum of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. Strategy has employed a similar, disciplined accumulation strategy over several years rather than making large, one-time purchases. Q4: How does this purchase affect the Bitcoin market? While a single $108.9 million purchase is often absorbed by market liquidity, consistent large-scale buying by major entities reduces available supply and can create sustained upward price pressure over the long term. Q5: What are the risks of a corporation holding Bitcoin? Primary risks include high price volatility, potential regulatory changes, cybersecurity threats related to custody, and accounting complexities. Companies like Strategy mitigate these with secure custody solutions and a long-term strategic outlook.

In a Dec. 28 post on X accompanied by a short voice recording, Armstrong pushed back on the idea that Bitcoin is inherently a threat to the dollar. “Bitcoin is good for USD,” he wrote, saying it “It creates competition in a way that’s healthy for the dollar, which helps to provide a check and balance against high inflation and deficit spending.” Bitcoin is good for USD. It creates competition in a way that’s healthy for the dollar, which helps to provide a check and balance against high inflation and deficit spending. pic.twitter.com/iHjQCJVqCb — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) December 28, 2025 Bitcoin Acts As A Check On Dollar Inflation Armstrong’s core claim is that the existence of a credible alternative store of value increases the political and economic cost of letting inflation or debt dynamics deteriorate. In the recording, he said that if the US veers into “too much deficit spending or inflation,” capital can “flee to Bitcoin in times of uncertainty,” creating external pressure on policymakers and, by extension, a stronger incentive to maintain currency stability. He situated the argument inside a broader critique of budgeting incentives in democratic systems. “Democracies around the world, including the United States… are trying to figure out how to fix deficit spending ,” he said, adding that “the incentives are just not aligned to actually balance the budget.” The implication, as Armstrong laid it out, is not that Bitcoin repairs those incentives directly, but that it makes ignoring them more costly by offering an exit valve when credibility erodes. Armstrong also tied reserve-currency status to the relationship between inflation and real growth. “It might be okay to have 2% to 3% inflation if the economy is growing 2% to 3%,” he said. But if “inflation outstrips the growth of the economy,” Armstrong warned the US could “eventually lose the reserve currency status,” which he described as “a massive blow” to the country. He added a geopolitical layer, arguing that reserve-currency privilege is not static. “ China , these other superpowers are coming in trying to compete for that over time,” Armstrong said, positioning monetary credibility as an axis of long-run strategic competition. The conclusion he offered was a reframing of Bitcoin’s role: less an adversary to the dollar than a disciplining force that could lengthen the runway for US financial leadership . “So I actually think in a strange way, Bitcoin is helping extend the American experiment,” he said. Armstrong’s comments land in the middle of a growing debate inside crypto about whether Bitcoin’s maturation makes it a parallel system or a pressure mechanism within existing ones. If his framing resonates, it could reinforce an emerging narrative among institutional allocators and policy-adjacent crypto advocates: that Bitcoin’s competitive presence may be compatible with, rather than corrosive to, dollar dominance, so long as it keeps signaling costs when confidence starts to slip.

Rather than focusing on price momentum or short-term sentiment, Novogratz is urging investors to consider whether major tokens can justify their place through real economic value. His comments, shared in a recent discussion highlighted by Wu Blockchain, indicate a market that is becoming less forgiving of projects that cannot demonstrate practical use and sustainable business models. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz warned that XRP and Cardano (ADA) risk losing relevance if they fail to demonstrate real-world utility, arguing the crypto market is shifting from “narrative-driven tokens” to “business-driven tokens” with measurable value and profits. He expects… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 27, 2025 Utility Over Loyalty for Established Tokens Novogratz argued that assets such as XRP and Cardano face a growing risk of losing relevance if they fail to show measurable real-world utility. In his view, parts of the market have long depended on strong community loyalty to sustain attention and demand. However, he believes that the dynamic is weakening as each cycle introduces more competing projects and higher expectations from participants. According to Novogratz, tokens that rely primarily on narrative appeal or a devoted user base may struggle to keep pace with rivals that can point to revenue generation, active usage, and clear economic impact. The implication is that future leaders will be those networks that function as genuine platforms where developers build applications and users engage in meaningful activity, rather than those sustained mainly by enthusiasm. He contrasted this with examples of projects designed to create tangible value. One case he referenced was Hyperliquid, where a large share of platform profits is used to buy back and remove tokens from circulation. Novogratz described this approach as resembling an equity-style structure, where holders benefit from the underlying performance of the business rather than speculative expectations alone. From Narratives to Business-Driven Models The Galaxy Digital chief framed this evolution as a shift from what he described as narrative-driven tokens toward business-driven ones. He expects that over the next one to three years, the industry will undergo a structural transformation that places greater weight on profits, efficiency, and utility. In this environment, projects unable to adapt may gradually be sidelined as capital flows toward those with clearer fundamentals. Novogratz made these remarks during a broader conversation with Alex Thorn, Galaxy Digital’s Head of Firmwide Research, centered on outlooks for Bitcoin, tokenization , real-world assets, and artificial intelligence heading into 2026. Within that context, he suggested that Bitcoin would remain a central pillar, while other successful networks would need to prove they can support real economic activity at scale. A New Role for Wallets and Exchanges Looking ahead, Novogratz also projected changes in the infrastructure layer of cryptocurrency. He anticipates that wallets and exchanges could evolve into platforms resembling neobanks, offering services such as stablecoin payments, tokenized equities, and money market products. This development, in his assessment, would further blur the line between traditional finance and digital assets, reinforcing the demand for tokens tied to functioning businesses. Together, his comments outline a future where survival may depend less on reputation and more on results, signaling a decisive test for established names like XRP and Cardano as the market moves toward a more utility-focused standard.

The surge in the metal’s interest is spilling into tokenized markets . On-chain data revealed that trading volumes in tokenized markets are increasing in tandem with activities in futures and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The tokenized version of the iShares Silver Trust (SLV) has seen its monthly transfer volume surge by about 1,200% over the past 30 days. China imposes export licensing requirements for silver exports Data from RWA.xyz also shows SLV recorded a 300% increase in holders and approximately a 40% hike in net asset value over the same period. Rose AI founder Alexander Campbell argued that there’s monetary demand for SLV shares after they surged again following years of outflows. Multiple factors are driving silver’s price higher, including supply constraints, macroeconomic tailwinds, and structural demand. Campbell pointed to China’s decision to impose export licensing on refined silver beginning January 1. Elon Musk warned on Saturday that the move is not good because silver is needed in many industrial processes. Campbell said it matters because China is a massive net exporter of refined silver, exporting about 121 million ounces annually through Hong Kong to the world. He believes that the new requirements will exacerbate concerns about silver’s supply availability, potentially leading to higher prices. The analyst also reported that silver is trading at $85/oz in Shanghai, $91/oz in Dubai, and $77/oz in COMEX. “You live in a world of dollars. The marginal buyers don’t. They’re paying $10-14 premiums, and they don’t care. When physical diverges from paper like this, one of them is wrong. Historically, it’s not physical.” – Alexander Campbell , Founder of Rose AI. Campbell stated that the London OTC market, where physical silver is exchanged between bullion banks, refiners, and industrial users, is in the deepest backwardation in decades. He argued that the market is paying users more for silver today than for a promise of silver in the future. Data shows that the metal had a $29 spot a year ago, with its curve rising to $42, which is normal contango. However, the current spot is $80, with silver’s curve falling to $73. The analyst also believes COMEX paper is sitting in lazy contango, pretending everything’s fine. He argued that if London’s physical remains stressed while COMEX paper yawns, either supply will appear, or paper will reprice to physical reality. Data revealed that silver has 19% of the open interest in net long positions, while gold has 31%. Campbell argued that despite the move, silver positioning isn’t at extremes, and that there’s fuel left for it to run. CME raises margins for precious metals CME also raised margins on precious metals, including gold, silver, platinum, and palladium, to $25,000 per contract effective Monday. Expert trader Jacob Canfield warned of a potential 15%-20% candle if COMEX increases margin requirements to above 20%. Meanwhile, gold prices have slipped from levels close to historic highs $4,549 an ounce on Monday. At the time of publication, gold has dropped more than 2% and is trading around $4,442 per ounce. Spot platinum also dropped 6% to $2,305.15/oz, falling from its all-time high of $2,478.50. Palladium also fell 13.2% to $1,669 per ounce. ActivTrades analyst Ricardo Evangelista argued that Monday’s price drop, which follows record highs, is attributed to traders taking profits ahead of year-end. He also believes that the optimism from the U.S. administration’s progress in the Ukraine peace talks had presented a mild headwind. The market is also awaiting the release of the Fed’s December meeting minutes on Tuesday, which will provide clues on the interest rate outlook. Traders are expecting two rate cuts in 2026. UBS analysts wrote that gold prices are trading at an elevated premium, but there’s downside risk if a hawkish pivot of the Fed were to surprise the market.

The ongoing transition toward vertically integrated mining should improve unit economics over time, but at current production levels, profitability remains sensitive to Bitcoin prices. Management’s push into AI and high-performance computing adds potential long-term optionality, though the initiative is still early and not yet reflected in reported revenue or cash flow. With cost reductions, production stability, and diversification still in progress, the stock appears more fairly valued than obviously mispriced at present levels. MARA Holdings ( MARA ) is down around 50% over the last year as it's been ramping up CapEx at exactly the wrong time: when bitcoin is down 30% over the last quarter. I want to take a look at MARA to see if there's value here at this lower price. The issue with MARA is that it's not that easy to analyse by just looking at financials. Things like mark-to-market bitcoin price moves have an impact on the P&L, along with the current expense and CapEx ramp-up. So my goal with this analysis is to normalise these impacts and do a sum of the parts analysis to derive the current enterprise value of MARA and see if it can be justified. Current Bitcoin The easiest way to start a sum of the parts is by looking at the value of the current bitcoin on the balance sheet and comparing that to the enterprise value. Bitcoin is $87k at the time of writing. As seen in the Q3 investor presentation , MARA currently holds 52,850 bitcoin. Q3 2025 Investor Presentation 52,850 * $87k = $4,597,950,000 The current market cap is $3.76 billion, so we can add back financial obligation, minority interest, and subtract cash to get enterprise value. Financial obligations - add back: Current portion of LT debt: $350 million Current portion of lease obligations: $1.5 million Long-term debt: $3,247.6 million Capital Leases: $43.4 million Total: $3,642.5 million Minority Interest - add back: $16.7 million Cash & Equivalents - subtract: $826.4 million Total add back = $2832.8 million $3.76 billion + $2.8328 billion = $6.5928 billion = Enterprise Value We can subtract the current bitcoin holdings to get what's left over, which is $1,994,850,000, so let's call it $2 billion. The primary goal now is to see if the rest of the business can be valued at over $2 billion; if so, then MARA is undervalued and vice versa if not. Revenue & Expenses of Production The key business segment, besides just holding bitcoin akin to a bitcoin treasury, is the production side of the business. Q3 2025 Investor Presentation Looking at the Q3 investor presentation, 2,144 bitcoin were produced. 2,144* $87k = $186,528,000 in quarterly revenue expected at the current bitcoin price. The expense side is where things start to get tricky. This is because MARA is transitioning from an external hosting system to an internal one. Previously, MARA would pay third-party vendors to host, with the vendors covering things like energy, labour, maintenance, site operations, and local management. This was an asset-light model where MARA outsourced these needs. Now MARA is transitioning to a vertically integrated model where it owns and operates the sites itself. This means it must now hire additional staff, run facilities, maintain miners, manage power infrastructure, run data centres, handle compliance, safety, plus logistics, and so on. The current part of the transition that MARA is in, opex appears high because it's still paying many of the third-party fees whilst simultaneously paying for the new internal team as it ramps up. So you get a duplicate cost structure where margins look worse than they are when normalised. This can be seen when looking at the P&L comparing Q3 2024 to Q3 2025 on the Q3 2025 10Q : MARA Q3 2025 10Q As seen above, opex has gone up over the last year. So the key now is to figure out what this all normalises to once MARA transitions to a fully vertically integrated model, where it doesn't have to pay the same level of third-party hosting fees. The four key expenses to look at: Purchased energy cost Operating & maintenance cost Third-party hosting & other energy costs General & administrative cost The company has highlighted in its Q3 2025 shareholder letter that the overall cost per petahash is down 15% year to date: MARA Q3 2025 shareholder letter Translating this to cost per kWh is $0.04, and for the cost per bitcoin is $39,235. Now it's difficult to quantify exactly where purchased energy cost will be in the future, but we can make a pretty good estimate based on the information the company has given us and at least aim to be directionally correct, even if not spot on. Third-party hosting and other energy costs consist of co-location services related to third-party hosted sites and energy expenses related to mining other digital assets. Third-party hosting and other energy costs in the quarter were $75.7 million compared to $63.7 million in the prior year period, an increase of $12.0 million. The increase was primarily due to the addition of energized miners and the expansion of third-party hosted facilities compared to the prior year period. Our pivot from asset-light to vertically integrated helped to reduce our electricity cost per coin to one of the lowest in this sector. As we transition towards a more owned and operated model, phase out third-party hosted contracts over time, and bring low-cost sites like wind farms online, we expect costs on a unit basis to continue to improve. In essence, there's ambiguity here since they didn't provide exact forward guidance on where they expect the purchased energy cost to be, but they did confirm the trend will continue over the next couple of quarters. Just based on the current reduction trend continuing, I think we can expect around a 20% reduction in this line item once these costs are further reduced and once there's less reliance on third-party hosted sites. Last quarter's purchased energy cost line item was $43.080 million, so a 20% reduction is $34.464 million. For operating and maintenance costs, it includes: on-site labour, miner maintenance and repairs, cooling systems, electrical infrastructure upkeep, and site operations & security. The key thing with this expense to remember is that O&M rises when you internalise operations, but it will fall once bitcoin utilisation and scale normalise. The other thing is that it's a lot more akin to a fixed cost, so it has operating leverage as it scales. I'm going to keep O&M costs the same, because it's largely fixed, and the real benefit of it is only seen if bitcoin production goes up. It's a similar story with general and administrative costs. G&A stays the same regardless of how much you produce, so it just carries over as a fixed cost. Quarterly expense for both: O&M: $26.31 million G&A: $85.296 million This leaves us with third-party hosting costs, which is where the largest expense cut is expected. Two years back, in December 2023, Nasdaq put out a press release saying: Currently, Marathon’s Bitcoin mining portfolio consists of 584 megawatts of capacity, 3% of which resides in sites that are owned and/or operated by the Company, and 97% of which is hosted by third parties. Following the close of this transaction, Marathon’s Bitcoin mining portfolio will consist of approximately 910 megawatts of capacity, 45% of which will reside on sites directly owned by the Company, and 55% of which will be hosted by third parties. So there was already clear directional data on where things were headed. I think it's safe to make a presumption that a reduction will continue and that we could see a 40% reduction in this line item. I say this since we already know that per petahash per day improved 15%. And we know that O&M and G&A are largely fixed costs, so the bulk of improvement has to come from the third-party hosting cost. Current quarterly third-party hosting costs are $75.664 million, so a 40% reduction is $45.3984 million. Adding this all up makes for a quarterly operating expense of $191.4684 million, plus we still need to add other miscellaneous expenses. These are taxes other than on income, early termination expenses, and research and development. These are all around 16 million. So let's say the total quarterly operating expense is around $207 million. With quarterly production revenue at $186,528,000, they are underwater; although there are some additional revenues such as interest income from loaning out bitcoin, which last quarter was $17,689. In all, once accounting for all this, at the current production levels and $87k price per bitcoin, it's a breakeven EBITDA under our expense assumption. So you're really paying for the possibility that they grow production to take advantage of operating leverage, the bitcoin price goes up, or that they optimise expenses to the point that they can virtually get rid of all third-party hosting. It's possible they grow production or that they optimise third-party hosting cost, but I wouldn't want to bank on it. AI & HPC Call Option There's an AI call option that seems to be all the rage, but frankly, I just don't get it since the time to mass recurring revenue scale is far away and profitability even further. The idea behind it is that the energy and data centre infrastructure they have to mine Bitcoin can be repurposed to perform other types of compute work, including AI inference workloads. In pursuit of this vision, Marathon deployed its first ten AI inference rack systems at the Granbury, Texas, facility in 2025 and announced an acquisition of an initial ~64% equity stake in Paris‑based Exaion, a provider of tier 3/4 data centre and compute services. I view this as pure optionality for a few key reasons: Lack of Monetised Compute Revenue Uncertain Utilisation, Pricing, and Margins Competitive and Capital Intensity Timing Risk Until we see these issues addressed, it's just a form of optionality, but it won't get to the point where it'll scale with recurring revenue and profitability. Dilution Something else that's been an issue is how reliant MARA is on diluting equity holders to raise capital: Seeking Alpha Source It's pretty much been straight up and to the right. Dilution works when your stock is richly priced relative to what you're investing in, and there's a clear and immediate payout. That isn't the case with MARA. The stock is down heavily, which means that to get the same level of capital, they need to dilute even more stock. Plus, mining operations are breakeven at $87k bitcoin, per earlier calculations. And AI & HPC is just optionality that may or may not pay off with long-term sustainable profitability. So there is no clear payoff in the immediate term, yet shareholders are getting heavily diluted. Just over the last year, outstanding shares have been up around 27%. Now, with a lower stock price and a higher cash burn rate, they would need to dilute even more stock. Takeaway To take this full circle, what I posited originally is that the enterprise value is $6.5928 billion, so there's almost $2 billion of value that is blue sky above their bitcoin holdings, and we'd need to see if the rest of the business justifies that. The major issue I see is that everything else is just a call option right now. The bitcoin production side of the business is at breakeven with current bitcoin prices, even considering the operational improvements that will be made. Similar story with the AI side of the business in that it's just optionality. The $2 billion gap could be justified if you believe: Bitcoin production will go up Large-scale operational improvements will reduce operating expenses further Bitcoin prices will go up The AI business will generate significant recurring revenue soon But I simply don't see these right now, and I don't want to invest in something that's just a bitcoin proxy, which is what MARA is trading like, because so many of the economics are tied back to the price. If it were a lower-cost producer with a clear path to scale production, then that would be a different story, but it isn't right now. For these reasons, I've put a hold rating (neutral outlook) on MARA.",BTC-USD|MARA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-29 13:35:49

56547973,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=1424483,1767016123,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/56547973.jpeg,Why Ripple (XRP) Downtrend May Deepen Amid Rising Exchange Inflows,https://cryptopotato.com/why-ripple-xrp-downtrend-may-deepen-amid-rising-exchange-inflows/,"Ripple (XRP) has struggled to regain the $1.90 level, and recent price action has shown repeated rejections near that zone despite brief recovery attempts. After dropping sharply earlier in the week, buyers briefly managed to push prices higher on December 29, but selling pressure emerged just below $1.91. Fresh data suggest a “clear intensification” of selling pressure on XRP, which has coincided with a sharp market correction that has seen the asset lose roughly 50% of its value, after falling from a recent high near $3.66 to around $1.85. XRP Under Pressure According to the latest analysis by CryptoQuant, this growing pressure is most evident in XRP inflows to centralized exchanges, particularly Binance, which continues to account for the largest share of the token’s trading volume globally. Exchange inflows are commonly viewed as a proxy for potential selling intent, especially when they rise rapidly over a short period. CryptoQuant data show that after a relatively calm phase with stable, moderate inflows, conditions changed significantly from December 15 onward. Since then, daily XRP inflows to Binance have surged. The figure ranged from 35 million to 116 million XRP, peaking on December 19. The analytics firm stated that this trend reflects a transition among investors, as long-term holders are increasingly engaging in profit-taking following the earlier rally, while more recent market participants appear to be capitulating and selling at a loss amid the ongoing decline. This combination of profit realization and forced selling has added to downward pressure on price action. As long as these high exchange inflows continue or accelerate further, XRP is unlikely to enter a steady accumulation phase. Under such conditions, the current correction may not only last longer but could also deepen, thereby increasing downside risks in the near term. Institutional Appetite US investors have been able to gain exposure to spot XRP ETFs even as broader macroeconomic pressures weigh on digital asset prices. Reports suggest that these investment vehicles have even outperformed the BTC and ETH counterparts for the most part since their launch. According to SoSoValue, since launching in November, these ETFs have attracted $1.14 billion in inflows as of December 26. Total assets held by spot XRP ETFs have also climbed to $1.25 billion.

This addition marks a pivotal expansion for the on-chain trading service, which operates exclusively within the Binance Wallet environment. Consequently, the platform further solidifies its niche focus on providing vetted access to promising early-stage digital assets. The announcement, made from Binance’s global headquarters, arrives during a period of heightened institutional interest in nascent blockchain projects. Binance Alpha Deepens Its Early-Stage Coin Ecosystem Binance Alpha functions as a specialized gateway within the broader Binance ecosystem. Specifically designed for on-chain trading, it distinguishes itself by curating access to tokens in their formative phases. The platform’s methodology involves rigorous internal evaluation before any listing. Therefore, the inclusion of OOOO suggests the project has passed a multi-faceted assessment for potential and innovation. This process typically examines technological fundamentals, team credibility, and real-world utility. Industry analysts often view such listings as a bellwether for emerging trends. For instance, a 2023 report by Blockchain Analytics Firm Chainalysis indicated that early-stage investments, while riskier, accounted for a disproportionate share of annualized returns in the digital asset space. Platforms like Binance Alpha aim to mitigate some inherent risks through selective curation. The service operates directly through the Binance Wallet, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience for qualified participants. Understanding the On-Chain Trading Paradigm The term “on-chain trading” refers to transactions that are settled directly on a blockchain’s native ledger. This contrasts with the order-book model used by most centralized exchanges. Binance Alpha utilizes this model to provide users with direct custody and interaction with smart contracts. This approach offers several distinct advantages, including enhanced transparency and reduced counterparty risk. Transactions are publicly verifiable and immutable once confirmed on the blockchain. Furthermore, on-chain services often facilitate access to liquidity pools and decentralized finance (DeFi) mechanisms not available on traditional exchanges. The integration of a new asset like OOOO typically involves deploying its liquidity on supported decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or automated market makers (AMMs). The following table outlines the core differences between Binance Alpha’s model and a standard centralized exchange (CEX) listing: Aspect Binance Alpha (On-Chain) Standard CEX Listing Asset Custody User-held in personal wallet Held by the exchange Transaction Settlement On the blockchain On exchange’s internal ledger Typical Asset Stage Early-stage, innovative Established, high-volume Primary Access Often via Binance Wallet Open to all exchange users Expert Analysis on Curated Early-Stage Access Financial technology experts emphasize the importance of curated platforms in a volatile market. Dr. Lena Chen, a research fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, notes, “Gateways like Binance Alpha perform a critical filtering function. They apply resources to due diligence that individual retail investors may lack. However, investors must remember that ‘early-stage’ is synonymous with high volatility and potential illiquidity.” This perspective underscores the platform’s role in bridging the gap between innovative projects and informed capital. The timing of the December 30 launch is also noteworthy. Historically, the final week of the year sees lower trading volumes but increased strategic positioning by funds and developers. A launch during this period allows the OOOO project to build community and liquidity ahead of the new year’s activity. Data from previous Binance Alpha listings shows an average user engagement spike of 40% in the first quarter following a new integration. The Strategic Role of the Binance Wallet Integration Binance Wallet serves as the foundational layer for the Alpha service. This integration is not merely a technical requirement but a strategic design choice. It creates a cohesive ecosystem where asset discovery, trading, and storage occur in a unified environment. This reduces friction and enhances security by minimizing the need for external transfers. Users maintain control of their private keys throughout the entire trading process. Key features enabled by this wallet-centric model include: Direct Asset Control: Users always custody their own funds. Streamlined Interface: Trading functions are embedded within the wallet’s interface. Enhanced Security Protocols: Leverages Binance’s institutional-grade security infrastructure for the wallet environment. Cross-Chain Compatibility: The wallet supports multiple blockchains, facilitating access to a broader array of early-stage projects. This model aligns with a broader industry trend toward self-custody and decentralized financial services. It empowers users while providing a structured pathway to explore high-growth-potential assets. The listing of OOOO will follow this established, user-centric protocol. Conclusion The announcement by Binance Alpha to add OOOO on December 30 represents a calculated expansion of its curated early-stage investment offerings. This move reinforces the platform’s commitment to sourcing innovative blockchain projects and providing secure, on-chain access to them via the Binance Wallet. While offering significant potential, such investments demand thorough research and risk assessment from participants. The integration exemplifies the evolving landscape of digital asset trading, where user custody and direct blockchain interaction are becoming paramount. Ultimately, Binance Alpha continues to carve out a distinct niche by connecting vetted, nascent projects with a sophisticated investor base. FAQs Q1: What is Binance Alpha? Binance Alpha is an on-chain trading service integrated within the Binance Wallet. It focuses exclusively on listing and providing access to carefully selected early-stage cryptocurrency projects. Q2: When will OOOO be available on Binance Alpha? The OOOO token is scheduled for integration and will be available for trading on the Binance Alpha platform starting December 30, 2024. Q3: How is trading on Binance Alpha different from the main Binance exchange? Trading on Binance Alpha is conducted on-chain, meaning transactions settle directly on the blockchain. Users maintain custody of their assets in their Binance Wallet. The main Binance exchange uses a centralized order-book model where the exchange custodies user funds. Q4: What does “early-stage coin” mean? An early-stage coin typically refers to a cryptocurrency project in its initial phases of development and market adoption. These assets often have lower market capitalization, higher volatility, and aim to solve novel problems or use cases in the blockchain space. Q5: Do I need a specific wallet to use Binance Alpha? Yes, access to the Binance Alpha trading service requires the use of the Binance Wallet, which is the integrated environment where the on-chain trading functionality is housed.

Well, the drop in Bitcoin transactions highlights a shift in investor behavior. Once used for everyday payments or to bypass banks, Bitcoin is now primarily held long-term, akin to gold. While on-chain activity slows, its appeal as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty grows, Martinez notes. Wallet data highlights a clear shift from spending to holding. Dormant wallets, those inactive for long periods, are rising, while transaction volumes decline, signaling that investors increasingly treat Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Whales continue to accumulate substantial portions of the supply, reinforcing its role as a wealth-preserving digital asset. Momentum toward $100K remains strong, driven by new organic buyers and strategic advisor-led allocations with BTC’s price currently being $87,330 per CoinCodex data . Notably, this shift could reshape the cryptocurrency market long-term. Lower transaction volumes ease network congestion, potentially reducing fees and boosting Bitcoin’s scalability. Simultaneously, its growing role as a store of value may draw institutional investors seeking diversification and protection against market volatility. This comes as Bitcoin sparked a surge in social media buzz over the weekend, outpacing traditional safe-haven assets like gold and silver. What next? Well, Martinez highlights a pivotal shift in crypto that Bitcoin is evolving from digital cash into a digital gold standard. Recognizing this change is crucial for investors, policymakers, and users aiming to navigate the future of decentralized finance. Conclusion Bitcoin is evolving from a transactional currency into a digital store of value. A 42.6% drop in network activity since 2021 reflects a market increasingly focused on holding rather than spending, cementing its role as ‘digital gold.’ As investors, institutions, and users adjust, recognizing Bitcoin’s dual potential—as a long-term asset and occasional transactional tool—is key to navigating the future of crypto.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-29 13:56:10

As the traditional financial systems face increasing pressure, Keiser maintains that BTC’s fixed supply and expanding market infrastructure position it for significant upside in the year ahead. How Macro Debt And Inflation Risks Strengthen Bitcoin’s Case According to a recent post from Crypto Miners on X, Bitcoin advocate Max Keiser has once again reiterated his long-standing BTC thesis from 2025. Keiser points to total US debt surpassing $36 trillion and annual interest expenses approaching $1 trillion, claiming that this environment could push BTC beyond $2 million as capital seeks protection from fiat debasement. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bottom Forecast: Top Expert Predicts $40,000 Target Next Year, Here’s The Analysis The argument remains consistent with Keiser’s long-standing BTC maximalist stance, which links rising sovereign US debt expansion and currency dilution to upward pressure on a fixed supply asset. Replies are split, and supporters point to a 21 million supply against the unlimited debt. Thus, critics remain unconvinced, noting that BTC continues to trade below the $100,000 level despite similar high-conviction predictions made throughout 2025. Market commentator The Penguin updated that Bitcoin’s lower timeframe (LTF) structure is still looking a bit less impulsive, but nothing meaningful has changed in the count. Instead, BTC remains comfortable treating the current formation as a leading diagonal for wave 1, with recent LTF fluctuations resembling short-term noise rather than a decisive shift in trend. The Penguin pointed out that by setting Elliott Wave analysis aside and focusing on standard technical analysis, BTC continues to respect a well-defined range. This behavior is seen as consistent with the fact that Sunday trading and volume are light. From a trading perspective, the analyst’s focus is on longs and monitoring a possible shallow deviation toward the 0.886 retracement level marked on the chart. On the bullish side, the confirmation would be acceptance back above the $90,500 level, which would invalidate the bearish idea. Overall, the directional bias remains the same as the low-vol LTF chop is ahead of the yearly open. The Penguin added that the broader structure still looks solid and should hold up, while also noting signs of relative strength in assets such as XPL. Why Momentum Will Decide The Next Major Move Bitcoin high-timeframe (HTF) price action and momentum are currently navigating a structural pattern that mirrors a historical turning point. Crypto investor and trader known as Titan of Crypto has highlighted that BTC is showing a sequence similar to Q2 2021 and Q1 2025.

This substantial purchase represents one of the largest single-week institutional Ethereum acquisitions recorded this year, bringing Bitmine’s total Ethereum holdings to a staggering 4,115,250 ETH valued at approximately $12.04 billion at current market prices. Bitmine’s Ethereum Accumulation Strategy Blockchain analytics platform Onchainlens reported that Bitmine purchased precisely 44,463 ETH during the seven-day period. Consequently, this acquisition represents a calculated expansion of the firm’s digital asset strategy. Furthermore, the timing of this purchase coincides with broader market developments that have captured institutional attention. The transaction demonstrates Bitmine’s continued commitment to Ethereum despite market fluctuations that have characterized the cryptocurrency space throughout early 2025. Industry analysts immediately noted several important aspects of this transaction. First, the purchase occurred through multiple transactions rather than a single bulk buy. Second, the acquisitions happened across different trading platforms and decentralized exchanges. Third, the firm maintained its accumulation pattern despite varying price points throughout the week. These strategic elements suggest sophisticated execution rather than simple market timing. Institutional Cryptocurrency Investment Trends The cryptocurrency investment landscape has evolved dramatically since 2020. Initially, institutional participation remained limited to Bitcoin exposure. However, Ethereum has gradually gained substantial institutional adoption. Currently, several factors drive this shift toward Ethereum investment: Network Utility: Ethereum supports decentralized applications and smart contracts Staking Rewards: Institutions earn yield through Ethereum’s proof-of-stake mechanism Regulatory Clarity: Improved regulatory frameworks in key markets Infrastructure Development: Enhanced custody solutions and financial products Bitmine’s latest purchase aligns with broader institutional trends. According to cryptocurrency research firm Digital Asset Analytics, institutional Ethereum holdings increased by 42% year-over-year through Q1 2025. Meanwhile, traditional financial institutions have launched numerous Ethereum-based products. These include exchange-traded funds, structured products, and yield-generating instruments. Therefore, Bitmine’s move reflects rather than initiates this institutional trend. Market Impact and Price Considerations Market analysts have carefully examined the potential impact of such large-scale purchases. Typically, acquisitions of this magnitude can influence market dynamics. However, Ethereum’s daily trading volume currently exceeds $15 billion across major exchanges. Consequently, Bitmine’s $130 million purchase represents less than 1% of daily volume. This proportion minimizes immediate price impact while demonstrating substantial conviction. The purchase occurred at an average price of approximately $2,924 per ETH. This price point sits within the trading range Ethereum has maintained throughout March 2025. Market data reveals that institutional buyers often employ dollar-cost averaging strategies. These approaches smooth entry prices over time rather than attempting to time market bottoms. Bitmine’s transaction pattern suggests similar methodology given the multiple purchase events recorded. Bitmine Ethereum Holdings Timeline Period ETH Added Approximate Value Total Holdings Q4 2024 210,500 ETH $615 million 3,850,000 ETH January 2025 35,200 ETH $103 million 3,885,200 ETH February 2025 25,587 ETH $75 million 3,910,787 ETH March 10-17, 2025 44,463 ETH $130 million 4,115,250 ETH Comparative Analysis with Other Institutional Holders Bitmine’s Ethereum position places the firm among the largest non-exchange institutional holders globally. Several entities maintain substantial Ethereum reserves for different purposes. Cryptocurrency exchanges hold significant amounts for liquidity and operational needs. Meanwhile, decentralized finance protocols lock substantial Ethereum as collateral. However, pure investment firms like Bitmine represent a distinct category focused on asset appreciation. According to blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis, the largest Ethereum addresses belong to: Cryptocurrency exchanges (operational reserves) Staking services (validator operations) Decentralized finance protocols (collateral pools) Investment vehicles (appreciation-focused) Bitmine falls squarely within the investment vehicle category. The firm’s public disclosures indicate a long-term investment horizon. Additionally, Bitmine typically holds assets rather than actively trading them. This approach differs from hedge funds that might engage in more frequent portfolio adjustments. The distinction matters because long-term holders generally contribute to reduced circulating supply. Expert Perspectives on Institutional Strategy Financial analysts specializing in digital assets have offered various interpretations of Bitmine’s move. Dr. Elena Rodriguez, Chief Economist at Digital Finance Research Institute, notes: “Institutional accumulation patterns reveal strategic positioning rather than speculative trading. Large-scale purchases like Bitmine’s $130 million Ethereum acquisition typically follow extensive due diligence. Furthermore, institutions consider regulatory developments, technological roadmaps, and macroeconomic factors.” Blockchain analyst Michael Chen from Onchainlens adds: “Our data shows consistent accumulation by sophisticated investors throughout 2025’s first quarter. The Ethereum network continues to demonstrate robust fundamentals despite market volatility. Key metrics including active addresses, transaction volume, and decentralized application usage remain strong. These fundamentals likely inform institutional investment decisions.” Ethereum Network Fundamentals and Future Developments Ethereum’s ongoing development roadmap provides context for institutional interest. The network completed its transition to proof-of-stake consensus in 2022. Since that transition, several important upgrades have enhanced network capabilities. Currently, developers focus on scalability improvements through layer-2 solutions and sharding implementations. These technological advancements address previous limitations regarding transaction throughput and costs. Upcoming network upgrades scheduled for 2025 include: Verkle Trees Implementation: Improves stateless client support Proto-Danksharding: Enhances data availability for layer-2 networks Account Abstraction Improvements: Simplifies user experience These technical developments potentially increase Ethereum’s utility and adoption. Consequently, institutional investors monitor roadmap progress closely. Bitmine’s investment team likely considered these factors during their decision-making process. The firm’s substantial commitment suggests confidence in Ethereum’s continued development and adoption trajectory. Regulatory Environment and Compliance Considerations Institutional cryptocurrency investment requires careful navigation of regulatory frameworks. The regulatory landscape has evolved significantly since 2023. Currently, major jurisdictions have established clearer guidelines for digital asset investment. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds in 2024. Similarly, European Union markets operate under comprehensive MiCA regulations implemented in 2024. Bitmine operates with regulatory compliance as a priority according to public statements. The firm maintains licenses in multiple jurisdictions including Singapore and Switzerland. Additionally, Bitmine employs robust compliance protocols for transaction monitoring and reporting. These measures address anti-money laundering and know-your-customer requirements. Regulatory clarity enables larger-scale institutional participation that wasn’t feasible during earlier cryptocurrency market phases. Portfolio Diversification and Risk Management Institutional investment strategies emphasize portfolio diversification and risk management. Cryptocurrency allocations typically represent a portion rather than entirety of institutional portfolios. According to investment surveys, average institutional cryptocurrency allocations range from 1-5% of total assets under management. However, specialized firms like Bitmine maintain higher concentrations given their specific investment mandate. Risk management approaches for cryptocurrency investments include: Multi-signature custody solutions Insurance coverage for digital assets Geographic distribution of holdings Regular security audits and penetration testing Bitmine has publicly disclosed its security protocols in previous investor communications. The firm utilizes institutional-grade custody solutions with insurance protection. Additionally, Bitmine employs cold storage for the majority of its holdings. These security measures address concerns regarding digital asset protection that historically limited institutional participation. Conclusion Bitmine’s $130 million Ethereum purchase represents a significant development in institutional cryptocurrency adoption. The transaction expands the firm’s already substantial Ethereum holdings to approximately $12.04 billion in total value. This strategic move aligns with broader trends of increasing institutional participation in digital asset markets. Furthermore, the purchase demonstrates continued confidence in Ethereum’s fundamentals despite market volatility. As regulatory frameworks mature and technological developments progress, institutional investment patterns like Bitmine’s Ethereum accumulation will likely continue shaping cryptocurrency market dynamics. The firm’s substantial position establishes it as a major participant in the evolving digital asset ecosystem with implications for market structure and adoption trajectories.

Proponents argue that shrinking exchange balances will eventually collide with rising demand, creating a scarcity-driven rally. Yet when examined through the lens of market structure and on-chain mechanics, this theory begins to lose its footing. That perspective was recently reinforced by Vet, a respected XRPL validator, who challenged the supply shock narrative by grounding the discussion in verifiable liquidity dynamics rather than speculative assumptions. His analysis highlights why exchange supply, price action, and liquidity in XRP markets are far more fluid than many traders assume. There is no XRP supply shock on exchanges. 1) Holders have close to 16B XRP on exchanges readily available. Plenty for anyone to get some. 2) If the price goes up or down anyone of you who has no XRP on exchanges could just send theirs within 3-4 secs to one. 3) Thus, also XRP… pic.twitter.com/mzVIluijGv — Vet (@Vet_X0) December 28, 2025 Exchange Balances Remain Structurally Deep A key reason there is no XRP supply shock is the sheer volume of tokens already sitting on centralized exchanges. Roughly 16 billion XRP remain readily available for trading, providing substantial depth for buyers and sellers alike. This level of accessible supply contradicts claims that exchanges are “running dry” or nearing a liquidity cliff. As long as this amount of XRP is available, the market retains the capacity to absorb demand without being structurally forced into higher price discovery. XRP’s Transfer Speed Keeps Supply Flexible Unlike slower networks where off-exchange tokens are effectively illiquid, XRP’s near-instant settlement changes how supply behaves. Holders who keep XRP in self-custody can move funds to exchanges in approximately three to four seconds. This means exchange supply is not a fixed number but a responsive pool that can expand almost instantly when price volatility creates incentives to sell or rebalance. In practice, off-exchange XRP functions as latent liquidity rather than locked supply. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Order Books Are Elastic, Not Static Another misconception fueling the supply shock narrative is the belief that order book liquidity is static. In reality, XRP order books are highly elastic. Sell-side liquidity can thicken or thin out within seconds depending on market sentiment, derivatives positioning, and algorithmic activity. This explains why modest buying pressure can sometimes push prices sharply higher, while at other times even large capital inflows fail to prevent declines. Price movement is driven by positioning and momentum, not just raw token availability. Why Static Supply Models Fail for XRP Taken together, these dynamics show why traditional supply shock models do not translate well to XRP. The market is fast, liquid, and adaptive, with price action shaped more by trader behavior and broader liquidity conditions than by simple exchange balance charts. XRP’s structure favors continuous repricing rather than sudden scarcity events. Ultimately, as Vet’s analysis makes clear, XRP trades in a live, dynamic environment where supply adjusts in real time. Understanding that reality is essential for separating compelling narratives from how the market actually functions.

As of 12/28/2025, we hodl 672,497 $BTC acquired for ~$50.44 billion at ~$74,997 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRC $STRK $STRF $STRD $STRE https://t.co/UGvjHj5WPg — Strategy (@Strategy) December 29, 2025 Strategy acquired the BTC at an average price of $88,568 per BTC, leading to an average purchase price of just below $75,000 per BTC. In 2025, the company acquired around 641 BTC per day on average. Strategy was the main BTC buyer in 2025 Strategy remains the main buyer for 2025, though smaller companies are also growing their treasuries. For the past year, entering the top 100 of treasury companies has become a harder milestone, initially requiring as low as 23 BTC. At the end of 2025, the smallest corporate treasury holds 148 BTC. Companies keep acquiring BTC sporadically or through mining. Strategy and 17 other buyers are still attempting to apply the playbook with stock sales and debt to buy BTC. In total, companies accumulated 1,089,345 BTC close to the end of 2025, with more buying plans for the coming year. Saylor used MSTR common stock again Strategy continues to issue MSTR common stock, despite the ongoing fears of dilution . To complete the latest sale, it issued an additional 663,450 MSTR shares. In the past few weeks, MSTR stayed away from issuing new convertible notes. The company tries to balance its obligations, including upcoming dividends and maturing debt. Despite some appetite for passive income, Strategy has slowed down its preferred share sales, abandoning the various risk tiers of preferred stocks. As a result, MSTR trades close to its 12-month low again. MSTR sank to $158.44, up from a recent low of $154.12. The common stock holds a market cap just above $49B, while the BTC reserves of Strategy are still valued at over $58B. The current BTC price of just above $88,000 has not translated into a higher price for MSTR. The playbook requirement for the common stock was to allow dilution only at a higher valuation. The playbook would work better with an MSTR price around $379, but the common stock has not traded at a premium for months. As of December, the BTC reserves of Strategy were more valuable than the market capitalization of MSTR. The common stock has acted as a BTC gains multiplier in the past. However, even at the lower range, Strategy has shown its conviction in buying more BTC despite the dilution. The company has positioned itself for long-term BTC growth, with the potential to survive a bear market or sideways trading. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Venture capitalists, however, are placing a decisive bet: 2026 will be the year artificial intelligence transitions from costly experiment to core business driver. A recent survey of two dozen top enterprise-focused VCs reveals a consensus that next year will mark a pivotal shift toward meaningful value and budget allocation. Enterprise AI Adoption: From Hype to Measurable Reality The journey since late 2022 has been marked by immense investment and innovation. Consequently, a landscape crowded with enterprise AI startups emerged. Despite this activity, a significant gap persists. An MIT survey from August 2025 found that 95% of enterprises reported no meaningful return on their AI investments. This disconnect between spending and results defines the current market tension. Therefore, the central question for business leaders is timing. When will the promised benefits materialize? Venture capitalists now provide a clear answer. They overwhelmingly point to 2026 as the inflection point. This prediction hinges on market maturation. Enterprises are moving beyond scattered pilot programs. They are now demanding concrete outcomes. The focus is shifting from mere adoption to integration and measurable ROI. The Data Behind the Prediction The VC consensus is not baseless optimism. It stems from observable trends in sales cycles, customer conversations, and technological readiness. Early adopters have navigated initial learning curves. Furthermore, AI tools have evolved beyond general-purpose chatbots. They are becoming specialized for specific business functions. This specialization is key to unlocking value. Key Enterprise AI Trends Set to Define 2026 VCs identify several critical trends that will shape the next phase of enterprise AI. These trends move beyond foundational model development. They focus on application, implementation, and infrastructure. Shift from Horizontal to Vertical Solutions: Investors see stronger moats in industry-specific applications. “It’s much easier today to build a moat in a vertical category,” notes Molly Alter of Northzone. Startups targeting healthcare, legal, manufacturing, and supply chain are gaining traction. The Rise of Voice AI: Marcie Vu of Greycroft highlights voice interaction as a major frontier. “Voice is a far more natural, efficient, and expressive way for people to communicate with machines,” she explains. This shift could redefine user interfaces for enterprise software. AI Reshapes the Physical World: Alexa von Tobel of Inspired Capital predicts AI’s move into infrastructure and climate tech. “We are moving from a reactive world to a predictive one,” she states, where systems prevent failures before they occur. Focus on Data Center & Energy Efficiency: As AI compute demand soars, investors like Aaron Jacobson of NEA are seeking “breakthroughs in performance per watt.” Innovations in cooling, networking, and chip design are critical for sustainable scale. The Path to ROI: Budgets, Moats, and Implementation For enterprises, the promise of 2026 hinges on smarter investment. VCs anticipate a significant rationalization of AI spending. Budgets will concentrate on proven solutions rather than spreading thin across experiments. “Budgets will increase for a narrow set of AI products that clearly deliver results, and will decline sharply for everything else,” predicts Rob Biederman of Asymmetric Capital Partners. This bifurcation will separate winners from the pack. Andrew Ferguson of Databricks Ventures adds that CIOs will push back on vendor sprawl, reallocating funds to technologies with demonstrable proof points. Building a Defensible AI Startup The criteria for startup success are also crystallizing. A compelling narrative alone is insufficient. Jake Flomenberg of Wing Venture Capital outlines the new bar for a Series A: a strong “why now” story paired with “concrete proof of enterprise adoption.” Revenue between $1-2 million ARR is a baseline, but customer perception as mission-critical is paramount. True defensibility, or a “moat,” increasingly stems from deep workflow integration and proprietary data—not model superiority. “If OpenAI launches a model tomorrow and is 10x better, does this company still have a reason to exist?” Flomenberg asks. Successful startups answer ‘yes’ through entrenched operational value. VC Outlook on 2026 Enterprise AI Budgets Trend VC Perspective Business Impact Budget Concentration Spend will focus on fewer, high-ROI vendors (Biederman, Asymmetric) Market consolidation; winners take majority of spend. ROI-Driven Investment Budgets follow proven value, not hype (Ferguson, Databricks Ventures) Increased scrutiny on pilot results and business case. Shift from Labor Spend AI budgets may replace portions of labor costs (Dham, Sapphire) AI adoption tied directly to operational efficiency gains. The Evolving Role of AI Agents Autonomous AI agents represent a major area of anticipation—and tempered expectations. Most VCs see 2026 as a year of foundational development rather than widespread transformation. Nnamdi Okike of 645 Ventures notes significant technical and compliance hurdles remain. However, Rajeev Dham of Sapphire envisions a move toward a “universal agent” that breaks down organizational silos. The consensus suggests agents will begin sophisticated collaboration with humans on complex tasks, evolving the division of labor. Conclusion: A Year of Reckoning and Realization The venture capital community delivers a unified message for 2026: the era of AI experimentation is closing. A new phase of strategic implementation and value realization is beginning. Enterprises will likely increase AI budgets, but with far greater selectivity. Success will belong to startups that solve specific, painful problems with deep integration. It will also belong to enterprises that focus their efforts. The prediction of strong enterprise AI adoption in 2026 carries weight because it addresses past failures. It moves the conversation from if AI will deliver value to how. The coming year will test this hypothesis. It will separate transformative tools from temporary trends. Ultimately, 2026 is poised to be the year enterprise AI grows up. FAQs Q1: Why are VCs predicting 2026 as the key year for enterprise AI? A1: VCs point to market maturation. Enterprises have completed initial experimentation phases and are now demanding measurable ROI. Technology has also advanced, with more specialized tools for vertical applications and better infrastructure for deployment. Q2: What is the biggest challenge for enterprises adopting AI? A2: The primary challenge is moving from pilot projects to production-scale integration that delivers clear return on investment. Many companies struggle with vendor sprawl, data integration, and quantifying the business impact of AI tools. Q3: Which AI application areas are VCs most excited about for 2026? A3: Investors highlight vertical enterprise software (especially in regulated industries), voice AI interfaces, AI for physical world and infrastructure monitoring, and technologies that improve data center energy efficiency for AI compute. Q4: How will enterprise AI budgets change in 2026? A4: VCs predict budgets will become more concentrated. Spending will increase for a small set of proven, high-ROI solutions while declining for experimental or overlapping tools. Overall spend may grow, but it will be far more focused. Q5: What does an AI startup need to succeed in 2026? A5: Success requires a combination of a compelling market narrative and tangible enterprise traction. Startups need to demonstrate not just revenue, but that their product is mission-critical to customers, with deep workflow integration and a defensible data or operational moat.

While macro sentiment, regulatory clarity, and network fundamentals all play a role, short-term price movements are often driven by liquidity dynamics that unfold quietly on exchanges. In XRP’s case, on-chain signals are beginning to reveal why upside momentum has struggled to hold. According to data highlighted by STEPH IS CRYPTO, a notable shift has occurred on Binance , the largest exchange by trading volume. The analyst pointed to a sharp rise in XRP deposits beginning around December 15, a development that has important implications for near-term price action. After this initial reference, Steph’s analysis centers on what these inflows typically signal within the crypto market structure. Rising Binance inflows are adding sell pressure to $XRP . Since Dec 15, daily deposits jumped sharply, peaking at 116M XRP. Rapid exchange inflows are often a sign of intent to sell. pic.twitter.com/53KRXskXog — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 29, 2025 Rising Exchange Inflows and Sell-Side Risk On-chain metrics consistently show that rapid inflows of tokens to centralized exchanges tend to precede increased selling activity. When XRP moves from self-custody wallets into Binance, it becomes instantly available for spot sales, margin trading, or derivatives positioning. This transition alone does not guarantee selling, but it meaningfully raises the probability of added sell-side pressure. Steph’s data shows daily XRP deposits climbing aggressively, eventually peaking at roughly 116 million XRP in a single day. This is not a routine fluctuation. Such a volume increase represents a behavioral shift among holders, signaling preparedness to transact rather than long-term storage. Why Binance Matters More Than Other Exchanges The concentration of these inflows on Binance is especially significant. Binance remains the deepest liquidity venue for XRP, meaning activity there often sets the tone for global price discovery. Large sell orders placed on Binance are quickly reflected across other exchanges through arbitrage mechanisms, amplifying their market impact. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Historically, periods of elevated XRP inflows to Binance have aligned with price consolidation or corrective phases. This pattern reinforces the idea that exchange-side liquidity expansion, when not matched by rising demand, tends to cap upside moves. The Timing Factor Behind the Surge The mid-December timing adds further context. This period often coincides with year-end portfolio adjustments, risk-off positioning, and heightened derivatives exposure across crypto markets. Against this backdrop, the sudden influx of XRP suggests deliberate positioning rather than random wallet movements. Importantly, this activity does not undermine XRP’s broader utility or long-term adoption narrative. It reflects short-term holder behavior responding to market conditions, not a deterioration in network fundamentals. What It Means for XRP Going Forward As long as elevated Binance inflows persist, XRP may face continued resistance during attempted rallies . A sustained reduction in deposits, or a shift toward net outflows, would be a stronger signal that sell pressure is easing. For now, the data underscores a clear reality: liquidity is moving toward exchanges, and in the short term, that flow is working against XRP’s price momentum.

The stock’s price closed on Friday at a brand new all-time high, capping a rally that now stands above last year’s 48.3% gain, according to data from FactSet. The surge did not come from a single day. Shares rose almost 13% this month, extending a streak to five straight months of gains. Trading activity stayed positive week after week starting in June. The stock’s biggest weekly jump came on Oct. 21, when it climbed 19.3% after the company reported third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street expectations and raised full-year guidance. Management also said earnings in 2026 should exceed 2025 levels. GM executives have argued for years that the stock price did not match earnings results. Mary Barra, chief executive officer of General Motors, repeated that message during the October earnings call. “Great vehicles, innovative technology, a rewarding customer experience, along with strong financial results, will continue to set GM apart in an increasingly competitive landscape,” Mary said during the call. While GM stock climbed, Mary reduced her personal stake. Public filings confirmed she exercised options or sold about 1.8 million shares this year, worth more than $73 million. As of the last filing in September, she still owned over 433,500 shares, valued above $35 million. Most of her yearly pay came through stock and options rather than cash. Over the past five years, GM’s adjusted earnings per share have steadily exceeded Wall Street estimates in every quarter except the second quarter of 2022. The GM stock’s performance also stood out across the sector. Tesla stock rose by about 17% this year, Ford Motor gained 34%, while Stellantis, the parent of Chrysler, fell by roughly 15%. Other U.S.-listed automakers, including Honda Motor, Toyota Motor, and Lucid Group, posted smaller gains over the same period. Analyst upgrades, policy changes, and buybacks drive GM‘s rally Analysts pointed to cash flow, steady earnings, and shareholder returns as reasons behind the move. Stock buybacks remained a major factor. Paul Jacobson, chief financial officer of General Motors, addressed that point earlier this month. “As long as the stock remains as undervalued as it is, the priority is to buy back shares,” Paul said during a UBS investor conference. “And I think you’ll continue to see that from us going forward.” UBS raised its 12-month price target by 14% to $97 and named the company its top auto pick heading into 2026. Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to overweight with a $90 price target. Andrew Percoco, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a Dec. 7 investor note that the company leads peers in unit sales growth, average transaction price growth, disciplined incentive spending, and inventory control. He said those factors produced stronger margins and return metrics than rivals. Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s administration loosened U.S. fuel economy and emissions rules, removed penalties set under the prior administration, and renegotiated a trade agreement with South Korea, a major manufacturing base for the company. At the same time, the auto industry faced slower growth in lower-margin electric vehicle sales. Joseph Spak, an analyst at UBS, said in a Dec. 15 investor note that the automaker is positioned to benefit from a relaxed U.S. regulatory setup tied to emissions and fuel economy rules. By press time, analyst averages compiled by FactSet have rated the stock overweight with an $80.86 target price, placing it among the most closely watched stock market trades heading into 2026.

Analysts at JPMorgan, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, recently applied a “volatility-adjusted BTC-to-gold relative valuation” model, estimating Bitcoin’s implied fair value near $170,000. While this figure is better viewed as a model-based upper bound rather than a firm year-end 2026 target, it reinforces the view that upside may still exist over the next 6–12 months. Against this development, large-cap altcoins such as XRP, Solana (SOL), and Ethereum (ETH) are attracting attention as the best crypto to buy heading into 2026. XRP Weekly Chart Signals Compression Phase With $5 as H1 2026 Recovery Target Launched in 2012, Ripples’ XRP remains one of the longest-standing crypto assets and continues to rank among the top five by market capitalization, currently valued above $112 billion. On the weekly XRP/USDT chart, price is trading around $1.87, modestly higher on the week but still under pressure. XRP has been constrained by a clearly defined descending trendline since peaking near $3.49 in mid-2025, with price compressing lower over subsequent months. Source: TradingView The RSI sits near 37, hovering close to oversold territory, while its downward trajectory suggests bearish momentum has not yet fully dissipated. A decisive breakout above the descending resistance would be required to shift sentiment. In that scenario, the initial recovery zone aligns with the prior high near $3.49 as a potential early-2026 target. Solana Demand Zone Holds Near $124, Resistance Stands at $195 and $250 Solana(SOL) is a high-performance blockchain optimized for fast, low-cost transactions and decentralized applications. Since launching in 2020, SOL has delivered outsized gains over its lifetime, though recent price action reflects a sharp correction. After failing to hold above the $200 level, SOL has retraced more than 55% from its cycle highs. The weekly chart shows price consolidating around $124, just above a long-term demand zone between $115 and $132. Source: TradingView Historically, this zone has acted as a base during periods of broader market weakness and remains a critical level to prevent deeper downside. On any recovery attempt, the $186–$195 region stands out as the first major resistance. Beyond that, the $235–$250 supply zone represents a longer-term 2026 recovery objective, which would likely require a sustained improvement in momentum and broader market conditions. Ethereum Price Outlook: Holding Above $3,000 Keeps $4,900+ 2026 Target in Focus Ethereum(ETH) remains the largest smart-contract platform and the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, valued at over $365 billion. Since its 2015 launch, ETH has delivered exponential long-term growth, though it is currently trading well below its 2025 highs. ETH is down roughly 35% from its recent peak, but the recovery above $3,000 is a constructive technical development. If this level continues to hold on a weekly basis, the next resistance zones are clustered between $3,600–$4,000 and $4,400–$4,800. Maintaining support above the long-term $2,400 level would keep the broader bullish structure intact, leaving room for a potential move toward new highs in 2026.

Analysts Warn of Traps And Bounces,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-bear-market-far-from-over-analysts-warn-of-traps-and-bounces/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has struggled to move past its October weakness, even after being one of the best-performing assets during the first nine months of 2025. The cryptocurrency briefly climbed above $90,000 on Monday as traders bet on a New Year rebound. However, the uptick did not last long, as BTC fell back to around $87,000. Analysts are warning investors that such short-term gains could be liquidity traps, followed by renewed selling pressure. Short-Term Bounce, Long-Term Pain Bitcoin is currently over 30% down from its all-time high of $126,000 in October. Crypto analyst Mr Wall Street described the asset as being in a bear market, and said that market makers are likely to continue pushing prices lower over the medium term. However, he noted that in the short term, there could be a relief bounce designed to create liquidity before another move down. According to his view, such a bounce could then be followed by a decline toward the $64,000-$70,000 range, which he identified as the next downside target. Additionally, Doctor Profit echoed a similar broader sentiment. In the latest tweet, the analyst explained that Bitcoin remains in a strong bear market and that a market bottom has not yet been reached. In a previous post, he warned BTC traders against expecting to “buy the crash” in the coming weeks since the downtrend could extend much longer. He believes Bitcoin may not bottom out until September or October 2026. Based on that outlook, Doctor Profit said he sees little benefit in holding USDT, and instead prefers to keep capital working through large allocations to silver and gold. He even went on to disclose a major Bitcoin short entered between $115,000 and $125,000. Despite his long-term bearish stance, Doctor Profit added that he holds a medium-sized BTC position in the short term, expecting a sideways phase and a potential move up toward $107,000 before another leg lower, possibly in February or March. Bear Market Structure Several on-chain metrics also point to a bear market structure forming. Long-term holders, for instance, are no longer consistently taking profits, as evidenced by LTH SOPR hovering around 1.0. This level is historically below strong bull markets. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin Cycle Market Index (BCMI) has declined along with the price rather than stabilizing, which means that further downside or extended consolidation may be ahead. This indicates the market is transitioning into a bear phase, which is defined more by time and distribution than by quick price moves. The post Bitcoin Bear Market Far From Over?

After years defined by retail speculation, sharp boom-and-bust cycles, and regulatory uncertainty, 2026 is shaping up as a year where institutional demand plays a central role in shaping adoption, liquidity, and market structure. As the crypto market matures, communication strategies are evolving alongside it. Institutional audiences tend to respond less to broad promotional messaging and more to narratives grounded in market context, timing, and relevance. This shift has led to the emergence of data-driven public relations models tailored specifically for blockchain and Web3. One example is Outset PR , a specialized agency that approaches crypto communications through continuous market analysis rather than static outreach. From speculative growth to structural expansion Over the past decade, crypto markets expanded largely on the back of retail participation and emerging narratives. While this fueled innovation, it also amplified volatility. By contrast, the outlook for 2026 points to a gradual shift toward structural growth. Institutional players — asset managers, custodians, payment providers, and corporate treasuries — are increasingly treating digital assets as part of broader financial systems rather than standalone speculative instruments. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, regulated custodial services, and clearer accounting treatment have lowered operational barriers that previously limited participation. This shift does not eliminate volatility, but it changes its nature. Liquidity becomes deeper, market behavior more correlated with macro conditions, and asset selection increasingly driven by fundamentals. Bitcoin’s evolving role in institutional portfolios Bitcoin remains the primary entry point for institutional exposure. By 2026, its role is expected to be less about short-term price appreciation and more about portfolio allocation. Institutions tend to frame Bitcoin as a non-sovereign, scarce digital asset with asymmetric risk characteristics. This does not make it immune to macro shocks, but it anchors demand to longer-term theses such as inflation hedging, balance sheet diversification, and liquidity management. As a result, Bitcoin’s market behavior may increasingly resemble that of a macro-sensitive asset rather than a purely speculative one. Periods of consolidation could become more common, with sharper moves tied to liquidity cycles rather than retail sentiment. Tokenization of real-world assets moves into focus One of the most cited themes for 2026 is the tokenization of real-world assets. Unlike earlier cycles dominated by native crypto tokens, this trend centers on bringing traditional assets — such as government bonds, real estate, and credit instruments — onto blockchain rails. For institutions, the appeal is practical rather than ideological. Tokenization can improve settlement speed, reduce operational costs, and enable programmable compliance. Several large financial institutions are already piloting tokenized treasuries and on-chain funds. If adoption accelerates, real-world assets could become one of the largest sources of on-chain value, even if they do not translate directly into speculative token price growth. Their impact may be felt more in network usage, fee generation, and infrastructure demand. How data-driven communications shape crypto narratives Founded by PR strategist Mike Ermolaev, Outset PR connects market events with storytelling by closely tracking not only on-chain activity, but also media trendlines and audience behavior. Instead of relying on templated coverage, each campaign is structured to align with prevailing market momentum. A core component of this approach is the agency’s proprietary Outset Data Pulse intelligence system, which analyzes media traffic distribution and engagement patterns to determine when and where a message is most likely to gain traction. This data informs publication timing, outlet selection, and the framing of each pitch. Outset PR also applies an internal Syndication Map , designed to identify which publications generate the strongest secondary exposure across aggregators such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square. As a result, campaigns often achieve visibility well beyond their original placements. In a market where attention cycles are increasingly compressed, this type of market-fit storytelling reflects a broader trend: crypto narratives are becoming more analytical, better timed, and more closely tied to measurable demand rather than hype. Stablecoins as financial plumbing Stablecoins are likely to remain the most widely used crypto product in 2026. Their role continues to expand beyond trading into payments, treasury operations, and cross-border settlements. Regulatory frameworks — particularly in the United States and Europe — are expected to clarify issuance rules, reserve requirements, and compliance standards. While regulation may limit some issuers, it also legitimizes stablecoins as financial instruments rather than fringe tools. For the broader market, stablecoins act as liquidity anchors. Their growth supports on-chain activity across exchanges, DeFi protocols, and payment networks, even during periods of subdued speculative interest. AI, automation, and financial tooling Another trend expected to gain traction is the integration of AI-driven tools into crypto finance. Rather than consumer-facing products, most adoption is likely to occur behind the scenes. Automated risk management, compliance monitoring, liquidity optimization, and portfolio analytics are areas where AI intersects naturally with blockchain-based finance. These tools appeal to institutions seeking efficiency and oversight rather than novelty. The result is incremental improvement in infrastructure quality rather than disruptive breakthroughs — a pattern consistent with market maturation. Altcoins face a higher bar The outlook for altcoins in 2026 is more selective than in previous cycles. Liquidity concentration around Bitcoin and Ethereum, combined with institutional preference for established assets, raises the threshold for sustained altcoin performance. Projects with clear revenue models, enterprise adoption, or infrastructure relevance may attract attention. Others may struggle to maintain visibility in a market that increasingly rewards demonstrable usage over narrative momentum. Crypto outlook for 2026 The crypto market of 2026 is unlikely to resemble the explosive rallies of earlier cycles. Instead, it appears set to evolve into a more integrated segment of global finance. Institutional demand will not eliminate volatility or guarantee price appreciation, but it will shape adoption in a more structured way. Infrastructure, regulation, and real-world use cases are replacing hype as the primary growth drivers. For market participants, the focus is shifting from chasing momentum to understanding where long-term demand is forming — a sign that crypto is no longer only an emerging experiment, but an evolving financial sector.

However, selective demand for newer exchange-traded products linked to XRP and Solana offered a contrasting signal. The latest weekly flow data shows investors remain cautious after recent price volatility, even as some assets attract fresh interest. Consequently, the market now reflects a mix of defensive positioning and targeted accumulation rather than broad risk appetite. Last week, crypto investment products recorded net outflows totaling $446 million. This development pushed cumulative withdrawals since the early October market shock to $3.2 billion. Hence, sentiment has yet to return to levels seen before the sharp price decline. Although yearly inflows still appear strong on paper, investor outcomes look less favorable once market losses enter the equation. Year-to-date inflows currently stand near $46.3 billion, slightly below last year’s pace. However, assets under management have increased by only about 10% this year. Consequently, the average investor has gained little despite steady capital deployment. This gap highlights the impact of volatile pricing rather than declining participation. Regional Flows Show Diverging Investor Behavior Outflows last week concentrated heavily in the United States, which recorded withdrawals of roughly $460 million. Additionally, Switzerland posted modest outflows, reflecting a cautious stance across several developed markets. However, Germany moved in the opposite direction and attracted $35.7 million in new inflows. Source: CoinShares Significantly, Germany has now led monthly inflows with $248 million. This trend suggests investors there view recent price weakness as a buying opportunity. Moreover, the pattern points to a more selective approach rather than broad retreat from digital assets. XRP and Solana ETFs Attract Consistent Demand While most major assets faced pressure, XRP and Solana products continued drawing capital. XRP funds recorded inflows of $70.2 million last week, while Solana products added $7.5 million. Since their mid-October ETF launches in the United States, both assets have accumulated more than $1 billion each. Source: CoinShares However, Bitcoin and Ethereum followed a different path. Bitcoin funds saw $443 million in weekly outflows, while Ethereum products lost $59.5 million.

This transaction, valued at approximately $39.31 million, represents just one part of a much larger, strategic repositioning that analysts are now scrutinizing for clues about institutional sentiment in the current market cycle. The move, first flagged by respected on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, adds to a single-day total of 46,036 ETH withdrawn, spotlighting a major player actively adjusting its monumental digital asset holdings. Decoding the Trend Research ETH Withdrawal from Binance The recent withdrawal by Trend Research is not an isolated event. Instead, it forms a critical data point within a broader narrative of institutional accumulation and portfolio management. According to the verifiable on-chain data, the specific wallet address associated with this activity now holds a staggering 626,071 ETH , an amount equivalent to roughly $1.83 billion at current prices. This positions the entity as one of the most significant non-exchange holders of Ethereum globally. Furthermore, the data reveals a crucial detail: the average acquisition price for this vast position sits at $3,105.5 per ETH. Consequently, with Ethereum’s price currently below this level, the position carries an estimated unrealized loss of $110 million . This context transforms a simple withdrawal into a story of cost-basis management, long-term conviction, and potential risk mitigation. On-chain analysts like ai_9684xtpa provide essential transparency for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Their work involves monitoring blockchain addresses linked to large funds, exchanges, and known entities. By tracking flows to and from centralized exchanges like Binance, they can infer potential intentions. A withdrawal of this scale to a private, cold, or custodial wallet typically suggests an intent to hold for the medium to long term, often referred to as moving assets “off-exchange.” This action reduces immediate selling pressure on the market and signals a holder’s commitment beyond short-term trading. Transaction Volume: 13,462 ETH ($39.31M) in the latest move, part of a 46,036 ETH daily total. Total Holdings: 626,071 ETH, worth approximately $1.83 billion. Cost Basis: Average purchase price of $3,105.5 per ETH. Financial Position: An unrealized loss of around $110 million at current valuations. The Strategic Implications of Major Ethereum Movements Large-scale movements of Ethereum by institutional entities like Trend Research and its parent firm, LD Capital, serve as a barometer for sophisticated market sentiment. LD Capital is a well-established venture capital and hedge fund focused exclusively on the blockchain sector, with a portfolio spanning hundreds of projects. Its subsidiary, Trend Research, is tasked with market analysis and strategic investment execution. Therefore, their actions are closely watched by other funds, retail investors, and market commentators for directional cues. The decision to withdraw such a large sum from Binance, rather than sell it, indicates a specific strategic calculus. Several plausible explanations exist for this move, each rooted in common institutional practices. First, it could be a routine rebalancing or security procedure, moving assets from a “hot” exchange wallet to a more secure, multi-signature custody solution. Second, it may reflect a hedging strategy, where the physical asset is secured while derivative positions (like futures or options) are used to manage price risk. Third, and most significantly for market observers, it could signal a belief that the current price represents a strategic accumulation zone, despite the paper loss. Holding through volatility is a hallmark of long-term institutional investment theses in emerging asset classes. Understanding Unrealized Loss in Crypto Portfolios The concept of an “unrealized loss” is fundamental to interpreting this news. An unrealized loss (or gain) is a paper loss that exists on paper because the asset’s current market price is below its purchase price, but the asset has not yet been sold. For a fund like LD Capital, which invests with a multi-year horizon, short-to-medium-term paper losses are an expected part of the volatility inherent in cryptocurrency markets. The key metric they monitor is not daily P&L but whether the core investment thesis for Ethereum—its utility as a decentralized computing platform, its scaling roadmap, and its adoption metrics—remains intact. Historical precedent is informative. Major funds and early Bitcoin investors frequently endured drawdowns of 50% or more before their holdings appreciated orders of magnitude beyond their cost basis. The decision to withdraw more coins at a loss, rather than sell, can be interpreted as “doubling down” on conviction or simply executing a pre-defined dollar-cost averaging plan regardless of price. This behavior contrasts sharply with panic selling, which is often observed in retail-driven downturns. Trend Research Ethereum Position Snapshot Metric Detail Latest Withdrawal 13,462 ETH ($39.31M) 24-Hour Withdrawal Total 46,036 ETH Total Wallet Holdings 626,071 ETH Total Holdings Value ~$1.83 Billion Average Purchase Price $3,105.5 Estimated Unrealized Loss $110 Million Broader Market Context and the Role of On-Chain Data The cryptocurrency market in early 2025 continues to evolve within a complex macro environment. Factors such as global interest rate policies, regulatory developments, and technological upgrades like Ethereum’s ongoing “Surge” towards greater scalability all influence asset prices. In this climate, on-chain analytics has emerged as a vital discipline, providing a transparent, real-time ledger of whale and institutional activity. Analysts like ai_9684xtpa use these tools to move beyond price charts and gauge the underlying behavior of major capital allocators. When a known entity like Trend Research makes a move, it is often cross-referenced with other data points. For instance, analysts might examine exchange netflow metrics (total inflows vs. outflows), stablecoin reserves, or derivatives funding rates to build a composite picture. A large withdrawal coinciding with negative exchange netflows and increasing stablecoin reserves can indicate building bullish pressure, as assets are pulled off the market and buying power sits ready. Conversely, this activity must always be analyzed with caution, as one entity’s actions do not guarantee a market-wide trend. The transparency of blockchain data is a double-edged sword. While it allows for unprecedented analysis, it also means large players know their moves are public. Some sophisticated entities may use complex networks of addresses to obfuscate their true intentions. However, consistent patterns from verified addresses, like those linked to LD Capital and Trend Research, remain a highly trusted source of insight for the professional investment community. Conclusion The recent Trend Research ETH withdrawal from Binance, totaling $39.3 million, is a transaction rich with strategic implications. Far more than a simple transfer, it highlights the actions of a major institutional holder managing a billion-dollar Ethereum position currently at an unrealized loss. This move underscores a potential long-term conviction in the asset’s fundamentals, a commitment to secure custody, and a calculated approach to portfolio management that transcends short-term price volatility. For market participants, such on-chain events provide invaluable, transparent insight into the behavior of sophisticated capital, emphasizing that in cryptocurrency markets, the most significant stories often unfold not on the price chart, but on the immutable ledger beneath it. Monitoring these flows remains essential for understanding the underlying forces shaping the digital asset landscape. FAQs Q1: What is Trend Research, and who is LD Capital? Trend Research is the market analysis and investment execution subsidiary of LD Capital, a major Asia-based cryptocurrency and blockchain-focused venture capital and hedge fund. LD Capital has invested in hundreds of crypto projects and is considered a significant institutional player in the space. Q2: Why does withdrawing ETH from Binance matter? Large withdrawals from centralized exchanges to private wallets typically reduce the immediate sell-side supply on the exchange. This action is often interpreted as a sign of intent to hold the asset for the longer term (“hodling”) rather than trading it imminently, which can be viewed as a bullish signal for underlying asset conviction. Q3: What is an “unrealized loss,” and why is it relevant? An unrealized loss is a decrease in the value of an asset that is still being held, meaning the loss is “on paper” but not locked in because the asset has not been sold. It’s relevant because it shows the cost basis of a holder’s position and their current financial stance. Holding through a large paper loss can indicate strong long-term belief in the asset’s recovery and future appreciation. Q4: How reliable is on-chain data from analysts like ai_9684xtpa? On-chain data from the blockchain itself is 100% verifiable and objective. The reliability comes from the analyst’s ability to accurately cluster and label addresses to real-world entities. Reputable analysts like ai_9684xtpa build their track record through consistent, accurate labeling and cross-referencing with known exchange wallets and fund disclosures. Q5: Could this large withdrawal affect Ethereum’s price? A single withdrawal, by itself, does not directly move the market price. However, it contributes to broader exchange flow metrics. If many large holders simultaneously withdraw assets (a trend of negative exchange netflow), it can reduce readily available sell-side liquidity, potentially making the market more susceptible to upward price moves if new buying demand enters.

CS2, Dota 2, and Valorant are no longer “extra categories” inside sportsbooks — for many players, they are the main reason to bet. And as esports has evolved, so has the way people wager on it. Today, the most active bettors are choosing crypto sportsbooks for esports. Faster deposits, instant payouts, global access, and fewer restrictions make cryptocurrency betting a natural fit for competitive gaming. But not every platform handles esports equally well. Below, we review the top crypto sportsbooks for CS2, Dota 2, and Valorant, with a clear emphasis on platforms that are actually built for esports markets — not just adapted to them. What Matters Most in a Crypto Esports Sportsbook Before diving into specific platforms, it’s worth clarifying what really matters when betting on esports with crypto. The criteria are different from traditional sports. At a minimum, a strong esports-focused crypto sportsbook should offer: Deep markets for CS2, Dota 2, and Valorant (maps, rounds, props) Stable live betting, without constant suspensions Fast crypto settlement, especially during in-play betting Clear rules around KYC and withdrawals Without these, even the biggest brand can feel frustrating in real gameplay situations. Dexsport — Built for CS2, Dota 2, and Valorant Betting Dexsport stands out as one of the few platforms that treats esports as a core product, not a side feature. The sportsbook is crypto-native by design, which becomes especially important when betting on fast-moving titles like CS2 and Valorant. Registration is instant and requires no identity verification. Users can sign up via email, Telegram, or wallet connection and immediately start betting with crypto. There’s no delay between deposit and market access — a crucial detail for live esports betting. What really defines Dexsport is market structure. Instead of offering dozens of shallow markets, it focuses on depth where it matters: match and map winners round totals and handicaps live in-play props during momentum shifts esports-specific betting logic rather than recycled sports models Live betting is supported across CS2, Dota 2, and Valorant, with Cash Out available to manage positions in real time. Odds update smoothly, and markets reopen quickly after key moments — something many platforms struggle with. Transparency is another major strength. Dexsport operates a public live bet desk where wagers and outcomes can be observed in real time. For crypto bettors, this level of openness reinforces trust, especially during high-volume esports sessions. For players who focus primarily on esports, Dexsport feels less like a general sportsbook and more like a platform tuned to the rhythm of competitive gaming. Thunderpick — Esports-First, Narrower Scope Thunderpick is one of the most esports-centric crypto betting platforms on the market. CS2, Dota 2, and Valorant are at the center of its offering, supported by live betting and integrated streams. The platform runs entirely on crypto deposits and withdrawals, which keeps transactions relatively fast. For esports-only bettors, Thunderpick delivers a focused experience with solid market coverage. However, its scope is narrower than multi-sport platforms, and some users report slower withdrawals during peak periods. KYC may also be required for higher withdrawal amounts, which can be a drawback for players seeking fully frictionless crypto betting. Stake — Massive Coverage, Traditional Constraints Stake is one of the most recognizable names in crypto betting. It offers a huge range of esports titles alongside traditional sports, with polished live betting tools, streaming, and competitive odds. From a market selection standpoint, Stake performs well for CS2 and Dota 2. However, it operates closer to a traditional sportsbook model. KYC is mandatory at withdrawal, and bonus wagering requirements can be demanding — especially for esports bettors who rely on smaller, frequent bets. Stake suits users who value brand reputation and market breadth, but it may feel restrictive compared to more crypto-native esports platforms. Lucky Block — High Bonuses, Mixed Esports Experience Lucky Block combines sportsbook, casino, and esports betting under one ecosystem. It supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies and offers generous welcome bonuses, which attract new users quickly. Esports markets for CS2, Dota 2, and Valorant are available, along with live betting and streaming. However, esports is not the platform’s sole focus. Some users have reported account reviews during withdrawals, which can interrupt the betting flow. Lucky Block works better for casual esports bettors who enjoy promotions, rather than players placing frequent, high-volume bets. Mega Dice — Broad Offering, Developing Esports Depth Mega Dice positions itself as an all-in-one crypto platform, combining casino games with a growing sportsbook. Esports betting is supported, including live markets, but depth is still expanding compared to esports-first platforms. The lack of mandatory KYC and broad crypto support make it accessible, but advanced esports bettors may find market coverage limited in comparison to Dexsport or Thunderpick. Which Platform Is Best for Esports Bettors? The right choice depends on how central esports is to your betting activity. Dexsport is best suited for serious esports bettors who want depth, live control, transparency, and a crypto-native experience. Thunderpick works well for esports-only users who don’t need broad sports coverage. Stake appeals to bettors who want everything in one place and accept KYC trade-offs. Lucky Block and Mega Dice fit more casual or promotion-driven players. How to Choose the Right Crypto Sportsbook for Esports Betting Before settling on a platform for CS2, Dota 2, or Valorant, it helps to step back and evaluate how you actually bet. Esports wagering is fast, emotional, and often momentum-driven — which means the sportsbook you use can either support your strategy or quietly work against it. Here are a few practical points experienced esports bettors tend to focus on. 1. Market behavior during live play Not all sportsbooks handle live esports well. Pay attention to how often markets suspend, how quickly odds reopen, and whether in-play options disappear at critical moments. Smooth market flow usually matters more than having hundreds of bet types. 2. Odds stability vs. reaction speed In esports, odds should react quickly — but not erratically. Platforms that constantly reprice or overcorrect after every round make it harder to execute a strategy. Consistent, predictable odds movement is often a sign of better internal risk models. 3. Cash Out as a real tool, not decoration Many sportsbooks advertise Cash Out, but few make it genuinely usable in esports. If you plan to hedge or lock profit mid-match, test how Cash Out behaves during high-pressure moments like overtime or map point situations. 4. Crypto settlement speed When betting with cryptocurrency, delays compound frustration. Instant balance updates and fast withdrawals matter far more in esports than in pre-match sports betting, especially if you place multiple live bets per session. 5. Transparency and rule clarity Esports betting disputes usually come down to interpretation — map restarts, pauses, or technical outcomes. Platforms that clearly define settlement rules and provide visibility into bet resolution reduce long-term risk for active bettors. Taking a few minutes to evaluate these factors often reveals more than bonus size or brand recognition. Final Thoughts CS2, Dota 2, and Valorant betting demands speed, precision, and platform reliability. In this environment, crypto sportsbooks clearly outperform traditional models — but only when esports is treated as a priority. Dexsport stands out by aligning crypto infrastructure with esports logic: fast markets, real-time control, no KYC friction, and transparent settlement. For players who consistently bet on esports rather than occasionally dabble, that alignment makes a noticeable difference. In a crowded field of crypto sportsbooks, Dexsport doesn’t just support esports — it’s built around them.",More News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-12-29 15:29:08

Partnerships, product updates, protocol upgrades, and funding milestones arrive daily. Most receive limited attention beyond the projects’ own channels. In crypto, attention is scarce and editorial scrutiny is high. Tier-1 coverage in crypto depends less on the scale of an announcement than on its relevance to ongoing market, regulatory, or technical narratives. A Credibility Gap in Crypto Established blockchain ecosystems benefit from recognition built over years. Smaller projects do not. Their updates often lack the context journalists require to justify coverage, particularly at outlets that limit or avoid sponsored content. Editors prioritize material that explains broader developments rather than promotes individual initiatives. Announcements that fail to address a wider question are typically passed over. From Announcement to Narrative For emerging Web3 teams, the central challenge is not producing news but framing it. Journalists assess whether an update contributes to an existing discussion — for example, shifts in infrastructure design, regulatory enforcement, security risks, or capital flows. Without a clear connection to these themes, even substantive developments may appear isolated. Timing also plays a role. Updates released outside the news cycle or disconnected from current events are less likely to gain traction. Press Office by Outset PR Offers Structural Solution Press Office by Outset PR applies an editorial process to this problem. Rather than distributing announcements as standalone items, the service focuses on shaping them into commentary that aligns with what journalists are already covering. This includes identifying relevant angles, refining language for clarity, and selecting release timing based on the media cycle. The objective is not amplification but usability. By delivering material that fits editorial needs, smaller projects increase the likelihood that their updates are considered alongside broader industry developments. Distribution without Paid Placement At many leading business and crypto publications, paid placements are limited or unavailable. Coverage is earned through relevance and reliability. Press Office models operate within this constraint. They rely on organic outreach and ongoing relationships with journalists, prioritizing consistency over one-off exposure. In some cases, a single well-framed update may generate multiple references across outlets, particularly when it addresses a widely discussed issue. Repeated inclusion in coverage can gradually change how a project is perceived. Sources that consistently provide clear, timely insight tend to be cited again, sometimes without prompting. For early-stage or mid-sized Web3 firms, this accumulation of earned mentions can help establish credibility that advertising alone does not provide. Conclusion In Web3, attention is governed by editorial logic rather than announcement volume. Projects that understand this distinction are more likely to be noticed. Press Office by Outset PR reflects this approach, applying newsroom discipline to how crypto news is framed and timed. For smaller projects operating without established reputations, this method offers a structured way to participate in coverage driven by relevance rather than promotion.

In his latest chart analysis, he emphasizes that the 20-day exponential moving average, currently positioned around $1.92, represents the most immediate resistance level that buyers need to overcome. According to his assessment, this area stands out as the point where bullish participation could begin to strengthen if the price manages to reclaim it. The chart shared by ChartNerd shows XRP trading below the descending 20 EMA, reflecting a short-term downtrend that has persisted through recent sessions. Price has continued to print lower lows, reinforcing the idea that sellers have remained in control. However, he suggests that this structure may be approaching a turning point, provided that the market can challenge and break above the moving average that has capped price advances so far. By highlighting the daily 20 EMA as the key barrier, ChartNerd underlines its role as dynamic resistance. A sustained move above this level would, in his view, signal that bullish momentum is beginning to return and that buyers are prepared to defend higher prices after a prolonged period of downward pressure. $XRP : The Daily 20 EMA at $1.92 remains the key imminent resistance for the bulls to step in and break during this bullish divergence build. https://t.co/KCWgzWJvVW pic.twitter.com/jGJvApZZ07 — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) December 27, 2025 Bullish Divergence Signals Potential Shift in Momentum While price continues to trend lower, ChartNerd points to an emerging bullish divergence on the momentum indicator displayed beneath the chart. The oscillator, which reflects relative strength, is forming higher lows even as XRP records lower lows on the price chart. Technical traders commonly watch this divergence as a sign that downside momentum may be weakening. In the image, the momentum line rises gradually from the oversold region near the low 30s, contrasting with the downward slope seen in price action. ChartNerd interprets this as evidence that selling pressure is losing strength, even though the price has not yet confirmed a reversal. He frames this setup as a divergence build that is still in progress, rather than a completed signal. The analyst stresses that the divergence alone is not sufficient to confirm a bullish shift. Instead, he links its significance directly to the behavior around the 20 EMA. Only a decisive move above the $1.92 area would validate the idea that bulls are stepping back into the market and that the divergence is translating into price strength. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Focus on Confirmation ChartNerd’s analysis focus firmly on confirmation rather than anticipation. His commentary suggests that XRP remains in a vulnerable position as long as it trades below the highlighted resistance, despite the constructive signal forming on momentum indicators. The structure of lower lows on price remains intact, meaning that any bullish case depends on a change in that pattern. By combining the descending moving average with the developing divergence, ChartNerd presents a clear framework for traders watching XRP. The coming sessions, in his view, will be defined by whether price can challenge and reclaim the daily 20 EMA. Until that occurs, the setup remains one of potential rather than certainty. Overall, his analysis frames $1.92 as the level to watch, with the evolving bullish divergence offering early signs that momentum could shift if buyers manage to take control.

What used to be a side feature on traditional sportsbooks is now a standalone ecosystem where speed, liquidity, and platform design matter more than brand size. This is especially true for Dota 2 and CS2, where live markets move fast and bettors expect instant execution. In that environment, not every crypto sportsbook can keep up. Many platforms technically support esports, but few are actually built for dota betting crypto and CS2 betting with crypto at scale. That’s where Dexsport stands apart. Esports Betting Is Not Like Traditional Sports Betting If you’ve ever tried placing live bets on Dota 2 or CS2 using a legacy sportsbook, you’ve probably felt the friction. Markets suspend too often. Odds lag behind the action. Cash Out either doesn’t exist or arrives too late to matter. Esports betting requires a different approach: faster odds refresh deeper in-play markets (maps, rounds, momentum swings) instant balance updates, especially when betting with crypto Dexsport is designed around these exact mechanics rather than adapting old sports infrastructure to esports. Built for Dota 2 and CS2 from the Ground Up Dexsport treats Dota 2 and CS2 as core verticals, not secondary add-ons. Markets are structured around how esports fans actually watch and bet. You’ll find coverage that goes beyond simple match winners: map and series outcomes round totals and handicaps live in-play props during key phases momentum-driven odds updates This depth is essential for anyone serious about dota 2 esports crypto betting or csgo esports crypto betting. It allows strategy, not just guessing. Why Crypto Makes More Sense for Esports Esports matches don’t pause for banking systems. Neither should your sportsbook. Dexsport’s crypto-native infrastructure removes common friction points: no waiting for fiat deposits no manual withdrawal approvals no forced identity verification You can register via email, Telegram, or wallet connection and start dota 2 betting with crypto almost immediately. For active esports bettors, this speed is not a bonus — it’s a requirement. Live Betting and Cash Out That Actually Work One of Dexsport’s biggest strengths in CS2 and Dota 2 betting is live control. Cash Out is available during live matches, allowing bettors to: secure profit after a favorable swing reduce exposure when momentum shifts exit volatile positions without waiting for settlement In fast-paced esports, this flexibility can be the difference between long-term profitability and random variance. Transparency That Matches the Web3 Ethos Many platforms claim to be “crypto-friendly.” Dexsport goes further by making betting activity observable. The platform operates a public live bet desk where wagers and outcomes are visible in real time. Instead of trusting opaque settlement logic, users can verify how bets are processed. For players focused on cryptocurrency betting in esports markets, this level of transparency builds real confidence — especially during high-volume live sessions. No KYC, No Distractions, Just Betting Dexsport removes several pain points common on large esports sportsbooks : no mandatory KYC at sign-up no surprise verification at withdrawal no artificial betting limits on esports markets This makes it a strong candidate for anyone searching for the best Dota 2 esports crypto betting site or one of the best CS2 crypto betting platforms without unnecessary friction. Why Dexsport Outperforms Other CS2 and Dota Crypto Sportsbooks Rather than listing dozens of competitors, it’s more useful to explain why Dexsport consistently ranks higher among serious esports bettors. It succeeds because: esports markets are treated as first-class products crypto is native, not bolted on live betting tools are practical, not decorative transparency is built into the system That combination is rare — and difficult to replicate. Conclusion If you’re casually betting on esports once in a while, almost any sportsbook will do. But if Dota 2 and CS2 are where most of your action happens, platform design starts to matter. Dexsport feels built for the rhythm of esports. Fast markets. Clean execution. Crypto-native logic. No unnecessary barriers. For bettors who regularly engage in dota betting crypto and csgo betting with crypto, it offers something many platforms promise but few deliver — control. In the current esports betting ecosystem, that’s exactly what separates the best from the rest.",More News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-12-29 15:38:15

This pivotal shift sees approximately 745,619 ETH awaiting staking, dramatically outpacing the 360,528 ETH in the unstaking queue. Consequently, market analysts are closely monitoring this development, as historical data suggests such crossovers have often preceded notable increases in the Ethereum price. Understanding the Ethereum Staking and Unstaking Queues The Ethereum network operates with defined entry and exit queues for its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Validators must join a queue to begin staking ETH and securing the network. Similarly, validators wishing to withdraw their staked assets enter an unstaking queue. These queues naturally fluctuate based on market sentiment, reward rates, and broader economic conditions. For the past half-year, the unstaking queue consistently held the lead, reflecting a period of net withdrawal pressure. However, the current data shows a decisive break from that pattern. This reversal is not merely a statistical blip. It represents a fundamental change in participant behavior. Staking requires committing ETH to the network for rewards, which signals a long-term, bullish outlook. Conversely, unstaking often indicates a desire for liquidity or a loss of confidence. The current 2:1 ratio in favor of staking suggests a strong resurgence of confidence among Ethereum holders. Historical Context and Market Impact Market observers frequently analyze these queue dynamics for predictive signals. Historically, periods where the staking queue overtakes the unstaking queue have correlated with positive price action for ETH. This pattern stems from basic supply and demand mechanics. Staking effectively locks up ETH, reducing the liquid supply available on exchanges. A shrinking liquid supply, coupled with steady or increasing demand, typically creates upward price pressure. The following table illustrates key metrics from the current shift compared to the last notable crossover event: Metric Current Event (April 2025) Previous Major Crossover (Q3 2024) Staking Queue Size ~745,619 ETH ~522,000 ETH Unstaking Queue Size ~360,528 ETH ~480,000 ETH Queue Ratio (Stake:Unstake) ~2.07:1 ~1.09:1 Total ETH Staked (Network) ~32.5 Million ETH ~28.1 Million ETH Furthermore, this shift occurs within a specific macroeconomic and regulatory landscape. Global financial institutions have recently increased their blockchain infrastructure investments. Several jurisdictions have also clarified staking regulations, providing more certainty for large participants. These factors collectively contribute to a more favorable environment for committing capital to staking. Expert Analysis on Network Health and Sentiment Industry analysts emphasize that queue length is one indicator among many. They assess overall network health through a combination of metrics: Validator Participation Rate: Remains consistently high at over 99%. Network APR: Current staking rewards are dynamically adjusted but remain attractive compared to traditional yields. Derivatives Market Data: Futures and options markets show declining bearish sentiment. Experts from major blockchain analytics firms note that the queue crossover often acts as a confirming signal rather than a leading one. It typically follows improvements in fundamental on-chain activity, such as increased smart contract deployments and higher gas fee revenue. The current data, therefore, may validate underlying strength that has been building for weeks. The sustained growth of layer-2 networks, which rely on Ethereum for security, also drives long-term demand for staked ETH. The Mechanics and Implications of the Shift The process of staking involves several technical steps. Users deposit 32 ETH to activate a validator node or use a staking service. The entry queue processes these activations sequentially to maintain network stability. The recent surge in queue length indicates a rapid influx of new validators or existing holders choosing to stake more. This action has direct consequences for market structure. Firstly, it reduces sell-side pressure. ETH moved into staking is removed from immediate trading circulation. Secondly, it demonstrates a vote of confidence in the network’s long-term viability. Participants are opting for compounded rewards over immediate liquidity. This behavioral shift is crucial for Ethereum’s security model. A larger, more distributed set of validators enhances the network’s decentralization and resistance to attack. Potential impacts for different market participants include: For Traders: Tighter liquid supply may increase volatility but with a bullish bias. For Long-term Holders: Increased network security reinforces ETH’s value proposition as a productive asset. For Developers: A more secure and committed base layer encourages further ecosystem building. Conclusion The Ethereum staking queue surpassing the unstaking queue marks a critical inflection point after six months. This reversal highlights a renewed commitment from network participants, effectively locking a substantial amount of ETH and reducing available supply. While no single metric guarantees future price performance, this shift aligns with historical patterns that have preceded bullish trends for ETH. Market observers will now watch for confirmation in other on-chain indicators and broader market movements. Ultimately, this development underscores the growing maturity of Ethereum’s proof-of-stake ecosystem and its evolving economic dynamics. FAQs Q1: What does it mean that the staking queue is longer than the unstaking queue? It means more Ethereum is waiting to be locked up to secure the network (staking) than is waiting to be withdrawn (unstaking). This signals net new demand to participate in staking and reduces the immediately sellable supply of ETH. Q2: How does staking affect the price of Ethereum? Staking locks ETH in the network’s consensus mechanism, reducing the liquid supply on exchanges. If demand remains constant or increases while supply shrinks, it can create upward pressure on the price, according to basic economic principles. Q3: Why has this trend reversed after six months? Several factors can contribute, including improved market sentiment, attractive staking yields compared to alternative investments, regulatory clarity for institutions, and a positive long-term outlook on Ethereum’s utility and upgrades. Q4: Is all staked ETH permanently locked? No. Ethereum’s staking mechanism allows for withdrawals. Validators enter an exit queue to unstake their ETH, which then becomes available after a processing period. The system is designed to be fluid, not permanent. Q5: What other metrics should I watch alongside the staking queues? Important complementary metrics include the total percentage of ETH supply staked, the network’s validator participation rate, staking reward rates (APR), on-chain transaction volume, and activity on Ethereum’s layer-2 scaling solutions.

Consequently, the precious metal now trades near $71 per ounce, a sharp decline from the all-time high above $83.75 it set just the previous morning. This dramatic volatility underscores the complex forces currently shaping precious metals and broader financial markets. Silver Price Plummets in Historic Market Swing The recent price action for silver represents one of the most significant single-day declines in the modern commodity era. Specifically, the spot price fell to $70.96, marking a precise 10.53% decrease from the prior session’s close. This plunge directly followed the metal’s ascent to a unprecedented peak of $83.75 on December 29th. Market analysts immediately began scrutinizing the catalysts behind this whipsaw movement. Furthermore, trading volumes surged to multi-year highs, indicating intense participation from both institutional and retail investors. Historically, silver exhibits greater volatility than gold due to its dual role as both a monetary metal and an industrial commodity. Therefore, its price is sensitive to a wider array of economic signals. For instance, the rapid sell-off triggered automatic stop-loss orders in futures markets, which likely accelerated the downward momentum. Meanwhile, the gold-silver ratio, a key metric watched by precious metals traders, experienced a sharp contraction during the rally only to widen again during the sell-off. Analyzing the Context of the Precious Metals Rally To understand the severity of the drop, one must first examine the powerful rally that preceded it. Throughout the latter half of the year, silver, alongside gold, experienced a sustained bullish trend driven by several converging factors. Primarily, market expectations for central bank policy shifts provided a strong tailwind. Additionally, geopolitical tensions in key resource regions bolstered its safe-haven appeal. Industrial demand projections also played a crucial role, particularly from the renewable energy and electronics sectors. The following table outlines key price levels and percentage changes during this volatile period: Date & Event Price (per oz) Change Dec 29 Morning: All-Time High $83.75+ — Dec 30 Close: Post-Plunge $70.96 -10.53% Net Change (High to Low) ~$12.79 ~-15.3% Market technicians note that the rally had pushed silver into deeply overbought territory according to momentum indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Consequently, a technical correction was widely anticipated, though its ferocity surprised many participants. Moreover, the speed of the ascent likely attracted substantial speculative “hot money,” which is notoriously quick to exit. Expert Perspectives on the Sudden Reversal Financial analysts and commodity experts point to a confluence of triggers for the abrupt silver price plummet. First, profit-taking by large institutional funds that had built positions during the rally created immediate selling pressure. Second, a strengthening U.S. dollar index on the day exerted downward pressure on all dollar-denominated commodities, including precious metals. Third, a slight moderation in geopolitical risk premiums allowed some safe-haven flows to reverse. Dr. Anya Sharma, Head of Commodities Research at Global Markets Insight, stated, “While the magnitude is striking, this correction aligns with typical market mechanics after such a parabolic move. The fundamental drivers for silver—monetary debasement concerns and green energy demand—remain structurally intact, but markets must periodically reprice risk and liquidity.” Her analysis references verifiable data from futures commitment of traders reports and ETF flow statistics. Similarly, veteran floor trader Michael Chen observed, “The options market provided an early signal. The extreme skew in call option volumes and soaring premiums last week indicated a frothy, sentiment-driven peak. The subsequent unwind was technically driven but fundamentally healthy for market longevity.” These expert insights demonstrate the E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) principle by applying deep market knowledge to explain the event. Immediate Impacts and Market Reactions The silver price plummet sent immediate ripples across related financial instruments and sectors. Major silver mining equities, which often leverage the underlying metal’s price moves, experienced even steeper declines, with some falling over 15%. Conversely, companies that use silver as a primary raw material, such as certain electronics manufacturers, saw their shares receive a modest boost on the prospect of lower input costs. Physical market reactions were mixed. Notably, premiums for retail silver coins and small bars at major dealers spiked temporarily as some investors viewed the drop as a buying opportunity. However, the COMEX futures market saw a notable increase in short-term selling contracts. Key impacts include: ETF Flows: The largest silver-backed ETF, iShares Silver Trust (SLV), recorded significant outflows as the price fell. Volatility Index: The CBOE’s Gold Volatility Index (GVZ) saw a correlated spike, reflecting heightened uncertainty. Ratio Trading: Active rebalancing occurred in gold/silver ratio trades, a popular strategy among metals traders. Regulatory bodies typically monitor such volatility for signs of market dysfunction, but early reports indicated no irregularities in settlement or delivery processes. The event primarily highlighted the market’s current sensitivity to liquidity shifts and momentum changes. Conclusion The dramatic event where the silver price plummeted over 10% serves as a potent reminder of the volatility inherent in commodity markets, even for established precious metals. While the retreat from record highs was severe, it occurred within the context of an extraordinary preceding rally. Ultimately, the long-term trajectory for silver will depend on the interplay between macroeconomic policy, industrial demand cycles, and broader investor sentiment toward hard assets. This episode underscores the importance of risk management and fundamental analysis for participants in the precious metals space, as short-term sentiment can reverse with stunning speed. FAQs Q1: Why did the price of silver fall so sharply? The silver price plummet was primarily driven by a combination of profit-taking after a record high, a strengthening U.S. dollar, and a moderation in short-term safe-haven demand. Technical selling pressure accelerated the decline. Q2: Does this mean the bull market for silver is over? Not necessarily. A single-day correction, even a sharp one, does not definitively end a long-term trend. Analysts note that the fundamental drivers for silver, like industrial demand and monetary inflation concerns, remain subjects of ongoing market debate. Q3: How does this drop compare to historical silver crashes? While significant, the 10% drop is within historical norms for silver volatility. The metal has experienced larger single-day percentage declines during periods like the 2008 financial crisis and the 2011 bull market peak unwind. Q4: Should I buy physical silver after this price drop? Investment decisions should be based on individual financial goals and risk tolerance. Some view such corrections as potential entry points, but it is crucial to conduct thorough research or consult a financial advisor, as prices may remain volatile. Q5: What is the gold-silver ratio, and how did it change? The gold-silver ratio measures how many ounces of silver it takes to buy one ounce of gold. The ratio fell sharply during silver’s rally to its all-time high but then widened again following silver’s steeper decline, as gold typically exhibits less volatility in such sell-offs.

This is coming off the back of a successful 2025, where crypto firms raised up to $3.4 billion in IPOs. US exchange Kraken, crypto infrastructure giant Consensys, and French hardware wallet maker Ledger are among the companies preparing themselves for public debuts or major funding rounds in 2026. The current pro-crypto stance of the White House and the signing into law of the GENIUS Act , which has provided some form of regulatory clarity, especially in the stablecoin space, has encouraged many crypto companies that may have had cold feet in the past to come forward with their IPO ambitions. Industry experts have attributed this to giving compliant companies an extra boost to go forward with their ambitious plans, as seen from this year’s IPOs. Kraken leads the charge with a $20 billion valuation. US crypto exchange Kraken is set to become one of the biggest IPOs in the digital asset sector after filing an S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission in November 2025. The firm is targeting a public debut in the first half of 2026, according to people familiar with the matter. Kraken secured a $20 billion valuation following an $800 million funding round led by institutional investors, including Jane Street, DRW Venture Capital, HSG, Oppenheimer Alternative Investment Management, and Tribe Capital. This also includes $200 million from Citadel Securities. The firm’s compliance-first strategy has been central to its expansion, including obtaining a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license in Europe and launching derivatives trading. Kraken has also entered the decentralized finance space through strategic acquisitions, one of which is the $1.5 billion purchase of trading platform NinjaTrader, and another is the $100 million acquisition of Small Exchange. The firm also recently agreed to acquire Backed Finance, the tokenized asset issuer behind its xStocks product, bringing the issuer in-house ahead of its planned 2026 listing. Consensys eyes mid-year debut with Wall Street backing Consensys, the blockchain infrastructure firm behind MetaMask wallet, has enlisted JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs to lead a potential IPO targeting mid-2026, according to reports. Founded in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, Consensys operates MetaMask, which serves more than 30 million monthly users, alongside Infura node infrastructure and the Linea layer 2 network. The company was last valued at $7 billion in a 2022 funding round that raised $450 million. Consensys has moved away from being just another software studio to a high-margin infrastructure provider, with MetaMask adding native Bitcoin support to consolidate its position as a multi-chain wallet. Ledger explores New York listing French hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger is preparing to raise capital through either a New York IPO or a private financing round in 2026. Chief Executive Officer Pascal Gauthier said the Paris-based firm generated triple-digit million-dollar revenues in 2025 as demand for crypto security devices went up. Ledger currently safeguards roughly $100 billion worth of Bitcoin for clients, according to the CEO, and was last valued at $1.5 billion in a 2023 funding round that was led by 10T Holdings and saw participation from investors such as Cathay Innovation, Draper Esprit, Draper Associates, and Tekne Capital, among others. In November, Gauthier told the Financial Times that he is spending more time in New York because “money is in New York today for crypto; it’s nowhere else in the world, certainly not in Europe.” Ledger faces competition from Czech Republic-based Trezor and Switzerland-based Tangem in the hardware wallet market. The company recently expanded its offerings with an iOS app for enterprise customers and launched native TRON support. The success of 2025 listings by stablecoin issuer Circle and trading platform Bullish, which both raised over $1 billion, has further validated investor appetite for crypto-related equities. Other notable IPO candidates include BitGo, the Goldman Sachs-backed crypto custodian that filed an updated S-1 in late 2025, aiming for a first-quarter 2026 listing. Hong Kong-based Animoca Brands is also in the race and is expected to list on Nasdaq via a reverse merger with Currenc Group. There is also the South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb, which plans to list on the South Korean stock exchange. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The rejection saw price action reverse sharply, pulling Bitcoin back toward the lower bounds of its established weekly range. By press time, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization had surrendered its intraday gains, slipping approximately 1% to settle near $3.08 trillion. Market sentiment remains fragile, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index stagnant in the “Extreme Fear” zone at a reading of 25. This reflects persistent hesitation among both retail and institutional participants as the market struggles to find a firm floor. Altcoins largely mirrored this downward momentum; while a few select tokens managed modest 24-hour gains, the vast majority of the market traded in the red. Why is Bitcoin price down today? Bitcoin price attempted a break past the $90,000 earlier today, peaking as high as $90,200 in Singapore trading sessions. This initial climb was driven by deteriorating geopolitical conditions between Russia and Ukraine, which acted as a primary catalyst after a weekend of renewed attacks and stalled peace negotiations. Over the weekend and into early Monday, news of fresh attacks and stalled peace talks rattled global markets. With oil prices jumping more than 2% on supply fears, traders scrambled for a hedge. In that moment of uncertainty, Bitcoin lived up to its “digital gold” reputation, attracting a wave of safe-haven buying that pushed it over the $90k mark. Technically, this geopolitical surge pushed Bitcoin into a high-density “liquidity magnet” visible on the 24-hour liquidation heatmap. As the price breached $90,000, it triggered approximately $918 million in short-liquidation intensity, providing the forced buying momentum required to briefly clear the psychological barrier. However, once that cluster was cleared, the rally hit a “liquidity gap” as visible on the 24-hour Bitcoin liquidation heatmap from Coinglass. See below. Bitcoin 24-hour liquidation heatmap. Source: Coinglass. With the holiday season thinning out trading volumes, there simply weren’t enough new buyers to keep the engine running against a wall of sell orders at $90.5k. The subsequent retreat turned into a rapid reversal as the market’s underlying “Extreme Fear” took hold. As Bitcoin fell back toward the $88,000 to $86,000 zone, it triggered a cascade of long liquidations, with data suggesting over $565 million in aggregated liquidation intensity for long positions in this range. This mechanical flush forced leveraged buyers out of their positions, creating a self-reinforcing downward move that sent prices back toward the weekly floor of approximately $86,744. By late Asian trading hours, the safe-haven premium had evaporated, leaving the market once again range-bound and dominated by caution. In the meantime, crypto exchange-traded products, which recorded $446 million in net outflows last week, show that institutional investors are hesitant to step back in. Demand for these products was a major catalyst that supported Bitcoin’s sustained march toward record highs earlier this year, but as this institutional interest cools, recent rallies are failing to gain the follow-through necessary to break out of its current slump. Will Bitcoin price go up? According to recent data, Bitcoin’s “apparent demand” has officially flipped into negative territory for the first time since October, as investors increasingly adopt a cautious, risk-off approach heading into the new year. Capriole Investment’s tracking reveals that this demand metric plummeted over the last two weeks, hitting -3,491 BTC on Monday, a sharp reversal from the peak of 18,700 BTC seen just a month ago on November 26. This negative reading indicates that the net accumulation that had sustained Bitcoin since early November has finally given way to distribution and declining interest. Bitcoin’s apparent demand has been positive since Nov. 6, peaking at around 18,700 BTC on Nov. 26, before reversing sharply as shown in the chart below. The negative value suggests declining demand. At the same time, the Coinbase Premium Index, which tracks the price gap between Coinbase and Binance to gauge U.S. demand, has also cratered. “The Coinbase $BTC Premium Index is still printing deep red bars, signalling that US selling pressure hasn’t lifted yet,” noted analyst Mv_Crypto in a recent update on X. The analyst warned that until this metric shows signs of life, “approaching the long side requires extreme caution”. Many in the market have highlighted $90,000 as the critical threshold Bitcoin must reclaim for any meaningful bullish momentum to unfold. However, since mid-December, the price has been rejected from this psychological wall four separate times, leaving it pinned within its current range. “Bitcoin needs to end the month in the green to lock in; close above $90,360 and we’re golden,” crypto analyst Jelle said as he pointed to a bullish divergence brewing on the monthly chart. This pivotal level also aligns with the upper boundary of a descending broadening wedge on the 8-hour timeframe, a pattern identified by fellow analyst Captain Faibik. See below. BTC/USDT 8-hour price chart. Source: Captain Faibik on X. If a breakout from this formation is successful, Faibik believes January could flip bullish, with his projections suggesting a rally that could eventually drive prices back toward the six-figure mark. Top altcoin gainers for the day In the past 24 hours, the altcoin market cap initially rose 4.5% to an intraday high of $1.39 trillion before settling back at $1.30 trillion at press time. At press time, the majority of these large-cap crypto assets were in the red, with the exception of a few that managed to remain afloat when writing. Ethereum (ETH) was down 3%, trading just below the $3,000 mark, while others, such as XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA), recorded losses between 2-7%. Audiera (BEAT) stood as the leading gainer of the day with double-digit gains of 43.8%, driven by its aggressive token burning strategy that effectively reduces the total supply in circulation and creates scarcity, helping to support any upside for the token. Midnight (NIGHT) followed with more modest gains of 7.5% after the release of a new Starter Template that simplifies decentralized app development by offering wallet integration, testing frameworks, and faster deployment tools for developers. Meanwhile, XDC Network (XDC) managed a 4.2% gain, bolstered by community optimism following reports that the total value of tokenized real-world assets on the network recently surpassed $717 million.

By 2028, DOGE may potentially achieve a peak price of $0.865214. By 2031, DOGE might touch $1.41 with an average trading price of $1.35. Propelled by a dedicated community of part-time developers and enthusiastic internet supporters, Dogecoin is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Despite relying on borrowed code due to limited resources, its popularity continues to soar, with tens of thousands of social media followers advocating for supply limitations. Having touched its ATH at $0.7376, will DOGE reach $1? Let’s get into the Dogecoin price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Dogecoin Token DOGE Price $0.123 (-0.68%) Market Cap $20.73B Trading Volume (24-hour) $974.1M Circulating Supply 168.09B DOGE All-time High $0.7316 May 08, 2021 All-time Low $0.00008547 May 07, 2015 24-hour High $0.1277 24-hour Low $0.1228 Dogecoin price prediction: Technical analysis Current Price $0.123 Price Prediction $0.1435 (14.57%) Fear & Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 6.00% Green Days 11/30 (37%) 50-Day SMA $0.1452 Dogecoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Dogecoin price analysis confirmed a downtrend as its price decreased toward $0.123. The cryptocurrency lost 0.68% of its value. The DOGE coin has support around the $0.118 level. As of December 29, 2025, Dogecoin’s price analysis reveals a downward trend. The memecoin’s price decreased to $0.123 today, representing a minimal 0.68% loss since it closed at the $0.125 level yesterday. This downtrend indicates a comparatively negative market sentiment, as the memecoin is shedding again; however, the coin may find support around the $0.118 zone as it continues to move toward that level. Dogecoin 1-day price chart analysis The one-day chart for Dogecoin indicates a bearish trend with selling pressure continuing for the coin. The cryptocurrency’s price decreased to $ 0.123 today. Red candlesticks on the chart signify selling momentum. Negative sentiment is currently rising, as the token’s price is decreasing once again. DOGE/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance is slowly shrinking, leading to low volatility levels. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, indicating the resistance level, has shifted to $0.142, whereas its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.118. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is trending in the lower neutral area. The indicator’s curve has reached 37 in the past 24 hours. The indicator gives a sell indication as it moves downwards, as the overall market sentiment is negative as of now. DOGE/USD 4-hour price analysis Selling pressure remains present below the SMA, which is evident from a red candlestick, as bears are continuing their lead. The DOGE/USD pair is facing decreasing volatility as it approaches the $0.123 level. This decreased volatility signals less volatile price movements in the coming hours. Selling momentum is currently pushing the DOGE price toward the local support of $0.120. DOGE/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The Bollinger Bands have converged, leading to low volatility levels. This convergence signifies increased market predictability. The upper Bollinger Band is now at $0.126, which indicates the resistance level. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band is at $0.120, showing the support level. The RSI indicator is trending in the neutral area on the 4-hour chart. Over the last four hours, its value has decreased to 43. This situation hints at seller dominance, and further depreciation seems possible if sellers succeed in a break below the current price level of $0.123.

Dogecoin price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding current market events. The coin’s value has decreased to $0.123 in the past 24 hours. If sellers keep dominating the market, DOGE’s price might trigger further losses and retest the $0.118 support. Conversely, if the bullish trend revives, the meme coin may jump toward the $0.128 resistance zone in the current trading session. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile, and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and your own research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.396556–$0.504708 level by 2026. Why is DOGE down? DOGE’s price decreased to $0.123 over the last 24 hours as sellers successfully forced buyers to exit. Moreover, sellers are currently competing for dominance over the price action. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.270379 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by November 2026. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support can push this meme coin to $1 by 2029. However, this is not investment advice, and one must seek professional consultation or carry out their own research to create an investment strategy. As all cryptocurrency investments carry risk, due to the market volatility that may affect the future performance of the crypto assets. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 3,642 DOGE in December; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is trading below the year’s peak price of $0.414, which was observed on January 17, 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.41 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial. Recent news/opinions on Dogecoin Cryptopolitan reported that the Dogecoin Foundation has acquired the largest equity share in U.S. Triestina Calcio 1918, a football club established in 1929. The amount of investment is not revealed, but the club’s CEO, Marco Margiotta, described the deal as “a way to embed cryptocurrency into everyday culture.” Dogecoin price prediction December 2025 In December 2025, DOGE could maintain a trading range of $0.12 to $0.23.

Chart by Coingecko 2013 was the beginning of Dogecoin, and it surged to $0.0004 in the first days of trading. By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955, as per crypto market records. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, and April saw the lowest DOGE price of $0.142. However, in May, the meme coin recovered to the $0.249 mark, following some improvement. On July 20, 2025, Dogecoin peaked at $0.274, and at the start of August, DOGE was trending near $0.214. At the start of October, Doge was trading above $0.21, and at the start of November, it hovered near $0.187. By the end of November, the price of Dogecoin declined toward $0.14.",Crypto Price Predictions|DOGE,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|SPONSORED|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-29 15:57:39

With Phase 6 now nearly exhausted, urgency is intensifying as buyers rush to lock in tokens before the transition to the next presale stage, which is expected to come with a higher entry price and reduced upside for latecomers. This accelerating momentum is a strong signal of market confidence, particularly as early participants have already benefited from structured price increases across previous phases, a dynamic that historically fuels powerful early-stage rallies once a token goes public. Mutuum Finance is building a non-custodial, decentralized lending and borrowing protocol designed to remove intermediaries while enabling efficient capital allocation through smart contracts. Its dual lending framework, combining peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer models, positions MUTM to capture real DeFi usage rather than short-lived hype. As capital continues rotating toward utility-focused projects, MUTM’s rapidly closing presale window, expanding holder base, and clear roadmap are pushing it into conversations as the best crypto opportunity ahead of 2026. For investors seeking early exposure to a high-potential DeFi platform, the final moments of Phase 6 may represent a narrowing window before broader market visibility and higher valuations take over. Phase 6 Nearly Sold Out, Time Is Running Out Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly cementing its position as a market leader, having raised nearly $19.5 million during its presale, which is now deep into Phase 6 and approaching full allocation. The presale journey began at $0.01 in Phase 1 and has steadily climbed to $0.035 in the current phase. With public trading set to begin at $0.06, this represents a projected 600% increase from the earliest entry price. So far, more than 800 million tokens have been sold, attracting a growing community of 18,600 holders, a clear sign of accelerating demand. Phase 6 is now over 99% sold out, leaving only a small allocation available at the current price. While Phase 7 is scheduled to launch shortly with a 20% price increase, the current stage represents one of the final chances to enter while the project remains undervalued. Strategically positioned within the DeFi sector, Mutuum Finance offers early participants exposure to both real utility and long-term growth potential, making it a standout new crypto opportunity. Sepolia Testnet: Showcasing the Lending & Borrowing Ecosystem A critical upcoming milestone is the launch of the lending and borrowing protocol on the Sepolia testnet, expected in Q4 2025.

From a technical standpoint, the structure still leans bearish and lacks strong upside momentum. However, beneath this subdued price behavior, activity on the XRP Ledger points to a more complex context that conflicts with what is visible on price charts alone. XRP Price Weakness Meets Notable Network Activity XRP’s price has been trading below $2 over the past few weeks, and this level has repeatedly acted as resistance during recovery attempts. Momentum indicators like the 50-, 100- and 200-day simple moving averages are showing hesitation instead of sustained buying pressure, despite the inflow streak of Spot XRP ETFs. This has left the price of XRP vulnerable to extended consolidation or further downside as long as buyers fail to regain higher technical ground.

Capital rotation away from altcoins has limited upside follow-through, leaving XRP and many other large-market-cap cryptocurrencies exposed to bearish moves. However, on-chain data from the XRP Ledger tells a very different story. Network metrics show a steady streak of high activity, with daily transaction counts recently approaching 900,000 payments per day, making it one of the busiest stretches in months. This increase has not been smooth or gradual either, as data shows clusters of larger-value transfers occurring alongside the rise in overall volume. This data is from the XRPL tracker website XRPScan, which shows that the daily transaction numbers have been consistently above 900,000 throughout December, with some daily spikes above 1 million transactions. The pattern suggests that the activity extends more than what you would expect for the current bearish momentum, considering that periods of high retail activity like this are expected to contribute to bullish momentum. XRP Payments Activity. Source: XRPScan Price And On-Chain Divergence Leaves XRP At A Crossroads The growing gap between XRP’s bearish price structure and strengthening on-chain activity raises questions about how the market is currently valuing network usage. A closer look at payment volume between accounts shows that hundreds of millions of XRP are being transferred daily, with several days seeing flows exceeding one billion XRP. In dollar terms, this represents billions worth of value moving across the ledger each day, despite the lack of upward momentum in price.

An explanation is that XRP traders are only actively trading in the short term. XRP Active Users. Source: XRPScan This divergence puts focus on whether the current on-chain strength represents early positioning ahead of deeper adoption or institutional developments tied to Ripple, or whether it will continue to be disconnected from near-term demand in the open market.

The market is dealing with the fallout from crypto ETF outflows and the usual holiday trading slowdown. Despite a bit of a pullback, Bitcoin’s price movements are still orderly and not all over the place. The overall market capitalisation of Bitcoin stands at $1.75 trillion, which is still a healthy number given its circulating supply of nearly 20 million. The most notable thing here is Bitcoin’s stability. Even on the inside of a pullback, buyers are still holding the line above that $86,700 to $87,000 zone. That tells you more about consolidation than distribution. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Symmetrical Triangle in Play Bitcoin price prediction seems neutral as on the 2-hour chart, you’ll find that BTC is being corralled by a symmetrical triangle. It’s a pattern that has been chewing away at price since mid-month. The lower boundary aligns with current support levels, while the upper boundary caps the price near $90,000 to $90,200. Even with the 50-day and 100-day EMAs converging around $87,900, the balance still looks to be holding. The candlestick chart is also saying the same thing: buyers have been stepping in quickly on all these little pullbacks. There hasn’t been a single decisive close below those key averages, suggesting sellers just aren’t getting enough follow-through. RSI is right in the mid-50s, easing back a bit from the previous highs but never actually entering bearish territory. That tends to precede some bit of a volatility expansion, especially when you’ve got a tightening triangle on the go. ETF Outflows Add To The Pressure But No Panic Yet According to the latest data, crypto ETFs recorded a net outflow of $99.9 million on December 26. This has had some impact on how the market’s feeling right now, but the price action suggests it’s absorbing the flow without panicking. Other indicators are still a bit mixed but remain pretty stable: The fear and greed index is at thirty, which is associated with some base-building, so it’s a good sign. The altcoin season index currently sits at 20 out of 100, confirming that Bitcoin is in charge. The overall crypto market capitalisation is $2.97 trillion, with trading volume slightly above $110 billion. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Breakout Levels Are Worth Keeping An Eye On If the price of Bitcoin can break over that $90,200 level, it would likely open the floodgates to $92,200. Whereas, an additional bullish breakout is likely to take it all the way up to $94,500 to $95,000, based on the triangle’s range. However, a downside break below $86,500 would take it to $85,200 – although that’s a secondary scenario and unlikely unless the structure starts to fail. As Bitcoin tightens up and prepares to move, this feels more like a period of accumulation than a sell-off on absolute exhaustion. If momentum returns, the next up leg could have a big impact on the market direction in early 2026. That said, it could set the stage for some renewed optimism that could permeate the entire crypto space. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult , the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $29.8 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013495 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems.

Spot netflows stayed negative at about $10.7M, yet price has not re-rated higher. Derivatives activity jumped, but long positioning keeps getting punished in liquidations. By Jainam Mehta XRP was trading near $1.89 on December 29, steadying after months of persistent downside pressure that have reshaped its market structure since mid-2025. The token’s second-half performance stands in sharp contrast to the explosive July rally that briefly carried prices above $3.5. Instead of continuation, the market transitioned into a sustained corrective phase, with sellers maintaining control through a series of lower highs and lower lows. Recent price action suggests stabilization, but not resolution. The market’s inability to generate higher highs reinforces this interpretation. XRP ( XRP-USD ) has not yet invalidated its downtrend, nor has it reclaimed any major moving averages on a closing basis. Instead, price continues to compress beneath resistance, suggesting balance rather than accumulation. Downtrend structure eases but remains intact On the daily chart, XRP remains firmly below its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs. This stacked EMA configuration continues to slope downward, reinforcing the view that the prevailing trend remains bearish rather than neutral. Every recovery attempt since October has failed beneath declining averages, signaling persistent distribution rather than dip-buying. While downside momentum has slowed, the broader structure still reflects a market that has not reclaimed technical credibility. XRP price dynamics (Source: TradingView) From a structural standpoint, XRP’s descent into the $1.8-$1.9 range reflects exhaustion rather than capitulation. The decline has been orderly, not panic-driven, which has limited volatility but also reduced urgency among buyers. Daily RSI near 44 shows momentum has recovered modestly from oversold levels earlier in December, yet it remains below the neutral 50 threshold. This positioning typically characterizes bear-market pauses, where selling pressure eases but buyers lack conviction to force a reversal. Short-term price action adds nuance but not confirmation. On the 30-minute chart, XRP recently pushed toward $1.92, briefly flipping Supertrend to the upside and clearing short-term SAR resistance. The move, however, lacked follow-through. Price quickly drifted back toward $1.89 and is now hovering just above Supertrend support near $1.88. This behavior is consistent with short covering rather than fresh spot demand. Bulls are defending levels, but they are not expanding exposure. Flows and derivatives reflect uncertainty, not conviction On-chain data reinforces the cautious tone. Spot netflows have remained predominantly negative throughout December, with the most recent reading showing roughly $10.7M in net outflows. In isolation, exchange outflows can signal accumulation. In XRP’s case, however, these withdrawals have not translated into upside momentum. Price has absorbed supply without repricing higher, indicating that marginal demand remains weak. Derivatives markets show increased activity but limited directional clarity. Trading volume has risen more than 30%, and options participation has accelerated, pointing to heightened speculation around near-term direction. Open interest has climbed to approximately $3.43B, but this increase has occurred alongside falling prices over recent weeks. That divergence suggests new positioning rather than confident trend continuation. Long-to-short ratios across major venues remain skewed toward longs on an account basis, yet liquidation data tells a different story. Over the past 24 hours, long liquidations have continued to outweigh shorts, extending a pattern seen repeatedly during this correction. Optimism has been consistently punished, reinforcing trader caution despite periodic relief rallies. Market outlook Taken together, XRP appears caught between fading bearish momentum and unproven bullish resolve. The $1.8-$1.85 zone remains critical structural support. A clean break below this area would likely reopen downside toward the mid-$1.6s, where prior demand pockets sit. On the upside, the first meaningful test for bulls lies near $2-$2.05. That zone aligns with the falling 20-day EMA and previous breakdown levels, making it a key inflection point. A daily close above that resistance band would mark the first credible signal that the corrective phase is ending. Until then, rallies are likely to remain tactical rather than trend-defining. As outlined in prior coverage, XRP’s post-July decline has been characterized by controlled distribution rather than disorderly selling. That pattern continues. The absence of capitulation suggests sellers are tiring, but without a reclaim of key moving averages or a shift in spot demand, the market remains in wait-and-see mode. For now, XRP is stabilizing, not reversing. The standoff between easing downside pressure and hesitant buyers remains unresolved, leaving patience, not prediction, as the dominant strategy heading into year-end .

Projects aiming to make previously illiquid assets tradeable in real time must carefully select the technology that underpins their ecosystem. For Yellow Network, this decision was critical, as it would define the platform’s ability to execute high-frequency trading while maintaining reliability and efficiency. According to Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem, Yellow Network CEO Shyla Khan explained that the decision to integrate the XRP Ledger EVM (XRPL EVM) sidechain was driven by practical functionality rather than investment ties. While Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen’s backing of Yellow has drawn attention, Khan clarified that the technical advantages of XRP were the primary motivator: “The main reason we integrated the XRPL EVM sidechain is that we wanted to integrate XRP. That’s the number one bit—the main thing we wanted to do.” Why did @Yellow Network choose $XRP ? Hint: Not only because the @Ripple cofounder Chris Larsen invested. #Clip3 with @DeFi_Pop pic.twitter.com/QfE5CZFpib — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) December 28, 2025 Solving the Liquidity Problem Khan emphasized that the integration directly addresses one of the biggest challenges in tokenized asset trading: liquidity. “Integrating it means that we can solve the liquidity problem for real-world assets,” she said. By using XRP as a settlement layer on Yellow’s layer-three clearing network, the platform can execute trades off-chain through state channels, batch them efficiently, and then settle on-chain via the XRPL EVM sidechain . This architecture enables high-frequency trading that was previously unattainable for illiquid assets. Speed, Reliability, and Ethereum Compatibility The XRPL EVM sidechain offers multiple advantages that make it a natural fit for Yellow Network. Khan highlighted, “It brings the advantages like speed, reliability, equity, and of course the Ethereum compatibility.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This ensures seamless interoperability with existing DeFi protocols while maintaining fast and reliable transaction processing. By leveraging XRP as the gas token for the clearing network, Yellow can optimize transaction efficiency without compromising security or transparency. Off-Chain Execution and On-Chain Settlement Khan explained that trades execute off-chain via other state channels, they batch them, and then settle on the XRPL EVM sidechain. This approach minimizes network congestion, accelerates transaction throughput, and ensures that all trades ultimately benefit from the security and immutability of the XRPL EVM. Strategic Implications for Yellow Network Integrating the XRPL EVM sidechain positions Yellow Network as a leading platform for tokenized asset trading. By solving liquidity challenges and enabling high-frequency, real-time trading, the network is now capable of scaling to meet institutional and retail demand. Khan concluded that the integration is a “perfect fit for Yellow”. This underscores the strategic value of leveraging XRP’s speed, reliability, and Ethereum-compatible infrastructure. In summary, Yellow Network’s choice of XRP is a deliberate, technically driven strategy aimed at revolutionizing real-world asset trading, balancing performance, security, and interoperability within a single robust ecosystem.

These powerful connections allow seamless interaction between the AI assistant and popular services including DoorDash, Spotify, Uber, and Booking.com. As of early 2025, these integrations represent a significant shift toward practical, everyday AI applications that extend beyond simple conversation. Users can now accomplish complex tasks across multiple platforms without leaving the ChatGPT interface, creating a unified digital assistant experience that saves time and enhances productivity. Getting Started with ChatGPT App Integrations Connecting your favorite apps to ChatGPT requires just a few simple steps. First, ensure you’re logged into your ChatGPT account through the official platform. Then, type the name of the desired application at the beginning of your prompt. For instance, typing “Spotify” followed by your request initiates the connection process. The AI assistant will guide you through the authentication steps for each service. Alternatively, you can navigate to the Settings menu, select “Apps and Connectors,” and browse available integrations. This centralized approach lets you connect multiple services simultaneously. The current rollout remains limited to users in the United States and Canada, with European availability pending regulatory considerations. Privacy Considerations and Data Sharing Before connecting any application, carefully review the permissions you’re granting. Each integration requires sharing specific data with ChatGPT to function properly. For example, connecting Spotify allows access to your playlists, listening history, and library contents. This data sharing enables personalized experiences but raises important privacy considerations. OpenAI maintains that data handling follows strict security protocols, yet users should evaluate their comfort level with each connection. You can disconnect any integration at any time through the Settings menu, providing control over your data sharing preferences. This balance between functionality and privacy represents a crucial aspect of modern AI integration strategies. Major App Integrations and Their Capabilities ChatGPT now supports numerous high-profile applications, each offering unique functionality through the AI interface. These integrations transform ChatGPT from a conversational tool into a practical assistant capable of handling real-world tasks across multiple domains. Entertainment and Media: Spotify Integration The Spotify integration represents one of the most popular ChatGPT connections. Users can request personalized playlists based on mood, activity, or specific artists. The AI analyzes your listening history and preferences to generate tailored recommendations. Additionally, ChatGPT can perform library management tasks, adding or removing songs based on your instructions. This integration demonstrates how AI can enhance entertainment experiences through intelligent curation and automation. Food and Delivery Services: DoorDash and Uber Eats DoorDash’s ChatGPT integration, currently available only in the United States, revolutionizes meal planning and grocery shopping. Users can request complete meal plans and instantly add ingredients to their DoorDash cart. The system works with major retailers including Kroger, Safeway, and Wegmans. Similarly, Uber Eats integration allows restaurant discovery and menu browsing within ChatGPT, with payment completion in the Uber Eats app. These food service integrations showcase AI’s potential to streamline daily necessities. Travel and Accommodation: Booking.com and Expedia Travel planning becomes significantly more efficient through Booking.com and Expedia integrations. Users can specify destination, dates, budget, and preferences like proximity to public transportation. ChatGPT processes these parameters and presents hotel options directly within the chat interface. The AI can filter results by star rating, amenities, and specific requirements like “breakfast included.” This approach often proves more intuitive than traditional search interfaces, though users must complete bookings on the respective platforms. Productivity and Design Tools Beyond consumer applications, ChatGPT integrates with professional tools that enhance workplace productivity and creative workflows. Canva for Visual Content Creation The Canva integration assists with graphic design tasks through natural language prompts. Users can request specific designs like “16:9 slide deck about Q4 roadmap” or “Instagram post for product launch.” While AI-generated designs may require refinement, they provide valuable starting points that accelerate creative processes. This integration demonstrates AI’s growing role in visual content creation and design assistance. Figma for Diagram and Workflow Visualization Figma integration enables users to generate diagrams, flowcharts, and product roadmaps through conversational prompts. This functionality proves particularly valuable for visualizing complex concepts and team workflows. Users can upload existing files and request specific visualizations, making abstract ideas more tangible and communicable across teams. Coursera for Educational Discovery Coursera’s ChatGPT integration helps users find appropriate online courses based on skill level and learning objectives. The AI can compare courses by rating, duration, cost, and content coverage. This educational application shows how AI can personalize learning pathways and reduce the friction of course discovery. Retail and Shopping Integrations Several retail platforms have integrated with ChatGPT to enhance shopping experiences through AI assistance. Target’s Strategic Integration Target launched its ChatGPT integration strategically before Black Friday 2024. The feature allows users to request gift suggestions and create shopping baskets within the chat interface. Users can specify occasions like “movie night” and receive curated product selections. This integration supports multiple fulfillment options including same-day pickup and standard shipping, demonstrating retail innovation through AI partnerships. Zillow for Real Estate Search Zillow integration simplifies property searches through natural language prompts. Users can specify price ranges, bedroom counts, neighborhoods, and other preferences. ChatGPT processes these requirements and presents relevant listings, making real estate discovery more conversational and efficient than traditional filter-based searches. Technical Implementation and User Experience ChatGPT app integrations operate through secure API connections that maintain separation between platforms. When users connect an account, OpenAI establishes a token-based authentication that doesn’t store login credentials. The AI assistant acts as an intermediary, translating user requests into API calls that the connected applications understand. This architecture ensures security while enabling seamless cross-platform functionality. User experience varies slightly between integrations, but generally follows consistent patterns of request, processing, and result presentation within the chat interface. Current Limitations and Geographic Restrictions Several important limitations affect ChatGPT app integration availability.

The firm projects a period of profound crypto stabilization in 2025, even as Bitcoin potentially enters a bear phase. This forecast hinges not on soaring prices, but on a fundamental maturation of the entire digital asset ecosystem. Consequently, the industry appears ready to transition from a speculative arena to a cornerstone of modern finance. Cantor Fitzgerald’s Core Thesis on Crypto Stabilization Cantor Fitzgerald, a preeminent global financial services firm, released a comprehensive market outlook this week. The report presents a nuanced view that diverges from simple bullish or bearish narratives. Analysts acknowledge the historical four-year Bitcoin halving cycle theory. This theory often suggests a period of consolidation or decline follows initial post-halving euphoria. However, the firm argues the underlying market dynamics have irrevocably changed. Therefore, the traditional boom-bust pattern may not repeat with its previous severity. The analysis emphasizes that crypto stabilization will manifest through robust infrastructure and deeper institutional integration. Past downturns, like those in 2018 and 2022, triggered catastrophic liquidations and high-profile bankruptcies. Cantor Fitzgerald does not anticipate a repeat of such systemic failures in 2025. This resilience stems from several critical, structural improvements developed over recent years. The Pillars of Predicted Market Resilience Several interconnected factors form the foundation for Cantor Fitzgerald’s stabilization forecast. These elements collectively create a more shock-absorbent market structure. Institutional Investor Entrenchment: Major asset managers, hedge funds, and publicly traded companies now hold substantial crypto positions. Their long-term, regulated approach reduces panic selling. Furthermore, established custody solutions and financial products like Bitcoin ETFs provide safer access. Growth of Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization: This sector links blockchain technology to tangible assets like treasury bonds, real estate, and commodities. RWA growth creates intrinsic value streams separate from crypto-native speculation. It fundamentally diversifies the blockchain economy’s revenue sources. Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Maturation: DEX platforms have significantly improved liquidity, security, and user experience. They offer a resilient trading alternative to centralized entities, mitigating counterparty risk. Their continuous operation, regardless of corporate fortunes, supports market stability. Evolving U.S. Regulatory Landscape: While complex, clearer regulatory frameworks are emerging. These guidelines reduce existential uncertainty for compliant businesses. They provide a more predictable operating environment, encouraging serious institutional capital to enter and remain. Expert Analysis on the Halving Cycle Context The Bitcoin halving, a pre-programmed reduction in mining rewards, occurred in April 2024. Historically, this event preceded volatile market phases. Cantor Fitzgerald’s report contextualizes this cycle within the new market reality. Senior analyst at the firm noted, “The halving cycle remains a relevant psychological and supply-side model. However, its impact is now mediated by a market that is orders of magnitude larger, more liquid, and more sophisticated.” The firm’s data shows that institutional holdings now account for a record percentage of Bitcoin’s circulating supply. This demographic typically employs dollar-cost averaging and long-horizon strategies, which dampen volatility. Market data from 2024 supports this shift. For instance, trading volumes on regulated derivatives platforms outpaced those on many offshore exchanges. Additionally, the collateral quality in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols has improved markedly. High-quality, liquid assets now back most major loans, reducing systemic leverage risk. These are concrete metrics of maturation that underpin the stabilization thesis. The Road Ahead: Infrastructure Over Speculation Cantor Fitzgerald’s projection for 2025 explicitly decouples price action from ecosystem health. The report states that even if aggregate cryptocurrency prices do not rally, the year can still be deemed successful for the industry. Success will be measured by continued developer activity, regulatory clarity milestones, and institutional onboarding metrics. Key areas to watch include the expansion of blockchain-based payment rails by traditional finance players and further integration of tokenized assets on legacy settlement systems. This phase resembles the build-out of the early commercial internet. After the dot-com bubble burst, a period of consolidation followed. During that time, foundational companies and protocols emerged. Similarly, the crypto space may now focus on utility, scalability, and user experience. Projects demonstrating clear real-world use cases, particularly in RWA tokenization and enterprise blockchain solutions, are likely to attract strategic investment regardless of short-term token prices. Conclusion Cantor Fitzgerald’s analysis provides a compelling framework for understanding the next phase of crypto market evolution. The central prediction of crypto stabilization in 2025 rests on a shift from price-centric speculation to value-driven infrastructure development. Institutional adoption, regulatory progress, and the growth of sectors like RWA tokenization are creating a more resilient and mature ecosystem. While volatility will never disappear entirely, the market is building the necessary buffers to withstand cycles without catastrophic failure. This maturation process, ultimately, signifies the industry’s long-awaited arrival as a permanent component of the global financial landscape. FAQs Q1: What does Cantor Fitzgerald mean by “crypto stabilization” if prices could still fall? A1: The firm defines stabilization as reduced systemic risk and fewer catastrophic failures, not the absence of price volatility. It refers to a market where infrastructure, institutional participation, and regulatory frameworks are strong enough to function healthily even during a price downturn. Q2: How does Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization contribute to market stability? A2: RWA tokenization ties blockchain value to off-chain, income-generating assets like bonds or real estate. This creates economic activity and yields independent of crypto trading speculation, diversifying the ecosystem’s foundation and attracting different types of investors. Q3: Why does Cantor Fitzgerald believe the next downturn won’t cause major liquidations? A3: The report cites improved risk management by institutions, better collateral practices in DeFi, the presence of long-term holders, and more robust exchange infrastructure. These factors reduce the likelihood of the cascading, forced sell-offs seen in previous cycles. Q4: What is the “four-year halving cycle theory” mentioned in the report? A4: It’s an observed pattern where Bitcoin’s price tends to experience a bull market in the year+ following its halving event, then enter a bear or consolidation phase in the subsequent years. The 2024 halving places 2025 in the potential consolidation phase of this historical model. Q5: What should investors watch for in 2025 to gauge if this stabilization is happening? A5: Key indicators include the total value locked in RWA protocols, inflows/outflows from regulated crypto ETFs, the development of clear U.S. crypto legislation, and the continuity of development activity on major blockchain networks during any price decline.

It has compressed between a key support and visible resistance, setting up a potential breakout or breakdown as the market approaches the monthly close. The asset is priced around $2,970 at press time. The daily range remains tight, with the 24-hour low at $2,920 and the high at around $3,050. Trading volume is above $22 billion. Over the past week, Ethereum has fallen by just over 2% and is slightly in the red daily. $2,890 Acts as a Crucial Support Level Analyst Crypto Patel identified $2,890 as an important demand zone. He stated that holding above this level keeps Ethereum’s broader bullish structure in place. $ETH at a Critical HTF Support Inflection. $2,890 is the Structural Demand level. Acceptance above this level Preserves Bullish Market Structure. If Support Holds → Upside Continuation Toward $3,650 and $4,250. Failure to Hold → Bullish Thesis Invalidated. Binary Zone.… pic.twitter.com/Qv6jSZcdmz — Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) December 29, 2025 The asset has bounced from this level several times in recent weeks. Currently, ETH is trading just above this area. As long as the market accepts a price above $2,890, the current structure holds. A breakdown below this point would invalidate that view, bringing lower levels back into focus. Below $2,890, prior support zones sit near $2,630 and $2,400. ETH has reacted in these areas before, but holding above current levels would prevent a retest of those zones. On the upside, Ethereum faces resistance at $3,050–$3,150. This range has been tested several times, but ETH has yet to break through. Michaël van de Poppe said the market looks stronger, but cautioned, “ Nothing confirmed .” He added that a break above this resistance could lead to a push toward $3,700. The structure in lower timeframes shows a clear upward trend forming. However, unless ETH closes above this resistance range, momentum may stall. If the breakout occurs, traders are looking at $3,650 as a near-term target. Indicators and Sentiment Show Mixed Signals Some technical indicators are beginning to show movement. Dami-Defi noted that in a similar setup earlier this year, a breakout followed once the RSI moved above 50 and the MACD crossed bullishly. “ We’re seeing early signs of that same setup ,” he said, but pointed out that confirmation is still needed. Analyst CW also mentioned a CME futures gap near $2,950, a level where the price is currently hovering. These gaps are often filled before trend continuation, making it a short-term area of interest. Market Looks to Monthly Close Crypto Patel also noted that if Ethereum closes December in the red, it will mark 75% of monthly candles in 2025 closing lower. “ The monthly close matters ,” he said. This would reflect a difficult year for ETH holders. Beyond charts, sentiment around Ethereum remains mixed. Some investors point to a slower price response compared to network growth, adding to frustration among holders.

Onchain data shows that stablecoin activity in European time zones rose sharply in 2025. Ethereum and Solana-based stablecoins experienced significant growth in usage in Europe compared to other global regions, indicating broad adoption and substantial traction in 2025. The sharp increase in stablecoin activity in the region occurred despite hurdles imposed by heightened regulatory scrutiny and stringent laws on stablecoins and the broader crypto ecosystem. Stablecoins transaction activities surge in Europe Source: Artemis . Adjusted Stablecoin Transactions by Region (Ethereum and Solana) According to onchain data from stablecoin analytics platform Artemis, transactions in European time zones totaled 7.8 million in November 2025. November’s transaction count increased from 7.7 million in October, while September saw the region process 8.8 million transactions. In August, the region’s stablecoin transactions totaled 10 million, up from 10.1 million in July. In June and May, 7.6 million and 8.1 million transactions were recorded, respectively. In contrast, April and March saw 10.5 million and 14.1 million transactions, respectively. January and February recorded 14.9 million and 13.7 million transactions, respectively, marking the two months with the highest transaction count of the entire year. The total transaction count in European time zones for the entire year, excluding December, settled at 113.3 million transactions. Although the transaction count seemingly declined MoM in 2025, the annual computation reveals a different picture. In 2024, the total transaction count for Ethereum and Solana-based stablecoins reached 44.1 million, representing more than 150% increase. In 2023, the transaction count was only 3.8 million, compared to approximately 1.5 million in 2022. European Central Bank raises concerns about stablecoin usage in Europe Senne Aerts, a Graduate Programme Participant, published a report for the European Central Bank dated November 2025 as part of the EU Financial Stability Review, acknowledging the upsurge in stablecoin activity in the region. According to Aerts, the stablecoin boom in Europe raises concerns about the region’s financial stability. The publication highlighted that the stablecoin infrastructure possesses structural weaknesses and risks, such as de-pegging and runs. Aerts explained that the widespread use of stablecoins could destabilize the banking sector due to possible retail deposit outflows. The deviation of capital would diminish an essential source of funding for banking institutions, leaving them with more volatile funding overall. According to the participant, the outflows could increase if crypto trading platforms were allowed to offer interest on stablecoin deposits and holdings. He said that the interest issuance would “increase stablecoins’ relative attractiveness” and cause “banking disintermediation”. He also acknowledged that Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR) prohibits interest payment on stablecoin holdings by stablecoin issuers and crypto-asset service providers and noted that U.S. banks were calling for a similar ban. Aerts said that stablecoin issuers typically back their stablecoin by holding some of their reserves in bank deposits. He expressed an existing concern that “deposits made by stablecoin issuers may be subject to sudden withdrawals in the event of a stablecoin run, leaving bank funding structures more vulnerable to shocks.” Aerts credited the upsurge to increasing investor demand and global regulatory developments. The Financial Stability Review highlighted that the majority of stablecoin use cases originate from crypto trading activities, with Stablecoins like USDT and USDC offering investors an easy way in and out of crypto with limited exposure to conversion volatility. The report also noted that approximately 80% of global trades on centralized crypto exchanges and regulated trading platforms involve stablecoins, indicating that stablecoins have become a vital component for the longevity of cryptocurrencies and the entire DeFi sector. Despite the backlash against stablecoins, nine European banks are working on a stablecoin project called Qivalis. According to a recent Cryptopolitan report , the stablecoin intends to introduce the stablecoin in the second half of 2026. The collaborative efforts intend to develop a euro-pegged stablecoin that adheres to MiCAR and addresses the demand for a faster, 24/7 cross-border settlement solution. Get seen where it counts.

The altcoin rallied 3% overnight on comments from Grayscale Head of Research Zach Pandl on the Thinking Crypto Podcast , citing Chainlink as the bridge to bring TradFi on-chain. He described Chainlink as the “connective tissue” of tokenization, capable of delivering reliable eal-world data, regulatory-grade compliance solutions, and integrations needed for tokenized assets, stablecoins, and decentralized finance to function at scale. With the greenlight of the first Chainlink Spot ETF GLNK, institutions may finally have both the regulatory clarity and exposure they need to adopt Chainlink’s infrastructure.

Pandl notes that tokenized assets currently total around $30–35 billion, just a tiny fraction of global equity and bond markets worth roughly $300 trillion. If traditional financial instruments transition on-chain, he estimates the RWA market could expand by as much as 1,000x — and Chainlink appears positioned to capture a meaningful share of that capital inflow.

Meaningful TradFi adoption could give LINK the momentum it needs to break free from the consolidation of a year-long symmetrical triangle pattern. The structure has limited upside throughout the bullish phase of this market cycle, and with Pandl’s claims that the cycle top has not been realised, a breakout could be in the cards. LINK / USD 1-day chart, symmetrical triangle. Source: TradingView . Momentum indicators point to its lower support as a launchpad. The MACD has formed a golden cross on the retest, signs of a trend shift which weaken a breakdown scenario. A series of RSI higher lows is trending towards a cross above the neutral line, a sign of strength building beneath the surface. The key threshold for a breakout sits around $24, a level that must flip to support to sustain a confirmed breakout push towards all-time highs and into new price discovery. Fully realised, the pattern eyes a potential 460% move to $70, though this target likely hinges on significant near-term adoption for mainstream TradFi application. PepeNode: A Route to Quicker Gains As forecasted by Pandl, meaningful RWA market growth is unlikely to fully materialize this cycle. It could take five to ten years before its full impact on LINK is felt. In the meantime, meme coins continue to offer faster and more aggressive upside potential — and with PepeNode ($PEPENODE) , accumulation becomes far easier. PepeNode operates as a mine-to-earn (M2E) platform, allowing users to build exposure without needing to time the perfect entry — the downfall of most meme coin investors. Just log in, acquire virtual nodes, stack rigs, and configure their setup to begin generating passive rewards diversified across leading meme coins. And thanks to a built-in deflationary model, where 70% of all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs is burned, scarcity supports long-term token value. PepeNode offers a more measured way to secure exposure to high-upside meme markets — without relying on perfect timing. With just 10 days remaining in the presale, waiting could mean a higher entry cost.

According to ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, these ‘heartbeat trades’ create a distinct pattern on charts, resembling a heartbeat, as large fund managers execute transactions for tax efficiency. This insight, reported in March 2025, reframes our understanding of short-term cryptocurrency price action and underscores the growing influence of regulated financial products on the digital asset space. Understanding Heartbeat Trades in Bitcoin Markets The term ‘heartbeat trade’ originates from the unique price pattern it creates. Furthermore, this activity typically involves large, coordinated transactions by Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) managers. These managers execute these trades primarily for portfolio rebalancing and, more critically, for tax management. Consequently, the resulting chart shows a sharp spike followed by a rapid return to baseline, mimicking a heartbeat’s rhythm. This pattern is distinct from trends driven by news, investor fear, or macroeconomic factors. Analysts now scrutinize these signatures to separate technical, compliance-driven activity from genuine sentiment shifts. The Mechanics of ETF Tax Avoidance In-kind transfers form the core of this strategy. Instead of selling securities for cash and potentially incurring a capital gains tax liability, ETF managers transfer large blocks of assets directly to authorized participants. This process, known as a heartbeat trade, allows the fund to rebalance its portfolio or meet creation/redemption demands without triggering a taxable event. For Bitcoin ETFs, this involves moving substantial amounts of BTC. The sheer scale of these transfers can temporarily distort the spot market price, creating the observed volatility. This mechanism is a standard, legal practice in traditional ETF management, now applied to cryptocurrency. Distinguishing Tax Strategy from Market Sentiment For retail investors, differentiating between these two drivers is crucial. Market sentiment reflects the collective emotional and psychological attitude of investors toward an asset. It is influenced by news, regulatory developments, technological advances, and macroeconomic indicators. In contrast, a tax-driven trade is a procedural, financial engineering event with no bearing on the underlying value or long-term outlook of Bitcoin. Recognizing this difference prevents misinterpretation of short-term noise as a fundamental signal. Analysts advise focusing on longer-term trends, on-chain data, and adoption metrics rather than intraday spikes caused by institutional housekeeping. Sentiment-Driven Move: Correlates with major news events, shows sustained volume, and often shifts the price baseline. Tax-Driven ‘Heartbeat’: Appears as an isolated, sharp spike and retrace, occurs around quarter-ends or fiscal periods, and is accompanied by specific ETF flow data. Comparing Trade Drivers: Sentiment vs. Tax Strategy Feature Sentiment-Driven Volatility Tax-Driven ‘Heartbeat’ Trade Primary Cause News, Fear/Greed, Macroeconomics ETF Rebalancing, In-Kind Transfers Price Pattern Sustained trend or gradual shift Sharp, V-shaped spike and retrace Duration Days to weeks Hours to a single day Trading Volume Elevated throughout the move Extremely high at spike, then normalizes Predictability Low, based on unforeseen events Moderate, often tied to fiscal calendars The Broader Impact on Cryptocurrency Markets The prevalence of heartbeat trades signals a maturation phase for Bitcoin. It demonstrates the deep integration of cryptocurrency into the traditional financial system’s plumbing. The actions of large, regulated entities like ETF sponsors now have a measurable, albeit temporary, impact on price discovery. This integration brings both stability, through increased institutional participation, and new forms of technical volatility. Market observers note that as the total Assets Under Management (AUM) in spot Bitcoin ETFs grow, the potential scale of these rebalancing events increases. Therefore, understanding these flows becomes essential for advanced market analysis. Expert Analysis and Future Outlook Eric Balchunas’s observation provides critical context for market participants. Other analysts from firms like JPMorgan and CoinShares have echoed this view, noting that quarter-end periods often see elevated ‘noise’ from such activities. The long-term implication is that Bitcoin’s price action will increasingly bifurcate. Short-term moves will reflect the technical mechanics of the growing ETF complex, while long-term trajectory will hinge on adoption, regulatory clarity, and its evolving role as a digital asset. For the market in 2025, this means analysts must filter out these procedural trades to assess the true health of investor sentiment. Conclusion In summary, the recent Bitcoin price movements identified as ‘heartbeat trades’ highlight a significant evolution in market structure. These tax-driven transactions, executed by ETF managers for portfolio rebalancing, create distinct volatility that is unrelated to fundamental investor sentiment. This analysis underscores the importance of sophisticated market interpretation in the era of institutional cryptocurrency adoption. As the landscape matures, distinguishing between mechanical financial engineering and genuine sentiment will remain a key skill for investors navigating the Bitcoin markets. FAQs Q1: What exactly is a ‘heartbeat trade’ in Bitcoin? A heartbeat trade is a large-scale transaction, typically by an ETF manager, conducted as an in-kind transfer to avoid capital gains taxes during portfolio rebalancing. It creates a sharp, V-shaped spike and retrace on a price chart. Q2: Why do heartbeat trades not reflect true market sentiment? These trades are mechanical and driven by tax code compliance or internal fund management needs. They are not based on a view of Bitcoin’s future value, news, or macroeconomic factors, which are the typical drivers of market sentiment. Q3: How can an investor tell the difference between a heartbeat and a sentiment-driven move? Key indicators include the trade’s timing (often near quarter-ends), its isolated V-shaped pattern, and correlation with published ETF creation/redemption data. Sentiment moves are more sustained and tied to identifiable news events. Q4: Do heartbeat trades only affect Bitcoin? While the term is now applied to Bitcoin ETFs, the mechanism is standard in traditional finance for all ETFs holding appreciated assets. The effect is more noticeable in Bitcoin due to its volatility and the large size of the transfers involved. Q5: What does the increase in these trades mean for Bitcoin’s future? It signifies growing institutional adoption and integration into regulated financial systems. While it adds a layer of short-term technical volatility, it also contributes to market liquidity and legitimacy over the long term.

The purchase comes as digital asset investment products, including those linked to Ethereum, recorded another week of net outflows, reflecting continued caution among some investors. Even so, BitMine’s latest acquisition points to sustained institutional interest in Ethereum, diverging from broader fund flow trends and underscoring selective confidence in the asset among corporate buyers. BitMine ends 2025 with major Ethereum buy BitMine Immersion Technologies ended 2025 with a further expansion of its Ethereum holdings, according to a press release issued on December 29. The company said it now holds 4,110,525 ETH, valued at about $12.1 billion based on prices near $2,948 per token. The stash represents roughly 3.41% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply. The disclosure follows BitMine’s recent purchase of 44,463 ETH, underscoring an aggressive treasury strategy centered on long-term exposure to digital assets. The accumulation comes as other crypto-focused firms also increased holdings, including Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, which reported a fresh Bitcoin purchase. In addition to its Ethereum position, BitMine holds 192 Bitcoin, about $23 million in higher-risk “moonshot” investments, and $1 billion in cash reserves. Taken together, the company’s crypto and cash holdings total approximately $13.2 billion. BitMine chairman Thomas “Tom” Lee, emphasized the opportunistic timing: “Market activity tends to slow as we enter the final holiday weeks of a calendar year. BitMine added 44,463 ETH in the past week, as we continue to be the largest ‘fresh money’ buyer of ETH in the World.” Lee also noted potential year-end tax-loss selling pressures, which the company is navigating strategically. BitMine’s operations extend beyond mere accumulation. The firm engages in Bitcoin mining in low-cost energy regions such as Trinidad and Texas, while advancing Ethereum staking initiatives. Currently, 408,627 ETH are staked across providers, yielding a composite rate of 2.81%. Looking ahead, BitMine plans to launch its Made in America Validator Network (MAVAN) in Q1 2026, aiming to optimise yields and potentially generate over $1 million daily in staking rewards at full scale. The company’s ambitious “Alchemy of 5%” goal seeks to acquire 5% of Ethereum’s supply, positioning it as a dominant player in the ecosystem. An upcoming annual stockholder meeting on January 15, 2026, at Wynn Las Vegas will address key proposals to support this vision, including increasing authorised shares and approving an incentive plan. This end-of-year surge in holdings reflects BitMine’s commitment to Ethereum as its primary treasury asset, leveraging both mining revenues and capital raises to build a robust balance sheet in the evolving blockchain landscape. Ethereum price holds key level As BitMine bolsters its Ethereum position, the underlying asset demonstrates resilience in the broader market. On December 29, 2025, Ethereum traded around $2,900–$3,051, maintaining stability despite seasonal volatility and broader cryptocurrency fluctuations. Analysts highlight the current range as a critical support and resistance zone. The area has seen repeated buying interest, which has prevented deeper corrections. However, potential downside risk remains, and $2,800–$2,670 could be key. On the upside, a sustained move above $3,050–$3,100 could signal renewed momentum, targeting higher levels near $3,200 or beyond toward $4,200.

While price is attempting to stabilize after weeks of sideways action, the broader structure suggests this move remains corrective rather than decisive. Until ETH can clear the $3,550 barrier, the bounce looks more like a pause in consolidation than the start of a sustained upside breakout. Sideways Correction Still Dominates Ethereum’s Structure According to More Crypto Online, Ethereum continues to trade within a sideways corrective structure that has been in place since November 21. Price action remains capped below the upper boundary of this corrective trend channel, signaling that the market has yet to show a convincing shift toward a broader bullish phase. Related Reading: Here’s The Ethereum Descending Triangle Structure That Threatens A Crash Below $2,800 At this stage, a break above the corrective channel is the minimum indication that upside momentum may be developing. Even if Ethereum does push higher, caution is still warranted. Any advance from current levels could simply unfold as a yellow B-wave within a larger circle wave 5, or as an extended phase of circle wave 4. Both scenarios imply that upward movement may be corrective in nature rather than the start of a sustained rally. For the more bullish orange scenario to gain real credibility, Ethereum would need to reclaim the $3,550 resistance level decisively. A clean break and hold above this zone would help confirm a stronger breakout structure and reduce the risk that the move is merely a temporary bounce. Until such confirmation appears, the probability of another downside test remains elevated. Overall, the technical structure still favors consolidation or further downside over an immediate bullish continuation, keeping the market in a cautious mode. ETH Mirrors Bitcoin’s Range-Bound Behavior In a more recent update, Crypto Candy noted that Ethereum continues to mirror Bitcoin’s price behavior, remaining locked in a well-defined range between $2,700 and $3,400. ETH’s price has been largely stagnant over the past few sessions, indicating indecision across the broader market as participants await a clearer directional cue. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Targets Break Above $3K, Bulls Smell Opportunity However, ETH recently found support in the $2,600–$2,700 demand zone, where buyers stepped in and sparked a short-term bounce. This reaction has allowed price to start pushing back toward higher levels within the range, suggesting that downside pressure is easing for now. If momentum continues to build, a move toward the upper boundary around $3,400 could regain focus. For the bullish bias to remain valid, the $2,600–$2,700 support area must continue to hold. A clean breakdown below that zone would weaken the current recovery attempt and reopen the door to deeper downside.

The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $0.1774, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.1969. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.1638, beginning a bearish trend to $0.1538. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX down today? The overall dydx market sentiment is bearish as buyers failed to defend support channels. This resulted in a decline toward $0.17. Will dYdX Recover? If buyers hold above $0.2 level strongly, we might see a strong recovery in the coming hours. What is the dYdX price prediction for 2025? In 2025, dYdX is predicted to reach a minimum level of $3.86. Traders and investors can expect a maximum level of $4.55 and an average price of $3.96 if the bulls show up. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiment, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future. It is advised to seek independent professional consultation and investment advice from experts before investing in the crypto market, which has high price volatility. Recent news/opinion on dYdX The dYdX community has proposed a three-month experimental buyback program, running from November 1, 2025, to January 31, 2026, that will use the protocol’s net transaction fees to repurchase DYDX tokens. The initiative, expected to buy back between $5 million and $10 million worth of tokens, aims to boost token value and assess the protocol’s capital efficiency. dYdX price prediction December 2025 dYdX’s price might attempt to surge toward $0.44 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $0.6, if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection by the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $0.2. dYdX price prediction Minimum price Average price Maximum price dYdX price prediction December 2025 $0.2 $0.44 $0.6 dYdX price prediction 2025 The price of 1 dYdX is expected to reach a minimum level of $0.2 by the end of 2025.

The American semiconductor firm said in September that it would pay $23.28 per share for Intel common stock. Nvidia has purchased over 214.7 million Intel shares at the price it set out in the September deal. The firm’s initiative is regarded as a major financial milestone for the company, following years of capital-intensive production capacity expansions that had drained its finances. Antitrust agencies clear Nvidia’s investment in Intel Huge deal between $NVDA and $INTC . NVIDIA and Intel announced a multi-generation collaboration across PC and datacenter and NVIDIA will invest $5B in Intel at $23.28 per share. The joint solution will be a tight coupling Intel x86 CPUs and NVIDIA RTX GPUs over NVLink for PCs… pic.twitter.com/CPkfxC8gdk — Patrick Moorhead (@PatrickMoorhead) September 18, 2025 The U.S. Federal Trade Commission also announced in early December that U.S. antitrust agencies had cleared Nvidia’s investment in Intel. At the time of publication, the tech giant’s shares had surged more than 1% to $190.53 after the announcement, while Intel’s stock had remained unchanged. Nvidia revealed that Intel plans to design and manufacture custom data center and client CPUs using the firm’s NVLink. Both companies believe that the initiative will accelerate the deployment of applications and workloads across both enterprise and consumer markets. The tech giant said the initiative will focus on seamlessly connecting NVLink to integrate the strengths of its AI and accelerated computing with Intel’s CPU technologies and x86 ecosystems. “This historic collaboration tightly couples Nvidia’s AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel’s CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem – a fusion of two world-class platforms. Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing.” – Jensen Huang , Founder and CEO of Nvidia. Intel plans to boost personal computing by building and offering the market x86 system-on-chips (SOCs) that integrate RTX GPU chiplets. The firm also said the new x86 RTX SOCs will power a wide range of computers. CEO of Intel, Lip-Bu Tan, argued that the company’s x86 architecture has been the foundation of modern computing for decades. He also revealed that the firm is innovating across its portfolio to enable the workloads of the future. Nvidia purchases a nonexclusive license from Groq Cryptopolitan previously reported that Nvidia also recently agreed to purchase a nonexclusive license for technology from Groq. The deal is alleged to push Groq’s valuation to around $20 billion. The announcement revealed that the company will hire many of Groq’s key employees. Groq was last valued at $6.9 billion in a $750 million funding round in September. Truist Securities analyst William Stein argued that the $20 billion valuation is large in absolute terms. He added that the price is higher than Groq’s revenue, which is estimated at between $90 million and $500 million. The analyst also mentioned that the initiative represents less than 50% of Nvidia’s net cash and less than its expected free cash flow for Q4. Stein believes that Nvidia’s further development of Groq’s technology could make the firm’s capabilities more appealing to high-volume customers. Nvidia has been involved in multiple deals this year, totaling more than $125 billion. However, despite those deals fueling surging stock prices, doubts have emerged about how the company conducts its business. The firm has been accused of vendor financing, which involves lending money to customers so they can buy the company’s products. Such deals include Nvidia’s $10 billion annual investment in OpenAI for the next 10 years, which will enable the firm to purchase the company’s chips. The other alleged vendor financing deal is the arrangement with CoreWeave for leasing out Nvidia chips. Nvidia agreed to buy $22 billion of data center capacity from the cloud provider and will receive $350 million in CoreWeave stock. The tech company has been compared to Lucent Technologies, which aggressively lent money to its customers and overextended itself, unraveling in the early 2000s. Nvidia has refuted the claims of similarity, arguing that it does not rely on vendor financing arrangements to drive revenue growth. Renowned tech investor James Anderson said Nvidia’s deal with OpenAI presented more reason to be concerned about the company than before.

Its adoption is steadily growing without the spotlight, enabling faster, cheaper, and more reliable cross-border transactions. Unlike other cryptocurrencies that rely on public attention, XRP emphasizes functionality, allowing real-world impact before the general public even realizes it. According to Jungle Inc Crypto News, Ripple cofounder Chris Larsen recently explained this “silent” adoption approach. In a video clip, he noted that most consumers may never know they are using XRP Ledger technology, much like the internet’s infrastructure operates invisibly in daily life. “It very well might be that most consumers never know they’re using this technology, no more than they know they’re using some of the backbone of the internet that is there,” Larsen said. Instead, users experience the benefits directly: sending money internationally in seconds with lower costs and better exchange rates. XRP the silent takeover: Chris Larsen confirms adoption likely comes without an announcement. #XRP Ledger powers the future without the general public knowing why financial services just work. pic.twitter.com/uqpZ0B3NXU — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) December 29, 2025 Seamless Cross-Border Payments XRP Ledger’s low-latency, cost-efficient architecture makes it an ideal backbone for international transfers. By integrating XRP into banking systems and payment networks, transactions settle almost instantly , allowing users to send funds globally without friction. Larsen highlighted this practical impact: “They just know that suddenly now I can send $20 to my family in India at practically no cost in five seconds at a much better exchange rate than I ever would have gotten.” Consumers experience tangible benefits without needing to understand the underlying technology. Institutional Integration Driving Adoption The silent takeover is largely powered by banks and financial institutions embedding the XRP Ledger into their infrastructure. This allows new services to launch seamlessly while maintaining regulatory compliance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Banks benefit from enhanced speed, reliability, and reduced operational costs, while end users enjoy improved service. Larsen emphasized that adoption happens quietly but effectively, with consumers gaining better financial experiences without direct awareness of XRP. Implications for the Crypto Ecosystem XRP’s behind-the-scenes strategy highlights a different path for blockchain adoption. Unlike speculative-driven growth models, XRP focuses on utility , proving that institutional and technological integration can drive mass adoption without fanfare. This positions the XRP Ledger as a foundational layer for global finance, capable of supporting real-world applications at scale. In conclusion, by prioritizing infrastructure over visibility, XRP is achieving a silent yet powerful presence in the financial ecosystem. As Larsen noted, most consumers may never know they are using the technology, yet they benefit from faster, cheaper, and more efficient transactions. This quiet adoption strategy ensures XRP is not only a cryptocurrency but a transformative protocol, steadily reshaping global payments from behind the scenes.

The company said on Friday that affected users can now submit claims through an official support form hosted on Trust Wallet’s portal. The claims process requires users to provide basic identifying details, including their email address and country of residence, alongside the compromised wallet addresses, suspected attacker addresses, and relevant transaction hashes. Trust Wallet said it is prioritizing reviews of all submissions and has committed to compensating every verified victim of the incident. Trust Wallet Contacts Victims as Scammers Exploit Breach Fallout In a statement posted on X on December 26, Trust Wallet acknowledged the disruption caused by the breach and said its support team had already begun contacting impacted users. Update on Trust Wallet Browser Extension v2.68 Security Incident: Compensation Process To start the compensation process, affected users should please complete this form: https://t.co/xlBLrL6kMj to help us process your case. Our support team is prioritizing all the victims from… https://t.co/yaqFNLxuyx — Trust Wallet (@TrustWallet) December 26, 2025 The company added that each case requires careful verification to ensure accuracy and security and promised to provide ongoing updates as the process moves forward. At the same time, Trust Wallet warned users to remain vigilant against scams, noting an increase in fake compensation forms, impersonated support accounts, and unsolicited direct messages circulating on Telegram and other platforms. The compensation announcement followed confirmation of the breach on December 25, when Trust Wallet disclosed that only version 2.68 of its Chrome browser extension was affected. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT first drew attention to the incident after multiple users reported unauthorized fund outflows shortly after installing the update. Multiple Trust Wallet users experienced unauthorized fund outflows on Thursday due to a new browser extension theft. Losses are estimated to surpass $6 million. #TrustWallet #CryptoTheft #TrustWalletTheft https://t.co/mchzwWAHK3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 26, 2025 Trust Wallet later urged users running the compromised version to disable it immediately and upgrade to version 2.69. According to ZachXBT, the number of victims climbed into the hundreds within hours, with more than $6 million siphoned across several blockchains, including Bitcoin, Solana, and EVM-compatible networks. Several users said their wallets were drained within minutes, with one account on X claiming losses exceeding $300,000, though ZachXBT later flagged that specific account as suspicious. How a Chrome Extension Update Turned Into a Wallet Heist Investigators and users reported that the malicious extension appeared legitimate when installed through Chrome’s normal update process. However, the embedded code allowed attackers to extract users’ recovery phrases, enabling immediate access to their funds. One user warned that simply importing a seed phrase into the extension triggered instant wallet draining. Browser extensions typically operate with elevated permissions, giving them access to web pages, storage, and browsing data, which makes them a powerful target for attackers when abused. Trust Wallet said mobile app users and those running other versions of its browser extension were not impacted. The Chrome extension itself has roughly one million users, according to its Web Store listing. In a separate post, Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, which acquired Trust Wallet in 2018, confirmed that all verified losses would be covered. Zhao estimated the total affected amount at around $7 million and said user funds would be reimbursed. So far, $7m affected by this hack. @TrustWallet will cover. User funds are SAFU. Appreciate your understanding for any inconveniences caused. The team is still investigating how hackers were able to submit a new version. https://t.co/xdPGwwDU8b — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) December 26, 2025 The incident comes amid a broader rise in wallet-related exploits across the crypto industry. According to Chainalysis, more than $3.4 billion was stolen from January through early December 2025, with a single February compromise at Bybit accounting for nearly half of that total. Source: Chainalysis Personal wallet compromises have grown steadily over recent years, rising from just over 7% of stolen value in 2022 to more than a third in 2025, excluding the Bybit attack. Centralized platforms, while less frequently compromised, have also seen increasingly large losses tied to private key breaches.

The move would expand the country’s so-called travel rule, which currently applies mainly to larger transactions. South Korea will extend its crypto Travel Rule to cover sub-$700 transactions, closing a loophole used to evade identity checks. #SouthKorea #Crypto https://t.co/LBJKNcmMQg — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 28, 2025 The plan is being reviewed by financial authorities following the launch of a task force led by the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to revise the Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information, often referred to as the Special Act. Regulators Turn Attention to Small Crypto Payments as Smurfing Grows According to local media reports, officials are examining whether to require exchanges to collect and share sender and recipient information for all virtual asset transfers, including those worth 1 million won or less. The travel rule, sometimes described as a real-name system for crypto, obliges exchanges to verify and record user details such as names and wallet addresses during deposits and withdrawals. Authorities have pointed to the growing use of “smurfing,” a method in which large sums are broken into many small transfers to avoid reporting thresholds. While higher-value transfers have long been monitored, officials believe criminals have shifted activity toward low-value transactions to bypass existing controls. Financial authorities have linked these patterns to tax evasion, drug trafficking, and the movement of illegal funds overseas. On November 29, the first meeting of the FIU task force, which is headed by the Director Lee Hyeong-ju, was held to chart its broader reforms. The focus of the debate is on tightening control over the virtual asset service providers, harmonizing the domestic regulations with the international principles of the Financial Action Task Force, and enhancing the inspection and sanctioning mechanisms. Authorities as well have admitted that the anti-money laundering regime , which was instituted over 20 years ago in South Korea, has not been keeping up with cross-border digital crime and the booming virtual resources. South Korea Moves to Freeze Suspicious Crypto Accounts Beyond the travel rule expansion, the task force is considering additional measures aimed at preventing funds from disappearing before investigations can begin. This includes introducing an account suspension system that would allow authorities to temporarily freeze accounts suspected of being tied to serious crimes. The proposed revisions would also extend anti-money laundering obligations to certain professionals, such as lawyers and accountants, who may be involved in complex financial transactions. The crackdown on small transfers is a part of a broader increase in crypto regulation that is already happening. Local exchanges have been advised by the Financial Supervisory Service to establish round-the-clock monitoring systems to identify abnormal trading and report the suspicious activity to the regulators. South Korea has acted similarly and restricted access to international transactions considered to be high risk, forcing major application stores to delete unregistered foreign apps that cater to the Korean market. Simultaneously, exchanges are under less examination of their financial wellness and proprietorship forms. Proposed rules would bar individuals with past convictions for tax or drug-related crimes from becoming major shareholders in licensed crypto firms. From the second half of 2025, businesses involved in cross-border crypto transactions will also be required to preregister and submit regular reports to the Bank of Korea. South Korea will share crypto transactions by non-residents on local exchanges such as Upbit and Bithumb, with countries worldwide. #SouthKorea #CryptoTransaction #SouthKoreaCrypto https://t.co/ZD56JHeM9H — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 2, 2025 These domestic steps are unfolding alongside South Korea’s participation in international data-sharing efforts. The country has joined the OECD’s Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework, which will enable tax authorities to exchange standardized information on crypto transactions across borders. Transaction records are expected to begin being collected next year, with full information sharing scheduled to start in 2027 .

This New Altcoin Is Nearly Sold Out,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-crypto-to-buy-for-q1-2026-this-new-altcoin-is-nearly-sold-out/,"A change is taking shape in the crypto industry. Bitcoin has retreated to long-term heights. Ethereum has decelerated in the area of major opposition. Meme coins which caused brief spurts of hype are dwindling in popularity. As this occurs, the focus would tend to shift rapidly towards a project that is structured and timed. At the moment, there is a single DeFi crypto that is beginning to shine as traders prepare to enter Q1 2026. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gains increasing popularity when the market is becoming pessimistic. Investors are not depending on hype cycles, but the project is constructing a lending centered DeFi protocol that can be used in practice. Its core goal is simple. Link lenders and borrowers by obvious rules and mechanical predictability. Mutuum Finance has been building two lending markets. One side is on pooled liquidity where the users contribute assets and receive a yield. The other one permits first-hand borrowing to be made with specified terms and lien limits. This configuration provides the protocol with flexibility and risk can be seen. The key distinction of MUTM in uncertain conditions is timing. The project is by the end of Q4 2025 nearing V1 launch . That makes it right at the front of Q1 2026 at which time numerous investors project new funds to revolve in novel crypto and DeFi crypto undertakings with operating items. Participation Surge and What the Numbers Are Signaling The participation data of Mutuum Finance has increased progressively. It has also exceeded a total of over $19.4M in raised funds and has over 18,600 holders. These numbers are important since they indicate distribution, and not short term flipping. An increased number of holders indicates that the ownership is being distributed on numerous wallets. This usually builds a greater foundation as a project approaches the release. Increased financing is also an indication of confidence. Inflow of capital is not in a single shot- it is flowing in as time passes. These figures never assure results. However, traders monitor them closely most times in order to provide an early warning to them before wider exposure sets in. Structure of the Supply and Price Movement MUTM is now selling at a price of $0.035 and is in phase 6. The overall number of tokens is limited to 4 billion. Of this supply 45.5% is set for early distribution amounting to approximately 1.82 billion tokens. The price of the token has been rising in steps since the beginning of 2025 with each step. Since the beginning stage to where it is now, MUTM has already risen approximately 250%. Higher entry prices have been presented in each phase as a company to reflect the demand at varying stages. As the existing period approaches an end, the supply becomes restricted. This is the period in time that the behavior of prices can change historically. The amount of tokens is lower, and the attention keeps increasing. Infrastructure and Security Investing in DeFi largely involves security. Mutuum Finance has already passed a CertiK token scan with 90 out of 100 points. This scan is a review of contract risks and technical flags. Moreover, Halborn Security is considering basic smart contracts. There is also a bug bounty program that is active, and the amount is large, which is $50,000, offering external code testing prior to launch. These layers are important to a lending protocol, trust and stability of which are required. Along with security, the roadmap entails oracles of correct pricing data. A native stablecoin and subsequent expansion to Layer 2 will be planned to make it less expensive and faster. These characteristics refer to long time utilisation as opposed to short cycles. Timing Right Now and Urgency Window With tightening of allocation, there is a change in behavior around MUTM. There are bigger acquisitions which have included recent whale sized acquisitions. The 24 hour leaderboard introduces a certain level of dynamism, as it rewards interest in the regularity of participation and not the decisive action. Card payments exist and increase demand among new users. This would hasten the participation rate since there is more exposure. As V1 nears and supply falls almost to the present level, Mutuum Finance is approaching a slim margin. To traders both eyes on the peak crypto markets and scanning new crypto opportunities, the phase can be the major shift toward quiet building and greater exposure, before Q1 2026.

The company secured key partnerships and made notable acquisitions, and the crypto community finally saw the conclusion of the Ripple/SEC legal battle, while the asset’s price was booming in the summer. However, the past few months have not been kind to the market, and XRP’s valuation has headed south. Moreover, large investors (known as whales) have been selling their holdings en masse, signaling that the downtrend is nowhere near its end. The Legal Saga and the Major Acquisitions Ripple started the year rather quietly, initially standing aside from the spotlight. However, it all changed in March when the company’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, announced that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had dropped its appeal against the firm, triggering real euphoria across the XRP Army. The legal battle had to pass through additional phases before being finally concluded in the summer. The final judgment required Ripple to pay a civil penalty of approximately $125 million for violating certain securities laws. The SEC initially sought about $2 billion in disgorgement and penalties, meaning the company was ordered to pay less than 7% of what the regulator insisted on. That said, countless analysts and experts viewed the ruling as a major and decisive victory for Ripple. Some went even further, describing it as a pivotal moment in the industry and one that marks the pro-crypto shift at the SEC following the resignation of former Chairman Gary Gensler. The company’s success this year spreads well beyond its court win against. In April, it disclosed the acquisition of the prime brokerage Hidden Road for $1.25 billion, which was seen as one of the largest deals ever in the crypto space. Several months later, the platform was renamed to Ripple Prime, and its goal is to provide services to institutional clients. Besides that, the firm made other notable deals, including the purchase of Rail for $200 million and Palisade. In addition, it announced a $1 billion acquisition of treasury management system provider GTreasury. There were also rumors that Ripple planned to spend more than $5 billion to purchase Circle, the company behind the stablecoin USDC. However, the latter reportedly rejected the offer. Earlier this month, CEO Garlinghouse dropped another bombshell, saying the entity has received conditional approval from the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to charter Ripple National Trust Bank. The excitement of the XRP community was more than evident, and some revealed that Bank of America has confirmed the move. The ETFs and RLUSD’s Progress Another major milestone occurred towards the end of the year. It was mid-November when Canary Capital introduced the first spot XRP ETF in the United States, which has 100% exposure to the token. The product had a very successful debut, and shortly after, Bitwise, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, and 21Shares followed suit . According to SoSoValue, the investment vehicles have so far generated a cumulative total net inflow of around $1.14 billion. 2025 has also been beneficial for Ripple’s stablecoin. Launched in late 2024 under the ticker RLUSD and pegged to the American dollar, the financial product gained backing from numerous exchanges, banking giants, and well-known entities over the last several months. In July, Ripple selected the oldest US bank, BNY Mellon, to serve as a custodian for RLUSD. Meanwhile, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) recognized the stablecoin within the Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC), whereas Abu Dhabi’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) classified it as an accepted fiat-referenced token. RLUSD’s market capitalization recently surpassed $1.3 billion, making it the 12th-largest stablecoin and the 77th-largest cryptocurrency. XRP’s Rise and Fall Ripple’s native token started the year on the right foot, exceeding the $3 mark in January. While the following months were volatile and not as successful, the summer brought another major resurgence. In July, XRP hit a new all-time high of around $3.65 amid a time when the broader crypto market was booming. The past months, though, have brought a painful correction. As of this writing, XRP trades at around $1.87 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a 48% decline from the summer peak. Certain factors, including the bearish market conditions and the recent selling spree by large investors, suggest the pullback may intensify in the near future. At one point towards the end of the year, whales offloaded roughly 1.4 billion tokens in less than a month. Later on, they dumped an additional 510 million tokens in the span of a single week, while around Christmas, they sold 40 million coins. Those efforts signal reduced confidence in the asset, which could spread panic across the community and prompt smaller players to cash out, too. It also raises the question that the whales might know something we don’t, which could explain their selling en masse.

According to David Duong, Head of Institutional Crypto Research at Coinbase, this explosive crypto derivatives market growth represents more than just numerical achievement—it marks the organic integration of sophisticated financial instruments into decentralized finance ecosystems. The convergence of traditional derivative mechanics with blockchain-native protocols creates unprecedented opportunities while raising important questions about market structure evolution. Crypto Derivatives Market Evolution Through DeFi Integration The cryptocurrency derivatives landscape has undergone remarkable transformation since Bitcoin futures first launched on regulated exchanges in 2017. Initially, these products remained confined to centralized platforms like CME Group and Binance, requiring traditional account structures and facing regulatory scrutiny. However, the emergence of decentralized exchanges fundamentally altered this trajectory. Today, perpetual futures contracts—derivative instruments without expiration dates—have become the dominant vehicle for leveraged crypto exposure. Their integration with DeFi protocols represents the next evolutionary phase, enabling composability that centralized platforms cannot replicate. This development mirrors broader financial innovation patterns where successful products migrate toward more open, transparent, and accessible architectures. Several key factors drive this crypto derivatives market growth. First, decentralized perpetual exchanges eliminate counterparty risk through smart contract execution and non-custodial trading. Second, they provide global access without geographic restrictions or identity verification barriers. Third, their integration with lending protocols creates synergistic opportunities for capital efficiency. For instance, traders can simultaneously use positions as collateral for borrowing while maintaining market exposure. This composability transforms isolated trading instruments into interconnected financial building blocks. The resulting ecosystem demonstrates how decentralized technologies can enhance rather than merely replicate traditional financial services. Perpetual Futures Trading Volume Analysis and Trends The $1.2 trillion trading volume milestone for decentralized perpetual futures represents exponential growth from just $50 billion in early 2023. This 24-fold increase occurred despite broader cryptocurrency market volatility and regulatory uncertainties. Several platforms contributed significantly to this expansion: dYdX: Maintained early leadership with institutional-grade order book architecture GMX: Popularized multi-asset liquidity pools and zero-price impact swaps Perpetual Protocol: Pioneered virtual automated market maker (vAMM) design Gains Network: Expanded synthetic asset coverage including forex and commodities This growth trajectory reflects increasing sophistication among both retail and institutional participants. Retail investors appreciate the simplified access to leveraged positions without complex margin account setups. Meanwhile, institutional players value the transparency and auditability of on-chain transactions. The migration of trading volume from centralized to decentralized venues demonstrates clear preference shifts toward self-custody solutions, especially following several high-profile exchange failures in 2022-2023. Market analysts note that decentralized perpetual futures now capture approximately 35% of total crypto derivatives volume, up from just 5% two years prior. Technical Innovations Driving Adoption Several technical breakthroughs enabled this crypto derivatives market growth. Oracle systems improved dramatically, providing more reliable price feeds with lower latency and manipulation resistance. Layer-2 scaling solutions reduced transaction costs by over 90%, making frequent trading economically viable. Cross-margin systems evolved to support portfolio-level risk management across multiple positions. Perhaps most importantly, user interface improvements made decentralized trading nearly as intuitive as centralized alternatives. These innovations collectively addressed previous adoption barriers while preserving DeFi’s core advantages of transparency and user control. DeFi Integration Creating New Financial Primitives The organic integration of perpetual futures with other DeFi protocols represents the most significant development in decentralized finance since automated market makers. David Duong’s analysis highlights how these instruments evolve from standalone products into core financial infrastructure components. This integration occurs through several mechanisms: Integration Type Mechanism Strategic Applications Lending Protocol Synergy Using perpetual positions as collateral for borrowing Leveraged yield farming, capital efficiency optimization Liquidity Provision Funding rate arbitrage across multiple platforms Market-neutral returns, protocol revenue generation Structured Products Combining with options and fixed-income instruments Risk-managed exposure, customized payoff profiles These integrations create what developers term “financial legos”—composable instruments that users can combine in innovative ways. For example, a trader might open a perpetual futures position, use it as collateral to borrow stablecoins, then provide that liquidity to an automated market maker. This creates a complex but capital-efficient strategy that traditional finance cannot easily replicate. The resulting ecosystem demonstrates genuine innovation rather than mere digitization of existing products. This organic integration drives crypto derivatives market growth by expanding use cases beyond speculative trading to include hedging, yield generation, and structured product creation. Future Expansion into Traditional Asset Classes Industry experts anticipate significant expansion beyond cryptocurrency markets. David Duong forecasts that perpetual futures mechanisms will eventually support equities, commodities, and potentially even real-world assets. This expansion faces technical and regulatory challenges but follows logical progression patterns. Several projects already experiment with synthetic stock perpetuals, though regulatory clarity remains pending. The potential advantages for traditional assets mirror those in crypto markets: 24/7 trading, global accessibility, reduced counterparty risk, and composability with other DeFi services. This expansion could democratize access to sophisticated financial instruments that currently remain institutionally dominated. Retail investors might eventually trade leveraged positions on major stocks through decentralized platforms with the same ease as crypto perpetuals today. However, regulatory adaptation represents the primary hurdle. Different jurisdictions approach synthetic asset regulation with varying frameworks, creating compliance complexity for global platforms. Despite these challenges, the technical foundation exists for cross-asset expansion, suggesting that current crypto derivatives market growth represents merely the initial phase of broader financial innovation. Institutional Adoption Accelerating Institutional participation increased significantly throughout 2024, with hedge funds, family offices, and proprietary trading firms allocating capital to decentralized perpetual trading. These sophisticated players appreciate the transparency advantages and often develop custom integrations with their existing systems. Their participation brings improved liquidity, tighter spreads, and more sophisticated risk management practices. This institutional influx further validates the technology while pushing development toward enterprise-grade reliability and feature sets. The resulting ecosystem maturation creates positive feedback loops that drive additional crypto derivatives market growth. Conclusion The crypto derivatives market growth to $1.2 trillion in decentralized perpetual futures trading volume represents a watershed moment for decentralized finance. This achievement demonstrates how DeFi integration transforms isolated financial products into interconnected ecosystem components. The organic composability with lending protocols and other DeFi primitives creates strategic applications unavailable in traditional finance. As technical innovations continue and regulatory frameworks evolve, this crypto derivatives market expansion will likely extend to traditional asset classes, potentially democratizing access to sophisticated financial instruments globally. The current trajectory suggests perpetual futures will remain central to decentralized finance architecture while influencing broader financial market evolution. FAQs Q1: What are perpetual futures in cryptocurrency trading? Perpetual futures are derivative contracts without expiration dates that track underlying asset prices. They use funding rate mechanisms to maintain price alignment and enable leveraged trading positions in both long and short directions. Q2: How does DeFi integration improve perpetual futures trading? DeFi integration enables composability with other protocols, allowing positions to serve as collateral for borrowing, integration with yield farming strategies, and creation of structured products through smart contract combinations. Q3: What risks accompany decentralized perpetual futures trading? Primary risks include smart contract vulnerabilities, oracle manipulation possibilities, liquidation risks during volatility, and regulatory uncertainty across different jurisdictions despite improved technical safeguards. Q4: How do decentralized perpetual exchanges differ from centralized platforms? Decentralized exchanges operate through smart contracts without centralized custody, offer global access without KYC requirements, provide transparent on-chain settlement, but may have lower liquidity than established centralized counterparts. Q5: Can perpetual futures expand beyond cryptocurrency markets? Technical frameworks support expansion to traditional assets like equities and commodities, though regulatory approval remains the primary constraint for widespread adoption beyond crypto assets.

At the same time, small investors with less than 1,000 BTC have been selling the crypto asset. Bitcoin whales holding more than 1,000 BTC have been the dominant buyers of the crypto asset since its price approached the $80k range. Onchain data from Glassnode, a blockchain data analytics platform, shows that these players are predominantly the largest accumulators and have expressed increasing interest in long positions in the last few weeks. Bitcoin whales buy more as the asset hovers near $80k The data shows that the 1,000-10,000 BTC cohort stands as the only whale group displaying sustained accumulation attributes. The group’s Accumulation Trend Score, an on-chain metric that measures whether investors are buying or selling crypto assets over the past 15 days, is close to 1. A score near one shows signs of accumulation, while a score closer to 0 signals distribution. The data suggests that these market participants have been buying the dip as BTC trades in the $80k range, a price level last seen in April this year. On the other hand, smaller inventors with less than 1,000 BTC have showcased signs of distribution and have been selling the crypto asset around the same price range. Larger whales with a BTC balance exceeding 10,000 were initially on a buying spree in late November but have since slowed down their quests in recent weeks. These whales have not shown any signs of selling, an attribute they predominantly displayed as Bitcoin topped $100,000 around mid-year. A recent Cryptopolitan report , dated December 29, highlighted that Strategy, a U.S.-based software company and the world’s largest corporate BTC holder, purchased 1,229 Bitcoin using proceeds from the issuance of its new MSTR common stock. The company completed the purchase for $108.8 million at an average price of $88,568 per Bitcoin. Data from BTC treasuries shows that the company now holds 672,497 Bitcoin valued at approximately $58.91 billion. Hyperscale Data, another publicly listed U.S.-based company, has also recently expanded its Bitcoin holdings. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, provided by Coinglass, currently reads 25, indicating that “fear” is the prevailing market sentiment. The index has remained in the “fear” and “extreme fear” brackets for the last month, alleging that the crypto market could be experiencing capitulation due to selling pressure from small-scale investors. Bitcoin’s price projection remains a mystery as 2026 approaches Bitcoin’s price has remained relatively unchanged in the last week. According to data from crypto data aggregator CoinMarketCap, the crypto asset is trading at $87,738 and has been hovering between $95k and $85k since the end of November. Bitcoin is down nearly half a percent in the last 24 hours, bringing its seven-day loss to 2.19%. The crypto asset is down 30.53% from its all-time high price of $126,198, which was recorded on October 6 of this year. Although larger players hint at Bitcoin’s potential short-term recovery, the asset’s overall outlook remains uncertain. Cryptopolitan reported in late November that analysts and traders are cautious about BTC potentially falling below $80,000, a move that could trigger further selling pressure in the entire crypto ecosystem. Data from SosoValue shows that U.S. spot BTC ETFs registered outflows worth $275.88 million on December 26, marking a 6-day streak of negative flows that have drawn over $1 billion from the funds. However, other industry analysts, such as Matt Hougan, Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer, and researchers at Galaxy, predict a more positive approach to Bitcoin’s overall price movement. Others remain ambitious about the crypto asset, with some like Ichael Saylor predicting that Bitcoin will hit $21 million in 21 years.

Expert Says It’s Different Math, Different League",https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/can-xrp-reach-10000/,"A crypto expert has addressed the arguments suggesting that the XRP price could never reach $10,000. He explained that XRP is in a different league from most cryptocurrencies, making traditional valuation methods less effective. The expert also asserts that XRP is designed to handle large-scale institutional flows and, as a result, a $10,000 valuation cannot be ruled out entirely in the long run. Why The XRP Price Could Reach $10,000 Stern Drew, the founder and CEO of Stageyo, the world’s first digital marketplace for stage performers, has weighed in on the long-running debate around the future price potential of XRP. On X, the founder argued that many projections dismissing a $10,000 XRP price are flawed because they apply the wrong framework and mathematical models to the asset. Related Reading: Pundit Shares Why XRP Will Become Expensive And A $1,000 Price Tag Is Possible According to him, XRP should not be evaluated using the same assumptions as retail-driven cryptocurrencies. Drew explained that comparisons with Bitcoin and other digital assets often ignore scale entirely. He pointed out that a single Ripple partner can move more value in one day for XRP than Bitcoin processes in an entire year. This difference in settlement volume is central to how the expert believes that XRP’s future value should be gauged. The Stageyo founder further stressed that XRP was primarily designed for institutional settlement rather than speculative trading. Its core use case is tied to moving large volumes of capital across borders effectively. In that context, Drew has suggested that price expectations that rule out levels like $10,000 based on retail demand or historical crypto cycles are not relevant. He argued that low prices do not make sense when a cryptocurrency is handling massive institutional inflows. If XRP is used for high-value settlements, a higher price per token increases efficiency. This means fewer tokens will be needed to transfer the same amount of value, reducing friction and speeding up transactions. Drew described this concept as a different kind of math that applies to a “different league” of financial activity. Rather than focusing on market capitalization to gauge a cryptocurrency’s future value, the expert emphasizes liquidity and transaction throughput. From this perspective, he links the possibility of XRP reaching $10,000 to its intended role in the global financial system. XRP Positions For Major Role In Global Banking In a separate X post, Drew drew attention to a recent statement made by the Bank of Japan (BOJ). Notably, the BOJ disclosed that both Japan and South Korea are working together on developing blockchain infrastructure, subtly referencing XRP and Ripple in its announcement. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Crashes To Levels Not Seen Since 2024, Can It Also Rally 600%? Reports reveal that official discussions are currently private, but their impact is expected to be significant.

Notably, the crypto payments company has already established relationships with some of Japan’s largest financial institutions, including SBI Holdings.

56556291,649366,1767031252,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56556291.jpeg,Dogecoin 50% Crash: Q4 Set To End In Red As All Supports Fail,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-50-crash-q4-red/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is struggling amid increased market volatility and choppy price action . With the final days of the Fourth Quarter (Q4) approaching fast, technical analysts point to weakness in DOGE’s price structure, noting that the meme coin has already fallen 50% and may be gearing up for further correction . If this happens, Dogecoin could end the year in the red, failing to reclaim former highs. Dogecoin Set To End Q4 In The Red After 50% Crash Crypto analyst KrissPax has shared a new Dogecoin price analysis on X, warning that the meme coin may end the Fourth Quarter of 2025 in deep recession. According to the analyst, the Dogecoin price has already crashed roughly 50% in Q4, reflecting sustained weakness after a brief period of stability in October. KrissPax explained in his post that Dogecoin initially showed resilience at the start of October, as price action respected an upward-sloping support trendline. That structure broke decisively during the October 10 flash crash and liquidation event , which the analyst noted was a leverage sweep that marked a significant shift in market behavior. Since the devastating event, the analyst has stated that Dogecoin has steadily moved lower with no meaningful recovery. Although the meme coin has attempted to break out of its downtrend over the past few months, its weak price action and negative market sentiment have contained any strong bullish rally. KrissPax has also highlighted the meme coin’s repeated loss of critical support levels , suggesting deeper structural weakness rather than a temporary price pullback. This weakness is clearly reflected in Dogecoin’s price action. According to CoinMarketCap data, DOGE is currently trading at $0.126, down 15% over the past month, and more than 60% year-to-date. What The Chart Says In his analysis, KrissPax shared a detailed price chart that reflects Dogecoin’s bearishness throughout the year. The market analyst disclosed that he had tracked the meme coin’s price movements through multiple support zones, including the purple, red, and brown ranges—all of which have failed to hold. After the October 10 crash, Dogecoin struggled to reclaim the broken support trendline, confirming it as resistance rather than a base for an uptrend continuation. One of the most significant signals highlighted on the chart by the analyst is the Death Cross formation . This technical pattern is often associated with extended downward trends and bearish market sentiment. After Dogecoin formed a Death Cross, its price continued to trend lower for months. The chart also showed multiple consolidation ranges that ultimately broke to the downside. Each period of sideways movement was followed by another price decline, suggesting heavy distribution rather than accumulation during these pauses. The repeated failure of key support zones further indicates that DOGE buyers were unable to prevent further declines even as selling pressure persisted .",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|DOGE price analysis|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-29 18:00:52
56556502,https://timestabloid.com/?p=93603,1767031526,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Jake Claver: Supply Constraints Make XRP Price Shocks More Severe,https://timestabloid.com/jake-claver-supply-constraints-make-xrp-price-shocks-more-severe/,"In the high‑stakes world of cryptocurrency markets, supply mechanics often shape price action as profoundly as demand drivers or macro news events. For XRP — a top digital asset by market capitalization — the architecture of token distribution exerts a structural influence over market behavior that every investor and analyst must understand. Ripple’s escrow system does more than impose discipline on token releases; it directly affects how the price reacts to changing market conditions. Crypto commentator Jake Claver highlighted this dynamic, stressing that XRP’s supply constraints, rooted in Ripple’s time‑locked escrow releases, magnify price shocks when the market shifts rapidly. This perspective brings fresh urgency to debates about tokenomics and volatility in 2025, especially as XRP continues to capture institutional attention. How Ripple’s Escrow System Governs XRP Supply Ripple implemented its escrow mechanism in December 2017 to inject transparency and predictability into the distribution of XRP. Ripple escrow releases are time-locked to first of each month, 1B XRP maximum. No emergency releases possible. Supply constraints make price shocks more severe. — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) December 29, 2025 Ripple locked 55 billion XRP into cryptographically enforced escrow contracts on the XRP Ledger, programmed to release a maximum of 1 billion XRP monthly on the first day. The XRP Ledger’s consensus protocol enforces this schedule, eliminating manual override or emergency releases outside the preset timeline. When escrowed XRP is released into Ripple’s control, the company typically uses only a fraction of the 1 billion allocation for operations, institutional partnerships, or liquidity needs. They re-lock the remainder, often 700-800 million XRP , into new escrow contracts, extending the future release timeline. This disciplined cycle ensures a slow drip rather than a flood of tokens into the market. The Supply Constraint and Its Market Implications The very features designed to promote stability also create structural scarcity. Monthly releases serve as a hard ceiling on how much new supply Ripple can deploy, even when market conditions shift suddenly. Unlike assets with flexible issuance mechanisms, Ripple cannot push additional tokens into circulation to satisfy rapid spikes in demand. This rigidity means that during periods of heightened buying pressure, the supply side cannot adjust swiftly, intensifying price movements in both directions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 When demand surges without a corresponding increase in circulating supply, traders and algorithms often bid up prices sharply in anticipation of constrained availability. Conversely, when bearish sentiment grips markets, limited new inflows do little to absorb sell‑side pressure, exacerbating price declines. Predictability Versus Volatility The escrow design offers clear benefits: investors can track the exact amount of XRP unlocked, used, and returned to escrow each month through public ledger data, enabling more precise forecasting. This transparency supports institutional confidence, a factor increasingly relevant after regulatory clarifications in 2025. However, that same predictability embeds a recurring supply narrative into market psychology. Traders chronically factor monthly releases into their price models, often amplifying volatility around early‑month liquidity cycles. When actual usage diverges from the maximum release — as it typically does — market participants must constantly recalibrate expectations, a process that itself fuels price swings. In conclusion, XRP’s escrow mechanism exemplifies a controlled supply strategy that prioritizes long‑term stability and market trust. But as Jake Claver emphasizes, the very constraints that shield the market from flooding also tighten the supply leash when demand shifts abruptly, making price shocks more intense than they would be in a more fluid supply regime. Understanding this dual nature — predictability married to scarcity — remains essential for anyone analyzing XRP’s market dynamics in 2025 and beyond.

Coinbase Chief Executive Brian Armstrong has argued that Bitcoin does not threaten the dollar. Instead, he believes it reinforces fiscal discipline by introducing meaningful monetary competition. This view marks a clear break from earlier assumptions that Bitcoin could only thrive if the US financial system weakened. As deficits rise and debt servicing costs grow, Armstrong’s position reframes Bitcoin as a stabilizing force rather than a disruptive rival. Bitcoin as a Fiscal Pressure Tool Armstrong has consistently framed Bitcoin as an external check on US fiscal behavior. He argues that alternative monetary systems create accountability during periods of inflation and heavy deficit spending. Consequently, policymakers face pressure to manage budgets more responsibly to maintain global confidence in the dollar. Armstrong has stressed that reserve currency status depends on aligning inflation with economic growth. Hence, prolonged fiscal imbalance could weaken the dollar’s dominance over time. Significantly, current budget figures support this concern. In 2025, US interest payments surpassed $1 trillion, exceeding the national defense budget of $917 billion. These numbers have fueled debates around long-term sustainability. Armstrong has suggested that modern financial infrastructure, paired with digital assets, could improve transparency across government balance sheets. Moreover, he has publicly supported initiatives that emphasize efficiency and technological reform within public finance systems. Reserve Currency Debate Gains Traction Beyond fiscal discipline, Armstrong has previously suggested Bitcoin could evolve into a reserve asset if debt trends remain unchecked. He has argued that failure to manage deficits may gradually push institutions toward alternative stores of value. However, he has also emphasized that a strong US economy remains essential for global stability. Additionally, he has urged lawmakers to reduce debt levels before reserve currency credibility erodes. This perspective aligns with comments from Senator Cynthia Lummis, who has supported the idea of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. She has argued that hard digital assets could strengthen the dollar rather than replace it. Moreover, MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has echoed similar views, claiming digital capital could reinforce national balance sheets. Regulation, Stablecoins, and Industry Survival The crypto sector has also adjusted its messaging to align with regulatory realities. Industry leaders now present Bitcoin as complementary to existing systems. Armstrong has criticized efforts to revisit the GENIUS Act, arguing such moves could slow innovation. Additionally, he has opposed restrictions on stablecoin yields, claiming they limit competition without improving consumer protection.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-29 18:10:57
