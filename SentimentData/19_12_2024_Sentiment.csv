The firm claimed that it has shifted its focus to Bitcoin as the leading cryptocurrency, which has been profitable, especially with the current price increases. *Metaplanet Projects First Fiscal Year Operating Profit Since 2017* pic.twitter.com/oYNKOtNatR — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) December 18, 2024 Metaplanet expects an operating income of ¥270 million ($1.8 million) for the year ending December 31, which is an improvement from the ¥468 million ($3.1 million) loss it made the previous year. Sales are also forecast to increase at a much faster pace – from ¥261 million ($1.7 million) to ¥890 million ($5.8 million). Bitcoin treasury management powers growth Metaplanet has attributed a lot of its success to its focus on Bitcoin, especially through Bitcoin put options trading. The company has projected that it will earn ¥520 million ($3.4 million) from put options only. Put options allow Bitcoin investors to sell the digital currency at a specific price providing both protection and profit-making chance. Metaplanet stands to benefit from earning premiums on these contracts and, when exercised, receiving more Bitcoin. This has helped it to increase the number of Bitcoins it has and also helped it to generate revenue. The company currently holds 1,142 Bitcoin worth ¥17.6 billion or $119.4 million as of now, and this makes the firm the second largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in Asia. It goes further than simple trading, as the company has announced that it will create a separate “Bitcoin accumulation and management” business. Besides treasury management, Metaplanet has expanded its activities in the Bitcoin sphere. Recently, the company obtained a license to launch a Japanese edition of Bitcoin Magazine, which has become a new player in the digital asset media market. This could open up new income streams since the use of Bitcoin is on the rise in Japan and the rest of the world. The deal was announced in July at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, which was attended by the former US President, Donald Trump. Metaplanet is set to officially launch Bitcoin Magazine Japan in the first quarter of 2025. Bitcoin Magazine was launched in 2012 by Buterin and others and is one of the earliest outlets focused on Bitcoin. In a bid to strengthen its position, Metaplanet has offered ¥9.5 billion ($64.5 million) in bonds to increase its Bitcoin reserves. The company intends to use both debt and equity as capital to facilitate the accumulation strategy in the business. Besides Metaplanet, other companies that have been actively accumulating Bitcoin include MicroStrategy. This week only, MicroStrategy acquired 15,350 Bitcoin for about $1.6 billion and now holds 439,000 Bitcoin in its portfolio with a total value of over $46 billion.

Santiment’s data, on the other hand, showed that 104 whale wallets with >100K ETH jointly held over 57% of the total supply worth $333.1B. ETH holders exhibited increased faith in the altcoin this year as the group’s overall balances grew steadily despite market volatility. IntoTheBlock’s ETH data summary revealed that 74% of the holders had held the token for more than 1 year, while large holders accounted for 53%. The number of transactions with a value of $100K or greater had a total volume of $65.4B in the last seven days as exchanges recorded a netflow of -$912.97M. The data suggested that most of the ETH supply was aggressively being moved into whale wallets.

Roughly 110 million $ETH is now held by long-term holders. pic.twitter.com/smh7DZL1of — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 18, 2024 According to Santiment’s latest data, 104 whale wallets currently hold nearly 58% of all existing ETH tokens. These holdings reached an all-time high, suggesting a positive shift in long-term holder sentiment. These 104 whales reflected increasing confidence among ETH’s largest stakeholders as they continued accumulating despite the token’s ability to hold above $4K. Conversely, mid-level ETH holders (100-100K) dropped to their all-time low supply ratio, accounting for ~33% of the total supply. The broader Ethereum ecosystem generally included a rising number of staking wallets, signalling a bullish long-term outlook. Such sustained accumulation by key stakeholders suggested increased conviction and reduced selling pressure, which aligned with positive market sentiment over time. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that ETH’s price movement historically correlated with shifts in long-term holder sentiments. Long-term holders could, therefore, enter the ‘greed phase’ as the current bull cycle suggested a parabolic price surge. These holders were now in the early stages of the ‘belief’ stage, indicating they felt optimistic about ETH’s future price potential. If history repeated itself, this indicated that Ethereum’s major upward movement could still be on the horizon as long-term investor sentiment strengthened. Bitwise predicts ETH’s value will rise significantly in 2025 Juan Leon, senior investment strategist at Bitwise, said that Ethereum stood to benefit from several big trends in 2025. Leon claimed that ETH had positioned itself as the most ‘battle-tested’ smart contract platform, with an 81% share of the tokenization market. He argued that ETH would be the driving force behind the tripling of tokenized funds in 2025. Leon called ETH ‘the comeback kid of 2025’, saying it would likely lead in the $100 trillion tokenized real-world asset market next year. Ethereum was overshadowed by Bitcoin and Solana in 2024. The Bitwise investment strategist noted that Ethereum ETFs had attracted over $2 billion in net inflows over the past 10 days. Farside’s data confirmed a new daily record of $428.5 million in ETH ETF inflows on December 5th. According to the data, Ethereum ETFs saw less than three-digit daily inflows in only three of the 10 trading days Leon considered. Leon estimated that fees generated from RWA-linked activity on ETH could surpass its $2.4 billion YTD fees by more than 40 times in 2025. He attributed Ethereum’s next year’s dominance to its status as the most secure and reliable decentralized smart contract platform. Ethereum’s growth could also be accelerated by regulatory tailwinds and its widely distributed validator network.

Though some lawmakers and President elect Trump support a U.S. Bitcoin reserve. Powell’s comments caused Bitcoin to drop 5.7%, with other major cryptos also losing value, and the stock market reacted negatively. Powell Says No to U.S. Bitcoin Reserve Jerome Powell Fed Chair has made a point during a press conference that the U.S. central bank is not allowed to hold Bitcoin. He explained that according to the Federal Reserve Act, there are rules about what the bank can own, and Bitcoin is not part of that. He also stated that the Federal Reserve is looking for something other than a law change by leaving the decision to Congress. “We’re not allowed to own bitcoin. The Federal Reserve Act says what we can own, and we’re not looking for a law change. That’s something for Congress to decide, not the Fed.” These statements came after questions about the possibility of the U.S. government building a Bitcoin reserve, similar to how it holds gold. Powell stressed that any decision on the U.S. government holding Bitcoin would be up to Congress and not the Federal Reserve. He clarified that the central bank is interested in something other than getting involved in Bitcoin or changing its laws. Despite Powell’s firm stance, there has been growing interest in Bitcoin as a potential asset for the U.S. government to hold. Trump has supported the idea, suggesting that the U.S. should not fall behind other countries in the global crypto race. Some pro- crypto senators including Senator Cynthia Lummis from Wyoming, have been pushing for this idea. Lummis has even drafted a bill requiring the U.S. Treasury to buy one million Bitcoin over the next five years. President-elect Donald Trump has also supported the idea of the U.S. creating a Bitcoin reserve, saying the U.S. needs to stay ahead of countries like China by embracing digital currencies. Market Reaction to Powell’s comments After Powell’s comments, the cryptocurrency market reacted quickly. Bitcoin dropped to $100,300 which is down about 5.7% over the past 24 hours. By the time of the press release, Bitcoin was trading at $100,740. The cryptocurrency market also fell. Ethereum fell by 6.8%, Binance Coin (BNB) dropped by 4.6%, and Solana (SOL) by 8.1%. Dogecoin (DOGE) performed the least among the top 10 positioned tokens which is dropping by 11% to $0.348. The stock market also equally reacted negatively to Powell’s comments. The S&P 500 closed with a loss of 1.55%, and the Nasdaq 100 dropped by around 2%. These show how market is reacting to the news about government policies, especially when it comes to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Powell’s stance on not supporting a Bitcoin reserve created uncertainty among investors and also, they quickly adjusted their positions by selling. Jerome Powell’s comments made it clear that the Federal Reserve is not interested in holding Bitcoin or supporting the U.S. Bitcoin reserve. The market’s reaction showed how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are dependent from investors and policymakers.

Alternative Larger Metrics Show The Answer,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-ready-to-run-11-ath/,"A crypto analyst has shared an XRP price chart, analyzing its action on the 4-hour timeframe while pinpointing key metrics of strength that suggest a possible rally. The analyst has predicted that XRP is preparing for a significant run to $11, marking a new All-Time High (ATH). Key Metrics Suggest XRP Price Set For $11 Surge In an X (formerly Twitter) post on Tuesday, prominent crypto analyst Javon Marks shared key observations of XRP’s price behavior, noting signs of strength through crucial metrics and a potential for a significant price rally to a new ATH at $11. The analyst has suggested that XRP shows clear upward momentum, with a sharp increase visible on the presented price chart. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Crash Incoming? Tron’s Justin Sun Unstakes $209 Million ETH From Lido Finance Looking at the chart, XRP has been breaking recent resistance levels and maintaining bullish momentum. XRP’s strongest resistance at $0.5, which lasted for over three years, was broken earlier in November, jumping above $1 following Donald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential elections. Currently, the XRP price is trading above $2.5, underscoring the massive growth surge it has experienced in less than two months. Marks has revealed that he was keeping a close watch on alternative larger-term metrics for the XRP price that signal a potential surge to new ATHs. The volume bars below the price chart indicate steady buying pressure for XRP, with increasing trading volume during upward trends. Recently, the XRP accumulation trend among large holders has increased significantly. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed via a price chart that whales have purchased a staggering 30 million XRP within the last 24 hours. This increased buying activity reflects the growing confidence in XRP, possibly fueled by the market’s bullish sentiment and expectations of a price rally. At the bottom of the XRP chart shared by Marks, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) illustrates a sharp upward curve, signaling the potential for a bull rally. The RSI appears as a fluctuating black line, clearly reflecting rising momentum. If XRP can sustain its current uptrend, it could surpass its current all-time high of $3.84 set during the 2021 bull market, potentially reaching a new high above $11 in this bull cycle. Update On XRP Analysis The XRP price has been persistently attempting to break through the resistance area at $2.5, aiming to reach new highs. Over the past month, XRP has had an impressive performance, recording a whopping 119.5% price increase. Despite being in consolidation, the cryptocurrency continues to exhibit strong growth, with its price climbing nearly 8% in the last seven days as it attempted to break through key resistance levels.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC.

The apex crypto tumbled by as much as 5.3%, dropping to $100,752 after briefly soaring past $108,000 earlier this week in a record-breaking rally. Traders, spooked by the slower-than-expected pace of easing, pulled back speculative bets, hitting Bitcoin and other riskier assets. Fed signals fewer cuts The Fed’s quarter-point rate cut on Wednesday was widely expected, but its forecast left markets cold. Officials projected the benchmark rate to fall to 3.75-4% in 2025, down from an earlier prediction of a full percentage-point reduction. Morgan Stanley described the updated outlook as “much more hawkish than we anticipated.” This cautious approach suggests the Fed is prioritizing inflation control over aggressive stimulus. Fed Chair Jay Powell admitted that the December decision was a “closer call” than previous ones. He said inflation was moving “sideways,” while risks to the labor market had “diminished.” These comments signaled that the central bank might adopt a more restrained pace of easing moving forward. The policy change sent shockwaves through global markets. U.S. Treasury yields climbed, with the two-year note—closely tied to Fed policy—rising 0.08 percentage points to 4.33%. The dollar strengthened by 1% against a basket of major currencies, while Wall Street’s S&P 500 dropped 1%. Risk assets, including Bitcoin, bore the brunt of this recalibration. A recalibration in monetary policy The Fed’s rate cuts have been framed as part of a broader “recalibration” of monetary policy aimed at curbing inflation. Officials raised their estimate of the neutral rate—one that neither stimulates nor constrains the economy—to 3%, up from 2.5% a year ago. Revised forecasts showed the Fed expects core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, to reach 2.5% in 2025 and 2.2% in 2026. These figures are slightly higher than earlier projections. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.3% over the next three years. Markets were already on edge following the September decision, where Fed Governor Michelle Bowman dissented, marking the first internal opposition to a rate cut since 2005. The December move, though expected, came amid continued debate among officials about inflation’s trajectory. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, rose at an annual rate of 2.8% in October. Powell described this phase as a “new process” in the Fed’s approach, explaining that future rate cuts would require a higher bar for approval. The Fed’s goal remains clear: bring inflation back to 2% without derailing the labor market or broader economy.

This collaboration enables BOB to secure transactions using Bitcoin as its anchor chain, providing a level of finality and irreversibility unique to the Bitcoin network. Integration Brings Bitcoin Finality to BOB The integration with Babylon equips Build on Bitcoin (BOB) with “Bitcoin finality,” ensuring that transactions recorded on its platform are permanently and irreversibly secured on Bitcoin’s blockchain. This mechanism, as a result, strengthens the security and trustworthiness of BOB’s hybrid layer two network, distinguishing it from other Bitcoin-based L2 solutions that lack Bitcoin-native security. Babylon, recognized as the leading Bitcoin staking protocol, manages a total value locked (TVL) of approximately $6 billion. The protocol, as a result, allows Bitcoin holders to stake their BTC, contributing to the security of decentralized applications and earning rewards in return. Introducing BOB as a Bitcoin Secured Network (BSN). Through our integration with @babylonlabs_io , we’re bringing Bitcoin finality to the Hybrid L2 and making @build_on_bob the best place to use BTC Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs). https://t.co/K6baJZ2TAs pic.twitter.com/YmQLiaa9r9 — BOB (@build_on_bob) December 18, 2024 Through Babylon’s protocol, BOB can use Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) to release Bitcoin liquidity into DeFi applications while retaining Bitcoin’s robust security. Hybrid L2 Model Combines Bitcoin and Ethereum Features Build on Bitcoin hybrid layer two model blends Bitcoin’s security with Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities. The network aims to create bridges to other blockchains while using Bitcoin as the final settlement layer. With over $200 million in TVL, 320,000 users, and 100 projects, BOB has positioned itself as a prominent player in the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem. The integration is also part of BOB’s larger roadmap. As part of Phase 2, BOB will launch bridges that connect Bitcoin to other networks using BitVM, a new computing framework enabling Ethereum-like smart contracts on Bitcoin. The testnet release for BitVM is scheduled for early 2025, signaling BOB’s commitment to expanding Bitcoin’s DeFi potential. Lombard’s LBTC Joins the BOB Ecosystem To further enhance its ecosystem, BOB has announced the integration of LBTC, the largest Bitcoin LST, managed by Lombard Finance. LBTC, with a TVL of $1.6 billion, becomes the fourth LST deployment on BOB, following Ethereum, Base, and Binance Smart Chain. Approximately 80% of LBTC’s TVL is already actively deployed in DeFi applications, reflecting its importance in the staking landscape. This addition bolsters Build on Bitcoin’s efforts to expand Bitcoin staking liquidity and amplify DeFi activity on its platform. Through partnerships with staking providers, wallets, and aggregators, BOB has simplified the process of staking Bitcoin with a one-click solution. Subsequently, to celebrate its integration with Babylon, Build on Bitcoin has launched a 45-day campaign aimed at incentivizing Bitcoin staking and DeFi activity. Over this period, an additional 4.5 million Babylon Points will be distributed daily to eligible users. In addition, the campaign includes additional incentives from BOB’s LST partners, such as Bedrock and PumpBTC, to encourage wider adoption. Users will be able to easily convert native Bitcoin into staking positions on Build on Bitcoin via the “BOB Stake” portal, which supports a seamless transition into DeFi applications.

The international body maintains that the technology presents both opportunities and challenges. According to the World Bank article authored by Jaime Saavedra (Human Development Director for Latin America and the Caribbean at the World Bank) and Ezequiel Molina (Senior Economist), if properly implemented, AI can boost learning and teacher training, which could also mean more specialized support for students. A good example of a country tapping into this use case is Ecuador. There is reportedly a successful AI tutoring program that was able to improve the math skills of students for a mere $18 per head in the country. The fear the general public and various governing bodies have regarding artificial intelligence is valid. It could even be necessary to ensure the creation does not spiral out of moderate ranges. Common fears about AI’s impact on education Critics have raised valid concerns about the impact AI will have on equity, effectiveness, and the very nature of learning itself. However, the truth is that AI is already being used in most aspects of human society which is why the World Bank believes it is important that we confront these challenging questions now. According to the World Bank, it is not irresponsible to promote AI even when many schools lack the minimum conditions to operate the technology. While it admits that many schools still require fundamental infrastructure and well-qualified teachers, the World Bank publication highlights how properly implemented technology can help bridge the gaps faster. AI can scale up teacher training and become a great learning aid that allows teaching materials to reach remote areas quickly. This means students who need extra support can get it more easily and effectively. On the question of whether AI will serve human communities or if it will be the other way around, the publication conceded that this is a truly legitimate concern shared by many people. AI development is concentrated in the developed nations of the Global North (North America and Europe), so it is possible for developing nations not to focus on their crucial local needs, such as native language content and culturally relevant teaching approaches. The solution according to the World Bank is strategic engagement. It recommended developing local AI talent via targeted scholarships and training, creating partnerships for local language content development, establishing clear regulatory frameworks that protect data sovereignty, and building teachers’ digital skills through comprehensive training programs. One country that seems to be ahead where creating a regulatory framework for AI is concerned is Uruguay. In the country, they’ve developed guidelines for AI use that respect local teaching methods while leveraging AI advances. Such a framework ensures the technology serves their educational purposes, and not vice versa. Will AI make students lazier? One of the most common questions teachers and parents have asked since generative AI like ChatGPT went mainstream is how it will affect students’ work ethic. While it is true that tools like ChatGPT will become a crutch, promoting intellectual laziness and superficial learning, the World Bank says what matters more is how people use it. The World Bank article argues that its capabilities mean students always have a high IQ partner to either brainstorm problems or more commonly, do homework. It went on to maintain that while AI can promote complacency among students, it did not invent cheating. Hence, it is ultimately up to a person to decide how to use it productively. The sophistication AI tools offer presents an opportunity to fundamentally rethink how we teach and assess learning. After all, we know technology can facilitate focusing on what truly matters: developing higher-order thinking skills, creativity, and critical analysis. One country that has proven this is Nigeria . In the country, the World Bank ran some pilot programs that revealed a fascinating fact: under proper guidance, students who learn to use AI tools thoughtfully actually engage more deeply with the material. So, rather than asking students to summarize texts (something AI can do instantly), teachers can urge them to critique AI-generated analyses, compare different AI interpretations, or even use AI as a brainstorming partner while coming up with their own novel ideas. According to the World Bank, a good teacher is able to encourage critical thinking via thoughtful conversations. With AI, more teachers can prepare effective lesson plans and activities for difficult-to-teach skills. Recommendations for implementing AI responsibly in schools In the field of education, there have not been many scientific breakthroughs regarding learning because educational research, unlike medical research, often struggles to reach classroom practice. However, the World Bank believes AI can change this pattern. How? By adopting the same evidence-based approach used in medicine, pharmaceuticals, or food safety – forging ahead consciously without allowing the fear of innovation to paralyze growth. Still, no new medical procedure or food additive is ever introduced to the public without proper testing, so a systematic approach to AI in education is required. According to the World Bank, we will have succeeded in properly harnessing the power of AI when we can manipulate the technology while keeping the human element at the center. Since education mainly focuses on human interaction, we have the opportunity to use AI to make this interaction more effective and enjoyable, but only as an assistant, not a replacement. Focusing on this principle will ensure that the technology serves our educational values and not the other way around.

In a recent complaint, the wBTC custodian and Sun-affiliated BiT Global accused Coinbase of using wBTC – the tokenized representation of Bitcoin ( BTC ) on the Ethereum ( ETH ) blockchain – as a “cash grab” before delisting it and replacing it with its own version of the asset. Said the complaint, “In the case of wrapped Bitcoin, Coinbase viewed it as just another cash grab. It saw a competitor, wBTC, that had something it wanted: an innovative product that released value inherent in Bitcoin and let users utilize that value in bold new ways… Coinbase decided it would take what it wanted. Once the value in wBTC had been demonstrated, Coinbase changed the rules, delisting wBTC from its platform so that it could no longer be traded on the Coinbase platform – and it did so shortly after launching its own knock-off clone called cbBTC.” In response to the complaint, Coinbase says it made the decision to delist wBTC largely because of its links to Justin Sun and the risks that would arise should he have any influence over it. The exchange notes that Sun’s name is “conspicuously” left out of BiT’s complaint. “Coinbase made the decision—based on a rigorous internal process—that wBTC should be delisted from Coinbase’s exchange due to the unacceptable risk that control of wBTC would fall into the hands of Justin Sun. BiT now asks the Court to override, on an emergency basis no less, Coinbase’s judgment that continuing to list wBTC could compromise the integrity of its platform and put customers at risk. BiT seeks to force Coinbase to do business with an entity that no longer complies with Coinbase’s standards due to Mr. Sun’s ‘material involvement.’ And yet, Mr. Sun’s name and connection to wBTC is conspicuously absent from BiT’s Complaint and TRO (temporary restraining order) request. So too is any acknowledgement that he has repeatedly been accused of, investigated for, and sued for financial misconduct, and that reports of his alleged misdeeds abound in the press and crypto community more broadly.” Coinbase also alleges that Sun is “infamous” in the crypto community and that he has been accused of several wrongdoings, including market manipulation and misappropriation of digital assets.

The US Federal Reserve axed interest rates by 25bps as expected, but played down the prospect of substantial further easing in 2025. BREAKING: The S&P 500 falls sharply after the Fed cuts rates by 25 basis points, but raises inflation forecast. The Fed reduced their outlook from 3 to 2 rate cuts in 2025 and raised inflation expectations from 2.1% to 2.5%. Inflation is back. pic.twitter.com/kKtEHD0IF0 — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 18, 2024 US equity markets and major cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC) , which had probably been looking for an excuse to pull back following their very strong performance in recent weeks, were dumped. And this bled across in the highly speculative crypto meme coin space, with meme coin total market cap collapsing to $106 billion from $117 billion on Tuesday, per CoinMarketCap . Crypto bulls will likely remain confident that there will be a reversal of the market’s fortunes into the year’s end. That’s because the incoming Trump administration is set to be the most pro-crypto in history, a complete 180-degree shift from the anti-crypto stance of the outgoing Biden administration. And global crypto adoption is also accelerating, not least thanks to increased chatter about the establishment of Bitcoin strategic reserves in nations all around the world. If one country implements a Bitcoin strategic reserve you can kiss goodbye to your 4 year cycles. I already laid this out in January and assumed an adoption cycle. Think 2002 big tech. pic.twitter.com/k5mQQNJRLw — Tyler (@TylerDurden) December 17, 2024 That means there is fertile ground for the return of a new meme season, with Shiba Inu likely to lead any such rally. That said, the latest developments in the Shiba Inu price chart are concerning. Is a short-term price crash right around the corner? Bearish Chart Developments – Is the Shiba Inu Price About to Crash? The Shiba Inu price’s latest drop has seen it slump under its 50DMA, after falling below its 21DMA earlier in the month. Moreover, SHIB has now also broken to the south of an upward trend channel in play since mid-November. All that suggests a drop back towards the next major support zone around $0.00002160 is on the cards, a further 11% decline from current levels. However, things would only really get bad for Shiba Inu if the meme coin broke below its uptrend from its summer 2024 lows. That could open the door to a retest of the 200DMA under $0.000019 or lower. But SHIB bulls should not fear. Yes, maybe the Fed won’t cut interest rates as much as the market wants in 2025. But this is not the end of the world for crypto markets, nor meme coins like Shiba Inu. As noted, the US crypto industry is about to enter a new golden age and global adoption is accelerating. Bitcoin may be the initial beneficiary of this, but this will eventually work its way into the altcoin and meme coin space. As a leading name in the space with a massive community and vast web3 ecosystem, Shiba Inu is going to attract substantial demand. To, for investors able to hold through some near-term turbulence, Shiba Inu price dips are a great opportunity to accumulate this high potential meme coin .

According to Hougan, Ethereum’s reputation as slow and expensive is becoming outdated as advancements in its ecosystem address these challenges. Bitwise CIO Predicts Ethereum Layer-2 Growth Will Outpace Solana by 2025 According to a recent tweet by Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, Ethereum Layer-2 networks are transforming the platform’s reputation and usability. Hougan noted that Ethereum’s advancements in scalability and user experience rival those of Solana, traditionally recognized for its ease of use. Moreover, Hougan highlighted projects like Clanker and Virtuals, AI-driven applications thriving on Ethereum Base network. These developments demonstrate Ethereum’s ability to support innovative, user-friendly solutions while maintaining its robust infrastructure. This shift is pivotal for ETH as it aims to combine institutional-grade credibility with improved accessibility for everyday users. Matt Hougan added, “If Ethereum can retain its institutional bona fides but level up ease-of-use, 2025 will be a good year indeed. It’s the Layer-2 network thesis playing out in real-time.” Despite the competition between Ethereum and Solana blockchains, VanEck predicted new all-time highs for both assets by 2025. Ethereum is projected to surpass $6,000, driven by Layer-2 growth and staking integration, while Solana is forecast to exceed $500 due to its scalability and adoption in DeFi and NFTs. VanEck also expects Bitcoin to reach $180,000, fueled by U.S. adoption and corporate holdings. Layer-2 Networks Propel Accessibility Ethereum’s evolution is largely driven by its top Layer-2 solutions, such as Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum. These solutions address long-standing issues of scalability and high transaction costs. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan emphasized the importance of these networks in making Ethereum ecosystem competitive with platforms like Solana. By leveraging Layer-2 technology, Ethereum provides a more seamless experience for developers and users. This advancement positions the platform as a hub for projects that require both scalability and affordability. Bitwise CIO predicts that this Layer-2-driven transformation will drive Ethereum’s growth in 2025. Moreover, Ethereum’s infrastructure is favored for projects in artificial intelligence (AI) and decentralized finance (DeFi). With a growing number of applications leveraging its infrastructure, Ethereum continues to demonstrate its versatility. Bitwise CIO believes this adaptability strengthens Ethereum’s position as a leader in blockchain technology. While Ethereum makes strides in accessibility and innovation, Solana recently overtook it as the leading ecosystem for new developers. According to Electric Capital, Solana experienced an 83% year-on-year growth in monthly active developers, ending Ethereum’s eight-year dominance in this metric. Despite Solana’s achievements, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan remains confident in Ethereum’s trajectory.

Here’s Why Qubetics Is the Next Best Crypto to Buy Under $1,https://thecoinrise.com/renders-success-left-you-wishing-heres-why-qubetics-is-the-next-best-crypto-to-buy-under-1/,"In the world of cryptocurrency, timing can be everything. The regret can be palpable for those who missed the opportunity to invest in Render during its early days. Render ($RNDR), now a household name among blockchain enthusiasts, began humbly but rapidly captured the attention of forward-thinking investors. Its ICO price was a mere fraction of its current value, and those who recognised its potential have seen their investments soar exponentially. However, if you’re feeling you’ve missed out, there’s a new opportunity on the horizon that could rival Render’s success – Qubetics ($TICS). The Rise of Render: From Underdog to Powerhouse Render debuted with an ICO that saw tokens priced at just $0.05, an absolute bargain in hindsight. Its vision was revolutionary at the time: a decentralised GPU rendering platform designed to streamline creative industries. Despite scepticism, early believers reaped life-changing gains as the project gained traction. Fast-forward to today, and Render is valued significantly higher, delivering returns that make investors’ eyes light up. But what about those who missed the boat? While hindsight can be cruel, the crypto market constantly evolves, offering new opportunities to capitalise on innovation. This is where Qubetics comes into play – the best crypto to buy under $1 right now. Why Qubetics Could Be the Next Big Opportunity Qubetics is currently in Presale Phase 13, and excitement is reaching a fever pitch. Unlike Render’s initial days, Qubetics has already achieved impressive traction, with over $7 million raised, more than 10,600 holders, and 355 million tokens sold. The price of $TICS tokens is just $0.034, making it an attractive entry point for investors seeking the best crypto to buy under $1. With weekly presale phases bringing a consistent 10% price hike, Qubetics is designed to reward early adopters handsomely. By the final presale phase, the token will experience a 20% price jump, making now the most compelling time to act. Post-presale projections suggest a target price of $0.25 per token, delivering a staggering ROI of 630.27% for those entering at this stage. Analysts are even more bullish, predicting Qubetics could soar to $10 or even $15 following the mainnet launch, offering potential returns of 29,106.88% and 43,660.31%, respectively. Imagine investing today and seeing your portfolio multiply beyond your expectations. Could Qubetics be your second chance at capturing gains similar to those who believed in Render early on? Innovating Cross-Border Transactions: The Qubetics Advantage What sets Qubetics apart isn’t just its presale success – it’s the groundbreaking utility it offers. The Qubetics Network empowers banks and financial institutions by enabling near-instant cross-border payments and settlements using the $TICS token. Institutions can leverage blockchain technology to perform transactions faster, more cost-effectively, and with enhanced transparency. The ability to execute international payments efficiently is crucial in an increasingly globalised business environment. Traditional systems are slow, riddled with inefficiencies, and lack the transparency that businesses and individuals now demand. Qubetics’ solution addresses these pain points, ensuring funds are transferred securely and swiftly. This means improved cash flow and operational efficiency for businesses, while for individuals, it ensures faster remittances and reduced delays. For anyone seeking the best crypto to buy under $1, Qubetics offers a rare combination of real-world utility and explosive growth potential. Why Timing Is Everything As we’ve learned from Render’s story, hesitation can be costly. Those who waited on the sidelines missed the chance to buy low and reap the rewards of early adoption. Qubetics offers a similar, if not greater, opportunity to position yourself for significant gains. With the next presale phase imminent and the token price set to rise again, the window of opportunity is shrinking. Every passing week brings higher prices, and the potential for missed gains grows larger. If you’re searching for the best crypto to buy under $1 that combines innovation, strong community backing, and exceptional growth prospects, Qubetics is a clear frontrunner. Conclusion: Don’t Let Another Opportunity Slip Away Cryptocurrency history is filled with stories of missed opportunities and rich with tales of redemption. Render’s meteoric rise may be behind us, but Qubetics presents a fresh chance for investors ready to act. With its presale success, groundbreaking real-world applications, and analysts’ bullish predictions, Qubetics is the best crypto to buy under $1 today. The presale phase is your chance to get in early, secure a favourable position, and watch your investment grow. Will you seize this chance, or will you look back with regret, wondering why you hesitated? The choice is yours, but the clock is ticking.

This bumps their ENA holdings to 741,687, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. WLFI’s December buying spree totaled nearly $45 million , expanding its position across multiple crypto assets. The breakdown: $30 million secured 8,100 Ethereum (ETH). $10 million was invested in Coinbase Wrapped Bitcoin (cbBTC). $2 million each allocated to Chainlink (LINK) and Aave (AAVE). $250,000 picked up 134,216 Ondo (ONDO) tokens via Cow Protocol on December 16. WLFI tokens rally as the market responds The crypto market hasn’t ignored WLFI’s spending spree. Several of its key assets have rallied, with Chainlink (LINK) leading the charge at a 28% surge, now valued at $28. Aave (AAVE) followed with a 17% gain, landing at $52. Ethereum (ETH) edged up by 8%, trading at $3,912. WLFI’s purchases have fueled speculation about the project’s ability to boost confidence in these tokens. The platform has partnered with AaveDAO, leveraging Aave’s protocols for lending and borrowing services. In return, AaveDAO gets 20% of WLFI’s fee revenue and 7% of its total token supply. And then there’s Justin Sun, founder of TRON, who invested $30 million in WLFI. His involvement has been a bit controversial, but the backing undeniably adds firepower to WLFI’s arsenal. But WLFI hasn’t had it easy since its September unveiling. Early token sales brought in $220 million, but wallet authenticity concerns during the launch cast doubt over the project’s credibility. Despite the briefly strong start, sales have slowed. WLFI wanted to sell $300 million worth of tokens but has managed to offload less than 25% of the remaining supply.

Choi Sang-mok, the nation’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Strategy and Finance, admitted that “domestic and international uncertainties” remain in the wake of a successful vote to impeach President Yoon Suk-yeol earlier this month. Not Negative on Crypto: Finance Chief Per Newsis , Choi told reporters that the government would “not let its guard down” in spite of the turmoil . Choi Sang-mok, South Korea’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Strategy and Finance, speaking on December 17, 2024. (Source: JTBC News/YouTube/Screenshot) He claimed Seoul would “manage the economy as stably as possible” by “gathering all the capabilities of the public and private sectors.” South Korean lawmakers have recently claimed to have issued an “all-stop” or pause on all crypto-related legislation following the political chaos of early December. Yoon declared martial law on December 3, only for lawmakers to force their way into parliament and overturn his decision. Impeachment Ruling Lawmakers have since voted to impeach the President. But the ruling is yet to be ratified by the constitutional court. Yoon has been suspended pending a verdict, with the People’s Power Party faction de facto ruling the nation in his stead.

(Source: CoinGecko) Choi responded to questions from the media on December 18, with one journalist asking him about US President-elect Donald Trump’s “position on strategic crypto reserves.” “Since the specific details of the strategic cryptoasset proposal from President-elect Trump have not been revealed yet, this is not the time to evaluate it. We plan to prepare a response and other measures when the new US administration takes office. We will act after these and other and new proposals related to cryptoassets become concrete.” Choi Sang-mok, South Korea’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Strategy and Finance Crypto Tax Delay The Deputy Prime Minister also spoke about the National Assembly’s recent vote to delay the launch of crypto tax to 2027. He explained: “The government is not negative on cryptoassets. As regulations and related systems are still in their infancy, we decided to defer [the crypto tax launch]. Because we judged that it would be appropriate to monitor the progress [of regulations] before we introduce taxation.” Trading volumes on the South Korean crypto exchange platform Upbit over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Choi further claimed that the central Bank of Korea, financial regulators, and “other related authorities” are currently “preparing new regulatory policies” for the crypto sector. He said these focus “not only on customer protection,” but also on “the legal nature” of crypto. And Choi said these parties were also looking at more “general” issues on “how to regulate this sector domestically.” “Everything has happened at lightning speed from beginning to end.""

The People’s Power Party has faced stiff opposition from the Democratic Party, which has a large majority in the National Assembly.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-18 23:36:00

After hitting a local top of $1.32, ADA retraced over 30%, dropping to $0.91 before returning to a critical support level. This price action has left investors speculating whether the current recovery marks the start of a new bullish phase or simply a temporary pause before further downside. Related Reading: Solana Monthly Chart ‘Looks Ready For A Monster Run’ – Details Top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared key insights on X, leveraging Santiment metrics to shed light on whale activity driving Cardano’s market movements. According to Martinez, large ADA holders began taking profits as the price rallied from $1.15 to $1.33. However, the story shifted dramatically as ADA dropped below $1, with whales accumulating again at the $0.91, signaling renewed confidence in the token’s potential. With whale activity and market dynamics heating up, Cardano has returned to a pivotal price range that could define its trajectory in the coming weeks. Investors are now closely watching whether this accumulation phase will fuel a sustainable rally or if further consolidation lies ahead for ADA. One thing is certain—Cardano remains a token to watch as volatility continues to shape its price action. Data Reveals Cardano Whales Behavior The past few weeks have been highly volatile for Cardano (ADA), reflecting the broader market’s unpredictable movements and the strategic plays of smart money. ADA has become a focal point for large investors making calculated moves as the market evolves. Top analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted data from Santiment that underscores the pivotal role of whale activity in shaping ADA’s price action. Martinez revealed that Cardano whales began offloading their holdings as the price rallied from $1.15 to $1.33, locking in significant profits. However, as the price dropped sharply to $0.91, these same whales re-entered the market, purchasing an impressive 160 million ADA during the dip. This buying spree has sparked optimism, suggesting that smart money views Cardano as bullish over the coming months. Such activity often indicates confidence in the asset’s potential to rebound and possibly outperform. However, it’s crucial to consider an alternative perspective. This accumulation phase might also serve as a short-term liquidity strategy designed to attract retail investors into ADA, potentially setting the stage for another wave of profit-taking by larger holders. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Load Up: Bullish Sign Or Bear Trap? As ADA hovers near critical levels, its next moves will likely depend on how these dynamics unfold. Whether this is a prelude to a sustained rally or a tactical maneuver by smart money, Cardano remains a key asset to watch in the weeks ahead. Price Holding Above $1 Cardano (ADA) is trading at $1.04, marking a swift recovery after spending only a few days below the critical $1 mark last week. This rebound showcases strong buying interest around the $1 level, which has historically acted as a psychological and technical support zone. If ADA manages to sustain its position above $1 in the coming days, the next target lies around $1.20—a price level that previously triggered significant selling pressure. Reclaiming this level would confirm bullish momentum and signal buyers are ready to challenge higher resistance zones. For ADA bulls to maintain momentum and drive the price higher, breaking and consolidating above the $1.20 mark is crucial. This would demonstrate the market’s strength and potentially pave the way for a broader rally. However, failing to claim $1.20 could result in another period of consolidation or even a pullback, as sellers may step in to defend this resistance level.

However, experts like Nic Carter caution that its volatility could destabilize the global financial system. Despite these risks, Bitcoin’s growing adoption suggests it could play a larger role in future finance if the Government adopts it. Bitcoin has become an investment and a potential store of value. As governments and states explore new ways to hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, one of the best ways is the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Several U.S. states are now considering Bitcoin as a reserve asset, which could alter how financial systems operate. Bitcoin as a Financial Asset Unlike traditional currencies Bitcoin isn’t controlled by any government or central authority. Over the years, Bitcoin has grown with both retail and institutional investors considering it as an alternative investment. Some see Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, a store of value, and even a potential future currency. In recent times, even governments and large corporations are starting to take notice of Bitcoin’s potential as Reserve. One of Bitcoin’s biggest supporters has been Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy. Saylor has purchased about 439,000 Bitcoins which is about$46 billion worth for his company’s treasury. This sets an example for other companies and governments to consider Bitcoin a reserve asset. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Interest from U.S. States Ohio has recently introduced a proposal for a “Bitcoin Reserve Fund,” which is allowing the state to purchase Bitcoin as part of its investment strategy. Recently, El Salvador and the Central African Republic have both adopted Bitcoin as an official legal tender. Companies like Metaplanet also adopts Bitcoin reserve as an asset, As this follows from other states of U.S. like Pennsylvania and Texas, which have also proposed laws to create Bitcoin reserves. In Ohio, House Republican Leader Derek Merrin introduced the Ohio Bitcoin Reserve Act (HB 703) in December 2024. This bill would give the Ohio State Treasurer the authority to buy Bitcoin, protecting against the devaluation of the U.S. dollar. Merrin stated, “The U.S. Dollar is being rapidly devalued, and our State Treasurer should have the authority and flexibility to invest in Bitcoin when determining proper asset allocation.” As Bitcoin offers strong potential as a reserve asset due to its deflationary nature, with a fixed supply of 21 million coins making it a hedge against inflation. It ensures security and independence from political or banking instability. Bitcoin also provides diversification for state reserves, which is reducing reliance on traditional assets. Risks and Challenges of a Bitcoin Reserve Nic Carter, founding partner of Castle Island Ventures recently in Bloomberg expressed concerns about the potential adoption of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset during an interview on Bloomberg TV. He argued that such a move could undermine global confidence in the US dollar, which is the most important of the current financial system. Carter stated, “I don’t think this is going to happen because it would erode confidence in the dollar, and that would be a negative outcome for everyone involved.” He also believes that using Bitcoin as a reserve asset could cause more problems than benefits. He pointed out that Bitcoin’s price can be very unstable, which could create issues for the global financial system, which currently depends on the stable US dollar. He said, “This is not a good idea because it could lead to volatility and instability in global markets.” As Bitcoin becomes more popular, it’s important for policymakers and financial institutions to think about these risks. As we all know the main problems with using Bitcoin as a reserve asset is its price volatility. Bitcoin’s value can change dramatically in a short period. For example, in 2021, its price went from nearly $70,000 to around $30,000. This kind of price swing makes Bitcoin an unstable choice for governments, as it could lead to unexpected losses if its value drops suddenly. Another issue is the lack of clear regulations around Bitcoin as he mentioned. Recently, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently said that nothing to do with Bitcoin that there are no laws governing its use. So, the market reacted all of a sudden when Powell’s comments. That led to a sudden drop in Bitcoin’s value from $107,00 to $101,300. So, Bitcoin can be a risky asset for governments, as sudden changes in the market can lead to financial instability for investors. Possible Futures for Bitcoin R eserves Matt, Bitwise CIO said that in an interview by December 2025, Bitcoin will likely surpass $200,000. He highlights three key things could support for the rally, ETFs, public companies like MicroStrategy, and even governments buying Bitcoin. As Matt puts it, “there’s just too much demand, not enough supply,” which he believes that will make the price higher. Also, Matt argues that we’re still in the early stages of this journey. As he said, “if we do get a Bitcoin strategic reserve where the government is buying Bitcoin… you’re going to be looking at three, four, $500,000 Bitcoin.” Although he still thinks the odds are less than 50%, but it could gain traction especially with the support from key leaders. He added, If the U.S. government starts holding Bitcoin as a reserve, its price could go up by reaching $300,000 to $500,000. While this is just an idea. Some U.S. states like Ohio, Texas, and Pennsylvania are thinking about holding Bitcoin as part of their reserves, hoping it could protect against inflation. But its price swings and lack of clear rules are big concerns.

PlayStation’s lead architect, Mark Cerny, who first introduced the PS5 Pro in September, announced on Wednesday that the two companies were creating a deeper collaboration to work on “machine learning-based technology for graphics and gameplay.” Sony wants to improve game graphics According to an article by The Verge , the two companies already have an existing partnership on the PS5 Pro and PS5 Pro’s GPUs based on AMD’s RDNA 2 architecture. The article further explains that PS5Pro uses a feature called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) to improve image clarity and frame rates. The new GPU is a combination of what was already offered on the PS5 with, according to Engadget , some cherry-picked features from the more advanced RDNA3 architecture that AMD introduced in 2022. That’s paired with ray tracing techniques that Cerny says in a video are from future RDNA tech on AMD’s roadmap and custom machine learning features created for the PS5 pro. The machine learning components are also reportedly a crucial part of AMD and Sony’s future work together. In the 37-minute presentation , Cerny explained the technical aspects of the PS5 Pro and other additional information about the “multi-year” project with AMD which is codenamed “Amethyst.” “And I’m honored to announce that we have begun a deeper collaboration with a focus on machine learning-based technology for graphics and gameplay,” said Cerny. Although he did not give the finer details about when and where the Project Amethyst tech will be used, it appears like something the market could see on the next PlayStation and other future hardware of which AMD is a part of. “These components should be key in increasing the richness of game graphics.” Cerny. According to Cerny, the two firms have two goals with Project Amethyst. “The first goal is a more ideal architecture for machine learning,” explained Cerny, adding the second goal is to develop “a set of high-quality CNNs for graphics.” “Both SIE and AMD will independently have the ability to draw from this collection of network architectures and training strategies, and these components should be key in increasing the richness of game graphics as well as enabling more extensive use of ray tracing and path tracing,” added Cerny. The technology should extend beyond PlayStation The collaboration between them is a culmination of the companies’ desire to push gaming tech even further. Additionally, the collaboration is expected to improve on what PlayStation has already accomplished with SP5 Pro, with their results starting to show with future console iterations like the inevitable PS6. Cerny explained that both Sony and AMD do not want the technology to be exclusive to PlayStation but to be used “broadly across PC and console cloud.” “Through this technology collaboration we’re looking to support broad work and machine learning across a variety of devices,” said Cerny. In the video, Cerny further discussed three specific areas and their future potential growth – rasterized rendering, ray tracing, and machine learning. According to Cerny, out of the three areas, rasterized rendering has the lowest potential for growth with improvements coming from using larger GPU or faster memory. Ray tracing has growth potential as the technology is still new and the tech is expected to see “quantum leaps” in the next decade, while machine learning has the greatest growth potential, which explains which it is the current focus for AMD and Sony. In his presentation, Cerny also highlighted chances were high the market might not see hardware that uses technology from Project Amethyst until PlayStation 6, since creating a console is “roughly a four-year journey.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",AI|PlayStation 5|Sony,EN,0,0,MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-19 00:06:04

In fact, with fresh presales, community-driven projects, and new use cases, the meme coin scene is evolving into something much bigger than a passing trend. If you’re looking for the best meme coins to invest in December 2024, then you’re in luck. This December, three meme coins stand out from the crowd: BTFD Coin (with a raging presale that gathered $4.1 million so far), Turbo, and COQ Inu. Each of these projects is packing a serious punch in terms of potential, utility, and community support. Let’s dive into why analysts are so optimistic about these coins and why they could make great investments before the year wraps up. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin That’s Making Waves As we approach the end of 2024, BTFD Coin continues to generate massive buzz in the meme coin market. The best meme coin to invest in December 2024 just might be this one, thanks to its explosive presale, highly engaged community, and features that make it a standout in the meme space. Currently in Stage 12 of its presale, BTFD Coin is priced at $0.00013, having raised over $4.1 million. The presale has been a total success, with over 56 billion tokens sold and 5,900+ Bulls holding tokens already. For investors looking to capitalise on this presale opportunity, here’s an investment scenario to consider: If you were to invest $7,000 at the current presale price of $0.00013, you’d be able to snag an impressive 53.8 million BTFD tokens. Now, if the price increases to $0.0006 post-presale (which many analysts are predicting), that $7,000 investment could skyrocket to $32,300. That’s over 460% growth—and it’s all thanks to the strong foundation and massive community backing BTFD Coin. BTFD Coin’s ecosystem also includes staking rewards, offering one of the highest APYs in the meme coin space (think 90%+). This creates an additional layer of opportunity for investors to grow their holdings even more. Add in the fact that BTFD Coin has a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that ties in directly with its ecosystem, and you’ve got a meme coin with long-term potential far beyond just its presale. Turbo: A Meme Coin Changing the Game with TurboChain Turbo was born from an AI-generated meme coin idea, and it has evolved into something far more significant thanks to the launch of TurboChain. This Layer-1 blockchain is set to support decentralised finance (DeFi) applications, blockchain-based games, and much more, giving Turbo a huge edge in terms of real-world use. The collaboration between Aurora Labs and NEAR Protocol has paved the way for TurboChain to support fast transactions and scale well beyond what most other blockchains are capable of. This will be a game-changer for developers looking to create decentralised apps (dApps) on TurboChain, which has been designed with customisability in mind. Developers can now innovate quicker and more efficiently than ever before. Turbo’s market cap sits at $690 million, and it’s listed on major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, and KuCoin. What’s more, all gas fees on TurboChain will be paid in Turbo tokens, which further increases the utility and demand for this coin. The combination of high demand for transactions, increasing blockchain usage, and an expanding ecosystem means that Turbo is one of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. Additionally, analysts are predicting big things for Turbo in 2025, with the price forecasted to rise from its current value of $0.06049 to around $0.10 by mid-2025. COQ Inu: The Meme Coin with Community Power and Strong Personality COQ Inu has developed a strong presence on the AVAX blockchain, making it one of the most popular meme coins on the network. With a $138 million market cap and a circulating supply of 69.42 trillion tokens, COQ Inu may have taken a slight dip recently (down 11.16% in the last 24 hours), but this is precisely why some investors are jumping in to buy the dip. COQ Inu was founded by respected members of the community who initially placed the entire coin supply with 150 AVAX in liquidity. The team has fully renounced the contract and burned liquidity, ensuring a strong foundation for long-term growth. What makes COQ Inu particularly interesting is its community-oriented nature and meme culture. The token’s personality revolves around fun, light-hearted branding that has struck a chord with meme coin enthusiasts, helping to establish it as a cult favourite. While COQ Inu doesn’t have the same kind of groundbreaking utility as Turbo or BTFD Coin, its growing presence on top exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, and Gate.io has cemented it as a meme coin worth watching. Additionally, with a price currently sitting at $0.000002, there’s room for big gains should the price rebound and continue upwards in the coming months. Conclusion: The Best Meme Coins to Invest in December 2024 BTFD Coin’s massive presale success, Turbo’s powerful blockchain tech, and COQ Inu’s tight-knit community all combine to make them the meme coins you’ll want to add to your portfolio this month. Whether you’re diving into BTFD Coin’s presale or taking advantage of Turbo’s Layer-1 blockchain development, these meme coins are primed for major growth. Don’t wait too long—these coins are already turning heads, and there’s plenty of room for price action as we head into 2025. Time to get in before the next big wave!

The Fed cut interest rates by 25bps but pushed back against expectations for a continuation of rapid interest rate cuts in 2025. What just happened? The Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points which is exactly what 97% of market participants wanted. But, the S&P 500 just posted its largest post-Fed drop since March 2020, erasing $1.8 TRILLION of market cap. Why? Let us explain. (a thread) — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 18, 2024 Despite the sharp intra-day decline, the Dogecoin price is holding above support in the form of the 50DMA and its recent range lows around $0.35 for now. After such a strong rally in recent weeks since Donald Trump’s election victory in early November, some are concerned that a deeper retracement could be on the cards in the short term. $0.33-35 has been a key level for Dogecoin going all the way back to mid-2021. Should this level go, the Dogecoin price would be at risk of a sharp dump back towards its early 2024 highs in the $0.23 area. While Dogecoin investors might need to brace for a short-term market dip, there remains plenty of reason to be optimistic on the cryptocurrency’s chances for 2025. Here’s why. Bullish Dogecoin Price Outlook for 2025 – When Will DOGE Hit $1? Dogecoin has two main factors that are playing in its favor. Firstly, the arrival of the Trump administration and a new US Congress is expected to usher in a new golden age for the crypto industry in the US. Meanwhile, chatter about the establishment of a US strategic reserve in the US and in other major nations continues to grow. These combined factors suggest there is massive potential for price growth ahead for major cryptocurrencies – as the number one meme coin, Dogecoin is in a prime position to benefit. Secondly, Dogecoin is inexorably tied into the new Trump administration, with Elon Musk’s new Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) named after it. Department of Government Efficiency pic.twitter.com/HFeHYNIkJN — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 7, 2024 Musk has been a long-term supporter and proponent of Dogecoin. The world’s largest meme coin is all but guaranteed to retain a leading portion of mind share in the meme coin market as Musk’s D.O.G.E. makes headlines, for better or for worse. So, assuming everything goes to plan – Bitcoin reserves are established and the crypto industry booms – in the coming years, it’s probably just a question of when, not if, Dogecoin hits $1. Analyzing Dogecoin’s relationship to Bitcoin during the last three market cycles can help us answer this question. During the past three market cycles, when Bitcoin (BTC) entered a new phase of price discovery (as it did in April 2017, December 2020 and just recently in November 2024), Dogecoin has always still been languishing well below its record highs. This time is no different. But during the past two market cycles, it only took the Dogecoin price between 1-3 months to catch up and break out to its own record highs. So, assuming history does repeat itself, a DOGE breakout could be coming as soon as early 2025, with $1 likely to be quickly hit. Does This Vote-to-Earn Meme Coin Have Even Bigger Upside Potential? Dogecoin could easily more than 2x in 2025 to hit $1. But there are many smaller, lesser-known meme coins that could post far larger gains. The team at crypto news.com keeps a close eye on the meme coin market as they hunt for high-potential projects. And one new meme coin they like a lot is an exciting new DAO-powered vote-to-earn meme coin called Flockerz (FLOCK) . One of the reasons analysts at crypto news.com are so excited about this token is the impressive pace at which is has been raising funds from earlier investors. Despite only launching a few weeks ago, Flockerz (FLOCK) has already attracted over $7 million from eager buyers. The Flock is growing day by day! 7M raised and this flocks here to stay! pic.twitter.com/a8gFhYt4P8 — Flockerz (@FlockerzToken) December 17, 2024 Couple that with its impressive social media metrics, and this token is looking like a meme coin that could really pop. With new meme coins like Fart Coin recently hitting a $1 billion market cap, the appetite for novel new meme coins appears elevated. FLOCK could easily become one of the best meme coins to launch in 2024. ClayBro outlines in the video below why he thinks the token has 25x potential.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-19 00:52:00

Despite recent downward pressures, several factors suggest a potential upward trajectory for the popular memecoin. #1 Dogecoin Bounces Off Key Support Level (1D Chart) Crypto analyst CRG (@MacroCRG) highlighted the resilience of Dogecoin and PEPE, another prominent memecoin, stating, “DOGE + PEPE both bouncing from important areas. The memecoin demise is greatly exaggerated IMO. Next leg up gonna take many by surprise.” CRG’s technical analysis reveals that DOGE has maintained a daily close above the critical support level of $0.385 for nine consecutive days, despite substantial selling pressure. Similarly, PEPE has sustained crucial support, indicating that the “memecoin season” might be making a comeback imminently. Related Reading: Ex-Hedge Fund Guru Bets Big On Dogecoin As ‘Core Crypto Bet’ For Dogecoin, the short-term resistance zone at $0.42 remains a pivotal level. CRG suggests that a break above this threshold could signal the onset of a new bull run, potentially catching many investors off guard. #2 Bullish Market Structure (4-Hour Chart) Further technical insight comes from crypto analyst Gonzo (@GonzoXBT), who provided a technical breakdown of Dogecoin’s price action. Gonzo explained, “DOGE 4H EMA100 -> acting as resistance 4H EMA200 -> acting as support. Until we flip 4H EMA100 we will just chop in between, don’t want to see it lose 4H EMA200 tho.” This analysis underscores the importance of the 4-hour exponential moving averages (EMAs) in determining short-term price movements. The 4H EMA100 currently serves as a resistance level, while the 4H EMA200 offers support. A sustained breach above the 4H EMA100 could facilitate an upward breakout, whereas a failure to maintain above the 4H EMA200 might lead to further consolidation or decline. #3 Trading Against The Crowd Crypto analyst Ali Martinez (@ali_charts) presented another bullish perspective on DOGE’s immediate outlook. He noted, “Market sentiment for Dogecoin has turned negative. It seems as if traders are getting impatient during the ongoing price consolidation!” Related Reading: Bull Flag Formation Puts Dogecoin Price As High As $2.15 This Cycle Martinez’s analysis, based on Santiment data, indicates a sharp decline in both search volume and Weighted Sentiment. Specifically, Weighted Sentiment has plummeted to its lowest point since mid-October, while search volume has dropped to levels not seen since early November. Martinez speculated on potential catalysts that could quickly reignite positive momentum for Dogecoin, referencing the establishment of the new US Department of Government Efficiency under the leadership of Elon Musk. He suggested, “Or you can wait the first POPULAR action of the Department of Government Efficiency.” #4 Liquidation Dynamics Indicate Potential Upside Adding another layer to the bullish thesis, crypto analyst Carlos Garcia Tapia (@CAGThe3rd) shared insights into the liquidation heatmap over the past three days, commenting, “FOMO longs just got liquidated on the 3D chart. DOGE.” The heatmap by Coinglass illustrates a significant liquidation of leveraged long positions clustered between $0.393 and $0.385 over the past two days. But there’s a bullish caveat: with the majority of longs now liquidated, the remaining liquidation cluster is positioned around the $0.42 mark. This setup suggests that Dogecoin could experience a bullish candle formation, potentially triggering further liquidations of bearish positions and propelling the price upward. Why? Because liquidation heatmaps are valuable tools in forecasting price movements as they reflect the underlying market liquidity and leverage dynamics. These heatmaps highlight where traders are most susceptible to forced liquidations, acting as psychological and technical barriers.

Pseudonymous analyst Inmortal tells his 221,100 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum’s two-hour chart looks similar to Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price action over the last two weeks. The analyst says that while Ethereum struggles to clear resistance at $4,000, he notes that BTC also had trouble breaching $100,000 for weeks before surging to new all-time highs. “Same price action, but with one difference. God candle after the breakout. ETH.” Source: Inmortal/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that ETH will surge close to its all-time high of $4,800 after the breakout. At time of writing, ETH is worth $3,892. The trader also has his radar locked on the memecoin Floki ( FLOKI ). According to the trader, FLOKI appears to be trading in a symmetrical triangle pattern and is gearing up to shatter the structure’s diagonal resistance en route to new record highs. “Second leg up – loading. New ATH – loading. Price discovery – loading. FLOKI.” Source: Inmortal/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that FLOKI will explode to a new all-time high of $0.00038. At time of writing, FLOKI is worth $0.000219. Looking at Solana ( SOL ), the trader sees the Ethereum rival bursting above its diagonal resistance to rally toward $300. “Something like this. SOL.” Source: Inmortal/X At time of writing, SOL is worth $222.60.

Among them, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has gained attention from analysts forecasting significant price gains in the current market cycle. Shiba Inu Expected to Break Previous Record A notable market analyst, Crypto Sheriff, has predicted that Shiba Inu could surpass its all-time high of $0.00008616, achieved during the 2020/2021 market cycle. In a post shared on December 15, the analyst stated that the outcome is inevitable, emphasizing the coin’s potential in the ongoing bullish trend. It is inevitable that #SHIB will break down ATH in this supercycle! pic.twitter.com/owuMMgpwoh — CRYPTO SHERIFF (@Gem_Sheriff) December 15, 2024 This prediction follows the asset’s impressive performance in November 2024, where the token rallied approximately 98% after the U.S. presidential election. Many believe Donald Trump’s victory signaled a crypto-friendly shift in U.S. policy, contributing to the token’s rise from $0.00001687 to $0.00003343. Meanwhile, the asset has retraced some gains and is trading at $0.00002682. Analysts Highlight Shiba Inu (SHIB) Bullish Patterns While Crypto Sheriff maintains a positive outlook, other analysts have provided additional technical insights supporting the possibility of a significant price increase. On December 10, CryptoELITES identified a bullish cup-and-handle formation on Shiba Inu’s weekly chart. The analyst noted that if the token breaks above a long-standing downtrend line, it could potentially reach $0.0004729, marking a 1,700% increase from its current value. The downtrend, which has acted as a resistance level since October 2021, is considered a critical barrier. According to CryptoELITES, breaking through this resistance would confirm the bullish pattern and set the stage for a sustained upward trend. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Risk of Downside Movement Despite the optimism, some analysts have highlighted potential risks. As earlier reported by Times Tabloid, market commentator PouyanTradeFX warned that if Shiba Inu fails to overcome the downtrend, the token could significantly decline. In this scenario, prices might drop by as much as 150%, bringing SHIB to the $0.000011 range. Such contrasting analyses underscore the importance of closely monitoring technical indicators and market conditions. While many remain bullish, the outcome will largely depend on how the asset performs in the face of these key resistance levels. The asset’s recent performance and technical setups have fueled speculation about its potential to reach new highs. Analysts like Crypto Sheriff and CryptoELITES are optimistic about the token’s future, while others urge caution, emphasizing the importance of breaking resistance levels to confirm a bullish trend.

Despite meeting market expectations, the announcement sparked a significant selloff in equities and cryptocurrency markets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. The market’s negative reaction highlights concerns about the broader implications of the rate cut. Market Reaction to the Rate Cut Zero Hedge, a prominent financial news and analysis platform, posted the announcement on X stating “FED CUTS 25BPS AS EXPECTED.” FED CUTS 25BPS AS EXPECTED — zerohedge (@zerohedge) December 18, 2024 In response, user JP Friend 1 queried , “Why is market dumping on that news?” This question underscores confusion among retail and institutional investors, as rate cuts are traditionally viewed as supportive of financial markets. Another user, Bleeerg, offered an explanation stating “There is a theory that cutting rates after a period of raises means that there are issues with the economy and it marks the start of a recession.” Aron Meystedt, contributing to the discussion, provided historical context: “Yep. If you look at past charts over time for the major indices and overlay them with the fed funds rate, the stock drop (recession) happens AFTER the rates are dropped. It’s counterintuitive, but that’s the way it usually goes.” Historical Context and Recession Concerns The theory discussed by users aligns with historical patterns. During previous economic cycles, rate cuts following a prolonged tightening phase have often signaled underlying economic vulnerabilities. Policymakers typically lower rates to stimulate growth, but the decision can indicate that the economy has entered a period of contraction or is at risk of doing so. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This dynamic creates a paradox: while rate cuts reduce borrowing costs and aim to encourage investment, they can also signal that monetary authorities are bracing for economic downturns. Investors often react by selling risk assets, anticipating weaker earnings, reduced consumer spending, and tighter credit conditions. Cryptocurrency Market Impact The selloff was not limited to equities. Major cryptocurrencies also experienced sharp declines, with XRP down 9.8% in the past 24 hours, trading at $2.32. Meanwhile, Bitcoin , the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has fallen over 5% during the same period and currently trades at $100,700. Cryptocurrencies, often high-risk assets, tend to mirror the broader risk-off sentiment in financial markets. As fears of a potential recession grow, investors appear to be moving away from volatile assets and toward safer options such as bonds and cash. As the situation unfolds, investors will closely monitor upcoming economic data and Federal Reserve communications to assess the trajectory of monetary policy and its impact on global markets. For now, the reaction underscores the complex interplay between rate adjustments, market sentiment, and economic expectations.

In contrast to Web2’s centralized structure dominated by firms like Google and Facebook, Web3 grants users direct management of their digital interactions. Among the notable projects leveraging this shift are The Graph, Theta Network, and Web3Bay , each targeting distinct functionalities. The Graph is dedicated to decentralized data indexing for dApps, while Theta Network advances video streaming via decentralized bandwidth sharing. Nonetheless, these projects are somewhat niche in their focus. Web3Bay takes a broader approach by providing a decentralized e-commerce platform that amalgamates Web3 advantages including dual payment systems, community governance, and cross-chain functionality, establishing itself as a more comprehensive solution for blockchain-based commerce. Web3Bay: Spearheading Decentralized E-commerce in the Web3 Era Web3Bay distinguishes itself by pioneering a decentralized marketplace that transfers complete control of data and financial transactions back to the users. This approach starkly contrasts with that of traditional e-commerce behemoths like Amazon, which rely on intermediaries. By eliminating these middlemen, Web3Bay not only cuts down on costs but also enhances the privacy of its users. This empowers users with real ownership of their digital assets—a feature not seen in narrowly focused projects like The Graph and Theta. A standout feature of Web3Bay is its dual payment system, which accepts both cryptocurrencies and traditional payment methods such as PayPal. This flexibility makes it a bridge between the older Web2 and the new Web3, opening up the platform to both crypto enthusiasts and traditional users alike. This inclusive approach is absent in The Graph and Theta, making Web3Bay a uniquely accessible option in the marketplace. Another critical aspect of Web3Bay is its commitment to Community-Driven Governance via its DAO. This governance model allows 3BAY token holders to directly influence the platform’s direction by proposing and voting on initiatives, aligning the platform’s evolution with the desires of its community. Unlike The Graph and Theta, which do not facilitate such a level of user control, Web3Bay’s model promotes a genuinely decentralized approach, giving it a distinct advantage in the competitive landscape. The Graph: Specializing in Decentralized Data Indexing The Graph is tailored for managing blockchain data specifically for decentralized applications. By allowing developers to effectively query across multiple blockchain platforms, it becomes a fundamental tool for DeFi and NFT projects, where swift access to on-chain data is crucial. However, The Graph’s functionality is primarily confined to data indexing, serving a pivotal yet narrow role. In contrast, Web3Bay extends its reach into the broader aspects of the Web3 landscape, covering decentralized commerce and governance. This not only enriches the platform’s utility but also makes it a more holistic solution for users. While The Graph does a stellar job at enhancing data accessibility, it stops short of engaging in the broader, dynamic realms of commerce and governance where Web3Bay excels and truly makes a difference. Theta Network: Innovating Decentralized Video Streaming Theta Network is crafted to transform video streaming by leveraging a decentralized network that cuts down on bandwidth costs and boosts the quality of content delivery. Users can share their bandwidth and receive rewards in return, creating a sustainable and community-supported content distribution network. This model is especially advantageous for content creators as it lowers operational costs and improves the quality of streams. Yet, Theta’s dedication to just content streaming might limit its utility in other areas. On the flip side, Web3Bay extends its functionality by integrating decentralized storage solutions, automated payments through smart contracts, and a scalable infrastructure that supports a broad spectrum of e-commerce activities. This flexibility makes Web3Bay a more comprehensive platform. Additionally, Web3Bay ‘s forward-looking initiatives to explore NFTs and DeFi sectors significantly widen its scope, providing opportunities for users to create, purchase, and trade a variety of digital assets, moving beyond mere content. Why Web3Bay Surpasses The Graph & Theta Web3Bay’s emphasis on decentralization and scalability positions it above The Graph and Theta. By integrating dual payment options and fostering community governance, Web3Bay promotes a user-centric approach in line with Web3’s foundational values. Utilizing smart contracts and decentralized storage through IPFS, Web3Bay enhances security and operational efficiency, presenting an all-encompassing solution for digital commerce. Its scalable architecture, featuring Layer-1 with Layer-2 rollups, ensures low fees and rapid transactions, offering a user experience that outshines The Graph’s data indexing and Theta’s streaming capabilities. With plans to expand into NFTs and DeFi, Web3Bay demonstrates its commitment to leading a comprehensive Web3 ecosystem, transcending the limited functionalities of its competitors. Key Insights Web3Bay’s integration of e-commerce, community governance, and scalable infrastructure cements its status as a frontrunner among Web3 projects. While The Graph specializes in data indexing and Theta excels in streaming, Web3Bay’s extensive capabilities in commerce, payments, and governance render it a more influential and adaptable platform. With its user-centric, decentralized marketplace and diverse payment options, alongside future expansions into NFTs and DeFi, Web3Bay is not just keeping up with the Web3 evolution but actively driving the next wave of blockchain integration.

XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, recently surpassed Tether (USDT). Analysts and investors alike are growing excited about the possibility for XRP holders to become among the wealthiest investors in the foreseeable future, as indicated by the recent spike. Related Reading: Solana Poised For Growth In 2025 With Record $173 Million Q3 Funding—Report Potential Price Forecasts An analyst has expressed an audacious outlook for XRP, indicating that those who retain the asset may experience substantial returns, which could result in life-changing wealth in the near future. He anticipates a significant increase in the price of the altcoin, with the goal of reaching a price point between $30 and $35 by 2025. #XRP HOLDERS WILL BE THE RICHEST PEOPLE YOU KNOW – HERE’S WHY! pic.twitter.com/k0tc6tCAq0 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 17, 2024 Based on this estimate, the present price of approximately $2.54 is expected to experience a staggering increase of around 1,277%. A $1,000 investment, for example, may potentially increase to $14,000 if these objectives are accomplished. It is also possible that those who have made larger investments will have the opportunity to become millionaires as the value of XRP continues to climb. This optimism is perpetuated by recent fluctuations in prices. In the last 30 days, XRP registered a solid 124% increase, which coincided with a successful retest of its 2021 peak of $1.97. According to analysts, the demand for the crypto will continue to rise as Ripple expands its partnerships throughout Asia and beyond, further driving up its price. Causes Of Wealth Formation The positive outlook for XRP is due to a number of reasons. Investors have a lot more faith in Ripple now that its legal fight with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been settled. Legal certainty is about to arrive, hence many people believe that using XRP in worldwide banking will hasten the adoption. Since big financial institutions see Ripple’s technology’s ability to transform cross-border payments, institutional interest in it is also piquing. Some wealth managers suggests that XRP has the potential to revolutionize international payments in a manner similar to that of early Amazon. They anticipate a future in which XRP processes trillions of transactions daily, which could result in a price increase of an astonishing $132—a preposterous 23,900% from its current level. Related Reading: The $589 XRP Dream: Believers Aren’t ‘Delusional’ Enough, Expert Says Precaution In The Face Of Optimism Still, experts advise caution even if XRP has an encouraging future. Although forecasts are hopeful, they are not guaranteed since the market for cryptocurrencies is somewhat erratic. Analysts emphasize the need of realizing gains as prices rise instead of waiting for a climax that might never come to pass. Their advice for investors: make wise judgments and closely check price swings.

A Strategic Plan To Boost Bitcoin Holdings Metaplanet Inc. started its Bitcoin-buying spree in April 2024. As of this writing, the Japanese firm has already added 1,150 Bitcoins, or $122.67 million, to its holdings. Metaplanet’s investment thesis is similar to that of MicroStrategy’s, led by Michael Saylor. The issuance of new bonds is expected to fast-track its investment in digital assets. By offering zero-interest bonds, the company can avoid short-term financial issues while using the fresh funds to add more digital assets. It’s also a win-win scenario for investors since these bonds are offered at a discount but are paid in full upon maturity. The market responded well to these most recent events; shares of the company surged by 51% during the past five days. The company’s market capitalization is raised to more than $1 billion as its shares hit a high of ¥4,270. The CEO of Metaplanet Inc., Simon Gerovich, has appreciated the overwhelmingly favorable reaction of the market to the move. Metaplanet And BTC Rewards Program Apart from its approach of bond issuing, Metaplanet also revealed its Bitcoin Rewards Program. Recently, the company started a ¥30 million ($199,500) prize pool to honor owners of at least 100 shares as of December 31, 2024. Using a lottery system, the company will select 2,350 shareholders who will get varying amounts of Bitcoins.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-19 02:14:04

With a near 4% price increase, Ripple is once again proving its ability to innovate in the cross-border payments space. Meanwhile, Binance Coin (BNB) remains a pillar of the crypto market, raising discussions about its long-term security and investment potential, especially as the Binance ecosystem continues to dominate. But the real dark horse in this conversation is Qubetics ($TICS) . While established giants like XRP and BNB focus on pushing boundaries in their respective domains, Qubetics is tackling crypto’s usability challenge head-on. By creating a non-custodial wallet that simplifies transactions and integrates seamlessly with Apple Pay and Google Pay, Qubetics is making crypto accessible to everyone. Let’s explore why these three projects are among the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024 and how they’re leading the charge for blockchain innovation. Qubetics: Making Crypto Usable for Everyone Let’s be honest—crypto can be daunting for newcomers. Complex wallets, unpredictable market swings, and high fees often keep people at bay. Qubetics is here to change all that with a wallet that makes using crypto as easy as tapping your phone . Imagine you’re a small business owner, and a customer pays you in Ethereum. Usually, you’d need to convert that crypto into fiat, track exchange rates, and hope the market doesn’t crash. With Qubetics, payments are automatically converted at the point of sale . Whether you’re a freelancer working internationally or a café owner in New York, Qubetics makes transactions seamless and stress-free. What sets Qubetics apart is its smart contract conversion mechanism, which shields users from crypto market volatility. Plus, it works across iOS, Android, and desktop, integrating with Apple Pay and Google Pay for ultimate convenience. It’s like bringing crypto into the real world without the headaches. Currently in Presale Phase 13, Qubetics has already sold over 355 million tokens and raised $7 million. At $0.0342 per token, $TICS is a steal. But act fast—the next phase brings a 10% price hike, with the final phase promising a 20% increase. After presale, the price is set to hit $0.25, delivering a jaw-dropping 900% ROI. If you’re looking for the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024, Qubetics is a must-watch. Ripple: The Cross-Border Payment Innovator Ripple (XRP) has long been a trailblazer in the crypto space, and its recent launch of the RLUSD stablecoin proves it’s not slowing down. Designed to enhance cross-border payment efficiency, RLUSD is Ripple’s latest move to solidify its role as a leader in global finance. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) network continues to expand, with partnerships across the banking and payments industries. This network allows XRP to act as a bridge currency, enabling near-instantaneous transactions at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. For global businesses, this is a game changer. Regulatory clarity in key markets like the U.S. is also boosting investor confidence. Ripple’s recent legal victories have positioned XRP as one of the most resilient cryptos, even amid market volatility. For retail investors, XRP offers both utility and long-term growth potential. If you’re searching for the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024, Ripple’s innovation in cross-border payments makes it a strong contender. Whether you’re an enterprise or a casual investor, XRP continues to prove its relevance in an evolving crypto landscape. Binance Coin: The Backbone of the Binance Ecosystem Binance Coin (BNB) is more than just a cryptocurrency—it’s the fuel powering the Binance ecosystem. As the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance relies on BNB for everything from transaction fee discounts to staking opportunities, making it a cornerstone of the crypto market. Security has been a hot topic for BNB, with analysts debating its long-term viability. But one thing’s clear: Binance’s focus on compliance and security upgrades has strengthened investor trust. BNB’s deflationary model, driven by quarterly token burns, ensures a steady decrease in supply, boosting its value over time. The Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is another reason why BNB is a must-watch. With its low fees and fast transactions, BSC has become a hub for DeFi projects, NFTs, and dApps. This growing ecosystem ensures that BNB remains relevant, even as new competitors enter the market. For investors eyeing the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024, Binance Coin offers a mix of utility, security, and growth potential. Whether you’re using it on Binance or staking it for rewards, BNB is a reliable pick for any portfolio. Wrapping It Up The blockchain world is evolving, and Qubetics, Ripple, and Binance Coin are leading the way. Qubetics is making crypto accessible with its innovative wallet, Ripple is revolutionizing cross-border payments with RLUSD, and Binance Coin remains a pillar of the market with its expansive ecosystem. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics, Ripple, and Binance Coin as the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024 . These projects aren’t just shaping the future of blockchain—they’re setting the standard for what’s possible. Don’t miss your chance to invest in these groundbreaking opportunities.

With the year wrapping up, investors are scouring for projects that could bring both short-term value and long-term gains. Recently, Qubetics, Solana, and Binance Coin have captured attention due to their impressive developments and growing communities. Qubetics ($TICS) continues to make headlines, having secured over 10,600 token holders holding more than 355 million tokens in its presale. Meanwhile, Solana is riding a wave of institutional adoption, and Binance Coin is fostering groundbreaking innovations on the Binance ecosystem. Let’s take a closer look at why these three stand out as the best coins to join in December 2024. Qubetics Sets the Stage with Over 10,600 Token Holders Qubetics ($TICS) is breaking barriers as the world’s first web3 aggregator , solving major interoperability issues in the blockchain space. At the heart of its ecosystem is its decentralised VPN (dVPN), a revolutionary solution designed to provide enhanced privacy, security, and unrestricted internet access. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on centralised servers, Qubetics’ dVPN operates on a peer-to-peer network, ensuring user data remains private and resistant to surveillance. For example, journalists working in regions with heavy censorship can use Qubetics’ dVPN to access information securely without the fear of government intrusion. Businesses that handle sensitive data across borders can also benefit, as the dVPN reduces the risks associated with centralised systems and potential data breaches. Currently, Qubetics is in its 13th presale phase, where tokens are priced at $0.0342 each. Each presale stage concludes every Sunday at midnight, bringing a 10% price increase. So far, the presale has attracted over 10,600 holders , with more than 355 million $TICS tokens sold, raising over $7 million. Analysts are bullish on its future, predicting that $TICS could reach $15 after its mainnet launch. For example, an investment of $400,000 today could deliver life-changing returns if these predictions hold true. You can learn more about this project by watching the video here . Solana Gains Momentum with New Staking Opportunities Solana continues to reinforce its reputation as one of the fastest and most scalable blockchain networks. Recent developments highlight growing institutional interest and innovative solutions within its ecosystem. A major boost came with Bitwise launching a Solana staking ETP (exchange-traded product) in Europe, offering an impressive 6.48% yield to institutional investors. This move not only improves accessibility to Solana but also reinforces its position in the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector. Adding to the momentum, the recent launch of the Solaxy ICO, a Layer 2 project built on Solana, raised over $750,000 in its first 72 hours. This demonstrates the strong investor demand for projects leveraging Solana’s high-speed, low-cost network. These developments position Solana as a serious contender for both short-term and long-term gains, making it one of the best coins to join in December 2024. Binance Coin Powers Innovation Across the Blockchain Space Binance Coin (BNB) remains a key player in driving blockchain adoption through its robust ecosystem. As the native token of the Binance exchange, BNB supports numerous applications, including transaction fee reductions, staking, and the Binance Launchpad. Recently, Binance Launchpad facilitated the listing of Simon’s Cat (CAT) on its spot market, resulting in a remarkable 50% price increase within 48 hours. The listing reflects Binance’s ability to propel promising projects into the spotlight and generate strong market interest. In addition, Binance’s continued efforts to diversify offerings through its HODLer Airdrop Program have further engaged its community, distributing tokens of newly listed projects to loyal holders. This proactive approach fosters innovation and cements Binance Coin’s importance in the blockchain ecosystem. With its consistent utility and support for emerging technologies, Binance Coin is undoubtedly one of the best coins to join in December 2024. Conclusion: Qubetics, Solana, and Binance Coin Shine Bright As 2024 comes to a close, Qubetics, Solana, and Binance Coin offer exciting opportunities for crypto investors. Qubetics has already attracted 10,600 token holders and sold 355 million $TICS tokens, with analysts predicting an extraordinary surge to $15 post-mainnet launch. Meanwhile, Solana is gaining institutional traction with new staking opportunities and a successful Layer 2 ICO. Binance Coin remains a cornerstone of blockchain innovation, driving projects that generate real value for investors. For those looking to position themselves for growth, these projects are the best coins to join in December 2024. Now is the time to research, evaluate, and make informed moves in the dynamic world of crypto.

A potential reason for this drop is the recent Federal Reserve rate cut meeting. Reason Behind the Crypto Market Decline During the conference, the Federal Reserve announced an interest rate ceiling of 4.50%, aligning with expectations, compared to the previous rate of 4.75%. Jerome Powell made a bold statement on cryptocurrency that significantly impacted the overall market. In a statement, Powell noted that we are not allowed to own Bitcoin and have no desire to change the laws. This statement by the Fed chief shows that the U.S. central bank has no interest or intention to support a scenario where the government would accumulate a significant amount of Bitcoin. Regarding the legal issues surrounding Bitcoin ownership, Powell stated, “That’s the kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed.” The idea of creating a so-called “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” appears to be failing, as the Federal Reserve has no intention of participating in such an initiative until President-elect Donald Trump takes office. This indicates that central banks are distancing themselves from holding large amounts of Bitcoin, unlike gold reserves. Federal Reserve’s Meeting Impacted Crypto Prices These statements by Powell have caused a significant downturn in the overall cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency, dropped by over 6.5%, falling below $100,000 after reaching the $108,000 mark. Meanwhile, other assets, including Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE), experienced price declines of 5.5%, 14.20%, 9.45%, and 11.5%, respectively.
