The firm claimed that it has shifted its focus to Bitcoin as the leading cryptocurrency, which has been profitable, especially with the current price increases. *Metaplanet Projects First Fiscal Year Operating Profit Since 2017* pic.twitter.com/oYNKOtNatR — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) December 18, 2024 Metaplanet expects an operating income of ¥270 million ($1.8 million) for the year ending December 31, which is an improvement from the ¥468 million ($3.1 million) loss it made the previous year. Sales are also forecast to increase at a much faster pace – from ¥261 million ($1.7 million) to ¥890 million ($5.8 million). Bitcoin treasury management powers growth Metaplanet has attributed a lot of its success to its focus on Bitcoin, especially through Bitcoin put options trading. The company has projected that it will earn ¥520 million ($3.4 million) from put options only. Put options allow Bitcoin investors to sell the digital currency at a specific price providing both protection and profit-making chance. Metaplanet stands to benefit from earning premiums on these contracts and, when exercised, receiving more Bitcoin. This has helped it to increase the number of Bitcoins it has and also helped it to generate revenue. The company currently holds 1,142 Bitcoin worth ¥17.6 billion or $119.4 million as of now, and this makes the firm the second largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in Asia. It goes further than simple trading, as the company has announced that it will create a separate “Bitcoin accumulation and management” business. Besides treasury management, Metaplanet has expanded its activities in the Bitcoin sphere. Recently, the company obtained a license to launch a Japanese edition of Bitcoin Magazine, which has become a new player in the digital asset media market. This could open up new income streams since the use of Bitcoin is on the rise in Japan and the rest of the world. The deal was announced in July at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, which was attended by the former US President, Donald Trump. Metaplanet is set to officially launch Bitcoin Magazine Japan in the first quarter of 2025. Bitcoin Magazine was launched in 2012 by Buterin and others and is one of the earliest outlets focused on Bitcoin. In a bid to strengthen its position, Metaplanet has offered ¥9.5 billion ($64.5 million) in bonds to increase its Bitcoin reserves. The company intends to use both debt and equity as capital to facilitate the accumulation strategy in the business. Besides Metaplanet, other companies that have been actively accumulating Bitcoin include MicroStrategy. This week only, MicroStrategy acquired 15,350 Bitcoin for about $1.6 billion and now holds 439,000 Bitcoin in its portfolio with a total value of over $46 billion.

Santiment’s data, on the other hand, showed that 104 whale wallets with >100K ETH jointly held over 57% of the total supply worth $333.1B. ETH holders exhibited increased faith in the altcoin this year as the group’s overall balances grew steadily despite market volatility. IntoTheBlock’s ETH data summary revealed that 74% of the holders had held the token for more than 1 year, while large holders accounted for 53%. The number of transactions with a value of $100K or greater had a total volume of $65.4B in the last seven days as exchanges recorded a netflow of -$912.97M. The data suggested that most of the ETH supply was aggressively being moved into whale wallets.

Roughly 110 million $ETH is now held by long-term holders. pic.twitter.com/smh7DZL1of — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 18, 2024 According to Santiment’s latest data, 104 whale wallets currently hold nearly 58% of all existing ETH tokens. These holdings reached an all-time high, suggesting a positive shift in long-term holder sentiment. These 104 whales reflected increasing confidence among ETH’s largest stakeholders as they continued accumulating despite the token’s ability to hold above $4K. Conversely, mid-level ETH holders (100-100K) dropped to their all-time low supply ratio, accounting for ~33% of the total supply. The broader Ethereum ecosystem generally included a rising number of staking wallets, signalling a bullish long-term outlook. Such sustained accumulation by key stakeholders suggested increased conviction and reduced selling pressure, which aligned with positive market sentiment over time. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that ETH’s price movement historically correlated with shifts in long-term holder sentiments. Long-term holders could, therefore, enter the ‘greed phase’ as the current bull cycle suggested a parabolic price surge. These holders were now in the early stages of the ‘belief’ stage, indicating they felt optimistic about ETH’s future price potential. If history repeated itself, this indicated that Ethereum’s major upward movement could still be on the horizon as long-term investor sentiment strengthened. Bitwise predicts ETH’s value will rise significantly in 2025 Juan Leon, senior investment strategist at Bitwise, said that Ethereum stood to benefit from several big trends in 2025. Leon claimed that ETH had positioned itself as the most ‘battle-tested’ smart contract platform, with an 81% share of the tokenization market. He argued that ETH would be the driving force behind the tripling of tokenized funds in 2025. Leon called ETH ‘the comeback kid of 2025’, saying it would likely lead in the $100 trillion tokenized real-world asset market next year. Ethereum was overshadowed by Bitcoin and Solana in 2024. The Bitwise investment strategist noted that Ethereum ETFs had attracted over $2 billion in net inflows over the past 10 days. Farside’s data confirmed a new daily record of $428.5 million in ETH ETF inflows on December 5th. According to the data, Ethereum ETFs saw less than three-digit daily inflows in only three of the 10 trading days Leon considered. Leon estimated that fees generated from RWA-linked activity on ETH could surpass its $2.4 billion YTD fees by more than 40 times in 2025. He attributed Ethereum’s next year’s dominance to its status as the most secure and reliable decentralized smart contract platform. Ethereum’s growth could also be accelerated by regulatory tailwinds and its widely distributed validator network.

Though some lawmakers and President elect Trump support a U.S. Bitcoin reserve. Powell’s comments caused Bitcoin to drop 5.7%, with other major cryptos also losing value, and the stock market reacted negatively. Powell Says No to U.S. Bitcoin Reserve Jerome Powell Fed Chair has made a point during a press conference that the U.S. central bank is not allowed to hold Bitcoin. He explained that according to the Federal Reserve Act, there are rules about what the bank can own, and Bitcoin is not part of that. He also stated that the Federal Reserve is looking for something other than a law change by leaving the decision to Congress. “We’re not allowed to own bitcoin. The Federal Reserve Act says what we can own, and we’re not looking for a law change. That’s something for Congress to decide, not the Fed.” These statements came after questions about the possibility of the U.S. government building a Bitcoin reserve, similar to how it holds gold. Powell stressed that any decision on the U.S. government holding Bitcoin would be up to Congress and not the Federal Reserve. He clarified that the central bank is interested in something other than getting involved in Bitcoin or changing its laws. Despite Powell’s firm stance, there has been growing interest in Bitcoin as a potential asset for the U.S. government to hold. Trump has supported the idea, suggesting that the U.S. should not fall behind other countries in the global crypto race. Some pro- crypto senators including Senator Cynthia Lummis from Wyoming, have been pushing for this idea. Lummis has even drafted a bill requiring the U.S. Treasury to buy one million Bitcoin over the next five years. President-elect Donald Trump has also supported the idea of the U.S. creating a Bitcoin reserve, saying the U.S. needs to stay ahead of countries like China by embracing digital currencies. Market Reaction to Powell’s comments After Powell’s comments, the cryptocurrency market reacted quickly. Bitcoin dropped to $100,300 which is down about 5.7% over the past 24 hours. By the time of the press release, Bitcoin was trading at $100,740. The cryptocurrency market also fell. Ethereum fell by 6.8%, Binance Coin (BNB) dropped by 4.6%, and Solana (SOL) by 8.1%. Dogecoin (DOGE) performed the least among the top 10 positioned tokens which is dropping by 11% to $0.348. The stock market also equally reacted negatively to Powell’s comments. The S&P 500 closed with a loss of 1.55%, and the Nasdaq 100 dropped by around 2%. These show how market is reacting to the news about government policies, especially when it comes to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Powell’s stance on not supporting a Bitcoin reserve created uncertainty among investors and also, they quickly adjusted their positions by selling. Jerome Powell’s comments made it clear that the Federal Reserve is not interested in holding Bitcoin or supporting the U.S. Bitcoin reserve. The market’s reaction showed how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are dependent from investors and policymakers.

Alternative Larger Metrics Show The Answer,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-ready-to-run-11-ath/,"A crypto analyst has shared an XRP price chart, analyzing its action on the 4-hour timeframe while pinpointing key metrics of strength that suggest a possible rally. The analyst has predicted that XRP is preparing for a significant run to $11, marking a new All-Time High (ATH). Key Metrics Suggest XRP Price Set For $11 Surge In an X (formerly Twitter) post on Tuesday, prominent crypto analyst Javon Marks shared key observations of XRP’s price behavior, noting signs of strength through crucial metrics and a potential for a significant price rally to a new ATH at $11. The analyst has suggested that XRP shows clear upward momentum, with a sharp increase visible on the presented price chart. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Crash Incoming? Tron’s Justin Sun Unstakes $209 Million ETH From Lido Finance Looking at the chart, XRP has been breaking recent resistance levels and maintaining bullish momentum. XRP’s strongest resistance at $0.5, which lasted for over three years, was broken earlier in November, jumping above $1 following Donald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential elections. Currently, the XRP price is trading above $2.5, underscoring the massive growth surge it has experienced in less than two months. Marks has revealed that he was keeping a close watch on alternative larger-term metrics for the XRP price that signal a potential surge to new ATHs. The volume bars below the price chart indicate steady buying pressure for XRP, with increasing trading volume during upward trends. Recently, the XRP accumulation trend among large holders has increased significantly. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed via a price chart that whales have purchased a staggering 30 million XRP within the last 24 hours. This increased buying activity reflects the growing confidence in XRP, possibly fueled by the market’s bullish sentiment and expectations of a price rally. At the bottom of the XRP chart shared by Marks, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) illustrates a sharp upward curve, signaling the potential for a bull rally. The RSI appears as a fluctuating black line, clearly reflecting rising momentum. If XRP can sustain its current uptrend, it could surpass its current all-time high of $3.84 set during the 2021 bull market, potentially reaching a new high above $11 in this bull cycle. Update On XRP Analysis The XRP price has been persistently attempting to break through the resistance area at $2.5, aiming to reach new highs. Over the past month, XRP has had an impressive performance, recording a whopping 119.5% price increase. Despite being in consolidation, the cryptocurrency continues to exhibit strong growth, with its price climbing nearly 8% in the last seven days as it attempted to break through key resistance levels.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC.

The apex crypto tumbled by as much as 5.3%, dropping to $100,752 after briefly soaring past $108,000 earlier this week in a record-breaking rally. Traders, spooked by the slower-than-expected pace of easing, pulled back speculative bets, hitting Bitcoin and other riskier assets. Fed signals fewer cuts The Fed’s quarter-point rate cut on Wednesday was widely expected, but its forecast left markets cold. Officials projected the benchmark rate to fall to 3.75-4% in 2025, down from an earlier prediction of a full percentage-point reduction. Morgan Stanley described the updated outlook as “much more hawkish than we anticipated.” This cautious approach suggests the Fed is prioritizing inflation control over aggressive stimulus. Fed Chair Jay Powell admitted that the December decision was a “closer call” than previous ones. He said inflation was moving “sideways,” while risks to the labor market had “diminished.” These comments signaled that the central bank might adopt a more restrained pace of easing moving forward. The policy change sent shockwaves through global markets. U.S. Treasury yields climbed, with the two-year note—closely tied to Fed policy—rising 0.08 percentage points to 4.33%. The dollar strengthened by 1% against a basket of major currencies, while Wall Street’s S&P 500 dropped 1%. Risk assets, including Bitcoin, bore the brunt of this recalibration. A recalibration in monetary policy The Fed’s rate cuts have been framed as part of a broader “recalibration” of monetary policy aimed at curbing inflation. Officials raised their estimate of the neutral rate—one that neither stimulates nor constrains the economy—to 3%, up from 2.5% a year ago. Revised forecasts showed the Fed expects core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, to reach 2.5% in 2025 and 2.2% in 2026. These figures are slightly higher than earlier projections. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.3% over the next three years. Markets were already on edge following the September decision, where Fed Governor Michelle Bowman dissented, marking the first internal opposition to a rate cut since 2005. The December move, though expected, came amid continued debate among officials about inflation’s trajectory. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, rose at an annual rate of 2.8% in October. Powell described this phase as a “new process” in the Fed’s approach, explaining that future rate cuts would require a higher bar for approval. The Fed’s goal remains clear: bring inflation back to 2% without derailing the labor market or broader economy.

This collaboration enables BOB to secure transactions using Bitcoin as its anchor chain, providing a level of finality and irreversibility unique to the Bitcoin network. Integration Brings Bitcoin Finality to BOB The integration with Babylon equips Build on Bitcoin (BOB) with “Bitcoin finality,” ensuring that transactions recorded on its platform are permanently and irreversibly secured on Bitcoin’s blockchain. This mechanism, as a result, strengthens the security and trustworthiness of BOB’s hybrid layer two network, distinguishing it from other Bitcoin-based L2 solutions that lack Bitcoin-native security. Babylon, recognized as the leading Bitcoin staking protocol, manages a total value locked (TVL) of approximately $6 billion. The protocol, as a result, allows Bitcoin holders to stake their BTC, contributing to the security of decentralized applications and earning rewards in return. Introducing BOB as a Bitcoin Secured Network (BSN). Through our integration with @babylonlabs_io , we’re bringing Bitcoin finality to the Hybrid L2 and making @build_on_bob the best place to use BTC Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs). https://t.co/K6baJZ2TAs pic.twitter.com/YmQLiaa9r9 — BOB (@build_on_bob) December 18, 2024 Through Babylon’s protocol, BOB can use Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) to release Bitcoin liquidity into DeFi applications while retaining Bitcoin’s robust security. Hybrid L2 Model Combines Bitcoin and Ethereum Features Build on Bitcoin hybrid layer two model blends Bitcoin’s security with Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities. The network aims to create bridges to other blockchains while using Bitcoin as the final settlement layer. With over $200 million in TVL, 320,000 users, and 100 projects, BOB has positioned itself as a prominent player in the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem. The integration is also part of BOB’s larger roadmap. As part of Phase 2, BOB will launch bridges that connect Bitcoin to other networks using BitVM, a new computing framework enabling Ethereum-like smart contracts on Bitcoin. The testnet release for BitVM is scheduled for early 2025, signaling BOB’s commitment to expanding Bitcoin’s DeFi potential. Lombard’s LBTC Joins the BOB Ecosystem To further enhance its ecosystem, BOB has announced the integration of LBTC, the largest Bitcoin LST, managed by Lombard Finance. LBTC, with a TVL of $1.6 billion, becomes the fourth LST deployment on BOB, following Ethereum, Base, and Binance Smart Chain. Approximately 80% of LBTC’s TVL is already actively deployed in DeFi applications, reflecting its importance in the staking landscape. This addition bolsters Build on Bitcoin’s efforts to expand Bitcoin staking liquidity and amplify DeFi activity on its platform. Through partnerships with staking providers, wallets, and aggregators, BOB has simplified the process of staking Bitcoin with a one-click solution. Subsequently, to celebrate its integration with Babylon, Build on Bitcoin has launched a 45-day campaign aimed at incentivizing Bitcoin staking and DeFi activity. Over this period, an additional 4.5 million Babylon Points will be distributed daily to eligible users. In addition, the campaign includes additional incentives from BOB’s LST partners, such as Bedrock and PumpBTC, to encourage wider adoption. Users will be able to easily convert native Bitcoin into staking positions on Build on Bitcoin via the “BOB Stake” portal, which supports a seamless transition into DeFi applications.

The international body maintains that the technology presents both opportunities and challenges. According to the World Bank article authored by Jaime Saavedra (Human Development Director for Latin America and the Caribbean at the World Bank) and Ezequiel Molina (Senior Economist), if properly implemented, AI can boost learning and teacher training, which could also mean more specialized support for students. A good example of a country tapping into this use case is Ecuador. There is reportedly a successful AI tutoring program that was able to improve the math skills of students for a mere $18 per head in the country. The fear the general public and various governing bodies have regarding artificial intelligence is valid. It could even be necessary to ensure the creation does not spiral out of moderate ranges. Common fears about AI’s impact on education Critics have raised valid concerns about the impact AI will have on equity, effectiveness, and the very nature of learning itself. However, the truth is that AI is already being used in most aspects of human society which is why the World Bank believes it is important that we confront these challenging questions now. According to the World Bank, it is not irresponsible to promote AI even when many schools lack the minimum conditions to operate the technology. While it admits that many schools still require fundamental infrastructure and well-qualified teachers, the World Bank publication highlights how properly implemented technology can help bridge the gaps faster. AI can scale up teacher training and become a great learning aid that allows teaching materials to reach remote areas quickly. This means students who need extra support can get it more easily and effectively. On the question of whether AI will serve human communities or if it will be the other way around, the publication conceded that this is a truly legitimate concern shared by many people. AI development is concentrated in the developed nations of the Global North (North America and Europe), so it is possible for developing nations not to focus on their crucial local needs, such as native language content and culturally relevant teaching approaches. The solution according to the World Bank is strategic engagement. It recommended developing local AI talent via targeted scholarships and training, creating partnerships for local language content development, establishing clear regulatory frameworks that protect data sovereignty, and building teachers’ digital skills through comprehensive training programs. One country that seems to be ahead where creating a regulatory framework for AI is concerned is Uruguay. In the country, they’ve developed guidelines for AI use that respect local teaching methods while leveraging AI advances. Such a framework ensures the technology serves their educational purposes, and not vice versa. Will AI make students lazier? One of the most common questions teachers and parents have asked since generative AI like ChatGPT went mainstream is how it will affect students’ work ethic. While it is true that tools like ChatGPT will become a crutch, promoting intellectual laziness and superficial learning, the World Bank says what matters more is how people use it. The World Bank article argues that its capabilities mean students always have a high IQ partner to either brainstorm problems or more commonly, do homework. It went on to maintain that while AI can promote complacency among students, it did not invent cheating. Hence, it is ultimately up to a person to decide how to use it productively. The sophistication AI tools offer presents an opportunity to fundamentally rethink how we teach and assess learning. After all, we know technology can facilitate focusing on what truly matters: developing higher-order thinking skills, creativity, and critical analysis. One country that has proven this is Nigeria . In the country, the World Bank ran some pilot programs that revealed a fascinating fact: under proper guidance, students who learn to use AI tools thoughtfully actually engage more deeply with the material. So, rather than asking students to summarize texts (something AI can do instantly), teachers can urge them to critique AI-generated analyses, compare different AI interpretations, or even use AI as a brainstorming partner while coming up with their own novel ideas. According to the World Bank, a good teacher is able to encourage critical thinking via thoughtful conversations. With AI, more teachers can prepare effective lesson plans and activities for difficult-to-teach skills. Recommendations for implementing AI responsibly in schools In the field of education, there have not been many scientific breakthroughs regarding learning because educational research, unlike medical research, often struggles to reach classroom practice. However, the World Bank believes AI can change this pattern. How? By adopting the same evidence-based approach used in medicine, pharmaceuticals, or food safety – forging ahead consciously without allowing the fear of innovation to paralyze growth. Still, no new medical procedure or food additive is ever introduced to the public without proper testing, so a systematic approach to AI in education is required. According to the World Bank, we will have succeeded in properly harnessing the power of AI when we can manipulate the technology while keeping the human element at the center. Since education mainly focuses on human interaction, we have the opportunity to use AI to make this interaction more effective and enjoyable, but only as an assistant, not a replacement. Focusing on this principle will ensure that the technology serves our educational values and not the other way around.

In a recent complaint, the wBTC custodian and Sun-affiliated BiT Global accused Coinbase of using wBTC – the tokenized representation of Bitcoin ( BTC ) on the Ethereum ( ETH ) blockchain – as a “cash grab” before delisting it and replacing it with its own version of the asset. Said the complaint, “In the case of wrapped Bitcoin, Coinbase viewed it as just another cash grab. It saw a competitor, wBTC, that had something it wanted: an innovative product that released value inherent in Bitcoin and let users utilize that value in bold new ways… Coinbase decided it would take what it wanted. Once the value in wBTC had been demonstrated, Coinbase changed the rules, delisting wBTC from its platform so that it could no longer be traded on the Coinbase platform – and it did so shortly after launching its own knock-off clone called cbBTC.” In response to the complaint, Coinbase says it made the decision to delist wBTC largely because of its links to Justin Sun and the risks that would arise should he have any influence over it. The exchange notes that Sun’s name is “conspicuously” left out of BiT’s complaint. “Coinbase made the decision—based on a rigorous internal process—that wBTC should be delisted from Coinbase’s exchange due to the unacceptable risk that control of wBTC would fall into the hands of Justin Sun. BiT now asks the Court to override, on an emergency basis no less, Coinbase’s judgment that continuing to list wBTC could compromise the integrity of its platform and put customers at risk. BiT seeks to force Coinbase to do business with an entity that no longer complies with Coinbase’s standards due to Mr. Sun’s ‘material involvement.’ And yet, Mr. Sun’s name and connection to wBTC is conspicuously absent from BiT’s Complaint and TRO (temporary restraining order) request. So too is any acknowledgement that he has repeatedly been accused of, investigated for, and sued for financial misconduct, and that reports of his alleged misdeeds abound in the press and crypto community more broadly.” Coinbase also alleges that Sun is “infamous” in the crypto community and that he has been accused of several wrongdoings, including market manipulation and misappropriation of digital assets.

The US Federal Reserve axed interest rates by 25bps as expected, but played down the prospect of substantial further easing in 2025. BREAKING: The S&P 500 falls sharply after the Fed cuts rates by 25 basis points, but raises inflation forecast. The Fed reduced their outlook from 3 to 2 rate cuts in 2025 and raised inflation expectations from 2.1% to 2.5%. Inflation is back. pic.twitter.com/kKtEHD0IF0 — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 18, 2024 US equity markets and major cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC) , which had probably been looking for an excuse to pull back following their very strong performance in recent weeks, were dumped. And this bled across in the highly speculative crypto meme coin space, with meme coin total market cap collapsing to $106 billion from $117 billion on Tuesday, per CoinMarketCap . Crypto bulls will likely remain confident that there will be a reversal of the market’s fortunes into the year’s end. That’s because the incoming Trump administration is set to be the most pro-crypto in history, a complete 180-degree shift from the anti-crypto stance of the outgoing Biden administration. And global crypto adoption is also accelerating, not least thanks to increased chatter about the establishment of Bitcoin strategic reserves in nations all around the world. If one country implements a Bitcoin strategic reserve you can kiss goodbye to your 4 year cycles. I already laid this out in January and assumed an adoption cycle. Think 2002 big tech. pic.twitter.com/k5mQQNJRLw — Tyler (@TylerDurden) December 17, 2024 That means there is fertile ground for the return of a new meme season, with Shiba Inu likely to lead any such rally. That said, the latest developments in the Shiba Inu price chart are concerning. Is a short-term price crash right around the corner? Bearish Chart Developments – Is the Shiba Inu Price About to Crash? The Shiba Inu price’s latest drop has seen it slump under its 50DMA, after falling below its 21DMA earlier in the month. Moreover, SHIB has now also broken to the south of an upward trend channel in play since mid-November. All that suggests a drop back towards the next major support zone around $0.00002160 is on the cards, a further 11% decline from current levels. However, things would only really get bad for Shiba Inu if the meme coin broke below its uptrend from its summer 2024 lows. That could open the door to a retest of the 200DMA under $0.000019 or lower. But SHIB bulls should not fear. Yes, maybe the Fed won’t cut interest rates as much as the market wants in 2025. But this is not the end of the world for crypto markets, nor meme coins like Shiba Inu. As noted, the US crypto industry is about to enter a new golden age and global adoption is accelerating. Bitcoin may be the initial beneficiary of this, but this will eventually work its way into the altcoin and meme coin space. As a leading name in the space with a massive community and vast web3 ecosystem, Shiba Inu is going to attract substantial demand. To, for investors able to hold through some near-term turbulence, Shiba Inu price dips are a great opportunity to accumulate this high potential meme coin .

According to Hougan, Ethereum’s reputation as slow and expensive is becoming outdated as advancements in its ecosystem address these challenges. Bitwise CIO Predicts Ethereum Layer-2 Growth Will Outpace Solana by 2025 According to a recent tweet by Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, Ethereum Layer-2 networks are transforming the platform’s reputation and usability. Hougan noted that Ethereum’s advancements in scalability and user experience rival those of Solana, traditionally recognized for its ease of use. Moreover, Hougan highlighted projects like Clanker and Virtuals, AI-driven applications thriving on Ethereum Base network. These developments demonstrate Ethereum’s ability to support innovative, user-friendly solutions while maintaining its robust infrastructure. This shift is pivotal for ETH as it aims to combine institutional-grade credibility with improved accessibility for everyday users. Matt Hougan added, “If Ethereum can retain its institutional bona fides but level up ease-of-use, 2025 will be a good year indeed. It’s the Layer-2 network thesis playing out in real-time.” Despite the competition between Ethereum and Solana blockchains, VanEck predicted new all-time highs for both assets by 2025. Ethereum is projected to surpass $6,000, driven by Layer-2 growth and staking integration, while Solana is forecast to exceed $500 due to its scalability and adoption in DeFi and NFTs. VanEck also expects Bitcoin to reach $180,000, fueled by U.S. adoption and corporate holdings. Layer-2 Networks Propel Accessibility Ethereum’s evolution is largely driven by its top Layer-2 solutions, such as Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum. These solutions address long-standing issues of scalability and high transaction costs. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan emphasized the importance of these networks in making Ethereum ecosystem competitive with platforms like Solana. By leveraging Layer-2 technology, Ethereum provides a more seamless experience for developers and users. This advancement positions the platform as a hub for projects that require both scalability and affordability. Bitwise CIO predicts that this Layer-2-driven transformation will drive Ethereum’s growth in 2025. Moreover, Ethereum’s infrastructure is favored for projects in artificial intelligence (AI) and decentralized finance (DeFi). With a growing number of applications leveraging its infrastructure, Ethereum continues to demonstrate its versatility. Bitwise CIO believes this adaptability strengthens Ethereum’s position as a leader in blockchain technology. While Ethereum makes strides in accessibility and innovation, Solana recently overtook it as the leading ecosystem for new developers. According to Electric Capital, Solana experienced an 83% year-on-year growth in monthly active developers, ending Ethereum’s eight-year dominance in this metric. Despite Solana’s achievements, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan remains confident in Ethereum’s trajectory.

Here’s Why Qubetics Is the Next Best Crypto to Buy Under $1,https://thecoinrise.com/renders-success-left-you-wishing-heres-why-qubetics-is-the-next-best-crypto-to-buy-under-1/,"In the world of cryptocurrency, timing can be everything. The regret can be palpable for those who missed the opportunity to invest in Render during its early days. Render ($RNDR), now a household name among blockchain enthusiasts, began humbly but rapidly captured the attention of forward-thinking investors. Its ICO price was a mere fraction of its current value, and those who recognised its potential have seen their investments soar exponentially. However, if you’re feeling you’ve missed out, there’s a new opportunity on the horizon that could rival Render’s success – Qubetics ($TICS). The Rise of Render: From Underdog to Powerhouse Render debuted with an ICO that saw tokens priced at just $0.05, an absolute bargain in hindsight. Its vision was revolutionary at the time: a decentralised GPU rendering platform designed to streamline creative industries. Despite scepticism, early believers reaped life-changing gains as the project gained traction. Fast-forward to today, and Render is valued significantly higher, delivering returns that make investors’ eyes light up. But what about those who missed the boat? While hindsight can be cruel, the crypto market constantly evolves, offering new opportunities to capitalise on innovation. This is where Qubetics comes into play – the best crypto to buy under $1 right now. Why Qubetics Could Be the Next Big Opportunity Qubetics is currently in Presale Phase 13, and excitement is reaching a fever pitch. Unlike Render’s initial days, Qubetics has already achieved impressive traction, with over $7 million raised, more than 10,600 holders, and 355 million tokens sold. The price of $TICS tokens is just $0.034, making it an attractive entry point for investors seeking the best crypto to buy under $1. With weekly presale phases bringing a consistent 10% price hike, Qubetics is designed to reward early adopters handsomely. By the final presale phase, the token will experience a 20% price jump, making now the most compelling time to act. Post-presale projections suggest a target price of $0.25 per token, delivering a staggering ROI of 630.27% for those entering at this stage. Analysts are even more bullish, predicting Qubetics could soar to $10 or even $15 following the mainnet launch, offering potential returns of 29,106.88% and 43,660.31%, respectively. Imagine investing today and seeing your portfolio multiply beyond your expectations. Could Qubetics be your second chance at capturing gains similar to those who believed in Render early on? Innovating Cross-Border Transactions: The Qubetics Advantage What sets Qubetics apart isn’t just its presale success – it’s the groundbreaking utility it offers. The Qubetics Network empowers banks and financial institutions by enabling near-instant cross-border payments and settlements using the $TICS token. Institutions can leverage blockchain technology to perform transactions faster, more cost-effectively, and with enhanced transparency. The ability to execute international payments efficiently is crucial in an increasingly globalised business environment. Traditional systems are slow, riddled with inefficiencies, and lack the transparency that businesses and individuals now demand. Qubetics’ solution addresses these pain points, ensuring funds are transferred securely and swiftly. This means improved cash flow and operational efficiency for businesses, while for individuals, it ensures faster remittances and reduced delays. For anyone seeking the best crypto to buy under $1, Qubetics offers a rare combination of real-world utility and explosive growth potential. Why Timing Is Everything As we’ve learned from Render’s story, hesitation can be costly. Those who waited on the sidelines missed the chance to buy low and reap the rewards of early adoption. Qubetics offers a similar, if not greater, opportunity to position yourself for significant gains. With the next presale phase imminent and the token price set to rise again, the window of opportunity is shrinking. Every passing week brings higher prices, and the potential for missed gains grows larger. If you’re searching for the best crypto to buy under $1 that combines innovation, strong community backing, and exceptional growth prospects, Qubetics is a clear frontrunner. Conclusion: Don’t Let Another Opportunity Slip Away Cryptocurrency history is filled with stories of missed opportunities and rich with tales of redemption. Render’s meteoric rise may be behind us, but Qubetics presents a fresh chance for investors ready to act. With its presale success, groundbreaking real-world applications, and analysts’ bullish predictions, Qubetics is the best crypto to buy under $1 today. The presale phase is your chance to get in early, secure a favourable position, and watch your investment grow. Will you seize this chance, or will you look back with regret, wondering why you hesitated? The choice is yours, but the clock is ticking.

This bumps their ENA holdings to 741,687, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. WLFI’s December buying spree totaled nearly $45 million , expanding its position across multiple crypto assets. The breakdown: $30 million secured 8,100 Ethereum (ETH). $10 million was invested in Coinbase Wrapped Bitcoin (cbBTC). $2 million each allocated to Chainlink (LINK) and Aave (AAVE). $250,000 picked up 134,216 Ondo (ONDO) tokens via Cow Protocol on December 16. WLFI tokens rally as the market responds The crypto market hasn’t ignored WLFI’s spending spree. Several of its key assets have rallied, with Chainlink (LINK) leading the charge at a 28% surge, now valued at $28. Aave (AAVE) followed with a 17% gain, landing at $52. Ethereum (ETH) edged up by 8%, trading at $3,912. WLFI’s purchases have fueled speculation about the project’s ability to boost confidence in these tokens. The platform has partnered with AaveDAO, leveraging Aave’s protocols for lending and borrowing services. In return, AaveDAO gets 20% of WLFI’s fee revenue and 7% of its total token supply. And then there’s Justin Sun, founder of TRON, who invested $30 million in WLFI. His involvement has been a bit controversial, but the backing undeniably adds firepower to WLFI’s arsenal. But WLFI hasn’t had it easy since its September unveiling. Early token sales brought in $220 million, but wallet authenticity concerns during the launch cast doubt over the project’s credibility. Despite the briefly strong start, sales have slowed. WLFI wanted to sell $300 million worth of tokens but has managed to offload less than 25% of the remaining supply.

Choi Sang-mok, the nation’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Strategy and Finance, admitted that “domestic and international uncertainties” remain in the wake of a successful vote to impeach President Yoon Suk-yeol earlier this month. Not Negative on Crypto: Finance Chief Per Newsis , Choi told reporters that the government would “not let its guard down” in spite of the turmoil . Choi Sang-mok, South Korea’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Strategy and Finance, speaking on December 17, 2024. (Source: JTBC News/YouTube/Screenshot) He claimed Seoul would “manage the economy as stably as possible” by “gathering all the capabilities of the public and private sectors.” South Korean lawmakers have recently claimed to have issued an “all-stop” or pause on all crypto-related legislation following the political chaos of early December. Yoon declared martial law on December 3, only for lawmakers to force their way into parliament and overturn his decision. Impeachment Ruling Lawmakers have since voted to impeach the President. But the ruling is yet to be ratified by the constitutional court. Yoon has been suspended pending a verdict, with the People’s Power Party faction de facto ruling the nation in his stead.

(Source: CoinGecko) Choi responded to questions from the media on December 18, with one journalist asking him about US President-elect Donald Trump’s “position on strategic crypto reserves.” “Since the specific details of the strategic cryptoasset proposal from President-elect Trump have not been revealed yet, this is not the time to evaluate it. We plan to prepare a response and other measures when the new US administration takes office. We will act after these and other and new proposals related to cryptoassets become concrete.” Choi Sang-mok, South Korea’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Strategy and Finance Crypto Tax Delay The Deputy Prime Minister also spoke about the National Assembly’s recent vote to delay the launch of crypto tax to 2027. He explained: “The government is not negative on cryptoassets. As regulations and related systems are still in their infancy, we decided to defer [the crypto tax launch]. Because we judged that it would be appropriate to monitor the progress [of regulations] before we introduce taxation.” Trading volumes on the South Korean crypto exchange platform Upbit over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Choi further claimed that the central Bank of Korea, financial regulators, and “other related authorities” are currently “preparing new regulatory policies” for the crypto sector. He said these focus “not only on customer protection,” but also on “the legal nature” of crypto. And Choi said these parties were also looking at more “general” issues on “how to regulate this sector domestically.” “Everything has happened at lightning speed from beginning to end.""

The People’s Power Party has faced stiff opposition from the Democratic Party, which has a large majority in the National Assembly.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-18 23:36:00

After hitting a local top of $1.32, ADA retraced over 30%, dropping to $0.91 before returning to a critical support level. This price action has left investors speculating whether the current recovery marks the start of a new bullish phase or simply a temporary pause before further downside. Related Reading: Solana Monthly Chart ‘Looks Ready For A Monster Run’ – Details Top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared key insights on X, leveraging Santiment metrics to shed light on whale activity driving Cardano’s market movements. According to Martinez, large ADA holders began taking profits as the price rallied from $1.15 to $1.33. However, the story shifted dramatically as ADA dropped below $1, with whales accumulating again at the $0.91, signaling renewed confidence in the token’s potential. With whale activity and market dynamics heating up, Cardano has returned to a pivotal price range that could define its trajectory in the coming weeks. Investors are now closely watching whether this accumulation phase will fuel a sustainable rally or if further consolidation lies ahead for ADA. One thing is certain—Cardano remains a token to watch as volatility continues to shape its price action. Data Reveals Cardano Whales Behavior The past few weeks have been highly volatile for Cardano (ADA), reflecting the broader market’s unpredictable movements and the strategic plays of smart money. ADA has become a focal point for large investors making calculated moves as the market evolves. Top analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted data from Santiment that underscores the pivotal role of whale activity in shaping ADA’s price action. Martinez revealed that Cardano whales began offloading their holdings as the price rallied from $1.15 to $1.33, locking in significant profits. However, as the price dropped sharply to $0.91, these same whales re-entered the market, purchasing an impressive 160 million ADA during the dip. This buying spree has sparked optimism, suggesting that smart money views Cardano as bullish over the coming months. Such activity often indicates confidence in the asset’s potential to rebound and possibly outperform. However, it’s crucial to consider an alternative perspective. This accumulation phase might also serve as a short-term liquidity strategy designed to attract retail investors into ADA, potentially setting the stage for another wave of profit-taking by larger holders. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Load Up: Bullish Sign Or Bear Trap? As ADA hovers near critical levels, its next moves will likely depend on how these dynamics unfold. Whether this is a prelude to a sustained rally or a tactical maneuver by smart money, Cardano remains a key asset to watch in the weeks ahead. Price Holding Above $1 Cardano (ADA) is trading at $1.04, marking a swift recovery after spending only a few days below the critical $1 mark last week. This rebound showcases strong buying interest around the $1 level, which has historically acted as a psychological and technical support zone. If ADA manages to sustain its position above $1 in the coming days, the next target lies around $1.20—a price level that previously triggered significant selling pressure. Reclaiming this level would confirm bullish momentum and signal buyers are ready to challenge higher resistance zones. For ADA bulls to maintain momentum and drive the price higher, breaking and consolidating above the $1.20 mark is crucial. This would demonstrate the market’s strength and potentially pave the way for a broader rally. However, failing to claim $1.20 could result in another period of consolidation or even a pullback, as sellers may step in to defend this resistance level.

However, experts like Nic Carter caution that its volatility could destabilize the global financial system. Despite these risks, Bitcoin’s growing adoption suggests it could play a larger role in future finance if the Government adopts it. Bitcoin has become an investment and a potential store of value. As governments and states explore new ways to hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, one of the best ways is the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Several U.S. states are now considering Bitcoin as a reserve asset, which could alter how financial systems operate. Bitcoin as a Financial Asset Unlike traditional currencies Bitcoin isn’t controlled by any government or central authority. Over the years, Bitcoin has grown with both retail and institutional investors considering it as an alternative investment. Some see Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, a store of value, and even a potential future currency. In recent times, even governments and large corporations are starting to take notice of Bitcoin’s potential as Reserve. One of Bitcoin’s biggest supporters has been Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy. Saylor has purchased about 439,000 Bitcoins which is about$46 billion worth for his company’s treasury. This sets an example for other companies and governments to consider Bitcoin a reserve asset. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Interest from U.S. States Ohio has recently introduced a proposal for a “Bitcoin Reserve Fund,” which is allowing the state to purchase Bitcoin as part of its investment strategy. Recently, El Salvador and the Central African Republic have both adopted Bitcoin as an official legal tender. Companies like Metaplanet also adopts Bitcoin reserve as an asset, As this follows from other states of U.S. like Pennsylvania and Texas, which have also proposed laws to create Bitcoin reserves. In Ohio, House Republican Leader Derek Merrin introduced the Ohio Bitcoin Reserve Act (HB 703) in December 2024. This bill would give the Ohio State Treasurer the authority to buy Bitcoin, protecting against the devaluation of the U.S. dollar. Merrin stated, “The U.S. Dollar is being rapidly devalued, and our State Treasurer should have the authority and flexibility to invest in Bitcoin when determining proper asset allocation.” As Bitcoin offers strong potential as a reserve asset due to its deflationary nature, with a fixed supply of 21 million coins making it a hedge against inflation. It ensures security and independence from political or banking instability. Bitcoin also provides diversification for state reserves, which is reducing reliance on traditional assets. Risks and Challenges of a Bitcoin Reserve Nic Carter, founding partner of Castle Island Ventures recently in Bloomberg expressed concerns about the potential adoption of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset during an interview on Bloomberg TV. He argued that such a move could undermine global confidence in the US dollar, which is the most important of the current financial system. Carter stated, “I don’t think this is going to happen because it would erode confidence in the dollar, and that would be a negative outcome for everyone involved.” He also believes that using Bitcoin as a reserve asset could cause more problems than benefits. He pointed out that Bitcoin’s price can be very unstable, which could create issues for the global financial system, which currently depends on the stable US dollar. He said, “This is not a good idea because it could lead to volatility and instability in global markets.” As Bitcoin becomes more popular, it’s important for policymakers and financial institutions to think about these risks. As we all know the main problems with using Bitcoin as a reserve asset is its price volatility. Bitcoin’s value can change dramatically in a short period. For example, in 2021, its price went from nearly $70,000 to around $30,000. This kind of price swing makes Bitcoin an unstable choice for governments, as it could lead to unexpected losses if its value drops suddenly. Another issue is the lack of clear regulations around Bitcoin as he mentioned. Recently, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently said that nothing to do with Bitcoin that there are no laws governing its use. So, the market reacted all of a sudden when Powell’s comments. That led to a sudden drop in Bitcoin’s value from $107,00 to $101,300. So, Bitcoin can be a risky asset for governments, as sudden changes in the market can lead to financial instability for investors. Possible Futures for Bitcoin R eserves Matt, Bitwise CIO said that in an interview by December 2025, Bitcoin will likely surpass $200,000. He highlights three key things could support for the rally, ETFs, public companies like MicroStrategy, and even governments buying Bitcoin. As Matt puts it, “there’s just too much demand, not enough supply,” which he believes that will make the price higher. Also, Matt argues that we’re still in the early stages of this journey. As he said, “if we do get a Bitcoin strategic reserve where the government is buying Bitcoin… you’re going to be looking at three, four, $500,000 Bitcoin.” Although he still thinks the odds are less than 50%, but it could gain traction especially with the support from key leaders. He added, If the U.S. government starts holding Bitcoin as a reserve, its price could go up by reaching $300,000 to $500,000. While this is just an idea. Some U.S. states like Ohio, Texas, and Pennsylvania are thinking about holding Bitcoin as part of their reserves, hoping it could protect against inflation. But its price swings and lack of clear rules are big concerns.

PlayStation’s lead architect, Mark Cerny, who first introduced the PS5 Pro in September, announced on Wednesday that the two companies were creating a deeper collaboration to work on “machine learning-based technology for graphics and gameplay.” Sony wants to improve game graphics According to an article by The Verge , the two companies already have an existing partnership on the PS5 Pro and PS5 Pro’s GPUs based on AMD’s RDNA 2 architecture. The article further explains that PS5Pro uses a feature called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) to improve image clarity and frame rates. The new GPU is a combination of what was already offered on the PS5 with, according to Engadget , some cherry-picked features from the more advanced RDNA3 architecture that AMD introduced in 2022. That’s paired with ray tracing techniques that Cerny says in a video are from future RDNA tech on AMD’s roadmap and custom machine learning features created for the PS5 pro. The machine learning components are also reportedly a crucial part of AMD and Sony’s future work together. In the 37-minute presentation , Cerny explained the technical aspects of the PS5 Pro and other additional information about the “multi-year” project with AMD which is codenamed “Amethyst.” “And I’m honored to announce that we have begun a deeper collaboration with a focus on machine learning-based technology for graphics and gameplay,” said Cerny. Although he did not give the finer details about when and where the Project Amethyst tech will be used, it appears like something the market could see on the next PlayStation and other future hardware of which AMD is a part of. “These components should be key in increasing the richness of game graphics.” Cerny. According to Cerny, the two firms have two goals with Project Amethyst. “The first goal is a more ideal architecture for machine learning,” explained Cerny, adding the second goal is to develop “a set of high-quality CNNs for graphics.” “Both SIE and AMD will independently have the ability to draw from this collection of network architectures and training strategies, and these components should be key in increasing the richness of game graphics as well as enabling more extensive use of ray tracing and path tracing,” added Cerny. The technology should extend beyond PlayStation The collaboration between them is a culmination of the companies’ desire to push gaming tech even further. Additionally, the collaboration is expected to improve on what PlayStation has already accomplished with SP5 Pro, with their results starting to show with future console iterations like the inevitable PS6. Cerny explained that both Sony and AMD do not want the technology to be exclusive to PlayStation but to be used “broadly across PC and console cloud.” “Through this technology collaboration we’re looking to support broad work and machine learning across a variety of devices,” said Cerny. In the video, Cerny further discussed three specific areas and their future potential growth – rasterized rendering, ray tracing, and machine learning. According to Cerny, out of the three areas, rasterized rendering has the lowest potential for growth with improvements coming from using larger GPU or faster memory. Ray tracing has growth potential as the technology is still new and the tech is expected to see “quantum leaps” in the next decade, while machine learning has the greatest growth potential, which explains which it is the current focus for AMD and Sony. In his presentation, Cerny also highlighted chances were high the market might not see hardware that uses technology from Project Amethyst until PlayStation 6, since creating a console is “roughly a four-year journey.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",AI|PlayStation 5|Sony,EN,0,0,MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-19 00:06:04

In fact, with fresh presales, community-driven projects, and new use cases, the meme coin scene is evolving into something much bigger than a passing trend. If you’re looking for the best meme coins to invest in December 2024, then you’re in luck. This December, three meme coins stand out from the crowd: BTFD Coin (with a raging presale that gathered $4.1 million so far), Turbo, and COQ Inu. Each of these projects is packing a serious punch in terms of potential, utility, and community support. Let’s dive into why analysts are so optimistic about these coins and why they could make great investments before the year wraps up. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin That’s Making Waves As we approach the end of 2024, BTFD Coin continues to generate massive buzz in the meme coin market. The best meme coin to invest in December 2024 just might be this one, thanks to its explosive presale, highly engaged community, and features that make it a standout in the meme space. Currently in Stage 12 of its presale, BTFD Coin is priced at $0.00013, having raised over $4.1 million. The presale has been a total success, with over 56 billion tokens sold and 5,900+ Bulls holding tokens already. For investors looking to capitalise on this presale opportunity, here’s an investment scenario to consider: If you were to invest $7,000 at the current presale price of $0.00013, you’d be able to snag an impressive 53.8 million BTFD tokens. Now, if the price increases to $0.0006 post-presale (which many analysts are predicting), that $7,000 investment could skyrocket to $32,300. That’s over 460% growth—and it’s all thanks to the strong foundation and massive community backing BTFD Coin. BTFD Coin’s ecosystem also includes staking rewards, offering one of the highest APYs in the meme coin space (think 90%+). This creates an additional layer of opportunity for investors to grow their holdings even more. Add in the fact that BTFD Coin has a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that ties in directly with its ecosystem, and you’ve got a meme coin with long-term potential far beyond just its presale. Turbo: A Meme Coin Changing the Game with TurboChain Turbo was born from an AI-generated meme coin idea, and it has evolved into something far more significant thanks to the launch of TurboChain. This Layer-1 blockchain is set to support decentralised finance (DeFi) applications, blockchain-based games, and much more, giving Turbo a huge edge in terms of real-world use. The collaboration between Aurora Labs and NEAR Protocol has paved the way for TurboChain to support fast transactions and scale well beyond what most other blockchains are capable of. This will be a game-changer for developers looking to create decentralised apps (dApps) on TurboChain, which has been designed with customisability in mind. Developers can now innovate quicker and more efficiently than ever before. Turbo’s market cap sits at $690 million, and it’s listed on major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, and KuCoin. What’s more, all gas fees on TurboChain will be paid in Turbo tokens, which further increases the utility and demand for this coin. The combination of high demand for transactions, increasing blockchain usage, and an expanding ecosystem means that Turbo is one of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. Additionally, analysts are predicting big things for Turbo in 2025, with the price forecasted to rise from its current value of $0.06049 to around $0.10 by mid-2025. COQ Inu: The Meme Coin with Community Power and Strong Personality COQ Inu has developed a strong presence on the AVAX blockchain, making it one of the most popular meme coins on the network. With a $138 million market cap and a circulating supply of 69.42 trillion tokens, COQ Inu may have taken a slight dip recently (down 11.16% in the last 24 hours), but this is precisely why some investors are jumping in to buy the dip. COQ Inu was founded by respected members of the community who initially placed the entire coin supply with 150 AVAX in liquidity. The team has fully renounced the contract and burned liquidity, ensuring a strong foundation for long-term growth. What makes COQ Inu particularly interesting is its community-oriented nature and meme culture. The token’s personality revolves around fun, light-hearted branding that has struck a chord with meme coin enthusiasts, helping to establish it as a cult favourite. While COQ Inu doesn’t have the same kind of groundbreaking utility as Turbo or BTFD Coin, its growing presence on top exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, and Gate.io has cemented it as a meme coin worth watching. Additionally, with a price currently sitting at $0.000002, there’s room for big gains should the price rebound and continue upwards in the coming months. Conclusion: The Best Meme Coins to Invest in December 2024 BTFD Coin’s massive presale success, Turbo’s powerful blockchain tech, and COQ Inu’s tight-knit community all combine to make them the meme coins you’ll want to add to your portfolio this month. Whether you’re diving into BTFD Coin’s presale or taking advantage of Turbo’s Layer-1 blockchain development, these meme coins are primed for major growth. Don’t wait too long—these coins are already turning heads, and there’s plenty of room for price action as we head into 2025. Time to get in before the next big wave!

The Fed cut interest rates by 25bps but pushed back against expectations for a continuation of rapid interest rate cuts in 2025. What just happened? The Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points which is exactly what 97% of market participants wanted. But, the S&P 500 just posted its largest post-Fed drop since March 2020, erasing $1.8 TRILLION of market cap. Why? Let us explain. (a thread) — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 18, 2024 Despite the sharp intra-day decline, the Dogecoin price is holding above support in the form of the 50DMA and its recent range lows around $0.35 for now. After such a strong rally in recent weeks since Donald Trump’s election victory in early November, some are concerned that a deeper retracement could be on the cards in the short term. $0.33-35 has been a key level for Dogecoin going all the way back to mid-2021. Should this level go, the Dogecoin price would be at risk of a sharp dump back towards its early 2024 highs in the $0.23 area. While Dogecoin investors might need to brace for a short-term market dip, there remains plenty of reason to be optimistic on the cryptocurrency’s chances for 2025. Here’s why. Bullish Dogecoin Price Outlook for 2025 – When Will DOGE Hit $1? Dogecoin has two main factors that are playing in its favor. Firstly, the arrival of the Trump administration and a new US Congress is expected to usher in a new golden age for the crypto industry in the US. Meanwhile, chatter about the establishment of a US strategic reserve in the US and in other major nations continues to grow. These combined factors suggest there is massive potential for price growth ahead for major cryptocurrencies – as the number one meme coin, Dogecoin is in a prime position to benefit. Secondly, Dogecoin is inexorably tied into the new Trump administration, with Elon Musk’s new Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) named after it. Department of Government Efficiency pic.twitter.com/HFeHYNIkJN — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 7, 2024 Musk has been a long-term supporter and proponent of Dogecoin. The world’s largest meme coin is all but guaranteed to retain a leading portion of mind share in the meme coin market as Musk’s D.O.G.E. makes headlines, for better or for worse. So, assuming everything goes to plan – Bitcoin reserves are established and the crypto industry booms – in the coming years, it’s probably just a question of when, not if, Dogecoin hits $1. Analyzing Dogecoin’s relationship to Bitcoin during the last three market cycles can help us answer this question. During the past three market cycles, when Bitcoin (BTC) entered a new phase of price discovery (as it did in April 2017, December 2020 and just recently in November 2024), Dogecoin has always still been languishing well below its record highs. This time is no different. But during the past two market cycles, it only took the Dogecoin price between 1-3 months to catch up and break out to its own record highs. So, assuming history does repeat itself, a DOGE breakout could be coming as soon as early 2025, with $1 likely to be quickly hit. Does This Vote-to-Earn Meme Coin Have Even Bigger Upside Potential? Dogecoin could easily more than 2x in 2025 to hit $1. But there are many smaller, lesser-known meme coins that could post far larger gains. The team at crypto news.com keeps a close eye on the meme coin market as they hunt for high-potential projects. And one new meme coin they like a lot is an exciting new DAO-powered vote-to-earn meme coin called Flockerz (FLOCK) . One of the reasons analysts at crypto news.com are so excited about this token is the impressive pace at which is has been raising funds from earlier investors. Despite only launching a few weeks ago, Flockerz (FLOCK) has already attracted over $7 million from eager buyers. The Flock is growing day by day! 7M raised and this flocks here to stay! pic.twitter.com/a8gFhYt4P8 — Flockerz (@FlockerzToken) December 17, 2024 Couple that with its impressive social media metrics, and this token is looking like a meme coin that could really pop. With new meme coins like Fart Coin recently hitting a $1 billion market cap, the appetite for novel new meme coins appears elevated. FLOCK could easily become one of the best meme coins to launch in 2024. ClayBro outlines in the video below why he thinks the token has 25x potential.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-19 00:52:00

Despite recent downward pressures, several factors suggest a potential upward trajectory for the popular memecoin. #1 Dogecoin Bounces Off Key Support Level (1D Chart) Crypto analyst CRG (@MacroCRG) highlighted the resilience of Dogecoin and PEPE, another prominent memecoin, stating, “DOGE + PEPE both bouncing from important areas. The memecoin demise is greatly exaggerated IMO. Next leg up gonna take many by surprise.” CRG’s technical analysis reveals that DOGE has maintained a daily close above the critical support level of $0.385 for nine consecutive days, despite substantial selling pressure. Similarly, PEPE has sustained crucial support, indicating that the “memecoin season” might be making a comeback imminently. Related Reading: Ex-Hedge Fund Guru Bets Big On Dogecoin As ‘Core Crypto Bet’ For Dogecoin, the short-term resistance zone at $0.42 remains a pivotal level. CRG suggests that a break above this threshold could signal the onset of a new bull run, potentially catching many investors off guard. #2 Bullish Market Structure (4-Hour Chart) Further technical insight comes from crypto analyst Gonzo (@GonzoXBT), who provided a technical breakdown of Dogecoin’s price action. Gonzo explained, “DOGE 4H EMA100 -> acting as resistance 4H EMA200 -> acting as support. Until we flip 4H EMA100 we will just chop in between, don’t want to see it lose 4H EMA200 tho.” This analysis underscores the importance of the 4-hour exponential moving averages (EMAs) in determining short-term price movements. The 4H EMA100 currently serves as a resistance level, while the 4H EMA200 offers support. A sustained breach above the 4H EMA100 could facilitate an upward breakout, whereas a failure to maintain above the 4H EMA200 might lead to further consolidation or decline. #3 Trading Against The Crowd Crypto analyst Ali Martinez (@ali_charts) presented another bullish perspective on DOGE’s immediate outlook. He noted, “Market sentiment for Dogecoin has turned negative. It seems as if traders are getting impatient during the ongoing price consolidation!” Related Reading: Bull Flag Formation Puts Dogecoin Price As High As $2.15 This Cycle Martinez’s analysis, based on Santiment data, indicates a sharp decline in both search volume and Weighted Sentiment. Specifically, Weighted Sentiment has plummeted to its lowest point since mid-October, while search volume has dropped to levels not seen since early November. Martinez speculated on potential catalysts that could quickly reignite positive momentum for Dogecoin, referencing the establishment of the new US Department of Government Efficiency under the leadership of Elon Musk. He suggested, “Or you can wait the first POPULAR action of the Department of Government Efficiency.” #4 Liquidation Dynamics Indicate Potential Upside Adding another layer to the bullish thesis, crypto analyst Carlos Garcia Tapia (@CAGThe3rd) shared insights into the liquidation heatmap over the past three days, commenting, “FOMO longs just got liquidated on the 3D chart. DOGE.” The heatmap by Coinglass illustrates a significant liquidation of leveraged long positions clustered between $0.393 and $0.385 over the past two days. But there’s a bullish caveat: with the majority of longs now liquidated, the remaining liquidation cluster is positioned around the $0.42 mark. This setup suggests that Dogecoin could experience a bullish candle formation, potentially triggering further liquidations of bearish positions and propelling the price upward. Why? Because liquidation heatmaps are valuable tools in forecasting price movements as they reflect the underlying market liquidity and leverage dynamics. These heatmaps highlight where traders are most susceptible to forced liquidations, acting as psychological and technical barriers.

Pseudonymous analyst Inmortal tells his 221,100 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum’s two-hour chart looks similar to Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price action over the last two weeks. The analyst says that while Ethereum struggles to clear resistance at $4,000, he notes that BTC also had trouble breaching $100,000 for weeks before surging to new all-time highs. “Same price action, but with one difference. God candle after the breakout. ETH.” Source: Inmortal/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that ETH will surge close to its all-time high of $4,800 after the breakout. At time of writing, ETH is worth $3,892. The trader also has his radar locked on the memecoin Floki ( FLOKI ). According to the trader, FLOKI appears to be trading in a symmetrical triangle pattern and is gearing up to shatter the structure’s diagonal resistance en route to new record highs. “Second leg up – loading. New ATH – loading. Price discovery – loading. FLOKI.” Source: Inmortal/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that FLOKI will explode to a new all-time high of $0.00038. At time of writing, FLOKI is worth $0.000219. Looking at Solana ( SOL ), the trader sees the Ethereum rival bursting above its diagonal resistance to rally toward $300. “Something like this. SOL.” Source: Inmortal/X At time of writing, SOL is worth $222.60.

Among them, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has gained attention from analysts forecasting significant price gains in the current market cycle. Shiba Inu Expected to Break Previous Record A notable market analyst, Crypto Sheriff, has predicted that Shiba Inu could surpass its all-time high of $0.00008616, achieved during the 2020/2021 market cycle. In a post shared on December 15, the analyst stated that the outcome is inevitable, emphasizing the coin’s potential in the ongoing bullish trend. It is inevitable that #SHIB will break down ATH in this supercycle! pic.twitter.com/owuMMgpwoh — CRYPTO SHERIFF (@Gem_Sheriff) December 15, 2024 This prediction follows the asset’s impressive performance in November 2024, where the token rallied approximately 98% after the U.S. presidential election. Many believe Donald Trump’s victory signaled a crypto-friendly shift in U.S. policy, contributing to the token’s rise from $0.00001687 to $0.00003343. Meanwhile, the asset has retraced some gains and is trading at $0.00002682. Analysts Highlight Shiba Inu (SHIB) Bullish Patterns While Crypto Sheriff maintains a positive outlook, other analysts have provided additional technical insights supporting the possibility of a significant price increase. On December 10, CryptoELITES identified a bullish cup-and-handle formation on Shiba Inu’s weekly chart. The analyst noted that if the token breaks above a long-standing downtrend line, it could potentially reach $0.0004729, marking a 1,700% increase from its current value. The downtrend, which has acted as a resistance level since October 2021, is considered a critical barrier. According to CryptoELITES, breaking through this resistance would confirm the bullish pattern and set the stage for a sustained upward trend. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Risk of Downside Movement Despite the optimism, some analysts have highlighted potential risks. As earlier reported by Times Tabloid, market commentator PouyanTradeFX warned that if Shiba Inu fails to overcome the downtrend, the token could significantly decline. In this scenario, prices might drop by as much as 150%, bringing SHIB to the $0.000011 range. Such contrasting analyses underscore the importance of closely monitoring technical indicators and market conditions. While many remain bullish, the outcome will largely depend on how the asset performs in the face of these key resistance levels. The asset’s recent performance and technical setups have fueled speculation about its potential to reach new highs. Analysts like Crypto Sheriff and CryptoELITES are optimistic about the token’s future, while others urge caution, emphasizing the importance of breaking resistance levels to confirm a bullish trend.

Despite meeting market expectations, the announcement sparked a significant selloff in equities and cryptocurrency markets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. The market’s negative reaction highlights concerns about the broader implications of the rate cut. Market Reaction to the Rate Cut Zero Hedge, a prominent financial news and analysis platform, posted the announcement on X stating “FED CUTS 25BPS AS EXPECTED.” FED CUTS 25BPS AS EXPECTED — zerohedge (@zerohedge) December 18, 2024 In response, user JP Friend 1 queried , “Why is market dumping on that news?” This question underscores confusion among retail and institutional investors, as rate cuts are traditionally viewed as supportive of financial markets. Another user, Bleeerg, offered an explanation stating “There is a theory that cutting rates after a period of raises means that there are issues with the economy and it marks the start of a recession.” Aron Meystedt, contributing to the discussion, provided historical context: “Yep. If you look at past charts over time for the major indices and overlay them with the fed funds rate, the stock drop (recession) happens AFTER the rates are dropped. It’s counterintuitive, but that’s the way it usually goes.” Historical Context and Recession Concerns The theory discussed by users aligns with historical patterns. During previous economic cycles, rate cuts following a prolonged tightening phase have often signaled underlying economic vulnerabilities. Policymakers typically lower rates to stimulate growth, but the decision can indicate that the economy has entered a period of contraction or is at risk of doing so. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This dynamic creates a paradox: while rate cuts reduce borrowing costs and aim to encourage investment, they can also signal that monetary authorities are bracing for economic downturns. Investors often react by selling risk assets, anticipating weaker earnings, reduced consumer spending, and tighter credit conditions. Cryptocurrency Market Impact The selloff was not limited to equities. Major cryptocurrencies also experienced sharp declines, with XRP down 9.8% in the past 24 hours, trading at $2.32. Meanwhile, Bitcoin , the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has fallen over 5% during the same period and currently trades at $100,700. Cryptocurrencies, often high-risk assets, tend to mirror the broader risk-off sentiment in financial markets. As fears of a potential recession grow, investors appear to be moving away from volatile assets and toward safer options such as bonds and cash. As the situation unfolds, investors will closely monitor upcoming economic data and Federal Reserve communications to assess the trajectory of monetary policy and its impact on global markets. For now, the reaction underscores the complex interplay between rate adjustments, market sentiment, and economic expectations.

In contrast to Web2’s centralized structure dominated by firms like Google and Facebook, Web3 grants users direct management of their digital interactions. Among the notable projects leveraging this shift are The Graph, Theta Network, and Web3Bay , each targeting distinct functionalities. The Graph is dedicated to decentralized data indexing for dApps, while Theta Network advances video streaming via decentralized bandwidth sharing. Nonetheless, these projects are somewhat niche in their focus. Web3Bay takes a broader approach by providing a decentralized e-commerce platform that amalgamates Web3 advantages including dual payment systems, community governance, and cross-chain functionality, establishing itself as a more comprehensive solution for blockchain-based commerce. Web3Bay: Spearheading Decentralized E-commerce in the Web3 Era Web3Bay distinguishes itself by pioneering a decentralized marketplace that transfers complete control of data and financial transactions back to the users. This approach starkly contrasts with that of traditional e-commerce behemoths like Amazon, which rely on intermediaries. By eliminating these middlemen, Web3Bay not only cuts down on costs but also enhances the privacy of its users. This empowers users with real ownership of their digital assets—a feature not seen in narrowly focused projects like The Graph and Theta. A standout feature of Web3Bay is its dual payment system, which accepts both cryptocurrencies and traditional payment methods such as PayPal. This flexibility makes it a bridge between the older Web2 and the new Web3, opening up the platform to both crypto enthusiasts and traditional users alike. This inclusive approach is absent in The Graph and Theta, making Web3Bay a uniquely accessible option in the marketplace. Another critical aspect of Web3Bay is its commitment to Community-Driven Governance via its DAO. This governance model allows 3BAY token holders to directly influence the platform’s direction by proposing and voting on initiatives, aligning the platform’s evolution with the desires of its community. Unlike The Graph and Theta, which do not facilitate such a level of user control, Web3Bay’s model promotes a genuinely decentralized approach, giving it a distinct advantage in the competitive landscape. The Graph: Specializing in Decentralized Data Indexing The Graph is tailored for managing blockchain data specifically for decentralized applications. By allowing developers to effectively query across multiple blockchain platforms, it becomes a fundamental tool for DeFi and NFT projects, where swift access to on-chain data is crucial. However, The Graph’s functionality is primarily confined to data indexing, serving a pivotal yet narrow role. In contrast, Web3Bay extends its reach into the broader aspects of the Web3 landscape, covering decentralized commerce and governance. This not only enriches the platform’s utility but also makes it a more holistic solution for users. While The Graph does a stellar job at enhancing data accessibility, it stops short of engaging in the broader, dynamic realms of commerce and governance where Web3Bay excels and truly makes a difference. Theta Network: Innovating Decentralized Video Streaming Theta Network is crafted to transform video streaming by leveraging a decentralized network that cuts down on bandwidth costs and boosts the quality of content delivery. Users can share their bandwidth and receive rewards in return, creating a sustainable and community-supported content distribution network. This model is especially advantageous for content creators as it lowers operational costs and improves the quality of streams. Yet, Theta’s dedication to just content streaming might limit its utility in other areas. On the flip side, Web3Bay extends its functionality by integrating decentralized storage solutions, automated payments through smart contracts, and a scalable infrastructure that supports a broad spectrum of e-commerce activities. This flexibility makes Web3Bay a more comprehensive platform. Additionally, Web3Bay ‘s forward-looking initiatives to explore NFTs and DeFi sectors significantly widen its scope, providing opportunities for users to create, purchase, and trade a variety of digital assets, moving beyond mere content. Why Web3Bay Surpasses The Graph & Theta Web3Bay’s emphasis on decentralization and scalability positions it above The Graph and Theta. By integrating dual payment options and fostering community governance, Web3Bay promotes a user-centric approach in line with Web3’s foundational values. Utilizing smart contracts and decentralized storage through IPFS, Web3Bay enhances security and operational efficiency, presenting an all-encompassing solution for digital commerce. Its scalable architecture, featuring Layer-1 with Layer-2 rollups, ensures low fees and rapid transactions, offering a user experience that outshines The Graph’s data indexing and Theta’s streaming capabilities. With plans to expand into NFTs and DeFi, Web3Bay demonstrates its commitment to leading a comprehensive Web3 ecosystem, transcending the limited functionalities of its competitors. Key Insights Web3Bay’s integration of e-commerce, community governance, and scalable infrastructure cements its status as a frontrunner among Web3 projects. While The Graph specializes in data indexing and Theta excels in streaming, Web3Bay’s extensive capabilities in commerce, payments, and governance render it a more influential and adaptable platform. With its user-centric, decentralized marketplace and diverse payment options, alongside future expansions into NFTs and DeFi, Web3Bay is not just keeping up with the Web3 evolution but actively driving the next wave of blockchain integration.

XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, recently surpassed Tether (USDT). Analysts and investors alike are growing excited about the possibility for XRP holders to become among the wealthiest investors in the foreseeable future, as indicated by the recent spike. Related Reading: Solana Poised For Growth In 2025 With Record $173 Million Q3 Funding—Report Potential Price Forecasts An analyst has expressed an audacious outlook for XRP, indicating that those who retain the asset may experience substantial returns, which could result in life-changing wealth in the near future. He anticipates a significant increase in the price of the altcoin, with the goal of reaching a price point between $30 and $35 by 2025. #XRP HOLDERS WILL BE THE RICHEST PEOPLE YOU KNOW – HERE’S WHY! pic.twitter.com/k0tc6tCAq0 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 17, 2024 Based on this estimate, the present price of approximately $2.54 is expected to experience a staggering increase of around 1,277%. A $1,000 investment, for example, may potentially increase to $14,000 if these objectives are accomplished. It is also possible that those who have made larger investments will have the opportunity to become millionaires as the value of XRP continues to climb. This optimism is perpetuated by recent fluctuations in prices. In the last 30 days, XRP registered a solid 124% increase, which coincided with a successful retest of its 2021 peak of $1.97. According to analysts, the demand for the crypto will continue to rise as Ripple expands its partnerships throughout Asia and beyond, further driving up its price. Causes Of Wealth Formation The positive outlook for XRP is due to a number of reasons. Investors have a lot more faith in Ripple now that its legal fight with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been settled. Legal certainty is about to arrive, hence many people believe that using XRP in worldwide banking will hasten the adoption. Since big financial institutions see Ripple’s technology’s ability to transform cross-border payments, institutional interest in it is also piquing. Some wealth managers suggests that XRP has the potential to revolutionize international payments in a manner similar to that of early Amazon. They anticipate a future in which XRP processes trillions of transactions daily, which could result in a price increase of an astonishing $132—a preposterous 23,900% from its current level.

Although forecasts are hopeful, they are not guaranteed since the market for cryptocurrencies is somewhat erratic. Analysts emphasize the need of realizing gains as prices rise instead of waiting for a climax that might never come to pass. Their advice for investors: make wise judgments and closely check price swings.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-19 02:14:04

With a near 4% price increase, Ripple is once again proving its ability to innovate in the cross-border payments space. Meanwhile, Binance Coin (BNB) remains a pillar of the crypto market, raising discussions about its long-term security and investment potential, especially as the Binance ecosystem continues to dominate. But the real dark horse in this conversation is Qubetics ($TICS) . While established giants like XRP and BNB focus on pushing boundaries in their respective domains, Qubetics is tackling crypto’s usability challenge head-on. By creating a non-custodial wallet that simplifies transactions and integrates seamlessly with Apple Pay and Google Pay, Qubetics is making crypto accessible to everyone. Let’s explore why these three projects are among the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024 and how they’re leading the charge for blockchain innovation. Qubetics: Making Crypto Usable for Everyone Let’s be honest—crypto can be daunting for newcomers. Complex wallets, unpredictable market swings, and high fees often keep people at bay. Qubetics is here to change all that with a wallet that makes using crypto as easy as tapping your phone . Imagine you’re a small business owner, and a customer pays you in Ethereum. Usually, you’d need to convert that crypto into fiat, track exchange rates, and hope the market doesn’t crash. With Qubetics, payments are automatically converted at the point of sale . Whether you’re a freelancer working internationally or a café owner in New York, Qubetics makes transactions seamless and stress-free. What sets Qubetics apart is its smart contract conversion mechanism, which shields users from crypto market volatility. Plus, it works across iOS, Android, and desktop, integrating with Apple Pay and Google Pay for ultimate convenience. It’s like bringing crypto into the real world without the headaches. Currently in Presale Phase 13, Qubetics has already sold over 355 million tokens and raised $7 million. At $0.0342 per token, $TICS is a steal. But act fast—the next phase brings a 10% price hike, with the final phase promising a 20% increase. After presale, the price is set to hit $0.25, delivering a jaw-dropping 900% ROI. If you’re looking for the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024, Qubetics is a must-watch. Ripple: The Cross-Border Payment Innovator Ripple (XRP) has long been a trailblazer in the crypto space, and its recent launch of the RLUSD stablecoin proves it’s not slowing down. Designed to enhance cross-border payment efficiency, RLUSD is Ripple’s latest move to solidify its role as a leader in global finance. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) network continues to expand, with partnerships across the banking and payments industries. This network allows XRP to act as a bridge currency, enabling near-instantaneous transactions at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. For global businesses, this is a game changer. Regulatory clarity in key markets like the U.S. is also boosting investor confidence. Ripple’s recent legal victories have positioned XRP as one of the most resilient cryptos, even amid market volatility. For retail investors, XRP offers both utility and long-term growth potential. If you’re searching for the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024, Ripple’s innovation in cross-border payments makes it a strong contender. Whether you’re an enterprise or a casual investor, XRP continues to prove its relevance in an evolving crypto landscape. Binance Coin: The Backbone of the Binance Ecosystem Binance Coin (BNB) is more than just a cryptocurrency—it’s the fuel powering the Binance ecosystem. As the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance relies on BNB for everything from transaction fee discounts to staking opportunities, making it a cornerstone of the crypto market. Security has been a hot topic for BNB, with analysts debating its long-term viability. But one thing’s clear: Binance’s focus on compliance and security upgrades has strengthened investor trust. BNB’s deflationary model, driven by quarterly token burns, ensures a steady decrease in supply, boosting its value over time. The Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is another reason why BNB is a must-watch. With its low fees and fast transactions, BSC has become a hub for DeFi projects, NFTs, and dApps. This growing ecosystem ensures that BNB remains relevant, even as new competitors enter the market. For investors eyeing the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024, Binance Coin offers a mix of utility, security, and growth potential. Whether you’re using it on Binance or staking it for rewards, BNB is a reliable pick for any portfolio. Wrapping It Up The blockchain world is evolving, and Qubetics, Ripple, and Binance Coin are leading the way. Qubetics is making crypto accessible with its innovative wallet, Ripple is revolutionizing cross-border payments with RLUSD, and Binance Coin remains a pillar of the market with its expansive ecosystem. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics, Ripple, and Binance Coin as the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024 . These projects aren’t just shaping the future of blockchain—they’re setting the standard for what’s possible. Don’t miss your chance to invest in these groundbreaking opportunities.

With the year wrapping up, investors are scouring for projects that could bring both short-term value and long-term gains. Recently, Qubetics, Solana, and Binance Coin have captured attention due to their impressive developments and growing communities. Qubetics ($TICS) continues to make headlines, having secured over 10,600 token holders holding more than 355 million tokens in its presale. Meanwhile, Solana is riding a wave of institutional adoption, and Binance Coin is fostering groundbreaking innovations on the Binance ecosystem. Let’s take a closer look at why these three stand out as the best coins to join in December 2024. Qubetics Sets the Stage with Over 10,600 Token Holders Qubetics ($TICS) is breaking barriers as the world’s first web3 aggregator , solving major interoperability issues in the blockchain space. At the heart of its ecosystem is its decentralised VPN (dVPN), a revolutionary solution designed to provide enhanced privacy, security, and unrestricted internet access. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on centralised servers, Qubetics’ dVPN operates on a peer-to-peer network, ensuring user data remains private and resistant to surveillance. For example, journalists working in regions with heavy censorship can use Qubetics’ dVPN to access information securely without the fear of government intrusion. Businesses that handle sensitive data across borders can also benefit, as the dVPN reduces the risks associated with centralised systems and potential data breaches. Currently, Qubetics is in its 13th presale phase, where tokens are priced at $0.0342 each. Each presale stage concludes every Sunday at midnight, bringing a 10% price increase. So far, the presale has attracted over 10,600 holders , with more than 355 million $TICS tokens sold, raising over $7 million. Analysts are bullish on its future, predicting that $TICS could reach $15 after its mainnet launch. For example, an investment of $400,000 today could deliver life-changing returns if these predictions hold true. You can learn more about this project by watching the video here . Solana Gains Momentum with New Staking Opportunities Solana continues to reinforce its reputation as one of the fastest and most scalable blockchain networks. Recent developments highlight growing institutional interest and innovative solutions within its ecosystem. A major boost came with Bitwise launching a Solana staking ETP (exchange-traded product) in Europe, offering an impressive 6.48% yield to institutional investors. This move not only improves accessibility to Solana but also reinforces its position in the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector. Adding to the momentum, the recent launch of the Solaxy ICO, a Layer 2 project built on Solana, raised over $750,000 in its first 72 hours. This demonstrates the strong investor demand for projects leveraging Solana’s high-speed, low-cost network. These developments position Solana as a serious contender for both short-term and long-term gains, making it one of the best coins to join in December 2024. Binance Coin Powers Innovation Across the Blockchain Space Binance Coin (BNB) remains a key player in driving blockchain adoption through its robust ecosystem. As the native token of the Binance exchange, BNB supports numerous applications, including transaction fee reductions, staking, and the Binance Launchpad. Recently, Binance Launchpad facilitated the listing of Simon’s Cat (CAT) on its spot market, resulting in a remarkable 50% price increase within 48 hours. The listing reflects Binance’s ability to propel promising projects into the spotlight and generate strong market interest. In addition, Binance’s continued efforts to diversify offerings through its HODLer Airdrop Program have further engaged its community, distributing tokens of newly listed projects to loyal holders. This proactive approach fosters innovation and cements Binance Coin’s importance in the blockchain ecosystem. With its consistent utility and support for emerging technologies, Binance Coin is undoubtedly one of the best coins to join in December 2024. Conclusion: Qubetics, Solana, and Binance Coin Shine Bright As 2024 comes to a close, Qubetics, Solana, and Binance Coin offer exciting opportunities for crypto investors. Qubetics has already attracted 10,600 token holders and sold 355 million $TICS tokens, with analysts predicting an extraordinary surge to $15 post-mainnet launch. Meanwhile, Solana is gaining institutional traction with new staking opportunities and a successful Layer 2 ICO. Binance Coin remains a cornerstone of blockchain innovation, driving projects that generate real value for investors. For those looking to position themselves for growth, these projects are the best coins to join in December 2024. Now is the time to research, evaluate, and make informed moves in the dynamic world of crypto.

A potential reason for this drop is the recent Federal Reserve rate cut meeting. Reason Behind the Crypto Market Decline During the conference, the Federal Reserve announced an interest rate ceiling of 4.50%, aligning with expectations, compared to the previous rate of 4.75%. Jerome Powell made a bold statement on cryptocurrency that significantly impacted the overall market. In a statement, Powell noted that we are not allowed to own Bitcoin and have no desire to change the laws. This statement by the Fed chief shows that the U.S. central bank has no interest or intention to support a scenario where the government would accumulate a significant amount of Bitcoin. Regarding the legal issues surrounding Bitcoin ownership, Powell stated, “That’s the kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed.” The idea of creating a so-called “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” appears to be failing, as the Federal Reserve has no intention of participating in such an initiative until President-elect Donald Trump takes office. This indicates that central banks are distancing themselves from holding large amounts of Bitcoin, unlike gold reserves. Federal Reserve’s Meeting Impacted Crypto Prices These statements by Powell have caused a significant downturn in the overall cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency, dropped by over 6.5%, falling below $100,000 after reaching the $108,000 mark. Meanwhile, other assets, including Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE), experienced price declines of 5.5%, 14.20%, 9.45%, and 11.5%, respectively. Additionally, this notable price decline in the crypto market occurred following Powell’s statement.",News|Crypto news|Fed,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|FIAT|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-19 02:46:30

Williams, a widely followed market observer, detailed his projection in a recent post on X . He also provided price targets for other leading altcoins. My Altcoin Prediction by January 1st – $ETH $5,325 – $XRP $3.10 – $FTM $4.25 – $HEART $0.20 – $IOTA $0.9 – $DOP $0.01 – $DOT $20 – $SEI $1.50 – $SOL $310 – $Pepe $1.00 What would you add to this list? — Jason A. Williams (@GoingParabolic) December 16, 2024 XRP Price Target Set at $3.10 Williams estimates that the token will reach $3.10 by January 1, 2025, marking a 31% increase from its current price of $2.36. Achieving this level within 13 days would solidify XRP’s market capitalization at approximately $170 billion, up from its current valuation of $135.36 billion. Such growth would maintain the token’s status as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The analyst also outlined price projections for several other altcoins. According to him, Ethereum could trade at $5,325, Solana at $310, Polkadot at $20, and Pepe at $1 by the same date. Although Williams did not specify the factors that might push the token to $3.10, several industry trends and developments could play a role in driving its value higher. Key among these is progress in the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Favorable rulings or settlements could boost investor confidence and increase institutional adoption of XRP. Additionally, the rapid adoption of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin could be another catalyst. Earlier this week, RLUSD’s introduction contributed to a 9% increase in XRP’s price , lifting it to $2.56. This followed a broader 20% price surge after the stablecoin received regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Significant adoption of RLUSD by major organizations or its listing on leading exchanges like Binance could further enhance the market performance in the coming weeks. Despite optimistic predictions, the token has faced challenges in reaching the $3 threshold. The last time the token surpassed this level was the 2017-2018 bull market, peaking at an all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Recent attempts have seen the asset approach this milestone without success. Earlier this month, XRP climbed to $2.86 on December 3 but encountered strong resistance, dropping to $1.90 shortly after. The cryptocurrency has since recovered, trading above $2 again and reaching $2.72 before falling back to its current price of $2.36 amid a market-wide correction. Recent Market Activity The digital asset initially saw a significant increase in trading activity, with its 24-hour trading volume rising by 54.25% to $19.23 billion. This surge in activity contributed to XRP overtaking Tether (USDT) as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization earlier this week. While Jason Williams’ projection of the asset reaching $3.10 by January 2025 may appear conservative compared to other forecasts, the target is achievable if key developments align in Ripple’s favor. Factors such as institutional interest, increased adoption of Ripple’s products, and progress in the SEC lawsuit could all support the token’s growth. However, market resistance at critical price levels remains a challenge, and traders should carefully monitor market conditions before making investment decisions.

Recent developments, like Shiba Inu’s forthcoming liquid staking upgrade and Dogecoin’s bullish technical indicators, highlight the evolving opportunities in this space. At the centre of this buzz is BTFD Coin , a standout newcomer with a booming presale that has captured the attention of meme coin enthusiasts worldwide. As we dive into these three projects, you’ll see why they rank among the best meme coins to invest in this month . From BTFD Coin’s presale milestones to Shiba Inu’s ecosystem expansion and Dogecoin’s market activity, there’s a lot to unpack. BTFD Coin: Where Bulls Run Strong Have you been waiting for the right meme coin to join? BTFD Coin, the latest sensation, might just be the perfect opportunity. With over $4.1 million raised in its presale, this coin has proven it’s not just a fleeting trend but a potential game-changer in the crypto world. Currently in Stage 12 of its presale at $0.00013 per coin, BTFD has caught the attention of over 5,900 investors—or as they like to call themselves, “bulls”. But why the hype? For starters, BTFD isn’t just about fun memes—it’s about financial opportunity. Consider this: a $5,000 investment at the current presale price would yield nearly $23,077 when the coin hits its post-presale listing price of $0.0006. That’s the kind of ROI that investors dream of. BTFD goes beyond the typical meme coin playbook by offering a 90% APY staking reward. Imagine letting your investment grow passively while enjoying community perks and market buzz. Add to that the P2E gaming feature, where the beta version is already live, and you’ve got a coin that’s merging entertainment with tangible rewards. The power of BTFD lies in its strong community of bulls, who aren’t just investors but advocates of the coin. The project’s tagline—“Own the Dip”—resonates with crypto enthusiasts looking for a coin that understands market dynamics and offers long-term growth potential. Shiba Inu: Expanding Ecosystem with Liquid Staking Shiba Inu, one of the most recognised names in the meme coin space, continues to evolve beyond its humble beginnings. Currently trading at $0.00002564, SHIB’s price may be down 5.23% in the past 24 hours, but its trading volume has jumped 13.79%, reflecting active investor interest. The Shiba Inu team is gearing up for a major upgrade with the introduction of liquid staking on ShibaSwap. This feature will allow users to stake their SHIB tokens while maintaining liquidity. In simpler terms, you can earn staking rewards without locking up your tokens. Liquid tokens representing staked assets can be traded or used as collateral on other DeFi platforms, enhancing utility and flexibility for investors. The Shiba Inu ecosystem continues to expand with projects like the Shibarium blockchain and ongoing token burns. These efforts aren’t just about reducing supply but creating a robust ecosystem where SHIB becomes a go-to token for DeFi solutions. The introduction of liquid staking is another step in that direction, offering both active traders and long-term holders more value. Dogecoin: Signs of a Bullish Breakout As the original meme coin, Dogecoin has consistently held its ground in the crypto market. Currently trading at $0.3841, DOGE’s price is down 3.99% over the past 24 hours, but its one-month performance shows a modest 2.46% increase. Beneath this surface-level stability, however, technical indicators suggest a much bigger story. Dogecoin is in what analysts call an “accumulation phase,” where market activity hints at a potential breakout. The 200 EMA, a key technical indicator, signals that DOGE could soon enter a bullish phase. Combined with increased transactions and the movement of previously dormant tokens, these factors suggest that DOGE may be gearing up for a significant upward move. Despite being a meme coin, Dogecoin has proven its resilience and versatility over the years. From its integration into Tesla’s merchandise store to its widespread acceptance as a payment method, DOGE continues to hold a unique position in the market. With bullish signals and growing speculation, it’s no wonder investors are keeping a close eye on Dogecoin as one of the best meme coins to invest in this month. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin market is as vibrant as ever, with new opportunities emerging for savvy investors. BTFD Coin leads the charge with its record-breaking presale and innovative features, making it a must-watch for anyone looking to join the crypto bull run. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu is solidifying its ecosystem with game-changing upgrades like liquid staking, and Dogecoin is showing signs of a bullish breakout that could take it to new heights. If you’re looking to ride the wave of the best meme coins to invest in this month, these three projects offer unique opportunities for growth. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the action— join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your spot in what could be the next big meme coin success story.

Among the projects gaining traction, TON (The Open Network) stands out for its significant institutional adoption, setting a benchmark for others to follow. Now, Lightchain AI ($LCAI) is emerging as a game-changer, combining blockchain and artificial intelligence to drive innovation. As $LCAI continues to make waves, the spotlight is on its Lightchain AI Presale , offering early access to this transformative project. This article dives into the factors behind TON’s institutional success, explores what makes Lightchain AI unique, and assesses whether $LCAI can carve a similar path in the institutional space. Understanding TON’s Institutional Appeal TON has emerged as a blockchain platform designed for scalability, speed, and ease of use. Its appeal to institutions lies in its ability to address the limitations of traditional blockchains, such as slow transaction speeds and high costs. TON’s recent partnerships with leading financial institutions and enterprises highlight its potential to reshape the blockchain landscape. Key Factors Behind TON’s Adoption: Scalability: TON’s architecture supports millions of transactions per second (TPS), making it ideal for large-scale applications. Interoperability: The platform’s ability to integrate with existing systems allows institutions to adopt blockchain technology without overhauling their infrastructure. Developer Ecosystem: TON’s developer-friendly tools and APIs enable quick deployment of decentralized applications (dApps), attracting both startups and established enterprises. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborations with major players in finance and technology have bolstered TON’s credibility and accelerated its adoption. Regulatory Compliance: TON’s focus on transparency and adherence to regulatory standards makes it attractive to risk-averse institutions. Lightchain AI: A Unique Proposition While TON has excelled in creating a blockchain tailored for institutional use, Lightchain AI offers something fundamentally different: the integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) to solve real-world problems. $LCAI aims to transform industries by enabling decentralized, AI-driven solutions that combine the transparency of blockchain with the computational power of AI.

Amid this, Ethereum has recorded a 2.4% decrease in the past 24 hours with a current trading price of $3,858, marking a 21.1% decrease away from its all-time high of $4,878 seen in 2021. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Load Up: Bullish Sign Or Bear Trap? Ethereum Withdrawals from Binance Surpass 7.8 Million ETH Data from CryptoQuant reveals that approximately 20.8 million ETH have been withdrawn from centralized exchanges in the past two months, a trend reminiscent of the 2021 bull market. Binance has played a central role in this movement, accounting for over 7.8 million ETH, which represents 33-39% of the total outflows. These outflows could be indicative of investors accumulating ETH for long-term holding or staking purposes, as suggested by CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk. The analyst added: These significant outflows from Binance indicate the platform’s continued influence on the cryptocurrency market, especially in balancing supply and demand for Ethereum. Notably, Binance’s influence is particularly evident given its global user base of 250 million and a record $21.6 billion in deposits this year, according to Crazzyblockk. The substantial outflows from Binance align with bullish market sentiment, as large-scale withdrawals often signal investor confidence. These movements suggest that Ethereum holders are moving their assets off exchanges. This reduction in the available supply of ETH on exchanges can create upward pressure on prices, should demand remains consistent or grows. Etheruem Market Performance And Outlook Ethereum has so far been struggling to make significant price move to the upside ever since the latest crypto market bull run began months ago. Despite Bitcoin seeing consistent gains recording new all-time highs nearly every month, Ethereum has lacked enough upward momentum to push its price past the $4,000 barrier. It is worth noting that this sluggish performance from Ethereum comes amid the positive developments ongoing in the crypto space including the recent news of Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest lender reportedly working on its own layer-2 (L2) blockchain on Ethereum using ZKsync technology.

According to analysts, Ethereum could still likely see further correction in its price as bearish signals recently formed on its chart suggesting a potential drop to 3,400. $ETH has formed a bearish double top, with RSI showing bearish divergence and a MACD crossover confirming the trend. A short-term correction could bring it to $3,400, with major support at $3,200 and $3,000. #Ethereum #CryptoTrading #eth pic.twitter.com/iWaPh1vwrr — crypto vulture Trader 🦅 (@crypto_vulture1) December 18, 2024 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",Ethereum|crypto|cryptoquant|ETH|ethereum|Ethereum Market|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-19 03:30:47

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-19 03:40:00

Dogizen Prepares for Liftoff Amid A-Grade Partnerships,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/next-big-crypto-dogizen-prepares-for-liftoff-amid-a-grade-partnerships/,"The altcoin season we’ve all been waiting for has finally dropped, and there’s one token that’s looking like the next big crypto to 100x. Telegram gaming platform Dogizen has reeled in over $1.6m. And is offering those who invest today 41.56% in gains before the presale ends. With Dogizen being the first-ever Telegram ICO and benefiting from multiple partnerships with dynamite names in the Telegram space, 2025 is Dogizen’s for the taking. Here’s why. Why Dogizen is looking like 2025’s next big crypto Alongside the partnerships, the market for Telegram games is entering a golden age. The sector rocketed from essentially $0 last spring to over $1.5 billion in a matter of months. There are just a handful of players in this space, which means that almost every project is approaching blue-chip status. Sector leader Notcoin has cleared over $2 billion in market cap. And Catizen , a project whose market cap has cleared as much as +$200 million, has generated an average revenue per user 200x that of the average crypto project. Also, these projects are getting Binance listings faster than you can say CZ loves you. Makes sense—especially when you consider their insane ability to onboard new users thanks to their simple UX, easy accessibility via one of the world’s most popular messaging apps, and viral growth power due to them being easily referable between Telegram users. Plus, Telegram, in particular, is witnessing outsized growth right now. It’s nearly 1 billion users strong and is growing at a phenomenal rate. Especially in the developing world; African Telegram crypto communities have exploded by +180% since 2023 . How Dogizen improves on the competition Unlike the Notcoin/Hamster Kombat/Catizen cohort, Dogizen is holding an ICO instead of airdropping its tokens. Such a strategy resulted in all of Dogizen’s rivals seeing their token prices slump after launch. Dogizen’s ICO is designed to onboard the loyal. Getting buy-in before the token hits the open market encourages long-term holding, a key element of sustaining and pumping a token’s price. It’s also the only Telegram ICO in the messaging platform’s history. This means that Dogizen is being fed straight to Telegram’s nearly 1 billion strong audience. An audience that is already hyper-engaged with crypto and Web3. Dogizen partnerships are pouring extra gas into the tank From Telegram wallet Grindery to Telegram game SHARKS , Dogizen has teamed up with some of the best names in its space. Not only does this open Dogizen up to a 3 million+ audience, but it also gives Dogizen some juicy brand equity as it piggybacks on these big names. The crypto market has been forecast to triple in size next year. And it’s game-changing products in promising sectors such as Dogizen that are ready to see the outsized gains. You can buy DOGIZ on the official Dogizen website .",Press Release,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|ZRX|BNB|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-19 03:57:08

This $3 level has been a tough barrier for XRP, and the price hasn’t yet broken down the overall bullish trend, despite some short-term pullbacks. Right now, XRP is in a sideways consolidation phase, and it appears to be staying within this range for the time being. Key Fibonacci Levels The key Fibonacci levels have been met, but there could still be a small dip before any further upward movement. The price has maintained an overall bullish trend, with the possibility that the price bottomed around $1.90 in 2020, and we’re now seeing an upward movement that could continue. Bullish Flag Breakout According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, XRP recently broke out from a bullish flag pattern, signaling short-term upward movement. Even with a small pullback, the price is still above the breakout point, meaning those who entered the trade are still in profit. The price target for this breakout is around $3.80, which suggests a potential 47-48% increase from current levels. Resistance Levels to Watch However, resistance levels remain important. If XRP hits the $2.90-$3 range, it could struggle to move higher. Therefore, while the bullish target is in play, other factors need to be considered. Short-Term Support and Resistance XRP is bouncing from short-term support around $2.50. If it falls below this level, the next support is around $2.38. The analyst said that a drop below $2.38 would invalidate the current bullish outlook. It is important to note that at the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.36 level. Short-term resistance to watch includes levels around $2.70, $2.78, and $2.85. If XRP breaks these levels, it could face more resistance near $2.90-$3. Conclusion Overall, XRP is still stuck in its current price range, with no clear breakout yet. The price is likely consolidating before making another move upward, but we should wait for the market to stabilize before making any conclusions, especially after the recent Fed decision.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-19 03:59:04

The price declined over 5% and there was a move below the $2.320 support. Finally, the price spiked below the $2.20 support. A low was formed at $2.171 and the price is now correcting losses. There was a move above the $2.250 level. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.720 swing high to the $2.171 low. The price is now trading below $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.40 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.450 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.45 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.720 swing high to the $2.171 low. The next resistance is $2.50. A clear move above the $2.50 resistance might send the price toward the $2.55 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.620 resistance or even $2.80 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.00. Are Dips Supported? If XRP fails to clear the $2.40 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.25 level. The next major support is near the $2.20 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.20 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.050 support. The next major support sits near the $2.00 zone.

With countless cryptocurrencies vying for attention, choosing the right one can feel overwhelming. Today, we’re spotlighting Qubetics ($TICS) , Monero ($XMR), and Stacks ($STX)—three projects that stand out for their unique features and recent developments, making them the best cryptos to join today. Among these, Qubetics is redefining the market with its groundbreaking asset tokenisation feature. Meanwhile, Monero and Stacks continue to attract users with their strong focus on privacy and smart contract innovation, respectively. Let’s dive into what sets these projects apart. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionising Asset Tokenisation Qubetics, the world’s first Web3 aggregator, is a rising star in the crypto landscape. In its 13th presale stage, $TICS is priced at $0.0342. With over $7 million raised, 10,600 token holders, and 355 million tokens sold , Qubetics is steadily building momentum and trust within the community. One of Qubetics’ standout features is its asset tokenisation capability. This innovation allows users to convert tangible and intangible assets into digital tokens on the blockchain. Imagine a real estate developer tokenising property shares or a business owner digitising intellectual property. By doing so, Qubetics enables fractional ownership, easier transferability, and enhanced liquidity for these assets. For professionals like lawyers or financial advisors, asset tokenisation simplifies complex transactions, reducing paperwork and ensuring transparency. Investors can diversify portfolios by owning fractions of high-value assets—a game-changer for those previously excluded from such opportunities. Explore the full scope of Qubetics . With ROI projections of up to 43,711.73% if $TICS reaches $15, it’s clear why this token is attracting attention. Combined with its asset tokenisation feature and growing community, Qubetics is undoubtedly among the best cryptos to join today. Monero ($XMR): A Pioneer in Privacy In its latest update, Monero enhanced its privacy protocol, improving efficiency and scalability. This ensures $XMR remains competitive and reliable in a rapidly evolving crypto environment. Monero has long been a favourite among privacy-conscious users. Its robust blockchain ensures anonymity for all transactions, shielding sensitive details from public scrutiny. Launched in 2014, $XMR continues to deliver unmatched privacy and security. Monero’s unique ring signatures and stealth addresses obscure transaction details, making it the go-to choice for individuals and businesses requiring confidentiality. For example, a journalist operating in a restrictive regime can securely receive donations or payments in Monero without risking exposure. Stacks ($STX): Empowering Smart Contracts on Bitcoin Stacks is bringing smart contracts and decentralised applications (dApps) to Bitcoin, combining the world’s most secure blockchain with advanced programmability. By leveraging the Bitcoin network, Stacks offers a unique approach to building Web3 applications. Stacks recently announced new partnerships with Web3 developers focused on decentralised identity solutions. This expansion underscores its commitment to building a robust and scalable ecosystem. As Bitcoin’s ecosystem expands, Stacks plays a crucial role in enabling smart contract functionality. For businesses and developers seeking to innovate on a secure foundation, $STX provides the perfect platform. Conclusion: Three Projects, Endless Potential Qubetics, Monero, and Stacks each bring something unique to the table, making them the best cryptos to join today . Qubetics’ asset tokenisation feature is a game-changer for professionals and investors alike. Monero’s privacy solutions remain unmatched, while Stacks bridges the gap between Bitcoin’s security and smart contract functionality. Whether you prioritise innovation, privacy, or programmability, these three projects deserve your attention.

Brandt, with decades of experience in the financial markets, has highlighted a significant bullish formation on the XRP/USD chart. The potential breakout could drive XRP to new heights. The “Half Mast Flag” Pattern On December 17, Peter Brandt shared an analysis of the XRP/USD trading pair, identifying a “Half Mast Flag” pattern. According to Brandt, this pattern often signals that an asset is gearing for an upward move, with the potential price increase matching the initial advance leading to the flag’s formation. The “Half Mast Flag” typically occurs when an asset’s price experiences a sharp move, followed by consolidation before resuming its upward trajectory. If this pattern completes as expected, XRP could be set for a significant price surge. Brandt’s observation has drawn agreement from various market commentators, with some suggesting that the asset’s price could exceed $3 if the breakout materializes.

If so, distance to upside should equal advance into tip of flag pic.twitter.com/Wj5c4gu5qE — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 17, 2024 In parallel, crypto analyst Ali Martinez also noted bullish signals for the token. Martinez identified a “Bull Flag” formation and predicted that breaking the $2.60 resistance level could pave the way for the token to climb toward $4. Major Transactions Linked to Binance While technical patterns point to bullish potential, on-chain activity has also caught the attention of analysts. Recently, a massive deposit of 69.3 million XRP, valued at approximately $175.8 million, was transferred to a Binance wallet from an unidentified address, according to data from the analytics platform Bithomp. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Before this, Whale Alert reported two large transfers involving Binance wallets. The transactions, totaling 920 million XRP—equivalent to $1.92 billion—indicate significant movements within the Binance ecosystem. While these transfers were substantial, they remained within Binance-associated wallets, raising questions about potential strategies or preparations linked to asset price activity. Ripple USD Stablecoin Gains Attention Adding to the excitement around the asset, the Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin officially launched on December 17. Ripple minted nearly $66 million worth of RLUSD after receiving regulatory approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services. This stablecoin is expected to enhance liquidity and expand decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities on the XRP Ledger. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson also expressed enthusiasm for RLUSD, describing it as “awesome” in a recent post on X . When asked whether Cardano might adopt RLUSD, Hoskinson indicated ongoing efforts toward this goal. As the asset consolidates near the $2.60 resistance level, the combination of technical patterns, whale activity, and ecosystem developments paints a promising picture. Breaking above the resistance could confirm the bullish formations identified by analysts, potentially driving the token toward $4 or higher.

Users should avoid sharing personal details and verify information only through official channels. Beware, ShibArmy Shibarium Trustwatch recently issued another important alert concerning the Shiba Inu community. The team cautioned that scammers request victims to send them an email containing information about the meme coin SHIFU. “Fraudsters are asking people to send them an email asking how to buy and claim SHIFU or if SHIFU has not appeared in their wallet,” the warning reads. The team advised people to remain vigilant and not send emails to anyone. Verifying information through official channels and avoiding sharing personal details is also a must . SHIFU is a dog-themed Shiba Inu-related meme coin introduced by the lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, at the beginning of December. While it is available for trading on certain decentralized exchanges, major platforms like Binance have not yet listed it. Earlier this week, the meme coin project launched a special airdrop. The team revealed that 30% of the token’s total supply (equaling 30 billion SHIFU) will be distributed to the community. 22 billion SHIFU will reach some of those holding at least 100,000 SHIB, and 100 BUBBLE. 2 billion tokens will be allocated to eligible LEASH holders, whereas lucky BONE owners will get 1 billion coins. The remaining 70% of the supply will be distributed for other purposes such as “liquidity and public pre-sale,” treasury, and market initiatives. Previous Warnings Shiba Inu has one of the largest community bases, which explains why fraudsters often target it. Last month, Shibarium Trustwatch cautioned users to stay away from dubious individuals who offer services with the meme coins SHI and TREAT. The team said the tokens are not live yet, advising people to follow the official X accounts of Shiba Inu, Shytoshi Kusama (the pseudonymous leading developer of the meme coin), Kaal Dhairya (another prominent developer), and Treat for more clarity on the matter. A few weeks later, Shibarium Trustwatch maintained that bad actors use Shytoshi Kusama’s name to promote fraudulent tokens in fake groups. “Always verify the authenticity of any group or token before participating. Stay vigilant and protect yourself and others from these scams,” the warning reads.

John Reed Stark, a former SEC enforcement official and crypto skeptic, recently appeared on Docket Media LLC podcast and opened up about the historic Ripple decisions. He said that the Ripple ruling doesn’t provide broad legal clarity and should only be applied to cases with similar specific facts. He criticized the Ripple decision, claiming that many people misunderstand the ruling, likely because they haven’t fully read it. He argued that Judge Torres was ‘mistaken on multiple counts, a view shared by other judges who have reviewed the case. “There’s so many things about the Ripple decision that people get entirely wrong because I don’t think they read it. It’s completely… it’s respectfully to Judge Torres, I think she was mistaken on multiple counts, as does Judge Rakoff and every single other judge that has looked at that decision (thought),” he said. Stark pointed out that the Ripple decision was twofold. First, he agreed that the initial offering of XRP tokens to sophisticated investors should have been registered as securities to protect those investors. However, Stark disagreed with the decision when it came to the secondary market, where XRP was traded on exchanges. ‘Ripple Decision Created Confusion’ He argued that the lack of a direct relationship between Ripple and retail investors meant they weren’t protected, which he believes is an unfair argument. Stark compared it to buying stocks in companies, where investors don’t have a direct contractual relationship with the company but are still protected under securities regulations. Stark also criticized the Ripple decision for creating confusion, especially after pro-crypto companies began citing it to argue that tokens were not securities. In response, the SEC sought an interlocutory appeal, hoping to stop the ongoing proceedings. However, the judge rejected the SEC’s request, stating that the Ripple decision could not be used as precedent unless the exact same circumstances were present.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-19 04:43:49

Her term is officially ending in January. The Senate Banking Committee has decided not to Re-nominate her. This feels like a big win for crypto people. Crenshaw has been a huge critic of cryptocurrency and often clashed with the industry. Now, with her departure and resignation of Gary Gensler, things could be very different at the SEC. Crenshaw’s Anti-Crypto Legacy Crypto people would be happy as Caroline Crenshaw’s SEC term ends . She was not exactly a favorite in the space. Her close relations with Gary and following his vision of a tough stance towards crypto made her the target for criticism. As a fun fact, the crypto industry poured millions into lobbying efforts to block her renomination, and it worked. People from the crypto industry spend huge funds to support candidates who align with industry goals. This influence didn’t stop with campaigns. Crypto-friendly Republican senators also pushed hard to ensure Crenshaw wouldn’t continue her role. Even Democrats felt the heat. Sherrod Brown, one of Crenshaw’s supporters, lashed out at the crypto industry, calling their lobbying efforts a “disgusting smear campaign.” But it wasn’t enough to save her spot. What Happens Now? With Crenshaw leaving and Gensler stepping down in January, things are already shifting. President-elect Donald Trump’s administration is shaping up to be much more crypto-friendly. Paul Atkins, who’s known for his pro-crypto views, will take over as SEC Chair. There’s also talk about who might replace Crenshaw. Names like Chris Brummer and TuongVy Le are being floated. Brummer, a blockchain expert, seems to have the strongest backing, but nothing is confirmed yet. If he’s chosen, it would send a clear message: the SEC might finally be ready to work with the crypto industry instead of fighting against it. What’s Next This feels like a turning point. For years, crypto companies have been calling for clearer regulations. Now, they might actually get them. Big names in the industry, like Tyler Winklevoss of Gemini , are already celebrating. He called Crenshaw’s departure “a roadblock removed” and emphasized the need for clear rules. Source : X.com The U.S. has lagged behind other countries in embracing crypto.

The court also observed that “ self-inflicted wounds are not irreparable injury ”, suggesting that BiT Global’s purported injury stemmed from BiT Global’s own actions and decisions and was not caused by Coinbase’s delisting. As covered by crypto.news earlier, the American cryptocurrency exchange giant Coinbase revealed on Nov. 19 that it would delist wBTC from its platform on Dec. 19. The decision came as a result of Coinbase’s regular review process, which BiT Global alleged was biased. The firm subsequently filed a lawsuit alleging violations of competition laws and libel, claiming the exchange damaged wBTC’s reputation by promoting its own tokenized Bitcoin product, cbBTC. Coinbase’s legal counsel characterized the suit as frivolous and suggested sanctions could be imposed against both BiT Global and its counsel. They pointed to a failure of evidence to support claims that Coinbase’s actions had caused users to abandon wBTC.

A spokesman for the exchange rejected the allegations, saying that they have the right to decide whether to list or delist a token. The company further denied accusations of monopolistic behavior, saying it represented less than one percent of all wBTC trading activity. cbBTC, on the other hand, has taken off since its Sept. launch , with a market cap exceeding $2.11 billion .

Still, Coinbase pointed to Sun’s previous accusations of financial misconduct and argued that his distancing from wBTC was a strategic decision. BiT Global also claimed that wBTC is crucial to the crypto ecosystem and defended their stance by accusing Coinbase of impartial listing policies and accusing the exchange of listing meme coins such as Mogcoin ( MOG ) and pepe ( PEPE ) that serve little purpose. So in a court filing today, @Coinbase gave their reason why they delisted wBTC, and it's basically just they don't like Justin Sun. That's really just it. They don't give any technical or legal arguments about why wBTC can't be listed. It's just guilt by association pic.twitter.com/bJmMnAue7x — Pledditor (@Pledditor) December 17, 2024 However, many crypto enthusiasts are siding with BiT Global saying Coinbase’s decision to delist wBTC is because they “don’t like Justin Sun”. Critics further argued that wBTC is more acceptable than cbBTC does not provide proof of reserves, unlike its competitor. A token requires proof of reserves to prove an issuer possesses enough assets to back the token and to expand transparency and trust. For wrapped tokens such as wBTC or cbBTC, it shows that each token is actually 1:1 backed by the original asset, in this case, Bitcoin ( BTC ). The absence of proof of reserves, on the other hand, puts each user at an increased risk of insolvency, fraud, or mismanagement by the issuer.

December’s end brings not just festive cheer but also an opportunity to spotlight the coins that have captured attention with their strong year-end momentum. So far, $CHO, $DOGE, and $HYPE are looking like the ones to watch for gains by January 1, and there’s a good chance they’ll keep it up into 2025. $CHO $CHO, the native token of Choise.ai , an enterprise crypto platform with over one million users, experienced a 700% spike from February to April, setting a yearly high . With the token’s utility growing through updates to Choise.ai’s expanding ecosystem of products, it seems poised to cap off the year with even greater gains. One of the most recent announcements from Choise.ai highlights their work with Vault , a B2B platform specializing in white-label crypto banking solutions, on Meme Bank, a new Choise.ai ecosystem addition designed to introduce real-world utility for meme coins. This will enable holders to, for example, spend their meme coins in real life via Visa and Mastercard. Meme Bank will actually feature individual banks for each meme coin, offering seamless transactions, exchanges, withdrawals, additional utility-driven features like token burns, staking options, and many more. This is probably going to be huge for $CHO because portions of the token will be burned during transactions within Meme Bank, alongside the associated meme coins, directly increasing their scarcity. With millions of transactions anticipated, $CHO holders stand to benefit as supply decreases and demand grows. In a recent post on X, Choise.ai revealed that the first meme bank will soon be unveiled, with community chatter suggesting that $DOGE will be the inaugural coin, and this means potentially tapping into its massive community of over 6 million active holders. Image Source: X Adding to the momentum, Choise.ai just announced the addition of Ryan Horn, a former Binance executive known for high-profile partnerships like those with Cristiano Ronaldo, to its Board of Directors. Earlier in the year, $CHO’s surge was partly fueled by its listing on BingX, building on its presence on exchanges like KuCoin and MEXC. Now, anticipation is building for a new tier-1 CEX listing, which could significantly broaden its audience and drive further demand. $DOGE As of 2024, meme coins command a staggering market capitalization of over $127 billion. And, even though many of them, such as $PEPE or $POPCAT, have gained serious attention and seen impressive growth, $DOGE, the original meme coin, still stands out as having the most genuine potential. With 11 years under its belt, its rise is driven by utility, not just speculation or hype. $DOGE has already seen a 342% increase in yearly growth, and the last two weeks of 2024 could push it even higher. The most popular meme coin certainly benefited from the overall bullishness in the market, especially after Bitcoin smashed through $100,000. But the momentum continued for another reason: hints from Elon Musk about $DOGE payments for X’s premium features, as well as President Trump’s appointment of Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the new Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). The name alone sparked attention, boosting $DOGE’s trading volume and hinting at its expanding utility. Plus, beyond its current use for payments within Tesla and various online and offline stores like Newegg, Jomashop, Burger Bear, Travala, and AirBaltic, $DOGE seems poised for more. After a healthy retest, which followed the big jump in November, $DOGE appears ready to finish the year with even stronger gains. One factor that could fuel this is if it actually becomes the first meme coin bank within Choise.ai’s Meme Bank project. If this scenario unfolds, burning $DOGE with each transaction could drive up demand while decreasing the supply in circulation. Additionally, expanding $DOGE’s utility and increasing its real-world applications could also be a major boost for its further growth. $HYPE Hyperliquid burst onto the scene on November 29 with the launch of its $HYPE token, marking one of the most talked-about token generation events in recent memory. As a decentralized perpetual trading platform and layer-1 blockchain, Hyperliquid allows users to trade perpetual derivatives and spot assets, all while pulling liquidity from multiple sources. At the heart of the platform is the $HYPE token, which does double duty as both a utility token for trading and the gas token for HyperEVM, the platform’s execution environment. Since its launch, $HYPE quickly climbed into CoinGecko’s top 30 cryptocurrencies. Over $1 billion in USDC net inflows have been recorded, and the token is being celebrated as one of the most successful airdrops ever, despite the absence of any major centralized exchange listings. What sets Hyperliquid apart is its commitment to decentralization; no token supply was allocated to private investors or exchanges, keeping ownership squarely in the hands of its users. The platform’s unique approach to decentralized perpetual trading has resonated with the DeFi community, and its rising popularity suggests it could become a key player in the space. However, with $HYPE’s value skyrocketing by 748% in less than a month, it’s important to tread carefully. While the token shows plenty of promise, its newness and rapid rise call for cautious optimism. Summary It doesn’t matter whether it’s the beginning or end of the year for coins with real potential and ongoing developments to get the recognition they deserve, but this time, the end of the year is lining up perfectly with big things happening for some projects. With teams like Choise.ai constantly building, there’s a lot in store. With the Meme Bank launch on the horizon, $CHO seems set for some nice gains, while $DOGE and $HYPE also have some strong potential to grow.",Information,EN,0,0,DOGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-19 04:55:00

USDT Exchange Inflows Have Remained High Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment discussed the trend in the Exchange Flow Balance for Tether’s USDT. The “Exchange Flow Balance” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the net amount of a given asset entering or exiting the wallets associated with centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the inflows outweigh the outflows, and a net amount of the coin is entered into the exchanges’ wallets. Such a trend is usually a sign of demand among investors for trading away the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Ethereum On-Chain Demand Should Sustain ETH Above $4,000, IntoTheBlock Says On the other hand, the negative indicator implies the holders are withdrawing a net number of tokens from these platforms. This kind of trend suggests the market is in a phase of accumulation. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Exchange Flow Balance for USDT over the last couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the Exchange Flow Balance for USDT has observed several large positive spikes over the past month, implying that large investors have been depositing their tokens. For assets like Bitcoin, a positive Exchange Flow Balance can be a bearish sign, as it could suggest the holders are planning to sell. However, the same isn’t true when the asset involved is a stablecoin. Investors generally store their capital in these fiat-tied tokens to avoid the volatility of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Such users eventually plan to venture into the volatile side once they feel the conditions are right. And when the time comes, they naturally transfer to exchanges to swap to Bitcoin or whatever desired coin. This act of selling USDT does not affect its value since the coin is, by definition, always stable around the $1 mark.

As such, stablecoin exchange inflows are usually considered a bullish sign for Bitcoin and other assets. During the last eight weeks, exchanges have received a net average of $40 million USDT. “Helping to fuel this bull rally and the many historic crypto pumps, look for stablecoin ‘dry powder’ to continue flowing in during this final stretch of 2024,” explains the analytics firm. Bitcoin Price Bitcoin set a new all-time high (ATH) beyond the $108,000 mark yesterday, but the coin appears to have seen a pullback since then, as its price is now trading around $104,500.

37827950,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52535,1734585395,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Flare Integrates XRP on Test Network,https://timestabloid.com/flare-networks-integrate-xrp-on-test-network/,"Flare, a blockchain platform, has officially launched FXRP, a tokenized representation of XRP, on its Songbird test network. This release marks a significant milestone following the completion of an open beta phase involving 48,000 participants. During the beta testing period, the system processed over 263,000 mints and 395,000 redemptions, highlighting the potential for broader adoption. Integration Details and Features The FXRP integration incorporates a unique verification feature called the “handshake” mechanism, which allows authorized agents to validate wallet addresses participating in minting and redemption activities. This system is a step toward bridging non-smart contract cryptocurrencies, such as XRP , Bitcoin, and Dogecoin, with decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Testing on Songbird will span six weeks for each asset, operating under specific financial parameters to ensure security and reliability. Flare has introduced a $2 million issuance cap per asset and offers $300,000 in loss protection through Flare Labs, providing an added layer of security for participants. Collateral for this testing phase will be backed by Songbird’s native token (SGB) and USDX, a stablecoin linked to U.S. Treasury values. Incentives for Testing Participation To encourage active engagement, Flare has allocated $260,000 in rewards through rFLR tokens for users involved in minting, redeeming, and trading FXRP. Participants can access the system via various minting applications, reducing reliance on any single platform and mitigating centralization risks. Developers also have access to comprehensive testing parameters through the Flare Developer Hub, ensuring a wide range of tools for experimentation. The FAssets protocol, which powers FXRP , utilizes an over-collateralization model to provide security and stability. Each bridged token is backed by collateral exceeding its value, a strategy that sets it apart from traditional bridging approaches that rely on custody or multi-signature wallets. Additionally, automated liquidation processes are in place to maintain system stability and protect user assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Addressing Market Limitations The integration of FXRP addresses a critical gap in cryptocurrency markets—the limited ability of non-smart contract tokens to interact with DeFi systems. By tokenizing these assets, Flare enables their use in activities such as lending, trading, and staking, unlocking new opportunities while maintaining security through robust collateralization measures. The ongoing Songbird testing phase is a preparatory step before the potential deployment of FXRP on Flare’s main network. This stage aims to identify and resolve operational challenges and optimize the system for scalability and reliability. Flare’s infrastructure incorporates decentralized oracles at the network level, which support data processing for various blockchain operations. This setup enables the seamless handling of price feeds, blockchain events, and external API data, all critical components for DeFi functionalities. By focusing on advanced asset-bridging techniques and maintaining strict collateralization protocols, Flare demonstrates its commitment to balancing accessibility with security in cross-chain operations. This initiative aligns with the broader industry trend of integrating traditional cryptocurrencies into the rapidly expanding DeFi ecosystem. The FXRP integration on Songbird signifies Flare’s innovative approach to blockchain interoperability, paving the way for non-smart contract tokens to achieve greater utility in decentralized finance.

The majority of the lawyer’s community has voiced against her renomination with over 107,000 emails from crypto supporters, helping block her re-nomination. Now, everyone is eyeing a pro-SEC Commissioner who might be more supportive of cryptocurrencies. What’s Happening at the SEC? Caroline Crenshaw, who has been a Commissioner at the SEC since 2022, is known for being tough on crypto. As per Elenor Terror, Fox Business Journalist the Senate decided not to move forward with her re-nomination, leaving a spot open at the SEC. This is important because the SEC controls rules for financial markets, including crypto. Apart from Crenshaw’s exit, Gary Gensler, the SEC Chairman, is also expected to leave in January . Gensler has been tough on crypto, but his replacement, Paul Atkins , is expected to be more supportive of the industry. This could mean fewer regulations and more freedom for crypto to grow. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Fed’s Anti-Bitcoin Stance Triggers Major Crypto Market Sell-off , Who Could Replace Crenshaw? By law, Crenshaw’s replacement must be a Democrat, and several potential candidates are already being discussed. One of the top names is Chris Brummer, a Georgetown law professor who was close to becoming the head of the CFTC in 2021. Another strong contender is TuongVy Le, who works as the general counsel for Anchorage Digital, a crypto bank. These candidates are seen as more crypto-friendly. Other names being floated include Jai Messai, a blockchain expert, and Carla Carriveau, an advisor to the New York Department of Financial Services. Why This is Important for Crypto With new leadership at the SEC, Senator Cynthia Lummis predicts that 2025 will be a Bitcoin year, along with David Sacks serving as the crypto czar . This optimism is further boosted by Crypto.com dropping its lawsuit against the SEC after meetings with political leaders, including President-elect Donald Trump, to discuss future crypto-friendly appointments. There is also buzz that the new chair may dismiss all pending crypto cases starting with Ripple. We have to wait and watch if Trump manages to make these strategic changes in top administration as it is very crucial if he wants his Bitcoin Strategic Reserve plan to succeed. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bitcoin’s 21 Million Supply Cap: Unwavering or Vulnerable? The debate over Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million has once again taken center stage in the cryptocurrency community, following a provocative disclaimer in a recent explainer video by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. The video, which aims to shed light on Bitcoin’s fundamentals, has ignited speculation over whether its famously fixed supply cap is as immutable as many investors believe. Released on Dec. 17, BlackRock’s three-minute video touted Bitcoin’s capped supply as a key factor underpinning its value as a deflationary asset. However, a disclaimer in the video raised eyebrows: “There is no guarantee that bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap will not be changed.” This statement has sparked a flurry of discussions, with critics and supporters alike weighing in on the implications for Bitcoin’s future. Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap has been integral to its reputation as “digital gold.” By limiting supply, Bitcoin mirrors gold’s scarcity while eliminating the risks of monetary debasement associated with fiat currencies. This deflationary design has made Bitcoin a store of value, particularly in inflationary economic environments. BlackRock’s video focuses on this point, stating that Bitcoin’s hard-coded rule “controls supply, purchasing power and helps avoid the potential misuse of printing more and more currency.” Yet the disclaimer hints at the theoretical possibility of altering this cap, a notion that runs counter to Bitcoin’s core ethos and could shake investor confidence. MicroStrategy’s executive chairman and vocal Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor reposted the video, amplifying its reach and sparking further debate. Detractors, such as Joel Valenzuela, Director of Marketing and Business Development at Dashpay, expressed skepticism, claiming that such a change would undermine Bitcoin’s legitimacy. Ethereum developer Antiprosynthesis also chimed in, asserting, “BlackRock understands Bitcoin better than Bitcoiners.” Could the Supply Cap Be Changed? Technically, Bitcoin’s supply cap could be altered through a hard fork, a process that would require widespread consensus among Bitcoin stakeholders, including node operators, developers, miners, and investors. However, such a change would be contentious and complex. Bitcoin developer “Super Testnet,” the mind behind BitVM, explained that while a hard fork could theoretically create a new blockchain with an uncapped supply, it would no longer represent Satoshi Nakamoto’s original Bitcoin . “The inflation cap is definitional to Bitcoin,” said Super Testnet, referencing Bitcoin’s whitepaper. “Eliminate that, and whatever you have isn’t Bitcoin anymore. You might as well ask what it would take to turn Bitcoin into PayPal.” This perspective suggests that any version of Bitcoin with an altered supply cap would lack the philosophical and economic underpinnings that make Bitcoin distinct. As history has shown, such changes are unlikely to gain traction. During the Blocksize War of 2016–2017, a proposal to increase Bitcoin’s block size limit was supported by 95% of miners but was ultimately rejected by node operators and the broader community, leading to the creation of Bitcoin Cash instead. The primary argument for uncapping Bitcoin’s supply centers on its long-term security model. Bitcoin miners rely on block subsidies and transaction fees to maintain the network. However, block subsidies halve approximately every four years, creating a financial challenge for miners unless Bitcoin’s price or transaction fees rise significantly. As of now, miners earn 3.125 BTC per block, worth around $316,950 at current prices. This reward will halve to 1.625 BTC in 2028, putting further pressure on the economic viability of mining. The final Bitcoin is projected to be mined in 2140, after which miners will depend entirely on transaction fees. Some argue that Bitcoin’s application layer, including developments in decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, must evolve to sustain sufficient network activity and fee revenue for miners. During the Bitcoin Ordinals craze, transaction fees spiked, benefiting miners. However, such periods of high activity are often short-lived. While miners have a vested interest in sustaining the network’s profitability, their influence alone is insufficient to enforce changes, as demonstrated during the Blocksize War. The broader community’s resistance to altering Bitcoin’s rules suggests that any proposal to increase the supply cap would face significant hurdles. The debate over Bitcoin’s supply cap is not merely technical but deeply philosophical. For many in the community, Bitcoin’s fixed supply is sacrosanct, a core principle that defines its identity and value. Any move to change it would likely fracture the community and create competing chains, as seen with Bitcoin Cash. BlackRock’s disclaimer, while hypothetical, has reignited this longstanding debate, reminding the community of Bitcoin’s decentralized governance structure. Ultimately, the question of whether Bitcoin’s supply cap is truly fixed may rest not on its code but on the collective will of its stakeholders to preserve its foundational principles. As of now, Bitcoin’s identity as “digital gold” remains intact, but the ongoing discussion serves as a potent reminder of the delicate balance between innovation and tradition in the cryptocurrency world. El Salvador to Scale Back Bitcoin Initiatives as Part of IMF Loan Agreement In other Bitcoin news, El Salvador , the first country in the world to adopt BTC as legal tender, is set to significantly scale back its Bitcoin-related initiatives in a move tied to securing a $1.4 billion loan deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This agreement marks a significant shift in the Central American nation’s approach to cryptocurrency, aiming to address its mounting debt challenges while reducing the risks associated with its Bitcoin experiment. The IMF announced on Dec. 18 that the loan agreement spans 40 months and includes measures designed to lower El Salvador’s debt-to-GDP ratio. The deal also introduces sweeping reforms to the country's cryptocurrency policies, reversing some of the bold steps taken under President Nayib Bukele’s leadership since Bitcoin was made legal tender in 2021. Among the most notable changes is the plan to make Bitcoin acceptance by private-sector merchants voluntary rather than mandatory. When the Bitcoin Law was enacted in June 2021, businesses were required to accept the cryptocurrency as a means of payment if they had the technological capability to do so. This policy, which sparked global attention and criticism, will now be revised to allow businesses to choose whether to accept Bitcoin. “For the public sector, engagement in Bitcoin-related economic activities and transactions in and purchases of Bitcoin will be confined,” the IMF said in its statement . Additionally, the government’s involvement in the state-backed Chivo wallet, which facilitates Bitcoin transactions for citizens, will be gradually reduced. Taxes in El Salvador will also continue to be payable only in US dollars, the country’s official currency. El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office has reported that the country currently holds 5,968.8 BTC, worth approximately $602 million at current market prices. However, Bitcoin usage among Salvadorans has remained low. A recent survey conducted in October revealed that 92% of respondents did not use Bitcoin for transactions, a slight increase from the 88% reported in a 2023 survey. Despite the low adoption rates, President Bukele’s administration has continued to promote Bitcoin as a key part of its economic strategy, touting its potential to attract tourism and foreign investment. The IMF, however, has repeatedly raised concerns about the speculative nature of Bitcoin and its potential to destabilize the country’s economy. IMF’s Conditions and Broader Financing Plan The $1.4 billion loan agreement is contingent on the IMF Executive Board’s approval. If approved, the agreement will unlock additional financing from global institutions, including the World Bank, bringing the total financial package to over $3.5 billion. These funds aim to stabilize El Salvador’s economy, which has faced mounting debt and limited fiscal space. The IMF has long criticized Bukele’s Bitcoin policies, citing risks tied to volatility, financial instability, and the speculative nature of the cryptocurrency market. The institution views the latest agreement as a step toward mitigating these risks and aligning El Salvador’s economic policies with global standards. Reactions to the IMF agreement have been mixed. Max Keiser, a prominent Bitcoin advocate and adviser to President Bukele, dismissed the IMF’s measures as “bureaucratic, meaningless nonsense.” In a series of posts on X, Keiser claimed that Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador remains robust and growing despite IMF objections. “Bitcoin use in El Salvador was always voluntary and its usage has never been higher,” Keiser wrote, dismissing concerns about the reforms' impact on adoption. However, critics argue that the low adoption rates among Salvadorans undermine the administration’s claims of Bitcoin success. Many point to surveys showing limited usage of Bitcoin for everyday transactions as evidence that the policy has failed to resonate with the public. The reforms signal a pragmatic shift in El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment. While President Bukele’s government has championed Bitcoin as a tool for economic empowerment and innovation, the new measures suggest that financial stability and debt reduction have taken precedence over furthering the cryptocurrency agenda. The gradual unwinding of the Chivo wallet, the voluntary nature of Bitcoin acceptance for merchants, and the limited public-sector involvement indicate a significant pivot. However, the government’s substantial Bitcoin holdings and the continued promotion of Bitcoin-related tourism and investment projects suggest that El Salvador is not entirely abandoning its crypto ambitions. As El Salvador navigates its obligations under the IMF agreement, the global cryptocurrency community will closely watch how these reforms impact the country’s Bitcoin narrative and its broader economic landscape. While the era of mandatory Bitcoin adoption may be coming to an end, the legacy of El Salvador’s bold experiment will likely influence debates about cryptocurrency adoption worldwide for years to come.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BCH|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|FORKS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-19 05:30:00

While Bitcoin has slumped after setting a new all-time high above $108,000 on Tuesday, Kiyosaki still thinks BTC can reach $350,000 next year. Robert Kiyosaki Sees $350K Bitcoin In 2025 In a post on X, Robert Kiyosaki reminded his 2.6 million followers that Donald Trump, the first-ever Bitcoin president in the United States, was reelected into office last month. During his 2024 election campaign, Trump made several crypto-related promises, including establishing a strategic Bitcoin stockpile. The concept has since picked up steam both in the U.S. and abroad. While there have been plenty of discussions and proposals, lawmakers have yet to review in detail a clear roadmap and timeline for the enactment of the national BTC reserve. Nevertheless, Kiyosaki believes the premier crypto Bitcoin will skyrocket to a new epic high in 2025 and reach a staggering $350,000 per BTC. Thus, he said, it makes sense to acquire more Bitcoin. “BITCOIN to $350K in 2025. OWN more BITCOIN in 2025,” Kiyosaki posited. Interestingly, a Bitcoiner created a poll to find out whether other Kiyosaki followers believe the flagship crypto will indeed reach $350,000 heights next year. Although only a handful of X users responded to the poll, the majority of the responders are skeptical of the sky-high price target. Are Kiyosaki’s Bitcoin Predictions Reliable? Since May. 2020, Kiyosaki has been a huge advocate for asset classes that cannot be directly manipulated by the Fed, having once advised investors to “Get Bitcoin and save yourself” after the Fed launched its mass money printing sprees to bolster the economy during the pandemic. It’s worth noting that Kiyosaki has a rather questionable track record of predicting Bitcoin’s price. Back in June, the best-selling author predicted that Bitcoin would be worth $350,000 by August. We are already in December, and the crypto’s current all-time high stands at $108,135 following the parabolic rally witnessed in recent weeks. Kiyosaki recently suggested that BTC was headed to $500,000 in 2025 and then climb past $1 million by 2030. In his belief, the gargantuan price appreciation would be triggered by artificial intelligence (AI) dramatically disrupting the global financial sector. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $101,046, down roughly 2.7% over the last 24 hours.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-19 05:30:34

This includes a collapse in the yen and its slow growth just before the parliament returns to Tokyo for a pivotal session next week. According to The Japan Times , the BOJ’s decision came after a two-day policy meeting. In the meeting, analysts were split over whether rates should be raised to 0.5 percent or held at the current 0.25 percent. Markets had already begun to anticipate the BOJ’s decision, moving on to a pause. This is a cautious measure after two 2024 rate hikes ended a yearslong freeze on negative interest rates. BOJ governor will address the further moves of the bank The uncertainty was exacerbated by Trump’s threat of further tariffs on Chinese, Canadian, and Mexican goods. Promoted as a tool for preventing illegal immigration and drug trafficking, the trade strategy raises questions regarding the encouragement of the beginning of a more general attack on the global trading system. Markets are waiting for BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda’s updates about the bank’s next moves when he addresses the decision later.

A failure to hold support near $101K could lead to a drop below $100K. Analysts predict Bitcoin’s 2025 average price could reach $119,218, signaling growth. Bitcoin’s price trends have long intrigued investors and analysts. With 2025 on the horizon, speculation is growing about the digital currency’s potential to reach $350,000. This bold forecast from Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, has sparked interest, especially in light of former President Donald Trump’s endorsement of Bitcoin. However, the outlook depends on key factors, including support and resistance levels and trading volume trends.

Nexo has generously donated $105,000 to Brink , a non-profit organization dedicated to open-source Bitcoin development.

The funds will be used to support our engineers’ work of securing Bitcoin software through their efforts of fuzz testing, code review, and other projects outlined in our recent annual report . Thank you Nexo! — [Mike Schmidt, Executive Director, Brink] Thanks to community donations, Brink has become a bug-hunting force, actively identifying and fixing critical vulnerabilities in the Bitcoin software. Recent disclosures on BitcoinCore.org offer a glimpse into the types of threats Brink and Bitcoin Core developers tirelessly combat, ensuring the network’s robustness for everyone. “Bitcoin Core developers are Bitcoin’s unsung guardians. By supporting their work, we help ensure that Bitcoin remains the most secure, innovative, and decentralized asset for future generations. This donation will directly fund Brink’s developers and is a testament to our shared responsibility to safeguard Bitcoin’s future. Stepping in to support critical development work that relies on contributions like these to move forward is crucial for the digital asset industry and we hope it inspires others to recognize the importance of funding Bitcoin Core development for securing the network’s future for millions worldwide.“ — [Elitsa Taskova, CPO, Nexo] This dedication to Bitcoin’s health isn’t lost on Nexo, a platform founded by “HODLers” (long-term Bitcoin believers). Nexo has a history of supporting Brink , and this HODL Day they’re making another significant contribution. This isn’t just a one-time act; Nexo is committed to Bitcoin’s future, ensuring its security for generations of HODLers to come. The collaboration between Nexo and Brink extends beyond finance.

Magic Eden (ME) and Ponke (PONKE) holders have faced huge losses that prompted them to turn to a new and lucrative PropFi altcoin that is making headlines with its advanced features and stable gains. While the rise of Ponke and the launch of Magic Eden’s ME token dominated the headlines, a new crypto coin is outpacing them rapidly in profit potential. This DeFi coin offers massive growth potential, real utility, and remarkable investor benefits, positioning it as a great investment option for stable gains. Here is why you do not want to miss this PropFi altcoin investment opportunity! >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE ME Token Struggles While a New DeFi Coin Rises With a 100x Profit Potential Magic Eden’s ME token was introduced on December 10, 2024, with an airdrop valued at more than $700 million. Initially, the token traded at around $4.50 , reaching a peak of $8.26 before dropping sharply to stabilize near $5.07. More than 70,000 users acquired 69 million tokens within the first hour, but most faced issues like app glitches and claim errors . Despite the challenges, traders leveraged the volatility, with one making $586,800 in profit. Listed on mainstream exchanges, the ME Foundation attributed challenges to increased app traffic during the launch. While Magic Eden’s ME token launch drew attention, a new PropFi altcoin surpasses it with groundbreaking innovations. Its impressive presale performance makes the new crypto a better investment due to its price stability and projected 100x growth potential. ME sold at $3.84 on December 15, down 68.54% in the past week. Holders are diversifying from ME to the PropFi altcoin due to its massive profit potential. Ponke’s Potential Outpaced by a New Crypto with Superior Growth Prospects Ponke, a surging meme coin, has gained attention with its strong forecast of $10 in the coming years. Notably, Ponke’s strategic partnerships, unique narrative, and integration into NFTs and gaming platforms convinced analysts to predict massive growth. PONKE mixes nostalgia, community vibes, and blockchain gaming culture, underpinned by a filled-up development roadmap. If PONKE’s adoption increases as projected, the token could hit its ambitious price goals, transforming it into a potential hidden gem with huge profits for early investors. While Ponke boasts gaming and NFT partnerships, a new PropFi altcoin outshines it with notable investor benefits. With its practical features, massive growth potential, and unrivaled trading flexibility, this DeFi coin offers a more lucrative, utility-driven opportunity than Ponke’s speculative potential. PONKE traded at $0.4482 on December 10, 2024, down 23.82% in the past week. Experts say PONKE will hit $0.4565 this month amidst increased buying pressure. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE FXGuys: The PropFi Altcoin Boosting Investment Strategies with a Trade2Earn Model FXGuys ($FXG) is leading the market in blending decentralized finance (DeFi) with proprietary finance (PropFi).

The company announced earlier today that its shares will commence trading on the United States OTCQX, a top-tier marketplace for over-the-counter stocks, on Thursday, December 19, 2024. The Metaplanet shares will trade on OTCQX under the ticker MTPLF, which will complement its stock trading in Japan.

Metaplanet and The Bitcoin Strategy Following the adoption of the Bitcoin strategy earlier this year, which has seen the company accumulate over 1,142 BTCs, Metaplanet is projecting the first fiscal year operating profit since 2017. Furthermore, the company’s stock market has rallied like a meme coin this year, with a return of about 2,068 percent year-to-date (YTD) to trade at about ¥3,685 at the time of this writing. Having added the Bitcoin treasury operations as the official new business line, Metaplanet is well positioned to attract more investors akin to MicroStrategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR) . Late last month, Metaplanet announced the issuance of moving strike stock acquisition rights to raise ¥9.5 billion, equivalent to about $62 million , for accelerated Bitcoin accumulation. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Japan Considers National Bitcoin Reserve as Countries Embrace Crypto , Market Impact The relentless Bitcoin accumulation by Metaplanet has strengthened the Bitcoin market in the Asian region.

37828883,https://coingape.com/?p=230028,1734587966,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Crypto Market Crash: Bitcoin, ETH, XRP, DOGE, SOL Trigger $860M In Liquidations",https://coingape.com/crypto-market-crash-bitcoin-eth-xrp-doge-sol-trigger-860m-in-liquidations/,"After the US Federal Reserve announced a 25 bps rate cut on Wednesday, the Bitcoin price came crashing under the $100K level to trigger the broader crypto market crash. The selling pressure was a reaction to the Fed’s future monetary policy guidance for 2025 and coming years. Along with Bitcoin, altcoins also faced strong pullback correcting to the tune of 10% and more. Top altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP, Solana (SOL), and others corrected 5-10% triggering more than $860 million in liquidations. Crypto Market Crash Saw Over $860 Million in Liquidation Bitcoin Price Drops Following Fed’s Hawkish Stance for 2025 On Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve announced its third rate cut of 25 bps on the expected lines with Jerome Powell setting up a hawkish undertone for 2025. Powell stated that the US central bank will proceed with only 2 rate cuts in 2025, against the anticipated 4 rate cuts. This was enough to send the Bitcoin price crashing under the crucial support of $100K levels. Thus, this recent correction has wiped out all the weekly gains for BTC, after hitting an all-time high above $108K earlier this week. Jerome Powell stated that the Fed remains committed to bringing inflation under the desired 2% target. The Fed chair also stated that achieving the 2% inflation target could take 1-2 years further adding to the hawkish tone. BTC Performs Better Than S&P 500 Despite Crypto Market Crash Blockchain analytics platform Santiment reported that BTC had shown a greater relative strength in comparison to the drop in the S&P 500. “This can actually be interpreted as a sign of strength once the dust settles over the next 24-48 hours,” noted Santiment. Source: Santiment Also, a majority of the US Bitcoin ETFs registered net outflows including Bitwise’s BITB, Invesco’s BTCO, Ark Invest’s ARKB, and Grayscale’s GBTC amid today’s crypto market crash. However, BlackRock’s IBIT saw a strong $356 million in inflows cancelling the overall negative impact. Despite the current turbulence, crypto market analysts continue to remain positive. Popular economist Alex Kruger wrote: “Next week is Xmas, which may change things. In my book BTC bouncing off 98 and SOL off 195 would be ideal. And then, up only into inauguration. Euphoria and leverage have been largely flushed out from crypto already, which should minimize the downside. Bigger picture unchanged IMO.” Bank of Japan Keeps Interest Rates Unchanged The Bank of Japan maintained its short-term policy rate at -0.1% on Thursday, choosing to monitor wage growth and inflation trends before making any adjustments. The widely expected decision underscores a cautious approach to monetary policy. In response, the yen weakened further, slipping past the critical 155 mark against the dollar, as the central bank refrained from raising borrowing costs. As a result, BTC price bounced back from the lows of under $100K and is currently trading at $101,020 as of press time. As per Coinglass data, the 24-hour BTC liquidations have soared to $148 million with $114 million worth of long liquidations. Altcoins Register Steeper Fall Than Bitcoin Along with the price of Bitcoin down today, altcoins faced an even greater fall with ETH, DOGE, XRP, and SOL all plunging between 5-10%. Other altcoins saw an even greater correction of between 10-20% in today’s crypto market crash. Crypto market data provider Santiment reported significant declines across several major altcoins over the past 24 hours. Avalanche (AVAX), Chainlink (LINK), and Litecoin (LTC) each dropped 16%, while meme coin Pepe (PEPE) fell 17%, reflecting widespread market turbulence. Santiment noted that while the pullback has been sharp, it could present an opportunity for dip buyers. “If this was indeed an overreaction, there is a reasonable chance that the projects with the biggest drops will offer the most attractive buying opportunities,” the report suggested. Well, this total crypto market volatility has led to total crypto market liquidations soaring to $860 million, per the Coinglass data . The 24-hour long liquidations have surged to $684.93M million while $200 million in short liquidations amid the crypto market crash. As CoinGape reported, altcoin season index has come crashing further to 55 leading to speculation of the end of the altcoin season. As per the Blockchain Center data, the altcoin season index is currently at 55, testing the crucial support of 50. Crypto market analysts expect a bounce back from here. Source: Blockchain Center ETH Price Bounces Back from Crucial Support Levels The ETH price crashed nearly 6% but bounced back from the crucial support of $3,550. Crypto analyst IncomeSharks highlighted Ethereum’s resilience amid recent market fluctuations, noting that the Supertrend indicator remains intact and bullish. “Ethereum ($ETH) hasn’t broken its Supertrend, maintaining a bullish outlook,” the analyst stated. “Currently, prices are holding at support levels, and in such conditions, shorting is not advisable.” Source: IncomeSharks XRP Price Rally to Continue Amid Crypto Market Crash? Amid the broader crypto market crash, the XRP price has dropped 6.2% all the way to $2.25. Crypto analyst IncomeSharks has highlighted a critical juncture for XRP as it tests its Supertrend support. “If bulls can defend this Supertrend level and establish a bullish consolidation pattern, it could provide a strong rationale for re-entry,” the analyst noted. Moreover, another analysis predicts XRP price potential rally to $6.

With as little as $100, savvy investors can gain exposure to emerging projects with exponential growth potential. Among these altcoins, FXGuys ($FXG) stands out as the most promising, leading the charge as a Top PropFi Project . Let’s explore FXGuys and four other emerging altcoins that could deliver massive returns in the next bull cycle. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE 1. FXGuys ($FXG): The Future of Trade2Earn and Staking FXGuys is redefining the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape with its unique Trade2Earn model and revolutionary Trader Funding Program . Designed as more than just a token, FXGuys combines trading incentives with a robust staking system, making it the best defi token for investors looking to maximize returns. Staking Rewards : The FXGuys ecosystem rewards investors through high-yield staking programs that generate passive income. Utility-Driven Token : The $FXG token powers the FXGuys platform, offering real-world utility through funding opportunities for traders and yield incentives for holders. Low Entry Price : At just $0.04, FXGuys presents a golden opportunity for investors to enter early and ride the wave of its projected growth. FXGuys has already raised millions during its presale stages, with demand continuing to surge. For investors seeking top defi coins with explosive potential, FXGuys is the leading choice. 2. Raydium (RAY): A Solana Ecosystem Powerhouse Raydium, a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) within the Solana blockchain, offers a combination of low fees and lightning-fast transactions. Its innovative liquidity pools and automated market-making (AMM) features make it a favorite among traders. Why It Stands Out : Raydium integrates with other Solana projects, enhancing its ecosystem value. Growth Potential : With Solana’s resurgence, Raydium could see significant price appreciation. 3. Flow (FLOW): The Go-To Platform for NFTs and Gaming Flow is a high-performance blockchain specifically designed for NFTs, gaming, and consumer applications. Known for powering projects like NBA Top Shot, Flow has earned a solid reputation in the digital asset space. Why It Stands Out : Its scalability and developer-friendly ecosystem make it ideal for mainstream adoption. Growth Potential : As NFT markets rebound, Flow is well-positioned to capitalize on renewed interest. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE 4. Movement (MOVE): A Rising Star in DeFi Movement (MOVE) is an emerging altcoin focused on providing cutting-edge solutions for decentralized finance. With a growing user base and active development, MOVE is quickly gaining momentum. Why It Stands Out : MOVE’s focus on scalable, low-fee DeFi products sets it apart in the competitive market. Growth Potential : Its accessibility and utility make it a strong contender in the high potential altcoins category. 5. Arweave (AR): A Leader in Decentralized Storage Arweave is revolutionizing data storage with its permanent, decentralized storage solutions. As demand for decentralized cloud services grows, Arweave remains one of the most valuable tokens in the space. Why It Stands Out : Arweave’s “permaweb” ensures data is securely stored forever, a unique feature among storage solutions. Growth Potential : Growing enterprise adoption could significantly drive AR’s value in the coming years. Why FXGuys Is Leading the Pack While all these altcoins present strong growth opportunities, FXGuys stands out for its unique combination of trading utility, staking rewards, and a low entry point. Backed by its innovative Trader Funding Program and Trade2Earn model, FXGuys is attracting attention from both retail and institutional investors, positioning it among the best proprietary trading firms and top defi coins of 2024. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE Conclusion With just $100, investors can enter the crypto market and gain exposure to projects like FXGuys ($FXG) , Raydium, Flow, Movement, and Arweave. Each of these altcoins brings unique value to the ecosystem, but FXGuys’ blend of utility, staking, and growth potential makes it the clear frontrunner. For those seeking the next top defi coin or high potential altcoin , FXGuys is the ultimate opportunity to turn a small investment into life-changing returns.

Coinciding with this development, Binance declared its intent to delist WazirX’s native token, WRX , on December 18th, escalating challenges for the exchange. Allegation of Fraud and North Korea Involvement The court’s directive came regarding a cyber attack reportedly from the North Korean hacking group, that was able exploit the vulnerabilities of the intended platform during the period of sJuly 2024. While attempts to recovery the stolen money have been made , only 57 percent of the lost amount could be recovered implying that 43 percent of the stolen customer money is untraceable. It also drew focus to Masud Alam, a man from West Bengal, who was arrested in November. Alam is alleged to have signed up the fake account which was later sold to a hacker through the Telegram platform to affect WazirX. The actual perpetrator of the attack as still on the loose and this increases pressure on the police force to produce good results. Of Binance, Delisting and WRX Impacts The ruling arrived shortly after Binance moved to suspend its WRX listings over the company’s failure to meet the set operational norms. Although Binance, which has always refuted having any ownership stake in WazirX, says the mentioned exchange platform is operating under Indian laws by Zanmai Labs. The delisting due to be implemented on December 25 has already sparked reactions in the market, with the value of WRX falling over 51% as of writing. Regarding operational integrity concerns, investors’ trust in the platform is still declining. A Path to Recovery? Recently WazirX has stated that it intends to relaunch the platform with a focus on better service and increased transparency and has announced its 5th town hall meeting. It has the vision to begin reopening under a recovery-oriented strategy, with the key of forging a new-age DEX. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Here’s What You Should Know,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/has-bitcoin-fallen-into-the-hopium-trap-heres-what-you-should-know/,"The post Has Bitcoin Fallen Into the Hopium Trap? Here’s What You Should Know appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin price has been surging since the start of the quarter and the U.S. election results offered a huge boost to the rally. With this, the price soared effortlessly and marked highs above $108K, marking a fresh ATH. However, what happened next raised some concerns as the price quickly dropped below $100,000 with the Fed Chair comments on the Bitcoin reserve. This suggests the BTC price could be rising with hope but when they are facing reality, it has negatively impacted the price. Does this signal the rise in the BTC price since November is just a hopium? Will the price face a sell-off after Donald Trump resumes office? After the win, Trump had shared his plans of setting up a Bitcoin reserve, which created huge bullish waves across the markets, driving the price to new highs. However, the Fed Chairman, Jerome Powell, recently commented against forming a ‘National Bitcoin Reserve’. He said that the agency is not allowed to own Bitcoin and they have no plans for a law change, responding to a question to know his thoughts on the BTC reserve. In no time, the BTC price dropped really hard, which raises concerns over it’s performance in 2025 after the new president assumes office. What’s Next—Will BTC Price Face a Crash? In the past 24 hours, contracts worth over $400 million have been liquidated, of which longs have liquidated for more than $335 million and shorts for nearly $83 million. This points towards the market participants waiting for a substantial downturn during Donald Trump’s inauguration. The prediction of a likelihood of unfullied investor expectations regarding swift policy reforms is much expected, as citied by Arthur Hayes, CEO of Bitmex. However, these are just speculations, and the real impact is not much distinct with just a month remaining. Besides the rise in spot ETF volumes, MicroStratergy’s growing BTC holdings strengthen hopes of a consistent upswing. As rightly said by a popular analyst, Lark Davis , the Bitcoin price is expected to keep on moving to it’s ATH as Trump is taking office soon. Rate cuts are happening all over the world and the money printer has turned on with cheap capital flowing into the space. Therefore, the analyst believes the market is at the edge of a mega-altseason, setting the stage for an explosive market rally.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-19 06:17:13

Kiyosaki has urged that, given Bitcoin’s democratic nature, people should buy even 1/2 a satoshi to benefit when the price hits the sky. Robert Kiyosaki co-authored Rich Dad, Poor Dad with Sharon Lechter, a book that propelled him to popularity. The book sold more than 32 million copies and was translated into 51 languages. The book’s highlight is that it stayed on the New York Times Best Seller list for over six years. Kiyosaki always encourages people to invest in digital assets, including Bitcoin , stating that fiat money, the US government, and the dollar are unreliable. The renowned author encourages people to buy Bitcoin even in small units. He has always held that its inclusive design is meant to help people build wealth. Kiyosaki has called on people to act swiftly before 2025. A “sat” (short for satoshi) is the smallest unit of Bitcoin. Named after Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, one satoshi equals 0.00000001 BTC or one hundred-millionth of a single Bitcoin. Rich Dad, Poor Dad author hails Trump as the ‘first Bitcoin president Kiyosaki believes that the current political environment favors Bitcoin and will see it maintain a bullish run. In his X post , he praised the US President-elect, Donald Trump, as “the first Bitcoin President,” claiming that Bitcoin will hit $350k. The US president-elect, Trump, has made moves that are encouraging to crypto lovers. He has outrightly advocated for blockchain technology, saying that it is the future and that people should embrace it. Additionally, his recent choice of appointment to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has renewed optimism in the crypto community. Robert Kiyosaki warns baby boomers of looming economic crash While intensifying his campaigns for crypto, the famous author has predicted the biggest economic crash that may affect all baby boomers. In his X post , Kiyosaki shared his concern, underscoring the tricky position of baby boomers. He mentioned that boomers risk losing their retirement benefits as they solely rely on conventional retirement assets such as stocks, bonds, and homes. He said that when the stock market bursts, boomers are going to lose a lot. Robert Kiyosaki has urged young people to help their parents evaluate their investments before the economic crash. He said the only way to be safe is to invest in Gold , Crypto, or Silver.

As the crypto market heats up, INTL demonstrates more strength and prospects than its peers, suggesting it could surpass the levels previously associated with the top altcoins. Let’s determine how high INTL will likely go during the bull market! IntelMarkets Eyes Higher Levels Than Its Rivals IntelMarkets is prepared to exceed market expectations and leave competitors like Cardano and Render in the dust during this bull run. The AI coin has rallied 711% since its presale began, significantly surpassing the wider altcoin market’s year-to-date (YTD) performance. The IntelMarkets platform harnesses blockchain and AI powers to enhance its efficiency and security. It runs on a dual-chain system, using both Ethereum and Solana to drive its operations. By integrating Ethereum, users will have access to a suite of sophisticated features, such as decentralized applications, liquidity pools, and smart contracts. In addition, transaction costs will be lower compared to other networks with Solana’s integration. With over 10,000 cryptocurrencies available on IntelMarkets, traders have a vast array of options to diversify their portfolios. The upcoming bull run presents an exciting opportunity to explore new coins and expand investment horizons. What sets IntelMarkets apart is its focus on improving profitability and mitigating market risks. The platform does so by introducing AI-powered trading bots to analyze the market thoroughly and suggest the best strategy so that you end up on the winning side even in a turbulent market. Cardano’s Breakout to $2 is Imminent as ADA’s Price Tests Key Support Level Cardano’s ADA eyes an imminent price breakout after a symmetrical show shows up on its one-day chart. It currently trades around $1.059, which is near the $0.916 lower support level. Experts consider this support zone the perfect entry for traders before ADA initiates a rally. With the symmetrical triangle formation, Cardano has shown the potential to hit targets at $1.450, $1.750, and $2.030. Rose Premium, a crypto analyst, suggested traders set a stop loss at $0.89 in case of an unexpected price reversal before ADA hits the set targets. If the price follows the pattern, it could reach $2 before the bull run ends. Cardano’s bullish outlook fueled positive sentiments about ADA’s ability to reach the set price. Meanwhile, ADA trades at $1.09, down 5.80% over the week. Render Scales Descending Trendline: Can It Reach $31 in This Bull Run? Render had demonstrated bullishness on the weekly timeframe as it broke through a descending trendline that ended the October 2023 rally. This breakout has turned RNDR’s outlook from bearish to bullish. Between October 2023 and April 2024, Render traded beneath the $6.50 resistance level, which matched the exact position of the trendline. A rise in volume coinciding with the breakout suggests that the breakout was legitimate. Price has since moved past several resistance levels unhampered as buyers overpower sellers. RNDR recently reached $10.90 after beating the $10 resistance wall. Now, RNDR is targeting $31, a price level it will attain this bull run with sufficient buying power and bullish momentum. Due to the market-wide decline, RNDR recorded a 9.62% drop to $9.20. INTL to Rise Above ADA and RNDR! INTL’s outlook suggests it could surpass ADA and RNDR in this bull market. INTL achieved a 711% increase in 2024 in its presale compared to the other top altcoins. The public presale is now in Stage 8, with INTL trading at $0.073. With INTL targeting a listing price of $0.110, investors can scoop 50% gains when the token hits the target price. Moreover, experts posit that INTL could soar 5,000% after its exchange debut as its adoption rate spikes. This projection presents it as the best cryptocurrency to buy this bull run.

Despite recent underperformance compared to other meme coins and altcoins, technical indicators suggest a bullish trend may take shape. As of now, the asset is trading at $0.00002453, reflecting a 7% decline over the past week. According to market analyst Klejdi Cuni, SHIB is exhibiting signs of an upward breakout, backed by key technical patterns observed on its daily chart. Source: TradingView Daily Chart Shows Potential Bullish Pattern Klejdi Cuni, a prominent analyst on TradingView, has pointed out encouraging signals for Shiba Inu on its daily price chart. Since September, the asset has demonstrated a gradual upward trend, characterized by higher highs. This movement forms what Cuni describes as an oval pattern—a structure often indicative of bullish momentum. One critical factor highlighted by Cuni is Shiba Inu’s ability to maintain strong support around the $0.00002424 level. This price range has held steady for approximately a month, signaling a consolidation phase. The analyst interprets this as evidence of accumulation, suggesting that buyers are gradually positioning themselves for a potential rally. If Shiba Inu successfully breaks out of its consolidation phase, Cuni anticipates several potential price targets. The first target, $0.00003232, would represent a 32% increase from its current price. The analyst also identifies $0.00004 as a critical resistance level, marking a point that SHIB last reached ten months ago. Reaching this level would translate to a 64% gain from its current position. Cuni’s third target is $0.00005675, which would mark a significant 132% increase. This price level was last seen during Shiba Inu’s peak in 2021. For the long term, Cuni suggests that SHIB could reach as high as $0.00007012 in the first half of 2025, representing a 187% surge from its current value. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Market Perspectives Other analysts have also expressed optimism regarding the token’s future, though the asset has yet to deliver the anticipated breakout. Sherif , a cryptocurrency market commentator, has stated confidence in SHIB surpassing its previous all-time high of $0.00008654 during the current market cycle. Additionally, an analyst known as CryptoELITES has projected even greater gains for Shiba Inu, forecasting a potential price of $0.0004729, which would effectively cancel a zero from its current value. This estimate is based on a cup-and-handle pattern observed on the weekly chart, a technical formation often linked to extended bullish trends. If this prediction materializes, it could yield approximately an 18-fold return for current holders. Potential Risks to Consider Despite the optimistic outlook, not all analysts are convinced of a guaranteed breakout. One market expert has warned of a potential decline to $0.000011 if Shiba Inu fails to maintain its bullish momentum. Such a move would signal a significant loss for holders and challenge the asset’s recovery prospects in the short term. While the asset has struggled to match the performance of other cryptocurrencies, signs of accumulation and bullish patterns on its daily chart have led analysts like Klejdi Cuni to predict a potential upward surge. With multiple price targets ranging from $0.00003232 to $0.00007012, SHIB’s future trajectory will largely depend on its ability to break out of its consolidation phase and overcome key resistance levels.

And now the sentiment has deteriorated. Bitcoin's seven-day call-put skew shows that Deribit-listed put options offering downside protection and expiring in one week are trading at the highest implied volatility premium to call options since September, according to data source Amberdata. In other words, put options are the most expensive relative to calls in three months. Its a sign of traders scrambling to hedge their bullish bets against a potential continuation of Wednesday's price slide, triggered by a hawkish Fed. The dour sentiment is also evident from the negative one-month skew, reflecting a bias for puts and a significantly weaker call bias in options ranging from two to six months. These calls traded at a 3 vol premium to puts at press time, down from the 4-5 vol premium observed early this month. On Wednesday, the Fed cut the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the 4.25% to 4.5% range. That's 100 basis points lower than the September levels when it began the easing cycle. Bitcoin declined following the rate cut, as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell described it as a close call and emphasized caution regarding future moves as rates approach the neutral level . Powell also said that the Fed has no intention of participating in any government plan to create a strategic bitcoin reserve, adding that board members do not intend to push for changes to the Fed law. This comes after President-elect Trump's recent mention that his administration would consider establishing a BTC reserve similar to the country’s oil stockpile. Meanwhile, the dot plot, an anonymous graphical representation of where the 19 committee members project the fed funds rates will be in the future, signaled only two rate cuts in 2025 instead of three expected and down from four in September. The dot plot essentially out-hawked the markets, sending risk assets lower. While Dow Jones ended bled 2.5% or over 1,000 points, BTC slipped from roughly $105,000 to under $99,000, according to data source TradingView and CoinDesk. As of this writing, BTC is trading at around $101,200, aiming to recover from overnight losses. Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's value against major currencies, continues to hold on to its overnight gains, holding steady near 108, the highest level since October 2022. A persistent strength in the USD could add to risk assets' woes.",Markets|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Options|Markets|federal reserve,EN,0,0,BTC|COMMODITY|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-19 07:13:09

As we inch closer to the end of the year, the spotlight shines on three meme coins making waves—BTFD Coin, Popcat, and Brett. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or someone looking to dip their toes into crypto, these coins have something unique to offer. With BTFD Coin reaching new presale milestones, Popcat drawing on its meme origins for potential recovery, and Brett leveraging its position on the Base Chain, it’s a perfect time to evaluate your options. This week has already seen meme coins capturing the imagination of investors. Popcat, born from a meme that swept the internet, continues to intrigue with its volatile moves, while Brett’s recent dip presents potential buying opportunities for those banking on its strong ecosystem. And then there’s BTFD Coin , a star that continues to rise with a staggering $4.1M raised in its presale. Meme coins have proven time and again that they’re not just a passing trend. With innovative utilities, loyal communities, and the ability to drive massive returns, they remain a favourite among crypto enthusiasts. So, if you’re wondering which coins to bet on this week, let’s break down what makes BTFD Coin, Popcat, and Brett contenders for the best meme coins to join this week . BTFD Coin: The Bull Run You Don’t Want to Miss Have you ever wondered what it’s like to catch a coin at the perfect dip and ride it all the way to impressive gains? That’s exactly the narrative BTFD Coin is creating for its investors. With a presale performance that has already amassed over $4.1 million, this meme coin is becoming a strong contender for one of the best meme coins to join this week. BTFD Coin, short for “Buy The F***ing Dip,” captures the meme spirit like no other. But it’s not all jokes and fun—this coin packs serious potential with its upcoming play-to-earn (P2E) game, a beta version already live. Combined with staking rewards that offer an impressive 90% APY, BTFD is positioning itself as more than just a meme—it’s an opportunity. Imagine investing $8,000 in Stage 12 of its presale at $0.00013 per coin. When BTFD reaches its post-launch price of $0.0006, your investment would balloon to over $36,900. It’s not just about the numbers, though; it’s about being part of a growing community of over 5,900 coin holders who are riding the bullish momentum. And let’s not forget the fun side of BTFD Coin. Its slogan, “ Own the Dip ,” resonates with crypto enthusiasts who know the importance of buying low and holding steady. If you’re looking for a meme coin that combines community power with strong fundamentals, BTFD Coin might just be your golden ticket. Popcat: Viral Meme Potential Meets Market Recovery If you’ve ever chuckled at the Popcat meme, you’re not alone. This internet sensation now has its own cryptocurrency, and while it’s down 5.8% over the past 24 hours, there’s more to the story. Popcat reached an all-time high of $2.05 in mid-November, and despite its current trading price of $0.9922, it remains a coin with potential for recovery. Popcat’s charm lies in its relatability. As a project inspired by a beloved meme, it enjoys a built-in fanbase that drives engagement. But Popcat isn’t just banking on its viral roots—it’s eyeing the future. Analysts believe that its ability to stabilise and build on its meme appeal could lead to significant upward momentum. For those who love meme coins for their unpredictability and market swings, Popcat offers an exciting opportunity. Its journey from meme to cryptocurrency reflects the evolution of internet culture, and its supporters are banking on the project’s ability to deliver value. If you’re a believer in the power of memes and community-driven growth, Popcat deserves a spot on your radar as one of the best meme coins to join this week. Brett: From Meme Mascot to Base Chain Icon Brett, affectionately known as Pepe’s best friend, is carving out its niche on the Base Chain. Despite a 6.82% drop in the past 24 hours and a current trading price of $0.1562, Brett has shown resilience. It’s backed by a rapidly expanding Base Chain ecosystem that provides a solid foundation for its growth. What sets Brett apart is its potential to thrive within the Base Chain network, which continues to attract new projects and applications. With its all-time high of $0.235 still fresh in memory, Brett’s current dip could be a prime entry point for investors looking to capitalise on its recovery. Brett is more than just a meme—it’s a cultural icon within the crypto space. Its connection to Pepe gives it a recognisable identity, while its alignment with the Base Chain ensures utility and longevity. As the ecosystem grows, Brett’s position strengthens, making it a contender among the best meme coins to join this week. The Bottom Line Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin, Popcat, and Brett stand out as some of the most exciting meme coins to explore this week. Whether you’re drawn to BTFD Coin’s bullish presale performance, Popcat’s viral appeal, or Brett’s solid Base Chain backing, there’s no shortage of opportunities in the meme coin market. Meme coins have a way of turning the ordinary into extraordinary, combining humour with real investment potential. But timing is everything. With BTFD Coin gearing up for its next presale stage, Popcat stabilising, and Brett poised for a rebound, now might be the perfect moment to act. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your spot in one of the year’s most promising meme coin projects.

But change might be on the way. In a recent meeting, the Digital Chamber’s Token Alliance spoke with SEC staffers for Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda to discuss the 2025 SEC Digital Asset Policy Priorities. The crypto regulations in the US have never been clear. Could this mark the beginning of a more open and cooperative era? Hinman Speech Critique One major focus of the discussion was the controversial 2018 Hinman speech. The SEC’s Corporation Finance division has identified denouncing this speech as a priority. It’s been criticized for causing confusion, especially regarding the Howey Test, which determines whether an asset qualifies as a security. This test has been falsly applied to crypto. Critics argue the speech created unnecessary market confusion and a sense of favoritism. Essentially, it’s seen as dividing the industry into “winners” and “losers,” which harms transparency and fairness. Removing the legacy of such informal guidance is seen as a critical step. Instead, experts encourage the SEC to rely on clear, formal rulemaking and no-action letters to provide straightforward compliance paths for crypto asset firms. Building Trust with New Leadership The meeting also shed light on the Token Alliance’s vision for the SEC under President-elect Donald Trump’s administration. Trump’s pick for SEC Chair, Paul Atkins, is viewed as a crypto-friendly figure with deep experience. Commissioners Peirce and Uyeda, known for their criticism of the SEC’s aggressive anti-crypto enforcement, could help lead this reset. The Digital Chamber’s agenda for the SEC’s first 90 days includes some bold moves. These include reviewing ongoing investigations, stopping cases without actual fraud, and rescinding confusing guidance like SAB 121. They also propose withdrawing proposed amendments that aim to redefine “exchange” to include decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Source : X.com Perhaps the most important goal is to shift away from enforcement driven regulation. They requested the SEC to foster a culture of transparency and collaboration. This could encourage innovation within the digital space. What to Expect The Token Alliance is optimistic about what the SEC’s new leadership could bring. Improving the relationship between the SEC and the digital asset industry might pave the way for clearer crypto regulations in the US. This will encourage more innovation, and stronger mutual trust. By focusing on fairness and transparency, this could finally be the fresh start the industry has been waiting for. Will these efforts pay off?

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-19 07:20:19

This bloodbath has been triggered by a series of events, including the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts and global tensions, like Israel’s airstrikes on Iran-backed groups in Yemen. Let’s analyze what caused the bloodbath in Satoshi Street today. Crypto Bloodbath: A Brutal 24 Hours In the past 24 hours, the crypto market saw a huge sell-off, wiping out $588 million in positions. XRP was hit the hardest, with $69 million in liquidations after its price peaked at $2.82, the highest it’s been since 2017, before falling to $2.56. Bitcoin lost $60 million in liquidations after its price dropped below $96,000. Ethereum also took a hit, losing nearly $58 million. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Has Bitcoin Fallen Into the Hopium Trap?

This uncertainty, mixed with a shift from “Extreme Greed” to “Fear” in the market, has contributed to the sell-off. After the FOMC interest rate cuts, both crypto and equities traders were left feeling a bit concerned.

XRP has dropped 6.74%, now trading at $2.35, while Solana has seen a 9.79% dip over the past week, now priced at $208.49. A Few Winners Amid the Chaos Not all cryptocurrencies are suffering. Ethena (ENA) has risen 11.66% , trading at $1.18, thanks to new utility features. Movement (MOVE) has also posted a strong gain of 11.48%, now priced at $0.7171, driven by strong community engagement. After the Fed rate cut, Bitcoin and crypto took a hit, with Bitcoin dropping 5.85% read Bitcoin price prediction to find out what’s next for the market! More Bloodbath in January? Looking ahead, Arthur Hayes , the former CEO of BitMEX, has given a stark warning that the crypto market may see another major sell-off around Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20, 2025. Hayes believes the market may not see a quick turnaround after Trump takes charge as many regulatory policies may get delayed due to political clashes. This can cause market sell-off if regulatory policies are delayed further. On the flip side, it is seen as a buying opportunity despite the sell-offs analyst believe 2025 will be the year of Bitcoin and there might be some major drops before it hits another ATH. Also, there are rumors of a new ETF hitting next year which can help the market recover from this loss. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Recent incidents such as the DEXX security incident where at least $21 million worth of user funds was lost, are evidence of the inherent risks of the crypto world. In this scenario, attackers compromised over 1000 users by simply taking advantage of the existing shortcomings of the platform’s private key management. The One Golden Rule of Crypto: Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins Begin by choosing the right wallet and using the best security practices on offer. There are two types of crypto wallets – Hot wallets, which have internet connectivity and cold wallets, which are stored offline. Apart from these two, there are smart contract wallets which can be programmed. Now let’s examine BNB Chain and Trust Wallet’s opinion on crypto wallet safety and how users can make informed decisions based on them. Lessons learnt from the DEXX security Issue. Before we dive into what crypto wallet security implies, it is necessary that we understand more about the recent security incident mentioned before. DEXX, which is a reputed on-chain trading terminal platform, experienced an attack on November 16 th , 2024, which primarily affected Solana funds. As a result of this attack over $21 million worth of user funds were lost, with about 1000 victim addresses. The community is concerned after finding out that more than 9000 unauthorized transactions were used in the attack. Subsequent investigations into several compromised addresses found out that the stolen funds remain in the hacker’s possession. This points to the fact that a single offender perpetrated the incident. The root cause of the incident was identified as vulnerability in the private key storage of the platform’s server. The API for exporting wallets from DEXX returned private, unencrypted keys. This reveals that DEXX stored private keys on its servers. All this, despite branding itself as a non-custodial wallet – what an irony. Several measures can be taken to prevent this sort of breach. Avoiding Storage of Private Keys: Private keys should never have been stored on DEXX’s servers, as this practice directly contradicts its non-custodial claims . Encryption: Sensitive data should be encrypted during transmission and storage to protect delicate user information. Regular Security Audits: Regular security audits should have been conducted to identify vulnerabilities before they were exploited. Checking whether selected wallets have gone through proper audits is key for users. When investing a substantial amount of funds, it’s better to choose reputed and time-tested platforms to decrease the chances of loss. What to Look for in a Secure Wallet? Consider the following features when looking for a secure cryptocurrency wallet. Secure Key Management Reliable wallets should commit to secure key management. They should ensure that all private keys are generated, stored and managed in the most secure manner possible. Some of the key aspects of secure key management include: Backup and Recovery: Users should be provided with secure backup options. They should also have the ability to recover private keys or seed phrases when needed. Seed Phrase Encryption: Ensure that the wallet has strong encryption measures for seed phrases. Non-custodial design: Go for wallets that do not store their private keys on centralized servers. User should have full control over their private keys. Wallet History and Security Licenses Selecting a secure wallet is undoubtedly the most challenging thing a new Web3 user has to do. Many users face difficulties in determining whether a wallet is secure and follows the best practices and protocols. With that being said, follow these steps to choose a secure wallet. Begin by checking the past records of the wallet and opting for one with a proven history and good reputation. These are likely to follow strict security protocols. Check whether the wallet has passed multiple audits and holds a valid security license. Follow these above steps to make informed decisions. Security Scanners and Alerts Users seldom understand the full implication of a transaction when performing them or exploring dApps. When receiving a given message or prompted transaction from a dApp, it requires a lot of trust from the user’s end. Why? – because its almost impossible to know the full extent of the transaction’s consequences, just by looking at the on-screen prompt. Fortunately, Trust Wallet’s Security Scanner feature solves this problem. This feature is responsible for analyzing transactions and identifying suspicious patterns, even before the funds are sent. This reduces the chances of users accepting or signing fraudulent or unwanted transactions. This feature alone has safeguarded $450 million from being stolen. Wallets with this feature simulate the transaction. They then provide the results to the users instead of just displaying the message or the transaction the DApp requests. This ensures that the client’s action is the same as their expectations. Crypto wallets are known as the gateway to interacting with dApps. But since the users do not fully understand the imitations of transactions, the security scanner feature should be used. Step-by-Step Guide for Choosing a Wallet The main tool for interacting with the crypto ecosystem is the crypto wallet. It functions as the gateway to dApps and blockchain networks. This makes choosing the right wallet very important, even if one is trying to play blockchain games as opposed to storing assets or executing transactions. Before you select a wallet, ask these questions to yourself. Do you want to hold assets long-term or are you simply a day trader? What is the maximum amount of risk you can take? Do you want to engage with dApps, or do you need basic storage or transaction capabilities? Crypto Wallet Types Crypto wallets can come in two forms – software wallets and hardware wallets. Software wallets have to be accessed using smartphones, browsers or computers. Users can conveniently connect with Web3 decentralized applications or get access to their digital assets simply by clicking. This feature makes them popular among crypto traders. The main advantage of software wallets is the level of functionality and immediate accessibility they provide. They are versatile, capable of connecting to dApps seamlessly and be used for use cases such as crypto payments and digital IDs. A good example of a software wallet is Trust Wallet. It is compatible with both desktops and mobile devices. When using a hot wallet on your PC or mobile, it’s crucial to install antivirus software for malware protection to ensure the security of your personal computer or phone. Hardware wallets on the other hand are physical devices used to store private keys in an offline environment. They are considered the safest option for crypto management and storage for this reason. It stores private keys away from internet connectivity. Hardware wallets are ideal for users who prefer an extra layer of physical security or wish to store their crypto assets without frequent transactions. They are also suited for those who like to store their crypto long-term. However, the trade-off is not convenient, as things like transaction execution can take longer. Can hardware and software wallets be used simultaneously? It is possible to use hardware and software wallets at the same time. You can connect Ledger, which is a hardware wallet to Trust Wallet’s( software wallet) browser extension feature. Are smart contract wallets safe? Smart contract wallets use smart contracts that can function as wallets and provide features such as signature validation, asset ownership, and execution. Most use the ERC-4337 industry standard to develop a smart contract wallet even though other methods exist. Smart contract wallets can bolster security and usability compared to traditional wallets. With smart contract wallets, users can get multi-owner accounts, flexible key management, token gas payments, account recovery, batch transactions, and advanced UX with security audits. Conclusion The world of cryptocurrency has both potential rewards and inherent risks. The key here is to stay informed and secure. Prioritize security by choosing wallets that can provide the above-mentioned features. Remember, it’s essential to make well-informed decisions and understand your needs before you choose a particular type of wallet. Lastly, security is a personal thing. Stay vigilant, avoid sharing personal information and use different storage methods.

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $235 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of around $20 billion, has been trapped in a consolidation mode for the past two weeks. Nonetheless, XRP price has already confirmed the onset of a macro bull run after breaking out of a six-year triangular consolidation following the overwhelming victory of pro-crypto US leaders led by Donald Trump . Furthermore, the XRP/BTC pair has rebounded from a crucial support level, amid the ongoing altcoin awakening catalyzed by institutional investors. XRP Whales Loads More Coins According to on-chain data analysis provided by Santiment, XRP whale investors, with a balance of between 100 million and 1 billion tokens, have added more than 860 million XRP coins this week, worth over $2 billion. During the ongoing bullish outlook, XRP whales have relentlessly accumulated more coins along the way. Betting on Robust Fundamentals Backed by Ripple and its robust business models, XRP has gained renewed interest in the recent past. Moreover, the ongoing Ripple vs SEC lawsuit is likely to be dropped under the upcoming Trump administration. On Wednesday, Ripple Labs debuted its fiat-backed RLUSD stablecoin , which has received overwhelming support from both centralized exchanges and DeFi protocols. The launch of RLUSD will significantly bolster XRP’s liquidity and enhance the company’s cross-border payments. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Is Down Today? $588M Crypto Liquidations Trigger Market Panic , Midterm Target From a technical analysis perspective, the XRP price, in the daily time frame, has broken out of a bullish pennant flag formed in the past two weeks.

Sources say Bullish demanded CoinDesk remove the article. According to a Fortune report published on Dec. 18, the Tron ( TRX ) founder’s team allegedly went to Bullish, a crypto exchange firm that bought the media outlet for $75 million last year, to demand the removal of an article about Justin Sun eating Maurizio Cattelan’s $6.2 million dollar banana artwork. The article was published in late November with the title “I Watched Justin Sun Eat the World’s Most Expensive Banana. I Don’t Get It,” which explained the context behind the act itself, the banana’s significance and Sun’s legal troubles with the the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. According to inside sources Fortune spoke with, Sun’s team disapproved of the tone of CoinDesk’s article, which resulted in Bullish demanding CoinDesk remove the article from its website. This request was met with backlash from the CoinDesk editorial staff who disagreed with the decision and asked for the article to be restored with an editor’s note at a meeting last week. Based on crypto.news’ internet search, the article titled “I Watched Justin Sun Eat the World’s Most Expensive Banana. I Don’t Get It.” could not be found anywhere on the publication site. However, it is still available on Yahoo News . This article was last updated on Dec. 2.

It is also important to note that Tron is a major sponsor of CoinDesk’s conference series, Consensus. According to the report, Bullish CEO Tom Farley has not responded to Fortune’s multiple requests for comment. The same can be said about CoinDesk’s editor-in-chief Kevin Reynolds and a spokesperson for Justin Sun, neither of them have confirmed Fortune’s findings. Moreover, sources claimed that Matt Murray, chair of CoinDesk’s editorial committee, resigned on Monday, Dec. 16. Though, Murray declined Fortune’s request for comment. In November 2023, Bullish acquired CoinDesk from its previous parent company, Digital Currency Group. As previously reported by crypto.news, the acquisition raised concerns over CoinDesk’s editorial independence moving forward.

IntelMarkets (INTL) , a new AI crypto, skyrocketed over 700% in presale and is primed to explode after Tier-1 exchange listings. On investors’ and experts’ radars, INTL has been hailed as the next Ripple (XRP) or Cardano (ADA). Its combination of AI with blockchain technology and DeFi paints a bullish picture, touted as the best new crypto to invest in. IntelMarkets (INTL): The Next Breakout Coin? IntelMarkets (INTL) has been rightfully hailed as the next Ripple (XRP) or Cardano (ADA) for several reasons. Its solid fundamentals as an AI-crypto are unrivaled, primed to transform the $347 billion crypto trading market. Additionally, its performance so far has been remarkable—a 700% upswing since its presale debut. In the eighth stage of the ICO, a token costs only $0.073, with over $4.9 million raised in early funding. This low entry is one of its biggest attractions, alongside its massive growth prospects. Industry experts, confident about its potential, predict a 7,500% jump in value after its scheduled listing on Tier-1 exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Even more impressive is its AI-powered trading platform. Unlike conventional exchanges, the trading ecosystem and robots will be completely driven by AI. The cutting-edge Rodeum AI is designed to identify market opportunities and automatically take positions depending on users’ objectives. Ripple (XRP): New ATH Soon? Ripple (XRP), a payment-based protocol, is among the top crypto coins. With a 300% gain to its name in the past three months, it has been one of the top performers. The XRP price retails around $2.5, targeting a breakout above $3 next. Top analysts like Mel_Senechal are optimistic about further upswings, expecting a rally toward $4.20 amid the buzz around the RLUSD launch. Lucasmcn137, another expert, anticipates a new ATH and a rally toward $5 and $7 this altseason. However, investors seeking massive gains have been betting more on projects like IntelMarkets (INTL). Notwithstanding, key technical indicators like 20-VWMA and 9-HMA suggest an increase in the Ripple (XRP) price in the coming days. A breakout above the $3 price level might just spark another big leap—one of the altcoins to watch out for. Cardano (ADA): A Good Crypto to Buy Like the rest of the crypto market, Cardano (ADA) trades upward. It changes hands above $1, registering a 40% gain on the monthly chart. Key technical indicators like the 50-EMA and 50-SMA suggest future upswings, making it among the best altcoins to invest in. At the same time, experts’ bullish stance is unwavering. Cantonmeow, a crypto expert, shared with their followers a potential rally toward $6 and $8 during this bull cycle. Deezy_BTC shares this bullish sentiment, predicting a jump above $10. While the coming weeks and months might be explosive for Cardano (ADA), investors seeking massive gains have been checking out the INTL presale instead. In addition to its significant upside potential, INTL boasts a bullish AI-DeFi narrative. IntelMarkets (INTL): The Next Big Thing After Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA)? The 700% IntelMarkets ’ (INTL) rally underscores its potential and investor trust. Set to explode after its much-anticipated debut, it is arguably the best crypto to invest in. This has drawn comparisons with popular cryptos like Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA), which it might match or surpass.

This bullish push comes amid strong ENA whale accumulation and a recent collaboration with Donald Trump’s crypto project World Liberty Financial . Over the past week and more, there has been continuous whale accumulation for Ethena as its USDe synthetic dollar sees strong demand crossing the $6 billion market cap. Ethena Price Surges Amid Collaboration with Donald Trump Project Despite the broader crypto market crash , Ethena price surged 10% to $1.20 earlier today with its daily trading volume surging 174% and crossing $1 billion. The Coinglass data shows a 20% jump in open interest to $700 million suggesting that traders continue to remain bullish on the altcoin. On the monthly chart, ENA has extended its gains to more than 100% amid the strong demand for the USDe . Spot On Chain has reported significant activity surrounding ENA tokens, highlighting major purchases and wallet movements. Following the announcement of a partnership with Ethena Labs, Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial spent $250,000 USDC to acquire 231,726 ENA tokens just 20 minutes ago. This brings their total holdings to 741,681 ENA, purchased at an average price of ~$1.011, with an unrealized gain of $33,900. Source: Spot On Chain Additionally, substantial whale activity has been detected. A newly created wallet, established 20 hours ago, has withdrawn 5.29 million ENA tokens from Binance at an average price of $1.12, totaling $5.92 million. The accumulation occurred as the token’s price dipped, suggesting strategic buying amid market fluctuations, reported Spot On Chain . Partnership With World Liberty Financial Additionally, Ethena Labs also officially announced its partnership with Donald Trump’s crypto project World Liberty Financial. The partnership seeks to improve USDe liquidity and increase user rewards across WLFI’s DeFi platforms. The announcement mentions the submission of a governance proposal to incorporate Ethena’s sUSDe synthetic dollar as a core collateral asset in WLFI’s forthcoming Aave-based lending and borrowing platform. This is also another major reason behind today’s Ethena Price rally. There’s been a strong demand for Ethena’s USDe synthetic dollar recently. Just over the last month, its market soared by nearly 100% shooting past $6 billion. As a result, of this strong growth USDe is now the third-largest stablecoin leaving behind the likes of DAI. ENA Price Action Ahead Over the last few weeks, the Ethena price has seen strong rejection at $1.2. Although it attempted a breakout above this, the bulls couldn’t sustain the momentum further. Thus, for the rally to continue, it is important that bulls should take the price above this resistance. But considering the growth of its ecosystem, crypto market analysts are predicting much higher price targets of $10 and above for the altcoin.

This marks the third consecutive time the BOJ has opted to hold rates steady, following similar decisions in September and October. Following the announcement, the Japanese yen fell to 155, showing a clear shift towards Bitcoin as investors seek alternative assets. BOJ Interest Rate Unchanged On December 19th, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) decided to keep its interest rates unchanged, sticking with a short-term policy rate of 0.25%. This marks the third consecutive hold, with the nine-member board voting 8-1 in favor. The Bank of Japan kept its policy rate unchanged at 0.25%, pausing its third straight rate hike. The central bank makes policy decisions by an 8-1 vote. The central bank said it was closely watching the U.S. economy because of high uncertainty over President-elect Donald Trump’s… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 19, 2024 While most of the BOJ board members supported the decision, Naoki Tamura, a policy hawk, pushed for a 0.5% rate hike due to rising inflation concerns. His proposal was rejected. However, this move, expected by many, reflects the BOJ’s cautious stance amidst uncertainty over U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s economic plans. Following the BOJ’s announcement, the yen dropped to a one-month low of 155.28 against the dollar before recovering slightly. BOJ Governor Ueda’s Key Remarks After the Bank of Japan’s recent meeting, Governor Kazuo Ueda shared important insights about the bank’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged. He noted that real interest rates are still very low, and if the economy and prices follow the bank’s forecast, there could be future rate hikes. Ueda also mentioned that careful analysis of various economic data will be crucial before making any adjustments to monetary support. He pointed out the importance of understanding the outlook for wages, especially in light of upcoming wage negotiations. Cryptocurrency To Thrive Soon With the BOJ keeping interest rates steady, many investors may seek alternatives like cryptocurrency. Low interest rates make traditional savings and bonds less rewarding, leading people to explore assets like Bitcoin.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-19 07:56:00

Recent reports showed that he lost 918.83K tokens worth $882.66K amid the 12% decline in CRV’s value over 24 hours. This liquidation highlights the risks of leveraging in volatile markets. In addition, the steep price fall reflects the challenges traders face during turbulent market conditions. CurveFI Founder’s CRV Position Liquidated After Recent Buyback On December 19, CurveFI founder Michael Egorov faced a major liquidation event, losing 918.83K CRV worth $882.66K. This comes just after his recent buyback, where he acquired 1.08 million tokens for $1.2 million at an average price of $1.114. The buyback occurred two days before the liquidation, marking his first significant purchase of Curve DAO Token since a similar event in June 2024. According to Spot on Chain analysis , Michael Egorov’s buyback took place on December 17, as he sought to strengthen his position. However, just days later, the price of Curve Dao Token plunged 12% within 24 hours triggering a liquidation event. PeckShield reported the liquidation of Egorov’s position, amounting to 918.83K CRV, worth approximately $882.66K. #PeckShieldAlert #Liquidation Michael Egorov-labeled address (0x7a16…5428) has been liquidated for 918.83K $CRV (totaling $882.66K). pic.twitter.com/ZXehpFZT81 — PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) December 19, 2024 Despite his attempt to increase his holdings in Curve DAO Token, the sudden price drop triggered margin calls, leading to liquidation. This serves as a stark reminder of the perils of maintaining large leveraged positions in an unpredictable market. Analysts warn that this event should serve as a cautionary tale for other investors considering leverage in a declining market. However, Egorov clarified that the tokens were stolen from him during the June 10 “uwu” hack. He described the liquidated tokens as “receipts of Sifu’s promise to repay the hacked funds,” rather than legitimate CRV tokens. Despite that, this development has also fueled concerns over Curve DAO Token’s broader performance, as the token saw a 7.8% drop shortly after Michael Egorov’s buyback . Token Faces Continued Decline Amid Market Pressure CRV token price has dropped by 13% in the past 24 hours, trading at $0.9375 after the latest development by Michael Egorov. It hit a 24-hour low of $0.90 and a high of $1.07, reflecting significant price volatility. With a market cap of $1.17 billion and $536 million in trading volume, CRV’s recent performance highlights ongoing bearish sentiment.

However, the WBTC team filed a lawsuit against Coinbase due to this delisting decision, claiming that the company's delisting decision was due to the launch of its own equivalent product, cbBTC. However, according to the latest development, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal announced that Justin Sun and Bit Global were defeated in the case in question.

The report also predicts that any price corrections during 2025 are likely to ‘remain mild.’ Bitcoin Pullbacks To Be Mild In 2025 Earlier this month, Bitcoin crossed the psychologically significant $100,000 price level, pushing its total market capitalization to slightly above $2 trillion at the time of writing. However, according to the latest edition of the Bitfinex Alpha report, BTC still has significant potential for growth heading into 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Track For $275,000? Analyst Cites Cup And Handle Formation The report highlights several technical indicators, including market value to realized value (MVRV), net unrealized profit/loss (NUPL), and the bull-bear market cycle indicator, which collectively suggest that the market still reflects bullish momentum and is far from hitting euphoric peaks. According to Bitfinex analysts, while diminishing returns might temper Bitcoin’s extraordinary growth seen in previous cycles, the cryptocurrency could still reach $200,000 under ‘favorable conditions.’ The report states: Our view is that any corrections in 2025 will remain mild, thanks to institutional inflows. Historically, post-halving years have seen the strongest rallies. Minimum price estimates stand at $145,000 by mid-2025, potentially stretching to $200,000 under favourable conditions. Indeed, institutional inflows into Bitcoin through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have shown a steady upward trajectory, especially after Donald Trump’s win in the November presidential election. A recent analysis revealed that US spot ETFs now hold more BTC than the wallet of Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. While the report projects a strong long-term bullish case, it cautions that some price volatility may emerge during Q1 2025. These pullbacks, however, are expected to be mild and short-lived. The report also notes that price corrections following Bitcoin halvings have been shrinking in size with each cycle: In previous cycles, once Bitcoin entered price discovery following a halving, corrections before mean reversion to new ATHs were relatively contained. In the 2017 cycle, the maximum correction was 33.2 percent, while the 2020 cycle saw a slightly smaller correction of 27.1 percent. Strategic Reserve May Extend BTC Gains One unique factor in this Bitcoin cycle is the speculation surrounding the potential establishment of a US strategic Bitcoin reserve. Such a reserve could drive Bitcoin prices into the seven-figure range, according to Blockstream CEO Adam Back. Related Reading: VanEck Gives Official Backing To Donald Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve Strategy Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at asset management firm Bitwise, recently noted that creating a strategic BTC reserve could propel the asset’s price to $500,000. Experts believe that if the US establishes a BTC reserve, other nations are likely to follow suit, creating a domino effect that could lead to a significant price surge. In related news, Japanese Member of Parliament Satoshi Hamada floated the idea of Japan creating its own strategic BTC reserve. At press time, BTC trades at $103,953, down 3.7% in the past 24 hours.

This decision leaves a crucial vacancy in the SEC, which oversees the U.S. financial markets. Crenshaw’s replacement must, by tradition, be a Democrat since no more than three of the five Commissioners can belong to the same political party. Her departure, alongside the expected resignation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler in January, signals a potential shift in the SEC’s approach toward cryptocurrency regulation. Gensler is set to be replaced by Paul Atkins, who is seen as pro-crypto , raising hopes within the crypto community for more favorable policies. Crenshaw, an outspoken critic of cryptocurrencies, faced growing opposition in the Senate during her renomination process. Procedural challenges and a lack of support ultimately ended her chances of continuing in her role. Senator Sherrod Brown, a fellow crypto skeptic and recent election loser, criticized her defeat, blaming corporate interests for a ""smear campaign."" Speculation about Crenshaw’s successor is already underway, with names like Chris Brummer, a Georgetown law professor and former CFTC Chair candidate, emerging as frontrunners. Another key contender is TuongVy Le, legal counsel for Anchorage Digital, a crypto bank. Other potential candidates include Jai Messai, Chief Legal Officer at blockchain company Lightspark, and Carla Carriveau, an advisor to New York’s financial regulator. The potential for pro-crypto leadership in two vacant SEC seats has sparked optimism among cryptocurrency supporters. Crypto.com, for instance, recently dropped its lawsuit against the SEC after its CEO met President-elect Donald Trump to discuss key appointments. These developments suggest the industry is gaining momentum and may see a friendlier regulatory landscape. With new leadership on the horizon, including a potential pro-crypto majority at the SEC, the stage is set for significant policy changes. Industry players are watching closely as nominations unfold, eager for a shift in the agency’s stance.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-19 08:04:05

The BitMEX co-founder says in a new analysis that longstanding economic issues will make it “almost impossible” for US President-elect Donald Trump to retain control of both legislative chambers in 2026, meaning he doesn’t have much time to accomplish his policy goals. “The people are impatient because they are desperate. Trump is an astute politician and knows his base. To me, that means he must go big early, which is why my money is on a massive dollar vs. gold devaluation early into his first 100 days in office. It is an easy way to make production costs globally competitive in America quickly. It will lead to an immediate re-shoring of productive capacity, leading to an increase in hiring today and not five years from now. Before we get to the crack-up-boom phase in this crypto bull market, I believe the crypto markets will experience a harrowing dump around Trump’s January 20 th 2025 inauguration day. Maelstrom will be lightening up on certain positions in advance, hoping to rebuy some core positions at lower prices sometime in 1H25.” Maelstrom is Hayes’ family office fund.

ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court described Binance’s compliance as “woefully inadequate” , highlighting that many clients faced significant financial losses due to these failures. She emphasized that ASIC is committed to using all regulatory tools to protect consumers and ensure integrity in the digital asset market. The lawsuit claims Binance did not meet several obligations, including issuing mandatory PDS and TMD documents, maintaining proper internal dispute resolution systems, and training employees to comply with regulations. ASIC also accused Binance of not conducting its business “efficiently, honestly, and fairly.” The regulator is seeking penalties, declarations, and orders for adverse publicity. In April 2023, Binance’s Australian financial services license was canceled following an ASIC review. Binance stated that it had requested the cancellation, citing only 104 users on its derivatives platform at the time. The spot trading platform continues to operate in Australia . This lawsuit is part of a broader regulatory push targeting crypto platforms. Recently, Kraken’s Australian operator was fined $12.8 million for compliance breaches, and AUSTRAC has introduced stricter Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements for crypto ATMs, including transaction monitoring and reporting of withdrawals over $10,000. Globally, Binance faces numerous legal challenges. The Indian government has accused the platform of owing $85 million in unpaid taxes. In the UK, a whistleblower lawsuit alleges that a former Binance employee solicited a bribe from a customer and was later terminated after reporting the misconduct. These mounting legal pressures reflect increasing efforts by governments to enforce stricter compliance across the crypto industry. ASIC’s legal action against Binance underscores the growing scrutiny faced by crypto platforms as regulators work to ensure compliance with financial laws and protect consumers. This case highlights the ongoing challenges for the crypto industry in meeting regulatory expectations.",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-19 08:07:17

According to a report by Wen Wei Po , the price of the Antminer S21 335T, a mining device, has now reached $5,600, or around RMB 40,700, climbing up by 30% compared to last year’s price of $3836.19, which comes to 28,000 RMB. There is even much higher demand for the Antminer S21 XP, a raw mining device with water-cooling facilities, which has continued to cause stockouts on Bitmain’s official website . Huaqiangbei merchants report a surge in bulk orders, with buyers from Russia, the U.S., and Canada purchasing hundreds or thousands of units. This demand is driven by Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) growing price, which has caused mining businesses to become more lucrative even with the inflated costs of equipment.

Renowned market commentator Steph is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) has recently highlighted a critical technical pattern that could signal a transformative moment for the digital asset. This ‘W’ pattern could send #Xrp to $35 pic.twitter.com/PbYFzPhdyY — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 11, 2024 Technical Chart Formation Reveals Promising Signals Examining the monthly price chart, the analyst identified a W-shaped pattern that spans several years. This formation traces back to the cryptocurrency’s notable price movements between 2017 and 2024 and shows the potential for a massive move in the immediate future. The pattern’s origins can be traced to XRP’s remarkable journey from June 2017, when the asset traded at approximately $0.20, subsequently surging to an all-time high of $3.84 in early 2018. Following this rally, the cryptocurrency experienced significant corrections, dropping to $0.11 in March 2020 before recovering to $1.96 by April 2021. Another substantial market correction occurred in 2022, particularly after the Terra ecosystem’s collapse, which pushed XRP to a low of $0.28 in June of that year. The recent market movements in November 2024 have been interpreted as the completion of this intricate W-shaped technical formation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Price Projection and Market Expectations Steph’s market analysis suggests XRP could be positioned for a substantial rally to $35. While the projected target might seem ambitious, some market commentators believe it is within the realm of possibility. At its current trading price of $2.34, reaching $35 would represent a massive 1,395.7% increase. This projection has naturally generated considerable debate within the cryptocurrency investment community. Critics argue that such a valuation would inflate XRP’s market capitalization to approximately $1.9 trillion, which they consider highly speculative. Ralston Maximus, another prominent cryptocurrency analyst, recently called out a critic in the crypto community who described XRP’s chances to reach $35 as ridiculous. Other experts have also predicted targets much higher than $35, showing the confidence the most trusted voices in the crypto world have in XRP. XRP’s recent performance has also bolstered the confidence of investors. Although the asset has experienced some volatility over the past 24 hours, it is currently up over 110% from last month, and bullish patterns like the W pattern highlighted by Steph show that this bullish momentum is expected to continue.

Ripple has launched its native stablecoin RLUSD on the XRP Ledger and on the Ethereum network. Ripple's launch of RLUSD in the heat of the crypto bull market is an excellent example of leveraging market conditions. For now, the launch of RLUSD does not directly threaten the use case for XRP in the Ripple ecosystem; however, there are hypothetical scenarios in which RLUSD adoption could threaten XRP’s role in the Ripple ecosystem. Ripple USD ( XRP-USD ) has been all the rage since the crypto market got into a bull trajectory, following President Trump's election win and his pro-crypto stance during the campaign. One crypto company to potentially benefit from possible policy shifts in the coming administration is Ripple. Crypto enthusiasts are familiar with Ripple Lab’s long-drawn battle with the U.S. SEC and Gary Gensler’s anti-crypto agenda these past years. Now that Trump has nominated Paul Atkins , a pro-crypto businessman, as the candidate to head the SEC, Ripple will likely see a breadth of fresh air and see its years-long case come to a settlement and a close. RLUSD: A Strategic Addition to the Ripple Ecosystem In a full-blown crypto bull market, like we're beginning to witness, product releases and strategic partnerships that are well-timed can amplify the momentum of the related crypto assets, easily creating double-digit gains for these crypto assets. These well-timed events create sustained catalysts for the crypto asset throughout the bull market. Ripple's launch of its stablecoin , the Ripple USD (RLUSD), in the heat of the crypto bull market is an excellent example of leveraging market conditions. As we’ve been using stablecoins more and more in our flows, that really piqued our interest that we should have our own native stablecoin that can be more cost effective and more operationally efficient to use. Jack McDonald, Ripple’s senior vice president of stablecoins. A blockchain network is as strong as the number of users who use it for transactions and other on-chain activities. Ripple’s launch of the RLUSD stablecoin means that Ripple’s blockchain network, the XRP Ledger (“XRPL”), now taps into the $200 billion stablecoin market, and now has access to more users and liquidity. Being a native Ripple product, I believe RLUSD will not struggle to find utility from the get-go. Ripple has facilitated over $70 billion in payments for its enterprise clients, which includes banks and payment service providers, and will now use RLUSD to facilitate such transactions, moving forward. The RLUSD stablecoin was launched on both the Ripple network and on Ethereum. I think it is a smart business move to also launch the token on Ethereum to leverage the Ethereum network's large user base and liquidity pool. Some crypto analysts might perceive the launch of Ethereum - a competing network to XRPL - as counterintuitive and as diluting the focus and use case of XRPL by introducing a competing blockchain, but I see the dual launch as a strategic move. The launch on both blockchain networks opens more use case opportunities for RLUSD. Both the Ethereum network and Ripple’s XRPL network have their unique perks, and I think users will gravitate towards which blockchain to choose for their RLUSD transactions based on the users' specific use case and preference. For instance, DeFi users might prefer using RLUSD on the Ethereum network, while enterprises that offer high-frequency, low-cost payment services, like remittances, may prefer RLUSD on XRPL. Ethereum’s vast DeFi ecosystem and dApps with complex smart contract capabilities are a strength for Ethereum. XRPL’s low fees and fast transactions are strengths for XRPL. However, I feel RLUSD will naturally see more usage on XRPL based on the sheer volume of institutional payments that Ripple processes and Ripple's core focus on cross-border settlements, which XRPL was built from the ground up to handle. Ripple’s efforts to build regulatory-compliant crypto products over the years would pay off here. There has been past scrutiny of stablecoins by regulators, and there have been incidents of stablecoins losing their 1:1 peg to their fiat currency. The TerraUSD (“UST”) stablecoin crash of spring 2022 is one of such depeg cases. There have been recent regulatory actions on stablecoins where Europe-based crypto exchanges have begun delisting a handful of stablecoins , including Tether USD ( USDT-USD ), Gemini Dollar ( GUSD-USD ), Dai ( DAI-USD ), and PayPal USD ( PYUSD-USD ), found not to be compliant with the E.U.’s MiCA regulatory requirements. Ripple’s RLUSD was issued in accordance with the New York State Department of Financial Services stablecoin guidance and will be subject to periodic stringent reporting, including third-party audits of fiat reserves. Based on Ripple’s focus on building institutional and regulatory-compliant crypto products, I believe Ripple will strive to maintain regulatory compliance in other jurisdictions, and RLUSD adoption will expand to those places where other existing stablecoins currently face regulatory restrictions, winning a chunk of the stablecoin market share in the process. RLUSD: A Threat To or a Catalyst For XRP? The launch of RLUSD does not directly threaten the use case for XRP in the Ripple ecosystem. RLUSD is a stablecoin within the ecosystem, while XRP remains a liquidity token. XRP’s use in the Ripple ecosystem has been as an on-demand liquidity (“ODL”) provider in cross-border settlements. When transfers are made in cross-border settlements involving two disparate fiat currencies between a sender and a recipient, XRP serves as a bridge currency or an “interim” currency between the sender and the recipient. The sent currency is first converted to XRP and then converted next to the recipient's local currency. This process allows institutions to carry out cross-border settlements in real-time without needing pre-funding. ODL plays a crucial role in Ripple's cross-border settlement network, and XRP was specifically built and integrated into the XRP ledger to provide such liquidity. XRP has been widely adopted for its role in providing liquidity in the ecosystem over the years. Most institutional partnerships utilizing RippleNet are built around the ODL feature. I see no immediate threats to XRP’s role as a liquidity provider in the Ripple ecosystem. RLUSD and XRP will most likely complement each other in terms of demand. If adoption of RLUSD grows and more cross-border settlements take place on RippleNet, demand for XRP’s as an ODL provider should also surge. It is, however, worth mentioning that the crypto space and its related technologies evolve rapidly, and there are future scenarios that could play out in which RLUSD adoption becomes a threat to XRP’s role in the Ripple ecosystem. For example, a potential threat lies in how well the adoption of RLUSD and the Ripple ecosystem tech stack goes among financial institutions globally. If RLUSD becomes a globally recognized stablecoin, or RippleNet becomes some sort of “standard platform” among financial institutions, and the adoption of RLUSD spreads in key jurisdictions, there could be a workaround in Ripple's tech, whereby the need for XRP’s ODL will erode. This is a hypothetical scenario but shouldn't be ruled out because the crypto world evolves quickly and regulation and adoption are happening at a more accelerated and unpredictable pace. Takeaway Stablecoins have been around long enough, and Ripple's launch of its native stablecoin isn't exactly a jaw-dropping innovation. What is distinctive about RLUSD is Ripple's institutional transaction volume, the payment network, and the institutional partnerships Ripple has built over the years which will benefit RLUSD in terms of adoption. Seeking Alpha I think the launch of RLUSD has already been priced into XRP, as the coin has been on a run since early November, achieving nearly 400% price gain. The crypto market follows the news trader’s idea of “buying the rumor, and selling the news,"" which I think XRP's recent price action has been a reflection of. XRP isn't one of my favorite altcoins at the moment because I think it won't be among the most rewarding crypto assets in this bull season of the market cycle. XRP has had impressive runs in the last two bull markets, especially during the 2017 crypto bull market. However, in the spirit of the current crypto bull market, I'm upgrading my rating for XRP to a “buy” despite my reservations about XRP giving impressive gains moving forward. My rating upgrade to a “buy” is mainly based on the fact that we are in a crypto bull market and going long established crypto assets like XRP is a no-brainer.",XRP-USD,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-19 09:14:42

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Amid the bull market, Binance Coin holders are turning to Lightchain AI for its smart fusion of AI and blockchain, as well as its massive growth potential. Table of Contents Binance Coin, a trusted giant in the crypto market Why Binance Coin traders are eyeing Lightchain AI Why LCAI could be the biggest opportunity of 2024/2025 Lightchain AI has the potential to be bigger than BNB Binance Coin (BNB) has long been a favorite among traders for its utility and consistent growth within the Binance ecosystem. However, growing interest is now shifting toward Lightchain AI (LCAI) , a cutting-edge platform merging blockchain with artificial intelligence. Offering features like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), Lightchain AI stands out for its decentralized AI solutions. With the Lightchain AI Presale ongoing at $0.003, traders are seizing the opportunity for massive gains as LCAI positions itself for 2025 success. Binance Coin, a trusted giant in the crypto market Binance Coin, introduced in 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), has become integral to the Binance ecosystem. Initially launched as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, BNB transitioned to Binance’s own blockchains: the BNB Beacon Chain and BNB Smart Chain. Tokenomics BNB’s total supply was capped at 200 million tokens. Binance implements a quarterly Auto-Burn mechanism to reduce supply, aiming to burn 50% of the total supply, leaving 100 million BNB in circulation. This deflationary model is designed to increase scarcity and potentially enhance value over time. Roadmap BNB’s evolution includes expanding its utility beyond fee reductions on the Binance exchange. It now powers the BNB Chain ecosystem, facilitating decentralized applications (DApps), smart contracts, and various DeFi platforms. Future developments focus on enhancing scalability, interoperability, and decentralization to support large-scale applications like SocialFi, GameFi, and the Metaverse. BNB’s consistent performance, strategic tokenomics, and integration into a robust ecosystem have solidified its status as a trusted giant in the crypto market. Why Binance Coin traders are eyeing Lightchain AI Binance Coin traders are increasingly turning their attention to Lightchain AI due to its fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology, offering significant growth potential. LCAI has a total supply of 10 billion tokens, strategically allocated to ensure sustainability, equitable distribution, and long-term value for its ecosystem participants. The allocation includes 40% (4 billion tokens) for the presale, 28.5% (2.85 billion tokens) for staking rewards, 15% (1.5 billion tokens) for the liquidity pool, 5% (500 million tokens) for marketing and partnerships, 6.5% (650 million tokens) for the treasury, and 5% (500 million tokens) for team allocation. Lightchain AI plans show its emphasis on creativity and expandability. Significant ͏points in process involve creating͏ model that showcase the͏ Proof ͏of Intelligence ͏(PoI) consensus along with the Artificial Intelligence Vi͏rtual Machine (AI͏VM). After that, there will be trial deployment to involve developer͏ and node operators in practical assessment. The launch of a mainnet will bring key features such as dece͏ntralized AI processing and token based transactions. Fu͏rthermore the roadmap detail strategies for expanding ecosystem by forming important partnerships to promote adoption in different sectors and ͏regions. The ambitious ͏advancements highlights Lig͏htchain AI’s potential as appealing investment possibility for BNB traders searching fresh opportunities͏.

You might also like: How Lightchain AI combines AI solutions with blockchain tech Why LCAI could be the biggest opportunity of 2024/2025 Whenever a new token emerges with whispers of 100x or even 500x returns, one question always surfaces. Why should I trust this project? Here’s what makes Lightchain AI (LCAI) stand out. 1. A new consensus mechanism Forget outdated systems like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). Proof of Intelligence (PoI) transforms the game by rewarding meaningful AI computations instead of wasting resources on irrelevant processes. Benefits? Actively contributes to AI development. Energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable. Solves real-world AI challenges rather than consuming resources for nothing. 2. Real-world utility with AIVM Gone are the days of empty promises and zero-use blockchains. The AI Virtual Machine (AIVM) is built to support the next generation of decentralized applications. Designed specifically for AI use cases, such as: Predictive Modeling Natural Language Processing (NLP) Developers are already recognizing AIVM as the go-to platform for groundbreaking AI-driven dApps. In short: it’s not just “smart tech,” it’s a smarter platform. 3. The numbers tell the story A presale price of $0.003 for a project of this magnitude is almost unheard of. Let’s break down the math: $300 investment at $0.003 nets users 100,000 $LCAI tokens. At $1 per token (a realistic 2025 target based on its roadmap), users are looking at a $100,000 return. For perspective, early backers of major players like Solana and Binance Coin saw similarly low entry points explode into fortunes. Lightchain AI is following this trajectory, but with a distinct tech advantage. 4. A robust and transparent roadmap Lightchain AI is not a fleeting project, it’s built for the long haul, with a meticulous roadmap in place. Phase 1 : Prototype development and community expansion. Phase 2 : Testnet launch and fine-tuning for maximum performance. Phase 3 : Mainnet launch, the game-changing moment for mass adoption. Key milestones for 2024 will be pivotal, as the team is already making real progress: Validator nodes are prepped and ready. Testnets are operational. Strategic partnerships with industry leaders are actively in progress. If Lightchain AI delivers even a portion of its ambitious plans, 100x returns will be the floor, not the ceiling. Lightchain AI has the potential to be bigger than BNB Lightchain AI has emerged as a promising project that combines the best of both worlds- artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. With its consensus mechanism, real-world utility through the AIVM, and a solid roadmap in place, it has caught the attention of Binance Coin traders who are seeking new investment opportunities. With a presale price of $0.003 and a projected target price of $1 by 2025, LCAI presents an exciting opportunity for significant returns. Its focus on sustainability and meaningful innovation sets it apart from other projects in the market. Investors looking to diversify their portfolio beyond BNB should keep a close eye on Lightchain AI and join the community to stay updated on its progress.

Kevin O’Leary, chairman of O’Leary Ventures, weighed in on this surge in CEO activity, suggesting that leaders are motivated by Trump’s pro-business stance and anticipated policies. Speaking on The Evening Edit , O’Leary highlighted two key reasons behind this trend: A stable corporate tax rate of 21% and the promise of deregulation. “ This is a phenomenal platform for Trump. Everybody knows he’s pro-business ,” O’Leary said. “ All of a sudden, CEOs want to suck up to Trump in a very big way because he’s got the power, the mandate, and the reach .” Kevin O’Leary: ‘I’m licking my own chops right now’ In the interview, O’Leary drew attention to the improved economic outlook following Trump’s electoral victory. A recent survey indicates a surge in global economic confidence. This is a stark contrast to concerns during President Joe Biden’s term, which O’Leary criticized for policies that burdened American households. The O’Leary Ventures chairman, popularly known as Mr Fantastic, highlighted the speed at which Trump is addressing economic issues. He described his approach as a reflection of what voters demanded. “ This mandate is going to be way better than the last one, a lot more stable and very good for business, ” O’Leary remarked. “ I’m licking my own chops right now. These are good times .” O’Leary noted that the Republican Party’s control of both chambers of Congress alongside the presidency bolsters confidence among business leaders. A cross-industry pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago Executives from leading companies, including Netflix’s Ted Sarandos and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, have visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Sarandos, a long-time Democratic donor, and Bezos are among the many leaders signaling a willingness to work with the incoming administration, even as they navigate past political divides. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, facing a potential US ban on the popular app, met with Trump earlier this week. Meanwhile, leaders from Apple, Google, and Meta are reportedly seeking a more favorable regulatory environment under the new administration. Moreover, Wall Street executives anticipate a reversal of policies they deemed anti-business under Biden, particularly on taxes and antitrust issues. Trump adviser Jason Miller described these meetings as a “vote of confidence” in the president-elect and his economic policies. “ Some of these CEOs are showing that they will be willing partners in the upcoming administration, even if they have not been politically supportive in the past ,” Miller said. He added that many more domestic and international CEOs are expected to follow suit. Despite their enthusiasm, corporate leaders harbor reservations about some aspects of Trump’s agenda, including potential sweeping tariffs and changes to manufacturing subsidies. However, executives see Trump as a dealmaker who responds well to flattery and engagement, making it a pragmatic choice to foster relationships rather than risk public rebukes. Nikki Haley, a former Republican presidential candidate and now vice-chair at consultancy Edelman, urged CEOs to embrace the opportunity to engage with Trump. “ It’s good to let him know what you’re working on, how you’re growing business ,” Haley said, emphasizing the value of face time with the president-elect. “ I’m not talking to any CEOs that are fearful of Trump, ” she added. Corporate America’s efforts to align with the incoming administration extend beyond meetings. Companies like OpenAI , along with financial institutions such as Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, are contributing to Trump’s inauguration, signaling extensive support from the business community.

BlackRock’s Controversial Take,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-bitcoins-21m-supply-a-lie-blackrocks-controversial-take/,"The post Is Bitcoin’s 21M Supply a Lie? BlackRock’s Controversial Take appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After Bitcoin hit an ATH in December the concern related to its Bitcoin has always been known for its fixed supply of 21 million coins. This cap is what makes it unique and valuable, setting it apart from traditional currencies that can be printed endlessly. But now, a video from BlackRock has stirred up questions about whether this limit is truly set in stone. What Did BlackRock Say? In a recent explainer video shared by Michael Saylor, BlackRock highlighted Bitcoin’s fixed supply as a key feature, saying it helps control inflation and maintain value. However, they added a surprising disclaimer: there’s “no guarantee” that the 21 million won’t change. This statement has sparked instant reactions, with some wondering if Bitcoin’s scarcity is really as secure as people think. Critics like Joel Valenzuela even claimed that this could be part of a plan to change Bitcoin’s rules. Can the Total Supply Be Changed? Technically, yes—but it’s not easy. For the 21 million limit to be altered, the Bitcoin community would need to agree on a major change, called a “hard fork.” This would split the network into two versions: one with the original cap and one without it. However, many believe that a Bitcoin without its supply cap wouldn’t be Bitcoin anymore. As Bitcoin developer Super Testnet explained, “The cap defines Bitcoin. Without it, it’s just something else entirely.” The idea of changing the cap often comes down to miners. Miners secure the Bitcoin network and are rewarded with new Bitcoin for their work. But these rewards are halved every four years, and by 2140, all 21 million coins will have been mined. After that, miners will rely only on transaction fees for income. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Hit Record Low Could Hit $120K Soon! , Some worry that this might not be enough to keep miners incentivized in the long run. Removing the cap could ensure miners stay profitable, but it would also disrupt Bitcoin’s core principle of scarcity. So many false statements in just three minutes. Wall Street has really hit a new low with Bitcoin. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 18, 2024 A Look at the Bigger Picture The Bitcoin community has a history of resisting big changes. Back in 2016-2017, miners tried to increase Bitcoin’s block size to improve scalability. Even though 95% of miners supported the idea, the broader community rejected it, showing that Bitcoin’s rules aren’t easily altered. As of now, the 21 million cap is Bitcoin’s unique identity and any change to this can be risky and may bring a wider crypto crash since Bitcoin is on an upward trajectory despite some short-term drops. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

However, its hawkish tone has negatively impacted the cryptocurrency market. In the last 24 hours, the meme coin market has seen a decline of 9.3%. At the time when various crypto markets were struggling due to the sudden shift in market sentiment, a Solana-based meme coin , Fartcoin, achieved a significant milestone. Dive in for details! Fartcoin’s Record-Breaking Market Cap Fartcoin, a new entrant in the meme coin market, recently achieved an impressive milestone of a $1 billion market cap. The performance helped the meme coin to enter the list of the top ten meme coins by market cap. Now, with a market cap of $1,051,271,885, Fartcoin remains the ninth largest meme coin. This meme coin has experienced an astounding growth of 108.6% in the last seven days; it has outperformed almost all the other top meme coins, including Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe and Bonk. In the last one hour, it has surged by over 4.9%. Fartcoin Market Cap: Ups and Downs In late October, the market cap of Fartcoin was just $77,362,059. On November 22, it reached a peak of $428,851,509. On December 3, it slipped to a low of $156,354,644. However, since December 8, the market cap has grown sharply. Soon after achieving the milestone, Fartcoin’s market cap plummeted to $714,713,686. However, it swiftly rebounded back to above the $1 billion market cap level. At the time of writing, the Fartcoin market cap stands at around $1,051,271,885. Growing Community Support for Fartcoin Reports suggest that at least 47,000 holders have joined the Solana-based meme coin project in the last two months. Many see this as a testament to Fartcoin’s growing appeal and community support. Fartcoin & Truth Terminal’s Viral Promotion Reports indicate that ‘Infinite Backrooms’ chat rooms played a crucial role in helping Fartcoin to exponentially grow its popularity. As per reports, meme-driven discussions in these chat rooms created a snowball effect of interest and adoption. In conclusion, Fartcoin’s rise highlights the power of memes and community in driving crypto adoption.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|FIAT|MARKET|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-19 09:24:44

XRP price experienced a sharp 15% decline after the launch of RLUSD, marking a bearish shift after gaining over 110% in the past month. Investors are now assessing what’s driving this unexpected market correction. What’s Behind XRP Price Crash After RLUSD Launch? XRP price witnessed significant volatility earlier this week following Ripple’s announcement of its RLUSD stablecoin launch on December 17. The cryptocurrency initially rallied above $2.8, reaching a multi-week high of $2.7 on the launch day. This surge was fueled by anticipation surrounding the stablecoin and positive market sentiment. The Ripple fell significantly, which was in line with other markets’ decline. The recent rate cut by the Federal Reserve also escalated market-wide corrections which led to the downward trend of XRP. The Federal Reserve has reduced interest rates by 25 basis points, a widely anticipated move supported by 97% of market analysts. What’s the deal with today’s market chaos? The Fed went ahead with a predictable 25 bps rate cut. No surprises there—97% of people expected it. But then, Bitcoin tanked around $100,000. Why? Let me explain without the usual Fed jargon. ————————- This is a glimpse of the premium… pic.twitter.com/wANPW4t2uV — Ali (@ali_charts) December 18, 2024 Whales Buy XRP After Crash Whale transactions exceeding $1 million surged after yesterday’s market crash, suggesting potential accumulation by large investors. Similar spikes occurred after crashes on December 10 and December 2, with transaction counts peaking at 65 and 136, respectively. Source: Santiment XRP Technical Analysis As of 19th December 2024, the price of XRP hovered at $2.37, making a decline of 3% in the past 24-hours. This follows the other decrease in crypto markets, with top altcoins seeing a similar decrease. The 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 42 which is a bearish front. A sustained recovery of RSI above the neutral 50 level may actually support the notion of a bullish reversal. XRP Price Chart: TradingView If the bearish trend persists, the XRP price could break below the $2.3 support level. The ongoing bearish momentum could push the price further down, targeting the stronger support at $2. A breakdown below this level might intensify selling pressure. However, if the bullish momentum makes a comeback, XRP could attempt a rebound , potentially surpassing the $3 mark. The XRP recent dip reflects market turbulence and cautious sentiment after RLUSD’s launch. Investors are eyeing key support levels and whale activity.

Despite investors’ sentiment, some analysts suggest that the King of altcoins is about to kickstart its bullish run to new highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Peak Between $160,000 And $290,000 If These Historical Patterns Repeat – Report Ethereum Sentiment Drops To Yearly Low According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Ethereum social sentiment has hit a one-year low amid its struggle to turn the $4,000 resistance into support. Per the post, this metric reached its most negative levels since December 18, 2023, when ETH was trading around $2,100-$2,200. The analyst pointed out that this is a “classic bullish indicator,” noting that when sentiment hit “rock bottom” a year ago, ETH’s price rallied around 30% in the following weeks. The cryptocurrency climbed to the $2,700 mark by January 12, a key level in ETH’s rally to the March high of $4,093. If Ethereum followed the same pattern, the cryptocurrency could see a jump to the $4,900-$5,000 price range in the next month, potentially turning the next big resistance level into support in the following two weeks. Martinez explained that the crypto’s rally will resume once ETH clears the $4,100 resistance, a level not seen since December 2021. Once this level is recovered, “$6,000 will become a magnet.” After breaking past the $4,000 mark this month, the second-largest crypto has struggled to turn this level into support. Its latest breakout attempt occurred at the start of the week when Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed its previous ATH. While BTC traded above the $107,000 range, Ethereum surged to $4,100 but quickly retraced to $3,900 before seeing a correction to the $3,800 level. Despite the pullback, ETH still registers gains in the weekly and monthly timeframes, recording a 2.3% and 22.6% increase, respectively. Will ETH Break Past $4,000 This Month? Altcoin Sherpa highlighted that ETH is “roughly at the same spot that BTC was at around 70K,” adding that it hasn’t “materially broken this level for years.” In the last three years, ETH has been rejected from the $4,000 level several times but ran to its all-time high (ATH) when it was held in 2021. If it were to mirror Bitcoin’s performance, the cryptocurrency could see a run to its $4,800 ATH before aiming for its first price discovery target of around $5,000. The analyst also noted that December and January are the “best times” for the Altcoin market’s performance. Similarly, Benjamin Cowen previously highlighted that ETH’s pair against BTC is “still following a familiar pattern” where Ethereum historically finds “renewed strength” between December and January. Related Reading: PNUT Memecoin Drops 10% Following Peanut’s Owner Legal Warning To Binance Nonetheless, Sherpa forecasted that the ETH/BTC pair would likely see one “final shakeout” before going “up for a few weeks/months.” To achieve this, the token must break past its recent 0.041 high. Trader and analyst Skew warned that breaking past the $4,000 resistance will take “even more buying pressure” as this price has “some massive seller continuously topping up supply.” Lastly, he stated that holding the $3,800 level was key to continuing the rally. As of this writing, ETH is trading at $3,874, a 2% decline in the daily timeframe.

A major factor driving this surge is the historic drop in exchange reserves, which are now at a record low of 2.4 million BTC. With high demand and limited supply, Bitcoin could soon reach $120K. Bitcoin Exchange Reserve Hit Record Low According to Kripto Baykus, a CryptoQuant analyst, Bitcoin’s exchange reserves have been steadily falling throughout 2024, dropping from 3 million in January to a record low of 2.4 million by the end of the year. This decline signals a change in how investors are approaching Bitcoin, especially among institutional investors. Many of these investors are adopting the “hodl” strategy, removing their Bitcoin from exchanges in favor of long-term holding. Baykus notes that this is a sign of confidence in Bitcoin’s future, with institutional players betting on the cryptocurrency’s potential. Potential Risks Ahead While the supply-side trends are bullish, there are some concerns about Bitcoin’s demand. Yonsei Dent, another CryptoQuant analyst, pointed out a divergence in the Coinbase Premium Index, a metric used to track demand in North America. Despite Bitcoin’s price surge, Coinpedia news reported that the Coinbase Premium Index has dropped. This suggests that the recent price surge may not be entirely driven by U.S. demand, raising concerns about the sustainability of Bitcoin’s rally in the medium term. Bitcoin To Soon Hit $120K As these reserves shrink and Bitcoin becomes scarcer, its price has been rising. At the start of 2024, Bitcoin was valued at around $40,000. By November, it had soared past $100,000, even hitting a new high above $108,000. With Bitcoin’s supply tightening and demand staying strong, experts believe that Bitcoin could continue to set new price records through the rest of 2024 and into 2025. If the current trends continue, Bitcoin could reach new highs, possibly even hitting $120,000.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-19 09:30:17

Litecoin is an alternative to Bitcoin, making it an appealing choice for everyday transactions worldwide. Additionally, with a finite cap of 84 million coins, LTC presents itself as a potential investment for value preservation, akin to Bitcoin’s role as a digital asset. Why is the LTC up today? As Bitcoin price is aiming to surpass the $100K mark, there’s an increasing buying demand in the altcoin market. As a result, Litecoin’s price is attempting to hold above $140. Will Litecoin reach $100? Litecoin price already touched the $100 mark this year; however, it is now well below that price point. By the end of 2024, Litecoin might surge above $150. Will LTC price reach $500? According to our Litecoin price prediction, LTC price might hit the $500 mark in 2028. However, this rally depends on the future buying interest in the altcoin market. Does LTC have a good long-term future? Despite the recent adjustments and potential peak formation, Litecoin exhibits a robust long-term price trajectory and outlook, indicating a very high potential for future growth. If the network continues to witness robust activities and growth, the price might even reach $1000 in no time. Recent news/opinion on Litecoin Almost 80% of Litecoin (LTC) investors are currently making a profit, reaching the highest level since 2021, resulting in an impressive rally. Litecoin price prediction December 2024 Litecoin’s price shows signs of a bullish move as it has been surging heavily for the past few days. As BTC’s price aims for a move above the $100K mark, Litecoin’s price intends to end this month on a bullish note. As a result, we might see the LTC price record a low of $115 with a maximum price of $156 and an average price of $138. Litecoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Litecoin Price Prediction December 2024 $115 $138 $156 Litecoin price prediction 2024 Investors are looking for top cryptocurrencies to buy now in the dip, with the market slump hinting at big opportunities. A critical point for Litecoin is its 2023 halving event, which reduced the mining reward. Initially, miners received 50 LTC per block, but the halving lowered this to 6.25 LTC. This reduction means fewer Litecoins are available, potentially driving up the price if demand remains steady or increases by the end of 2024. However, past halvings haven’t always led to significant price hikes, with prices even falling after the 2019 event. With a projected network and increasing adoption, in 2024, Litecoin’s price is expected to hit a minimum of $54. The maximum price could reach up to $115., with an average trading price around $80.

The coin has been around an all-time high in transactions and active addresses. These figures indicate a strong and bustling network, suggesting good growth potential for Litecoin in 2025. Hence, the forecasted lowest price for Litecoin is $186.72. According to our analysis, the highest possible price for LTC could be $201.25, with an average expected price of $195.03. Litecoin price prediction 2026 Litecoin’s growing popularity is evident in its expanding social media presence, particularly on Reddit, with active users reaching 2021 levels before its all-time high. Experts predict a significant rally by 2026, with prices ranging between $226.67 and $268.45 and an average of $233.15. Advancements from the Litecoin Foundation are expected to drive a strong rebound, boosting its market cap and valuation. Litecoin (LTC) price prediction 2027 In 2027, the price of Litecoin is expected to reach a minimum value of $323.83. The maximum price could be as high as $390.17, with the average trading price throughout the year around $335.49. Litecoin price prediction 2028 In 2028, the lowest forecasted price of Litecoin is $461.29.

Additionally, the growing frequency of events likely to influence LTC’s price could enhance its public perception. By the end of 2024, Litecoin’s price is expected to hit a minimum of $64. The maximum price could reach up to $115., with an average trading price around $80. We expect the LTC coin price to reach a high of $250 in 2027. Litecoin historic price sentiment LTC price history In its early years, Litecoin traded between $1 and $5 before surging to over $300 during the crypto bubble of late 2017 to early 2018. In 2021, Litecoin hit an all-time high of $412.96 early in the year but dropped significantly, closing at $144.56 by the end of the year. In 2022, Litecoin experienced significant losses, dropping below $45 mid-year. However, it managed to outperform the broader market despite a nearly 55% decline overall. 2023 saw high volatility for Litecoin, peaking at $114.50 in July but declining sharply due to market pressures, ending the year at $72.80 with a modest 7% rise despite underperforming the broader market. In 2024, Litecoin started the year around $68.20, climbed to $102.40 in April, and then fell below $80. After further declines in May and June, it dropped to $49 in August before rebounding to $70.

Emerging projects like Solana-based Fartcoin are also attracting the attention of traders after it defied the recent market slump. However, other projects face regulatory scrutiny. Ritardio was recently flagged by the UK's FCA for its unauthorized promotions. Meanwhile, a parody account turned meme coin profits into a $69,000 donation to Save the Children. Meme Coins Gaining Momentum in Global Crypto Holdings A recent survey that was conducted by Binance revealed that meme coins surpassed Bitcoin as the most-held cryptocurrency among users worldwide. The survey was released on Dec. 18 as part of the Binance Global User Survey, and the findings show that 16% of respondents reported holding meme coins, while 14.44% hold Bitcoin. The survey included more than 27,000 participants from various regions, including Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America. Binance noticed that the popularity of meme coins is not limited to current holdings but extends to their future potential as well. Although the survey did not reveal the value of respondents’ holdings, data from CoinGecko estimates the total market capitalization of meme coins to be around $117 billion. Among these, Dogecoin (DOGE) is still a leader, trading at $0.362. Bitcoin’s market cap is higher than $2 trillion, and is trading at $101,000. Survey main takeaways (Source: Binance ) The survey also indicated that there is growing optimism for 2025. Some respondents predicted that artificial intelligence (AI) tokens and meme coins will be among the top drivers of market growth. AI tokens led with 23% of respondents favoring their growth potential, while 19% expressed more confidence in meme coins’ market value rising in the coming year. Google search trends also echoed this interest, and show a peak in searches for ”meme coin” earlier in December. It also reached higher search volumes than ”Bitcoin” during the same period. 30d search volume for ‘meme coin’ (Source: Google ) Interestingly, 45% of the Binance survey participants joined the crypto space in 2024, with nearly one-third engaging in regular trading. Despite their speculative nature and lack of utility, meme coins still gained a lot of traction. Experts speculated about the possibility of a meme coin supercycle, despite some critics comparing their trajectory to initial coin offerings (ICOs) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), both of which experienced dramatic rises before very sharp declines. Whether meme coins actually sustain their momentum or face a similar fate is still up for debate. Fartcoin Defies Market Slump Its not only the larger and more popular meme coins attracting the attention of investors. Fartcoin , a Solana-based meme coin with no utility, captured a lot of attention on Dec. 18 by briefly surpassing a $1 billion market cap and defying a broader altcoin market slump. Over the past 30 days, the token surged by over 250%, which made it an an outlier even as the crypto market faced pressure from the Federal Reserve's announcement of a 25-basis-point rate cut. Fartcoin all-time price action (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Between 8:20 pm and 9:00 pm UTC on Dec. 18, Fartcoin’s price jumped by about 21% to $1.02, which pushed up its market cap to $1.02 billion. However, the rally was short-lived as the coin retraced 16% in hours, bringing its price to $0.83 and its market cap to $838.4 million. At press time, Fartcoin was trading hands at $1.01 after its price again managed to climb by over 20% in the past 24 hours. Despite this volatility, the rise sparked some very humorous reactions across social media. Investor Brandon Beylo commented that “the funniest possible outcome is usually the most likely.” Liquidity Capital’s founder joked about hedge fund managers underperforming against teenagers trading the token in their parents' basements. Fartcoin’s two-month trading history has been riddled with extreme volatility. Since its launch on Oct. 24, the token has fluctuated widely. Some market analysts speculated on the implications of these movements. Unlimited Funds co-founder Bob Elliot commented that Fartcoin’s parabolic rise could signal that monetary policy is still less restrictive than intended. Others like Syncracy Capital’s Daniel Cheung suggested that the current market cycle may offer prolonged “buy the dip” opportunities. The broader market, meanwhile, saw painful losses. Tokens like Dogwifhat (WIF), BONK, and Theta Network experienced double-digit declines. Amid the chaos, some people pointed out that while central banks like the Federal Reserve cannot own Bitcoin, there are no restrictions against owning tokens like Fartcoin. FCA Warns Against Solana-Based Retardio Project Things are not going as well for other meme coin projects. The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a warning about the Solana-based Retardio project due to concerns over unauthorized financial promotions targeting UK consumers. On Dec. 16, the FCA stated that the project may be offering or promoting financial services without regulatory approval. The watchdog also reminded consumers to interact only with FCA-authorized firms for adequate protection. The Retardio project features a Solana-based NFT collection that reportedly achieved $31 million in lifetime sales, alongside its associated meme coin trading under the ticker “Retardio.” The token is valued at around $0.07, and holds a market cap of close to $73 million, according to Dexscreener. Retario price action over the past week (Source: CoinGecko ) According to the FCA, UK consumers dealing with Retardio will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or protection under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). This means that they are unlikely to recover funds if the project collapses. The regulator urged consumers to verify the authorization status of firms through the FCA registry and report unauthorized entities through official channels. In a now deleted response , the Retardio project humorously claimed to have ”issued a warning” against the FCA. Animoca Brands Chairman Yat Siu recently explained in an interview that meme coins represent the value of user attention. Unlike traditional social platforms that obscure the value of user-generated content, meme coins very transparently link market cap to the attention they garner. Siu described meme coins as a tokenized form of attention due to their correlation with user engagement and cultural significance in Web3. Parody Account Turns Meme Coin Profits into Philanthropy A parody X account claiming to represent a former trader donated proceeds from a meme coin inspired by him to charity after the token's value briefly skyrocketed to almost $1 million. The account, named Richard E. Ptardio , received 700 million Richard Ptardio (PTARDIO) tokens on Dec. 17, created through the Solana token creator Pump.fun. The tokens were Initially valued at $53,250, but surged by 1,765% in hours to reach almost $1 million. Despite the windfall, Ptardio distanced himself from the project, and stated that the token was created without his knowledge or consent. After announcing his decision to sell the tokens, he pledged to donate the entire proceeds to Save the Children, a global charity supporting education, health, and other programs for children. While the token's value eventually dropped, Ptardio donated 313.4 Solana, which is worth $69,000, to the organization. It is common for meme coin creators to allocate a portion of their tokens to the people or themes they are inspired by. The account behind Ptardio portrays an older man who spent 35 years trading in London, Hong Kong, and New York before joining the cryptocurrency space in September.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-19 09:31:12

Trump warns BRICS countries of harsh consequences if they reject the U.S. dollar. Experts fear Trump’s duties could disrupt global trade and hurt the U.S. economy. The ongoing battle between the BRICS nations and President-elect Donald Trump over the dominance of the U.S. dollar in global trade intensifies as both sides brace for potential economic impacts. BRICS nations are actively working to reduce their reliance on the dollar. In response, Trump has issued a strong warning, threatening 100% tariffs on goods from these countries if they proceed with alternative financial systems. Russia Defends BRICS Strategy Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov addressed Trump’s threats, asserting that BRICS is not trying to challenge the U.S. dollar directly but instead reacting to U.S. economic policies. In an interview with Tass , Ryabkov explained that the bloc’s actions result from Washington’s decisions, destabilizing the global financial system.

This decline followed the US Federal Reserve’s announcement that it plans to significantly reduce easing measures in 2025. In the past 24 hours, the broader crypto market has also seen over $780.24 million in liquidations. Fed’s hawkish shift surprises markets, driving crypto and stock declines The US Federal Reserve announced that it plans to significantly reduce easing measures in 2025. The Fed proceeded with a 25-basis point rate cut as expected. However, the updated dot plot, a chart showing rate projections from individual Fed members, indicated a 50-basis point increase. This caught markets off guard, which had earlier anticipated a 100-basis point reduction in 2025. The shift spooked markets, sending the 10-year US Treasury yield and the US dollar spiked sharply while cryptocurrencies and stocks took a severe beating. During his press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said : “It’s not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking into a dark room full of furniture. You just slow down.” ~ Jerome Powell Bitcoin is presently trading at $101,393 after paring some losses. Altcoins drop as Bitcoin faces headwinds from Powell’s comments Apart from Bitcoin several altcoins also experienced a significant drop on Wednesday, with Ether plunging 6.5% and XRP falling 12.64%. The GMCI 30 index, which measures the performance of the top 30 cryptocurrencies, fell 7.18% in the last day. Bitcoin’s latest rally has been propelled by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump reaffirming his commitment to establishing a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. Adding to the bullish sentiment states such as Texas, Pennsylvania, and Florida have established bills to form state-backed Bitcoin reserves , amplifying optimism among traders. However, Powell said during a news conference on Wednesday that the central bank is not allowed to hold Bitcoin and is “not looking for a law change,” in response to a question on his view on the U.S. government Bitcoin reserve. Arthur Hayes, former CEO of BitMEX and current CIO of Maelstrom, recently wrote in an article that he anticipates a significant sell-off in the crypto market around Donald Trump’s inauguration in January. He believes investors will begin to recognize the gap between their expectations and the reality of the market. According to Hayes, the market will instantly face the reality that Trump has at best one year to enact any policy changes on or around January 20th. He noted that this realization will trigger a sharp sell-off in crypto and other Trump 2.0 equity trades.

In response to a lawsuit over its November delisting of wBTC, the top wrapped bitcoin product on the Ethereum blockchain, Coinbase said in the very first sentence that it acted “due to the unacceptable risk that control of wBTC would fall into the hands of Justin Sun.” On Dec. 18, the judge hearing the case refused to issue a temporary restraining order barring Coinbase from delisting wBTC while the case goes forward.

Wrapped bitcoin is a form of the world's largest cryptocurrency that can be used in decentralized finance (DeFi) on blockchains other than Bitcoin. Coinbase introduced cbBTC in September, and in November said it would delist WBTC, citing its listing standards. That action prompted BiT Global, a custodian involved in WBTC, to sue the crypto exchange to prevent the removal. A court ruled against BiT Global on Wednesday . There's one more link in the chain: Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain and one of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2024 . In its defense, Coinbase cited BiT Global's links to Sun, who has been accused of fraud and market manipulation in the U.S., as an "" unacceptable risk ."" Sun, who denies the accusations, also became an adviser to World Liberty Financial, a position he gained after picking up a $30 million stake in the platform last month in exchange for WLFI tokens. World Liberty Finance has not explicitly stated its decision to swap the tokens. On-chain data shows it has been active in the market in the past week, picking up millions of dollars worth of Aave (AAVE), Chainlink's LINK and Ethena's ENA tokens, all companies related to it through partnerships or integrations. Sun has little to do with WBTC directly. In August, BitGo, the original and longtime custodian of the bitcoin backing WBTC, said it would distribute control over the project's custody to three entities globally (including BiT Global) instead of just one to help decentralize the operation. BiT Global is registered as a Trust and Company Service Provider (TCSP) in Hong Kong and is a ""strategic partnership between BitGo, Justin Sun, and the Tron ecosystem,"" according to the August release. Sun has no direct or indirect involvement on the cap table of those companies or the listed shareholders of BiT Global, board member Robert Liu said in an October interview Some board members believe Sun’s involvement is actually “good for WBTC,” he said, given the success of Tron, crypto exchange HTX and other businesses. “The Tron blockchain has more than 50% of global market share,” Liu said. “They have the highest turnover rate. So people have no issue putting more than $60 billion of the stablecoin assets circulating on Tron blockchain.”",Markets|World Liberty Financial|Coinbase|BitGo|Justin Sun,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|LINK|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-19 09:36:46

Traditional wallets often lack safeguards to address real-world coercion scenarios. Addressing this challenge, Deus Wallet introduces a new feature: Duress Mode. This technology, integrated into Deus’s non-custodial framework, provides an added layer of security to help safeguard cryptocurrency assets and user safety in high-risk situations. The Issue: Crypto Security Is More Than Digital While digital security has advanced with multi-signature wallets, biometric authentication, and hardware devices, physical security remains overlooked. Criminals have adapted their tactics, targeting crypto holders. Considering Real-Life Examples: 2022, London: Criminals broke into a businessman's home and extorted $1.1 million in Bitcoin at gunpoint. 2023, New York: A crypto trader was kidnapped and forced to transfer $400,000 while held captive. 2021, Bangkok: A prominent investor managing millions in crypto was ambushed by an international gang and coerced into transferring $2.7 million. In each case, victims lacked the tools to mitigate risks under pressure. Standard wallets provide no ""last line of defense"" for these real-world threats. Deus Wallet: Next-Level Protection Deus Wallet tackles this vulnerability with its non-custodial structure and Duress Mode. This approach allows users to retain full control over their assets while incorporating an additional security measure designed to address specific risks. Non-Custodial Goal With Deus, private keys are stored exclusively by the user, not on any centralized server. This eliminates third-party risks such as hacking, insider theft, or regulatory overreach. In an era where centralization poses increasing threats, non-custodial wallets offer unparalleled independence and security. Duress Mode was developed with one goal: to protect users in life-threatening situations. The way it works: Duress PIN Configuration: Setting a secondary PIN during wallet setup. Under Coercion: Entering the Duress PIN instead of the regular one. Seamless Decoy: The wallet opens a ""fake"" account with minimal or no funds, while users' actual assets remain hidden. This feature ensures that attackers see what appears to be the entire wallet balance, without ever suspecting the existence of hidden funds. Deus Wallet is part of a growing movement to rethink cryptocurrency security. As the crypto ecosystem matures, protecting users in both digital and physical spaces is becoming more important. The Bigger Picture: Rising Crypto Adoption: As cryptocurrencies enter mainstream finance, the average user profile shifts from tech-savvy enthusiasts to general consumers, many of whom lack advanced security awareness. Criminal Adaptability: Criminals exploit the pseudonymity of blockchain transactions, knowing that once assets are transferred, they’re nearly impossible to recover. The Security Gap: While solutions like hardware wallets protect against cyber threats, tools like Duress Mode address the issue of physical security. Deus Wallet is at the forefront of this shift, setting a new standard for protecting users and their assets.

However, the crypto market is unpredictable, and profiting trades can bring heavy losses. This is why, this one crypto trader lost nearly $500k on the PEPE token, as his trades were FOMO driven. How A Crypto Trader Lose $500k With PEPE Token? Spotonchain, an AI-driven analytics platform’s X post, reveals that an anonymous trader is bearing heavy losses in his PEPE Coin investment. Although profit and loss are common in crypto trading, a few end up following FOMO, which often leads to losses even when the investment is in a profitable asset. It happened with the trader “0x4ec” who spent 4.75 WBTC and 150K USDC ($1.59M) to buy 60.782B PEPE on December 10. At that time, the token was moving towards a peak but soon entered a downtrend amidst increased volatility as the PEPE price had hit an ATH. Instead of holding, the trader dumped all his PEPE-based tokens at low in fear of further losses, bearing a loss of $477K. PEPE tops the most demanded meme coins list , with its heavy returns and impressive performance over the year. However, the investor bought the PEPE when it was at a peak and lost thousands of dollars as the price corrected over the increased volatility. PEPE Token Downtrend Continues, 11% Lost Today With the Bitcoin price hitting record highs, the market was hitting its prime until today. PEPE Coin and the rest of the cryptos began struggling amidst the crypto market crash , influenced by the FED’s 25 bps rate cuts and Jermome Powell’s take on Bitcoin reserve. With that, the PEPE price has plummeted 11% in the last 24 hours, currently at $0.00001916. However, the drop began even before, and on the weekly charts, the PEPE price has dropped 24%. With that, its market capitalization and trading volume stand at $8.05B and $3.43B. The Nansen Data reveals that smart money began moving from the market, as the smart money traders holding PEPE dropped from 115 to 95 within just two weeks. Nevertheless, many analysts see this as a common correction for the meme coin, which leads to bigger rallies. However, according to the technical analysis, the PEPE token is in a bearish trend, with the RSI falling below 50 and the MACD and moving average representing sellers. A bullish move could happen if the Pepe coin moves past the key resistance at $0.00002821. What’s In This For You? The PEPE Coin lost the battle with the bears, ending with a 24% correction over the week. With that, the PEPE price has moved 32% away from the ATH, currently trading at $0.00001916 under the seller’s presence. One such seller lost nearly $500k after he FOMO bought the token near the ATH and sold it when the token collapsed. Amidst this ATH-induced volatility and the crypto market crash, the PEPE price struggle is likely to continue until it bounces back above the key resistance at $0.00002821.

Traditional wallets often lack safeguards to address real-world coercion scenarios. Addressing this challenge, Deus Wallet introduces a new feature: Duress Mode. This technology, integrated into Deus’s non-custodial framework, provides an added layer of security to help safeguard cryptocurrency assets and user safety in high-risk situations. The Issue: Crypto Security Is More Than Digital While digital security has advanced with multi-signature wallets, biometric authentication, and hardware devices, physical security remains overlooked. Criminals have adapted their tactics, targeting crypto holders. Considering Real-Life Examples: 2022, London: Criminals broke into a businessman’s home and extorted $1.1 million in Bitcoin at gunpoint. 2023, New York: A crypto trader was kidnapped and forced to transfer $400,000 while held captive. 2021, Bangkok: A prominent investor managing millions in crypto was ambushed by an international gang and coerced into transferring $2.7 million. In each case, victims lacked the tools to mitigate risks under pressure. Standard wallets provide no “last line of defense” for these real-world threats. Deus Wallet: Next-Level Protection Deus Wallet tackles this vulnerability with its non-custodial structure and Duress Mode. This approach allows users to retain full control over their assets while incorporating an additional security measure designed to address specific risks. Non-Custodial Goal With Deus, private keys are stored exclusively by the user, not on any centralized server. This eliminates third-party risks such as hacking, insider theft, or regulatory overreach. In an era where centralization poses increasing threats, non-custodial wallets offer unparalleled independence and security. Duress Mode was developed with one goal: to protect users in life-threatening situations. The way it works: Duress PIN Configuration: Setting a secondary PIN during wallet setup. Under Coercion: Entering the Duress PIN instead of the regular one. Seamless Decoy: The wallet opens a “fake” account with minimal or no funds, while users’ actual assets remain hidden. This feature ensures that attackers see what appears to be the entire wallet balance, without ever suspecting the existence of hidden funds. Deus Wallet is part of a growing movement to rethink cryptocurrency security. As the crypto ecosystem matures, protecting users in both digital and physical spaces is becoming more important. The Bigger Picture: Rising Crypto Adoption: As cryptocurrencies enter mainstream finance, the average user profile shifts from tech-savvy enthusiasts to general consumers, many of whom lack advanced security awareness. Criminal Adaptability: Criminals exploit the pseudonymity of blockchain transactions, knowing that once assets are transferred, they’re nearly impossible to recover. The Security Gap: While solutions like hardware wallets protect against cyber threats, tools like Duress Mode address the issue of physical security. Deus Wallet is at the forefront of this shift, setting a new standard for protecting users and their assets. Key Features of Deus Wallet Non-Custodial Architecture: Full control of private keys ensures users’ funds are always theirs. Duress Mode: A revolutionary feature to safeguard assets under physical coercion. User-Friendly Design: Intuitive interface suitable for beginners and experts alike. Advanced Encryption: Multi-layered security protects against cyberattacks. Customizable Settings: Users can define access parameters and Duress Mode triggers according to their preferences. Cross-Platform Compatibility: Available on iOS, Android. In today’s world, digital and physical security go hand-in-hand. Deus Wallet provides a comprehensive solution, ensuring that users’ assets and personal safety are never compromised.

Table of Contents Shiba Inu poised to skyrocket by 1,700% Ethereum trades in rectangular pattern Intel Markets unleashes AI-powered trading platform In summary Shiba Inu (SHIB), the second largest meme coin in terms of market cap, may soon be the next meme token to skyrocket, according to analysts. Meanwhile, whales have been accumulating Ethereum (ETH) and a new AI coin called Intel Markets (INTL) . While ETH looks set for a new ATH, INTL has outperformed many top altcoins in the market, giving investors up to 700% returns on their investments. Shiba Inu poised to skyrocket by 1,700% A top analyst called CRYPTO SHERIFF has said that Shiba Inu could break its previous all-time high price of $0.00008616 in the current bull run. The analyst made this assertion in an X post, arguing that the Shiba Inu coin price surge was inevitable. CRYPTO SHERIFF predicts the value of the memecoin could pump to $0.000085171 in the coming weeks. Another crypto analyst, CryptoELITES, noted the Shiba Inu token could reach $0.0004729 in the current cycle, 1700% up from the current price. The prediction comes at a time when the Shiba Inu crypto is moving in a range-bound price after its meteoric rise in November 2024. At the time, the token rose by about 98% from $0.00001687 to highs of $0.00003343. At the time of writing, however, the token has lost some of these gains. CoinMarketCap shows the value of the Shiba Inu coin has dropped by 6.1% on the weekly chart and 15.1% on the biweekly timeframe. Ethereum trades in rectangular pattern Ethereum , the leading altcoin has been trading in a rectangle channel over the last week after testing and failing to break and hold above the yearly high at $4,093. The Ethereum price could rally toward $4,380 if the price maintains a breakout above this level in the long term. But if the support level near $3,820 is violated, the price of the Ethereum token may drop toward the support level near $3,550. Presently, CoinMarketCap data indicates the Ethereum coin price has small gains of 4.6% and 4.3% on the weekly and biweekly timeframes. Data from Santiment showed Ethereum’s top holders have been bullish. These ones have been accumulating ETH anticipating early bullish signals. The data shows that there are 104 wallets holding more than 100k ETH. Such a build up could form a price rally in the coming weeks.

Shiba Inu (SHIB): A DOGE-Inspired Token on the Ethereum Network Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency that originated as a meme token in 2020. Created by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, it operates on the Ethereum blockchain, which allows compatibility with decentralized applications. Initially launched with a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, half were sent to Vitalik Buterin, who donated a portion to a Covid relief fund and burned 40%, reducing circulating supply. SHIB is part of an ecosystem that includes features like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and future plans for NFTs and decentralized governance. Its Ethereum-based infrastructure provides it with broader use cases compared to Dogecoin, potentially increasing its appeal depending on market trends and utility growth. PEPE Memecoin and Its Growing Popularity PEPE is a deflationary cryptocurrency based on the Pepe the Frog meme. It runs on the Ethereum network and has no transaction taxes or real utility, staying true to its memecoin nature. Released with inspiration from Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, it reached a $1.6 billion market cap in 2023. PEPE uses a burning mechanism to reduce supply and rewards long-term holders for stability. The team plans to expand through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. Its ERC-20 structure benefits from Ethereum’s security. Available on platforms like Binance and Uniswap, PEPE has attracted a strong fan base and remains a simple but notable option in the current memecoin market trend. Floki: A Meme Coin with Expanding Utility and Global Reach Floki started as a meme coin inspired by Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu dog name in 2021. It has since grown into a project with real-world uses and global goals. Its ecosystem includes an NFT metaverse game called Valhalla and the DeFi platform FlokiFi. Partnerships like NOWPayments enable FLOKI tokens for actual transactions, supported by a prepaid Floki Card. The project also focuses on charity by funding schools in places like Laos and Nigeria. Floki has earned attention for its diverse efforts and was listed by The Economic Times as a top meme coin. Its expanding scope and use cases may make it an attractive option in the current market. BONK: A Community-Driven Solana Memecoin BONK is a Solana-based memecoin featuring a Shiba Inu mascot. It seeks to redistribute influence from venture capital-backed tokens to the Solana community. Half of BONK’s initial supply was given to participants in Solana’s NFT and DeFi platforms. After being listed on Coinbase, BONK’s value surged over 100%, making it the third-largest memecoin by market cap in December 2023. Its adoption extends to decentralized apps, including BonkSwap, a new decentralized exchange. While its vast supply and memecoin volatility present challenges, BONK’s strong integration into Solana’s ecosystem and extraordinary rise of over 10,000% in 2023 highlight its potential appeal in this market cycle. Conclusion DOGEN stands out as the ultimate choice for those craving excellence and success. Backed by a 23,700% growth forecast, it aims to redefine market dominance. Unlike PEPE, FLOKI, BONK, and SHIB, which show limited short-term potential, DOGEN is crafted for winners. With a bold community and exclusive rewards, it’s primed for extraordinary gains this altcoin season.

The altcoins suffered even more, with massive price drops from the likes of XRP, AVAX, DOGE, LINK, and many, many others. BTC’s Crash Bitcoin’s price movements ahead of yesterday’s crash were highly positive as the asset had added more than fourteen grand from December 10 until December 17. This resulted in soaring past $100,000 and going all the way up to just over $108,000 to register its latest all-time high. Then, all eyes turned to the US Federal Reserve’s FOMC meeting, which took place yesterday. Although the central bank indeed cut the interest rates as expected by 25 basis points, Jerome Powell made a couple of statements that pushed the entire crypto market south. First, he noted that the central bank might stop reducing the rates next year. He disputed Trump’s promise that the US could start buying BTC, saying that this might not be possible. As a result, bitcoin’s price tumbled hard. It had already retraced to $105,000 after the latest peak but dumped even more to just under $99,000 as the day progressed. Although it has managed to recover some ground and now sits above $101,000, it is still more than 2% down on the day. Its market capitalization has declined to $2.010 trillion on CG, but its dominance over the alts has exploded to 54.6%. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 19.12.2024. Source: TradingView Alts in Deep Red State The alternative coins plummeted even more during the market-wide correction, with numerous double-digit price drops from the top to their respective bottom. Many have recovered some ground but are still deep in the red, such as XRP , DOGE, ETH, ADA, AVAX, LINK, SHIB, DOT, XLM, BCH, CRO, and others. According to Santiment, four of them have a good chance to bounce off and mark some impressive gains. Still, the total crypto market cap dumped from over $3.950 trillion two days ago to under $3.6 trillion during the lows yesterday evening. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

At this point, BinanceUS, the US arm of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, said that it aims to restart USD services in early 2025 in the face of expected changes in US cryptocurrency policy. The announcement comes after regulatory pressure in the US forced the exchange to suspend fiat trading last year. BinanceUS suspended dollar deposits and withdrawals in June 2023 as a result of the SEC's lawsuits and has been operating with restricted banking access since then. “I can't yet give a firm launch date for USD trading to resume, but let me be clear: It's not a question of if, it's a question of when,” interim CEO Norman Reed said in a statement. BinanceUS said that despite regulatory hurdles, the company has maintained stable operations despite the investigation it faces over compliance and alleged financial violations. The CEO said in his statement that despite Binance.US’s restrictive activities and investigations, it continued to support 160 cryptocurrencies and provide staking services for more than 20 assets during this period, which is much more than its closest competitors. The CEO noted that BinanceUS survived the SEC’s 17-month investigation, which included numerous depositions and hundreds of document requests, and that he was confident that the SEC could not find any evidence of wrongdoing on the exchange’s part. “Now that we are alive, our goal is to help crypto thrive and provide freedom of choice to all Americans.” *This is not investment advice.

37835899,187972,1734601796,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/68/37835899.jpeg,Marinade Finance Makes Strategic Investment in SuperSol,https://chainwire.org/2024/12/19/marinade-finance-makes-strategic-investment-in-supersol/,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates, December 19th, 2024, Chainwire Marinade Finance Makes Strategic Investment in SuperSol to Boost Solana’s Growth and Enhance Layer-2 Capabilities. The Solana ecosystem has been witnessing rapid growth and evolution, with demand for scalability, performance, and real-time capabilities reaching new heights. This growth is driven not only by traditional decentralized finance (DeFi) applications but also by the rise of emerging sectors like GameFi (gaming on blockchain) and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN). In response to these expanding needs, Marinade Finance, a prominent self-custodial staking protocol on the Solana network, has made a strategic investment in SuperSol, the first native Layer-2 scaling solution for Solana. Marinade enables SOL holders to automatically delegate their tokens to top-performing validators in a competitive open marketplace, optimizing yields by allowing validators to share fees directly with stakers. Strengthening Solana’s Infrastructure for a New Era SuperSol, designed to significantly enhance Solana’s scalability and performance, aims to address the growing demand for efficient and reliable infrastructure that can support the next wave of decentralized applications (dApps). With a primary focus on sectors such as GameFi, which combines gaming with decentralized finance, and DePIN, which utilizes decentralized networks for physical infrastructure, SuperSol is poised to become a critical component in the future of the Solana blockchain. The investment by Marinade Finance is seen as a crucial move to help SuperSol accelerate its development and adoption. By supporting innovations like SuperSol, Marinade is positioning itself at the forefront of the efforts to improve Solana’s Layer-1 and Layer-2 capabilities, ensuring that the network can handle the next generation of dApps and meet the increasing demand for high-performance, low-cost, and scalable solutions. The Role of Marinade Finance in the Solana Ecosystem Founded in 2021, Marinade Finance has quickly established itself as one of the most prominent players in the Solana ecosystem. The platform allows users to automatically stake SOL tokens, Solana’s native cryptocurrency, while receiving mSOL, a liquid staking derivative. mSOL allows users to earn staking rewards while maintaining liquidity, enabling them to participate in other DeFi activities without locking their assets. Through this innovative approach to staking, Marinade Finance has significantly contributed to the overall growth and decentralization of the Solana network. By providing liquidity to staked assets, Marinade enables participants to earn staking rewards without locking their assets, thereby supporting both network security and a more dynamic ecosystem for decentralized finance. In addition to its core offering, Marinade has become an active participant in broader efforts to enhance Solana’s ecosystem. Its decision to invest in SuperSol is in line with its long-term vision to support projects that aim to improve Solana’s scalability and bring real-world use cases to life. SuperSol: A Key Enabler for the Future of GameFi and DePIN The main challenge facing blockchain networks like Solana has always been the need to scale in a way that maintains high throughput while minimizing costs. Solana’s high-speed and low-cost architecture has made it a popular choice for developers, but as adoption grows and more applications are built on the network, there is an increasing need for solutions that can handle even more transactions without compromising performance. This is where SuperSol comes into play. SuperSol is a Layer-2 scaling solution that builds on top of Solana’s existing architecture to offer increased scalability and enhanced performance. By utilizing SuperSol, developers will be able to create more efficient applications, particularly in GameFi and DePIN - two sectors experiencing explosive growth. In the GameFi space, where games and financial incentives are integrated on the blockchain, the need for high-speed transactions is paramount. Traditional gaming engines often struggle to meet the performance demands of real-time, immersive environments, but Layer-2 solutions like SuperSol can help ensure that these games run smoothly and cost-effectively on the Solana network. Similarly, in the rapidly growing DePIN sector, which includes applications focused on decentralizing physical infrastructure such as networks, energy grids, and other assets, scalability is critical. SuperSol’s advanced Layer-2 architecture is designed to handle the transaction loads and data requirements of such applications, making it an ideal fit for this emerging market. A Strategic Partnership with Long-Term Impact While the financial details of the investment have not been disclosed, Marinade’s support for SuperSol is more than just a monetary contribution - it’s a strategic partnership aimed at fostering innovation and ensuring the continued growth of Solana’s ecosystem. By investing in projects like SuperSol, Marinade is positioning itself as a key player in the infrastructure and scalability efforts that will shape the future of blockchain technology.

It comes at a condition of scaling down its “Bitcoin Project”. As a result, the Latin American nation has also agreed to adopt measures that will improve the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio along with improving its balance. The deal comes following four years of rigorous negotiations between the two parties. IMF Seeks Bitcoin Project Adjustments With El Salvador The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has acknowledged El Salvador’s efforts to improve the country’s fiscal situation by reducing inflation, boosting economic growth, and managing its short-term debt obligations. In the past, the country’s controversial adoption of Bitcoin in 2021 under President Nayib Bukele led to tensions with the IMF. This followed a series of credit downgrades and a decline in bond prices. However, the current deal is likely to resolve long-standing issues affecting El Salvador’s bond markets. The downside to this agreement has been that Bukele government has made concessions regarding Bitcoin. Legal reforms will make the use of cryptocurrency voluntary for the private sector, addressing concerns previously raised by the IMF. Additionally, the IMF noted that the risks associated with El Salvador’s Bitcoin project would now be “significantly diminished” in line with its policies, per the Bloomberg report . On the other hand, the Latin American country continues with its policy of adding one Bitcoin a day to its treasury. Recently, Elon Musk praised the country’s Bitcoin policy and the strategic Bitcoin reserve it has built over the past few years. Unwinding the Chivo Wallet The Latin American Bitcoin nation is willing to gradually scale back its involvement in the Chivo crypto wallet, a project launched in 2021 that has faced significant technical challenges. During its launch, Chivo offered $30 in BTC to new joiners to encourage sign-ups. Although it initially attracted over 3 million participants, the long-term adoption of the digital wallet has been a bit underwhelming. The Chivo wallet saw fewer than 2% of remittances being sent via the platform by 2022. Despite setbacks with the Chivo initiative, President Nayib Bukele has implemented a series of economic reforms, including buying back dollar-denominated bonds at a discount, restructuring pension debt, and refinancing domestic securities. Furthermore, the country welcomes new players with Bitget recently securing a license as a Bitcoin Service Provider in the country. The development comes at a time when Bitcoin is facing strong selling pressure slipping under $100K levels amid the broader crypto market crash soon after the Fed’s rate cut announcement.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 36.39, nearing oversold levels, which could hint at a potential bullish reversal. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close, at $0.38 and $0.40 respectively, suggesting consolidation. Bulls are focusing on the nearest resistance at $0.51. If the price breaks above this level, it could climb toward the next resistance at $0.616, representing a significant increase from current levels. This move could mean a rise of over 30%. On the downside, if the price falls, it may find support at $0.31 or even $0.21. With a 6-month gain of over 200%, Dogecoin has shown strong growth. As the crypto market anticipates an altcoin season, traders are watching to see if Dogecoin can push higher.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 34.51, indicating that SHIB is approaching oversold conditions. The Stochastic oscillator is at 23.71, which also suggests potential undervaluation. The 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is $0.00002572, slightly below the 100-day SMA of $0.00002704, pointing to short-term bearish momentum. Despite recent declines, SHIB may be setting up for a rebound. The nearest resistance level is $0.00003614. Breaking above this could see SHIB targeting the second resistance at $0.00004418, which would be an increase of around 50% from current levels. With a 6-month price increase of over 41% and positive market sentiment for altcoins, SHIB could experience further growth in the upcoming altcoin season.

The latest 25 bps cut and the Fed’s outlook for 2025 hurt the Bitcoin price and the other altcoins within the market. Ever since the BTC price rose above the consolidation around $102K towards the ATH, whales intensified their activity while raising their holdings. In the last few days, whales were seen buying two tokens, Polygon and Ethena, soon after the BTC price breached above the zone. According to the data from Santiment, the whales have accumulated over 36.65 million Ethena and over 40 million Arbitrum over the past week. These accumulations were recorded by the wallets holding between 1,000,000 to 10,000,000 ARB or ENA tokens. In the meantime, the price of ENA has maintained a consistent upswing, while the ARB price continues to plunge. After the latest reversal in the price of ENA, the bulls have been constantly failing to defend the support levels. However, they are trying hard to prevent the price from breaking below the support zone between $0.83 and $0.79 as the sell-offs continue to accumulate. Besides, the MACD validates a rise in the buying pressure while the supertrend has turned bearish, indicating a breach below the levels could be imminent. Apart from these, whale activity over other platforms also rose, but unfortunately, they sold their holdings instead of buying. Polygon (POL) has witnessed a massive sell-off, mainly led by the whales holding between 10M and 100M, which have sold over 80 million POL in the last 48 hours. This is feared to push the MATIC price into a short-term dip or else a major trend could be expected for the POL price rally. The current trade setup of POL suggests the price is in extreme danger of losing another 15% before the end of the year. The price is testing the neckline of the head & shoulder pattern and a breakdown from here may lead to an extended bearish action below $0.45. Meanwhile, the RSI has turned bearish with the base & conversion line of Ichimoku clouds undergoing a bearish crossover, validating the bearish claim. However, if the price manages to sustain within the zone between $0.49 and $0.51, the bearish narrative could be squashed for a while.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|TRADING|ARB|ENA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-19 10:05:33

The article detailed how Sun consumed the $6.2 million banana he had purchased at a Sotheby’s auction . The banana was originally crafted by Maurizio Cattelan and titled as a “Comedian” art piece. The report, titled “I Watched Justin Sun Eat the World’s Most Expensive Banana. I Don’t Get It,” explored the stunt’s context in the art world and included background on Sun, including his legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Source: YahooFinance The SEC has charged Sun with fraud , allegations that Sun and his blockchain company Tron have moved to dismiss. Soon after publication, CoinDesk faced significant pressure. According to sources cited in a Fortune report , Sun’s team complained about the tone of the article, leading CoinDesk’s parent company, the crypto exchange Bullish, to allegedly demand its removal. The incident has grown in tensions between CoinDesk and its new owner, Bullish, which purchased the publication last year for $75 million. These concerns about editorial independence follow Bullish’s assurances that CoinDesk would operate as an independent subsidiary. However, Matt Murray, chair of CoinDesk’s editorial committee, resigned on December 16, and the Fortune report claims this has caused staff unease. CoinDesk Vs. Justin Sun: What’s Bullish’s Stance? Bullish, a crypto exchange led by former NYSE president Tom Farley, has ambitious plans, including a potential IPO next year. Despite these plans, the controversy over the Justin Sun article has exposed potential conflicts between CoinDesk’s journalistic integrity and its business interests. Sources suggest Sun’s team’s objections to the article extended beyond its tone. The article also discusses media coverage of Tron and its alleged connections to illicit finance. Bullish’s acquisition of CoinDesk followed a challenging period for the publication’s previous owner, Digital Currency Group (DCG), which sold the outlet to strengthen its balance sheet. Although Bullish paid $75 million, far less than the $200 million valuations initially anticipated, the purchase was seen as a strategic move to bolster the exchange’s media presence. Since the acquisition, Bullish has emphasized its commitment to maintaining CoinDesk’s editorial independence. However, incidents like removing the Justin Sun article have cast doubt on these promises. The resignation of Matt Murray, chair of the editorial committee, further complicates the situation. Justin Sun: A Polarizing Figure Sun’s decision to eat the banana —a performance art piece designed to provoke dialogue about the intersection of art and commerce—was met with mixed reactions. While Sun’s PR team framed the act as an homage to contemporary art, CoinDesk’s critics dismissed it as a publicity stunt. Sun, known for his extravagant gestures such as paying $4.57 million to dine with Warren Buffett , has a history of courting attention. However, the CoinDesk article also discussed his legal challenges and the SEC’s fraud allegations. The original text, which has been removed but is still available on Yahoo News through a syndication agreement, evoked a mix of skepticism and curiosity. It noted Sun’s penchant for theatricality while also delving into the broader implications of his actions within the art and crypto communities. However, removing the piece has raised concerns about how sponsors can influence coverage, particularly when significant financial interests are at stake. Tron is notably a major sponsor of CoinDesk’s Consensus conference series. Per Fortune, CoinDesk’s journalists reportedly raised concerns over editorial independence during a recent newsroom meeting with Bullish CEO Tom Farley and CoinDesk CEO Sara Stratoberdha. They called for the article to be reinstated with an editor’s note and sought reassurances about the integrity of future editorial decisions. As of now, neither party has commented on any of Furtune’s claims.

Best Token to Buy If You Missed Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) & Ripple (XRP)?",https://timestabloid.com/should-you-bother-with-crypto-best-token-to-buy-if-you-missed/,"From a little financial experiment, cryptocurrencies are today a worldwide economic phenomenon. From Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH), early investors have exhibited amazing gains generating billionaires. However, the crypto market has opened new possibilities as these currencies have developed. Still worth considering cryptocurrencies? Let’s investigate whether crypto investing is profitable and select the best token to purchase if you miss BTC, ETH, and XRP. The Journey of Bitcoin (BTC): A $1 Dream Turned $100K Reality A turning point came when BTC first reached equilibrium with the US currency in February 2011. Early adopters started flooding in, seeing the promise of a dispersed financial system. Bitcoin had jumped to $30 by June 2011, but it wasn’t until late 2013 that it crossed the $1,000 mark, indicating its global presence. The craze started in 2017 when Bitcoin’s price surged to an all-time high (ATH) of $19,850, a figure many felt was impossible. However, the coin exceeded expectations in December 2020, rising to $64,799 quickly. With its price around $101,881.73, Bitcoin’s ATH in 2024 sits at $103,900. Although BTC is already firmly established as “digital gold,” many new investors looking for exponential returns cannot afford its incredible price. Ethereum (ETH): The Growth of the Smart Contract Giant Ethereum transformed the crypto landscape by adding smart contracts, allowing distributed apps (dApps), and creating the environment for the larger DeFi ecosystem. Founded in 2014, ETH first traded for less than $1. It took off only during the 2017 bull market, rising beyond $100 and reaching $414 by June. The trip did not stop there. Ethereum exceeded $1,418 by January 2018 and fell drastically during the crypto winter. Following years of development and adoption, ETH retested its prior ATH in February 2021, and by May, it had skyrocketed to $4,399. Though its utility has spurred Ethereum’s expansion, like Bitcoin, its price has matured, and triple-digit percentage rises are less likely in the foreseeable future. Ripple (XRP): The Sleeper Giant with a Parabolic Rally Starting in 2017, Ripple’s XRP coin shocked many with its explosive growth. From under $0.01 to an all-time high of $3.40, XRP gained almost 51,000% between March 2017 and January 2018. Top cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ripple’s promise of transforming cross-border payments drew institutional interest. However, regulating issues, especially with the SEC, have hampered its recent expansion. Though XRP still has promise, its days of parabolic rallies are behind it. Investors increasingly seek significant returns to more recent coins with untapped potential and substantial use cases. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Best Token for Missed Opportunities Rexas Finance (RXS) is the next great prospect for investors who believe they missed the boat on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. Positioned as a revolutionary token in the real-world asset (RWA) space, Rexas Finance is not just a cryptocurrency but also a gateway to a future whereby tokenization and asset liquidity are seamless. With fractional ownership and worldwide access, Rexas Finance (RXS) lets consumers tokenize real-world assets, including real estate, art, and commodities. Both institutional and retail investors find it appealing since its Certik-audited system guarantees top-tier security and confidence. The cryptocurrency’s presale performance has been outstanding. Priced at $0.15 and in its tenth stage, RXS has now raised approximately $28.46 million in presale money. With each stage selling out earlier than expected, Rexas Finance has regularly outperformed expectations. The expected listing price of $0.20 for late entries guarantees assured returns. Since its first-stage presale, Rexas Finance (RXS) has already experienced a price increase of five times. Analysts project a 47,000% increase so that RXS might be among the most profitable tokens of this cycle. Unlike more established cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, which mainly depend on market mood, RXS is motivated by actual use and acceptance. Set to list on three of the top 10 tier-1 exchanges, Rexas Finance guarantees strong liquidity and accessibility for worldwide investors. The token’s creative approach would be ideal for diversifying their portfolios or making money in the next bull run. RXS provides access to a groundbreaking investment ecosystem and a notable price increase.

Notably, with the South Korean won (KRW) hitting a 15-year low against the dollar, concerns about a looming financial crisis have intensified. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju likened the situation to the 1998 IMF crisis, sparking fears of a potential market collapse. KRW Whales Shifts Focus To USDT Stablecoin The South Korean won recently fell to its weakest level in 15 years, trading at 1,448.9 per dollar. Amid this, USDT commands a 3% premium against the official exchange rate, unofficially valuing it at 1,559 KRW on Upbit, CryptoQuant CEO and founder Ki Young Ju reported. He revealed on X that this premium mirrors exchange rates during the 1998 IMF crisis, warning of severe implications for the economy. Besides, Ki said that amid this topsy-turvy scenario, the KRW whales are now accumulating USDT. Source: Ki Young Ju, X Meanwhile, domestic assets have lost their appeal, with wealthy individuals moving capital abroad, he noted. According to Ki, the government’s rigid measures to defend the currency are exacerbating the situation. He argued that fostering industries and reducing regulations would better attract investments and stabilize the economy. On the other hand, South Korea’s finance minister promised bold interventions to stabilize financial markets. Measures include expanding foreign exchange swap lines and allowing flexible management of forex transactions by local banks. However, these steps have not fully eased market tensions, as evidenced by the stock market performance of the country. The benchmark KOSPI index dropped nearly 2%. South Korea Economic Slowdown Fuels Concern South Korea is likely moving towards a potential market crash ahead, as evidenced by the focus shift of the KRW whales towards USDT. According to a Reuters report , the Bank of Korea (BOK) predicts a grim future for South Korea’s growth. Its potential economic growth rate, now around 2%, could drop below 1% by the 2040s due to low innovation and resource inefficiency. The central bank emphasized that reforms are crucial to reversing this trend. These challenges are compounded by political instability, including the aftermath of President Yoon Suk Yeol’s controversial martial law order . Global macroeconomic factors, such as the US Federal Reserve’s cautious stance on interest rate cuts, also pressure the won. Notably, the KRW fell to its lowest level today after the US Fed announced a 25bps rate cut on December 18. In addition, Jerome Powell’s speech also indicates a hawkish move ahead by the US central bank, which has further weighed on the sentiments. Meanwhile, the BOK urged structural reforms, advocating for innovation ecosystems, balanced regional development, and work-life balance policies to boost growth. Yet, with capital outflows accelerating and domestic confidence waning, the road to recovery seems difficult. Notably, South Korea’s financial turbulence highlights the urgent need for strategic reforms. Without decisive action, the nation risks sliding into a market crash like the 1998 meltdown, leaving both markets and policymakers on edge.

Bitcoin mining economics improved in November as the average price of bitcoin was 31% higher while the average network hashrate rose by almost 4%, the report said. The hashrate , representing the total computing power dedicated to a network, is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty. ""Average daily revenue per exahash was $55,649, which represented a 20.7% month-on-month increase,"" analysts Jonathan Petersen and Jan Aygul wrote. U.S.-listed miners mined less bitcoin in November than the previous month, the bank said. Still, they mined more on a ""network basis,"" accounting for 24.7% of the total network. The bank noted that uptime improved, which could be partly due to colder temperatures as winter approaches. MARA Holdings (MARA) mined the most bitcoin, with 907 in November, and CleanSpark (CLSK) was second, with 622, the report noted. MARA's installed hashrate remained the largest in the sector at 46.1 exahashes per second (EH/s), followed by CleanSpark at 33.7 EH/s, the report added.

USDⓈ-M stands for USD-Margined Futures, a type of cryptocurrency futures contract offered on platforms like Binance. It refers to stablecoins such as USDT ( Tether ) or BUSD (BUSD), which are pegged to the US dollar. These contracts are settled in these stablecoins, rather than traditional fiat currency or the underlying crypto asset. Depending on the contract and position size, the revised leverage tiers will vary from 1x to 75x, enabling traders to fully benefit from their leveraged positions in the crypto market.

Analysts forecast short-term targets of $2.78 to $8.76, with potential for further growth if the price reaches $10. Wait for These Things to Happen Despite the latest correction, which briefly suppressed the price of XRP to under $2.25, Ripple’s native token remains one of the best performers in the market this year. It currently trades at around $2.42, which represents a whopping 300% increase since January 1. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko The pump was long anticipated by the XRP army, and some members might be contemplating whether to sell some of their holdings. However, one market observer, using the X moniker Maxi, said investors should wait a bit longer. The analyst outlined seven vital factors XRP investors should get checked before eventually cashing out. The first element is the launch of Ripple’s stablecoin – RLUSD. As CryptoPotato reported , the financial product meant to be pegged 1:1 to the American dollar saw the light of day on December 17. The second thing is Donald Trump’s inauguration, scheduled for January 20, 2025, while Gary Gensler’s departure from the US SEC is the third factor. The agency’s leader, who is known for his anti-crypto approach, will vacate his post next month, with Paul Atkins replacing him at the helm. The latter has a completely different stance toward the digital asset sector, advocating for implementing regulations that foster innovation in the space. Next on the list is the eventual settlement of the lawsuit between Ripple and the US SEC . The entities have been confronting on the legal front for four years, with some seeing the agency as the underdog. After all, Ripple secured some vital (yet partial) court wins, while the upcoming shift in the leadership of the Commission could lead to a favorable resolution. The other factors investors should wait for include the beginning of the altseason, a potential partnership between Ripple and a large banking institution, and the possible launch of an XRP ETF. XRP Price Predictions Some of the people making bullish forecasts as of late include the X users JAVON MARKS and Dark Defender. The former expects a potential price explosion, while the latter set $5.85 and $8.76 as short-term targets. Most recently, Armando Pantoja also chipped in. He claimed that XRP could be headed toward $2.78 and then $3.87. The analyst went even further, forecasting a mass FOMO effect if the price reach $10-$12, and “that’s when it will get crazy.” The post Don’t Sell Your Ripple (XRP) Until These Seven Things Happen (Analyst) appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Donald Trump|Ripple|Ripple (XRP) Price|SEC,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-19 11:27:33

While some investors made panic sales in the face of these declines, some investors turned the declines into opportunities and made purchases. At this point, Lookonchain said that Chinese investment firm Longling Capital acquired Ethereum (ETH). Chinese investment firm Longling Capital purchased 6,000 ETH following the recent price drop of ETH. Since May 8 last year, the company has raised a total of 75,400 ETH ($180.4 million) at an average price of $2,392 and sold 50,800 ETH ($172.8 million) at an average price of $3,401. “A smart whale (probably associated with LonglingCapital) bought 6,000 ETH after the price drop. This whale is very good at buying ETH low and selling it high, and made a total profit of $83 million.” Ethereum, which has fallen 5.2% in the last 24 hours, continues to be traded at $3,660 at the time of writing. *This is not investment advice.

The Miami, Florida-based company said it bought about 990 bitcoin for an average price of $101,710 each. The latest purchase will bring the amount of bitcoin held in Hut 8's reserve to 10,096, or about $1 billion in market value, and make it among the top 10 largest corporate owners of bitcoin, the company said in a statement on Thursday. The miner is planning to use the reserve through options strategies, pledges, sales or other strategies, according to the statement. Hut 8's CEO, Asher Genoot, told CoinDesk that his firm will be opportunistic in buying more bitcoin in the open market. “Today, the market recognizes and values our strategic reserve, which effectively lowers our cost of capital and strengthens our financial position. As long as this market dynamic persists, we will remain opportunistic in expanding our Bitcoin reserve,” Genoot said. The move follows Hut 8's announcement earlier this month that it started a new $500 million at-the-market share issuance program. At the time, the firm said some of the proceeds from the fund would be used to buy bitcoin in the open market, among other things. MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of bitcoin on its balance sheet, started the trend of buying bitcoin in the open market. It wasn't until MARA Holdings' purchase of bitcoin in the open market this year that this became prominent among the miners. Most recently, peer Riot Platforms (RIOT) bought 667 bitcoin at an average price of $101,135 on Dec. 16. Buying large amounts of bitcoin in the open market has paid off for miners opening up new avenues of raising funds at a time when the industry is grappling with a profit squeeze after the recent Bitcoin halving event. Last month, MARA was able to raise $1 billion in convertible debts—a financial instrument where investors can convert debt into equity—with zero interest. This means investors are willing to let go of the interest income from the debt for the equities that provide them with exposure to bitcoin. Hut 8 said holding bitcoin reserve serves as a flexible option for the firm that can help the company grow. ""We view our strategic reserve as a dynamic financial asset that can be actively managed to drive returns well beyond simple price appreciation,"" Genoot told CoinDesk. ""Together with the significant investments we are making to expand our core operating business—with a clear path to 24 EH/s of self-mining capacity by Q2 2025—strategic Bitcoin purchases in the open market can strengthen our balance sheet and ability to invest thoughtfully in growth,"" he said.

I have a buy rating on the YieldMax Bitcoin Option Income Strategy ETF for lower-risk exposure to bitcoin, despite its high expense ratio. YBIT's covered call strategy offers income from bitcoin's volatility, but caps upside gains; it's up 29% versus IBIT's 73% in three months. Seasonal trends favor bitcoin in Q1, making YBIT a compelling play amid high implied volatility and potential consolidation in bitcoin prices. Bitcoin is up 148% so far this year. Just since the US election, the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency has risen by about 65%. Indeed, bitcoin and its related ETFs have been perhaps the ultimate Trump trade. With the incoming President poised to potentially move to create a “bitcoin reserve” and allow the industry to write its own regulations, there are clear fundamental and policy tailwinds at play for the years ahead. A new ETF is on the scene to help investors potentially capture even more return from bitcoin. The YieldMax Bitcoin Option Income Strategy ETF (YBIT) is a covered call strategy on spot bitcoin. I have a buy rating on the product as I see it as a lower-risk (though with less upside too) play on bitcoin. Its primary drawback is an elevated expense ratio, but I see the fund as being a viable option for those seeking option premium income return from a notoriously highly volatile asset. As it stands, traders price in the potential for 20% more upside to bitcoin this year, underscoring its high volatility. Of course, this is just a ‘max price’ market, and nobody knows how the token will trade for the balance of 2024 and beyond. More Bitcoin Gains to Come? High Volatility Expected Kalshi According to the issuer , YBIT seeks to generate current income via a synthetic covered call strategy on one or more select U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETPs. YBIT is actively managed by ZEGA Financial. When selecting Bitcoin ETPs on which to trade options, ZEGA focuses primarily on the following two key factors: Preference for Bitcoin ETPs that hold “physical” or “spot” Bitcoin over such ETPs that reference Bitcoin indirectly via futures contracts. It prefers Bitcoin ETPs that have sufficient option liquidity to support YBIT’s trading activities. The Fund’s primary investment objective is to seek current income. The Fund’s secondary investment objective is to seek exposure to the share price of the Bitcoin ETP(s), subject to a limit on potential investment gains. YBIT is a small ETF with just $105 million in assets under management as of December 17, 2024. Its annual expense ratio is high at 0.99% while the forward dividend yield is very high at 46%. Of course, the high distribution rate is due to option premium generation that is procured from writing call options on bitcoin-related products. The dividend does not come from the cash flows of a company – that's a key difference for prospective investors to recognize. On liquidity , I also encourage prospective investors to use limit orders during the trading day since the ETF’s median 30-day bid/ask spread is high at 28bps, per YieldMax. Share-price momentum with YBIT is strong right now given bitcoin’s rapid appreciation in the past seven weeks, but its relative return to spot bitcoin is weak due to the nature of capping potential upside through selling upside call options. In the past three months, YBIT is up 29% (total return) compared to a 73% gain in the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). IBIT Soaring, YBIT's Return About Half Last 3 Months Seeking Alpha I also assert that paying attention to seasonal trends with anything crypto-related is key, as the market moves not on fundamentals like profits of a company, but rather on animal spirits like fear and greed. Bitcoin has tended to perform well over the first three months of the year; since 2021, only January 2022 was a negative month in Q1. So, that would augur for a long bitcoin position. Aggressive investors might choose to buy something like IBIT while those who are more risk-sensitive might prefer YBIT. In general, a call-selling strategy should outperform when the asset it tracks falls or trades sideways, but underperforming during quickly rising markets. Bitcoin Seasonality: Strong Q1 History Barchart Now let’s take a look at a key variable for an option-income fund: volatility. Today, implied volatility on bitcoin (using IBIT as a proxy) is high at 60%. Historical volatility has ranged from 40% to 75%, so IV is not too far from where we’d expect it. I think that there may be added implied volatility discounted into bitcoin with the new year looming – a risk is that we could see so-called “tax gain” harvesting among holders who want to sell, but do not want to realize a gain until the following tax year. IBIT: Implied Volatility Near 60% Fidelity Investments As for YBIT’s distribution history, there have been varied monthly payouts. When implied volatility is higher, I would expect larger dividends. The July and November distributions were relatively large, so those who are sensitive to taxes must be aware that high payouts can come about with relatively little warning – July and November were very different in terms of bitcoin returns, so I will be curious to see what the December distribution will be. YBIT: Distribution History YieldMax ETFs YBIT currently uses IBIT options to create its bitcoin exposure. I like that since IBIT is the largest spot bitcoin ETF, so liquidity is high. YBIT: Holdings & Dividend Information Seeking Alpha The Technical Take Now let’s briefly take a look at bitcoin’s technical situation. Notice in the chart below that shares broke out from a bull flag pattern following the November election. Then, $100k was near-term resistance, which the bulls managed to get through without too much delay. I see a measured move upside target to $115k-$120k based on the $45k range height of the 2021-2024 cup and handle pattern. We are getting close to that zone now. Considering that bettors see a $124k max price this year, we might be due for limited upside in the months ahead, making YBIT a compelling play compared to an outright long bitcoin position. Bitcoin: Upside Target $115k-$120k, $100k Support Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line I have a buy rating on YBIT. Now could be a favorable time to own a covered call play on bitcoin, with potential consolidation on tap. Bullish seasonal trends suggest that a material downside move is not too likely, so holding some long exposure with YBIT also fits the narrative and broad set of indicators I see today.",IBIT|BTC-USD|YBIT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-19 11:30:00

Solana and Its Native Cryptocurrency SOL Solana is a blockchain platform designed for scalability and decentralized applications. It focuses on fast transactions and flexible tools for developers. Solana’s approach avoids sharding, relying instead on a high-capacity network for efficiency. Its native cryptocurrency, SOL, is used for transactions, running programs, and rewarding contributors. SOL also gives users access to projects built on the platform. The network’s architecture and support for multiple programming languages make it attractive for hosting high-demand applications. Its potential to handle large volumes of activity has drawn attention from developers and investors. The coin’s appeal in the market depends on ongoing adoption and the success of projects within the Solana ecosystem. AVAX: A Fast and Flexible Blockchain Platform AVAX is the native token of Avalanche, a high-speed, eco-friendly blockchain. Avalanche processes up to 4,500 transactions per second with finality in under two seconds. It uses a hybrid consensus model and features three chains (X-Chain, C-Chain, P-Chain) to handle diverse functions like transactions and smart contracts. A unique feature is its customizable Subnets, which allow users to create new blockchains. AVAX is used for paying transaction fees, staking to secure the network, and powering Subnets. Its low fees, rapid transaction speeds, and flexibility may appeal to users looking for scalable, energy-efficient solutions. Whether AVAX is attractive depends on market conditions and individual investment goals. Polkadot (DOT) and Its Role in Blockchain Interconnection Polkadot is a system that connects different blockchains, allowing them to share data and value without needing a middleman. It uses parachains to make transactions faster and more efficient than Bitcoin and Ethereum. DOT is the network’s token, which is used for managing updates and ensuring transactions are valid. DOT holders can vote on changes to the system and earn rewards by staking. Polkadot was created by Gavin Wood, who also helped build Ethereum, and was launched in May 2020. Its focus on blockchain communication and scalability makes it an interesting option, especially as demand grows for more efficient and flexible blockchain solutions. Polygon (POL) and Its Role in Scaling Ethereum Polygon is a layer two solution for Ethereum designed to improve transaction speed and reduce fees. Its native coin, POL, is used for fees, staking, and governance. The platform uses proof-of-stake, involving validators and delegators to secure the network and process transactions. Originally launched as Matic Network, it rebranded to Polygon in 2021. By allowing users to bridge assets and engage with decentralized applications at lower costs, Polygon expands Ethereum’s functionality. Its low fees and efficiency make it appealing for DeFi activities. The coin and technology benefit from Ethereum’s growing ecosystem, suggesting potential for sustained use in the market. Conclusion SOL, AVAX, DOT, and POL show steady promise but may deliver slower short-term results. For those chasing elite growth and lifestyle, DOGEN emerges as the standout pick. Positioned for a projected 700% rise before its presale closes, it aligns with past breakout tokens and offers unique perks to early adopters seeking dominance and unmatched returns.

The data also indicated that the Chinese banks’ margins are narrowing due to a persistent property slump and a slowdown in China’s economy. Data from Singapore-based firm Data Motion International Trading Pte also revealed that the average mortgage rate for buyers’ first homes in 42 big cities inched up to 3.08% last month from a record low of 3.05% in October. The increase in mortgage rates remains surprising because the housing market is still in a persistent decline that began three years ago. The Chinese housing market prices are still plummeting despite recent signs of improvements in sales following a stimulus push that began in late September. Chinese regulators guide banks to raise mortgage rates on new loans Chinese Banks raise mortgage rates for the first time in 3 years pic.twitter.com/NlP5RWX0ot — Barchart (@Barchart) December 19, 2024 Chinese banks are battling a record-low net interest margin but are still under pressure to boost their books. The pressure seems to be constraining the central bank’s ability to further bring down interest rates. More rate cuts could indicate that next year will intensify the challenge for lenders to find ways to deal with declining loan rates. Shen Meng, a director at Beijing-based boutique investment bank Chanson & Co, believes that home sales will likely remain challenging in the near future, making the rate increase unjustified from a market perspective. “It’s likely that regulators guided the banks to raise mortgage rates on new loans in a concerted move, so as to create enough buffer for further and bigger rate reductions next year.” – Shen Meng, Director at Chanson & Co. The world’s No.2 economy moved to lower costs in late September on as much as $5.3 trillion in outstanding mortgages for homeowners to bolster the property market. Pang Gongsheng, Central Bank governor, revealed that the measures would result in an average 50 basis point cut for borrowers and reduce their annual interest expenses by about 150 billion yuan ($20.6 billion). PBOC’s executives issue guidance to ease price war among banks Figures from Data Motion that surveyed banks’ local branches across Chinese cities also disclosed that 17 out of the 42 cities lifted first-home mortgage rates in November. Cities like Wuhan, Wenzhou, and Changsha recorded the biggest increase of 20 basis points. A report by Caixin revealed that the uptick trickled down from guidance given by local branches of a supervisory body overseen by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC). The supervisory body known as the interest rate self-disciplinary mechanism cited two unnamed bank executives. The report also disclosed that the executives’ guidance was intended to ease a “price war” among banks that undermined profitability as they raced to slash mortgage rates to draw clients. Official data also indicated that combined profits at commercial lenders edged up just 0.5% in the first three quarters to 1.9 trillion yuan. The data also showed that total non-performing loans surged to a record 3.4 trillion yuan at the end of September. Net interest margins also narrowed to 1.53%, the lowest ever and well below the 1.8% threshold regarded as necessary to maintain reasonable profitability. The nation’s central bank cut the reserve requirement ratio in recent years to free up low-cost money and address lenders’ profit pressure. China’s banks also cut deposit rates to reduce funding costs. The country’s authorities joined in vowing to beef up capital positions at the biggest state-owned lenders using funding from the sale of special sovereign bonds.

Notably, the other cryptocurrencies are Mines of Dalarnia (DAR), IOTA (IOTA), Livepeer (LPT), Harmony (ONE), and Horizen (ZEN). Notably, these updates from the leading crypto exchange has caught investors’ attention, as such updates usually impact the market sentiment. Binance Updates Leverage Tiers for Key Perpetual Contracts Binance Futures has unveiled new leverage and margin tiers for select USDT perpetual contracts, aligning its offerings with market dynamics. The update introduces adjusted tiers for DARUSDT, MEUSDT, CAKEUSDT, IOTAUSDT, LPTUSDT, ONEUSDT, and ZENUSDT. The revised leverage structure affects several notable pairs. For DARUSDT, the maximum leverage was reduced from 75x to 50x for positions below $10,000. Similarly, MEUSDT retains its 75x leverage for positions under $10,000 but adjusts tiers for larger positions, increasing the margin requirement for trades exceeding $3 million. CAKEUSDT, a widely traded pair, also sees adjustments, maintaining 75x leverage for small positions while recalibrating margin rates for trades exceeding $5 million. For IOTAUSDT and LPTUSDT, smaller position tiers experience leverage increases, ensuring competitive conditions for traders managing smaller portfolios. On the other hand, larger trades, such as those exceeding $2 million for ZENUSDT or ONEUSDT, now require higher maintenance margins, reflecting Binance’s focus on mitigating risks in volatile markets. These updates underscore the top crypto exchange’s commitment to maintaining a secure and efficient trading environment. The adjustments apply to new positions opened after December 19, 08:15 (UTC). Existing positions remain unaffected, offering seamless continuity for traders. This strategic move highlights Binance’s adaptability and dedication to optimizing trading conditions. Price Impact: DAR, ME, CAKE, and Others Experience Volatility The Binance Futures leverage update has led to varying price movements across multiple tokens. However, the tokens’ declines could also be due to the gloomy sentiment noted in the broader crypto market . Mines of Dalarnia (DAR) trades at $0.162, marking a 4% drop in the last 24 hours. It has a market cap of $100 million and a 24-hour trading volume of $33 million. Magic Eden (ME) price declined 10% in the last 24 hours and exchanged hands at $2.80. The token has a market cap of $372 million, with a 24-hour trading volume of $317 million. ME token previously surged to $25 before crashing by 80% after its Binance listing. PancakeSwap (CAKE) price was trading at $2.763, down by 8% in the last 24 hours. Its market cap stands at $797 million, with a 24-hour trading volume of $187 million. The 24-hour price range was $2.75 to $3.07. IOTA (IOTA) price traded at $0.32, showing an 8% drop in the last 24 hours. With a market cap of $1.17 billion and a trading volume of $115 million, its 24-hour low and high were $0.30 and $0.36, respectively. Livepeer (LPT) traded at $13.45, marking a 10% drop in the last 24 hours. Harmony (ONE) price was down 12% in the 24-hour time frame and exchanged hands at $0.0275. It has a market cap of $393 million and a 24-hour trading volume of $41 million. Horizen (ZEN) traded at $15.35, reflecting a 6% increase in the last 24 hours. The token has a market cap of $241 million, with a trading volume of $79 million. Its 24-hour price range was between $13.90 and $15.77. Binance plays a crucial role in the price movement of many cryptocurrencies, with its announcements having a significant impact. Recently, Binance delisted the SUI and HMSTR trading pairs, leading to noticeable price drops for these coins.

The proposal is expected to rebuild trust and encourage innovation. The next three months will be critical for shaping a more balanced regulatory approach under Trump. Recognized as a pro-crypto advocate, the Paul Atkins-led SEC could signal potential regulatory changes and improve crypto relations under the Trump administration. This shift could lead to clearer and more supportive regulations for the crypto industry. In a December 18 statement , the Digital Chamber said, “The digital asset industry is striving to operate responsibly, and the SEC must recognize this to foster a productive and transparent ecosystem.” The group emphasized the need for mutual trust. The SEC has been criticized for “regulating through enforcement”, which has caused much confusion and slowed down innovations. The Digital Chamber’s Token Alliance is calling for a change by urging the SEC to build trust with the crypto industry. It believes this can happen if the SEC recognizes that most crypto participants act responsibly. it also maintains that a more transparent approach would help both sides move forward. The 90-day crypto plan The Token Alliance has proposed a 90-day plan to change the way how SEC handles cryptocurrency regulations. One key suggestion is to immediately review all current crypto-related investigations, Wells notices, and lawsuits. The plan also calls for pausing litigation in cases that don’t involve fraud, investor harm, or immediate risk. This includes major cases involving companies like Binance, Coinbase, and Ripple, which have caused inconveniences between the SEC and the crypto industry on a regular basis. The goal is to create a more balanced approach and avoid obstructing innovation. This reset’s goal is especially to build trust and clear up confusion in the digital asset space. The Alliance suggests removing outdated rules that have caused confusion, including the 2019 framework applying the Howey test to digital assets and the 2018 “Hinman Speech.” The group also wants to stop regulating the industry through enforcement actions. Instead, it urges the SEC to create clear and consistent rules to help businesses. These changes are necessary to clear up confusion, make the market fairer, rebuild trust in investors, and encourage innovation in the crypto world. Another priority is to deal with the burden of Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which forces companies holding cryptocurrencies to list them as liabilities. The Token Alliance argues that this rule pushes investors away from the U.S. market and to the riskier options abroad. Although President Biden rejected a bill to repeal SAB 121, may be the new administration could reverse this decision and provide relief. It also mentioned reconsidering the SEC’s plan to expand “exchanges” to cover decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms under Rule 3b-16. Critics argue that this could limit innovation in the DeFi space and reduce its benefits. SEC’s new era Paul Atkins is expected to take a different approach from the outgoing Gary Gensler. Atkins will likely work closely with Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda, who have criticized the current regime’s policies on digital assets. Together, they could guide the SEC toward a fairer and clearer regulatory system. The Token Alliance’s recent talks with Commissioners Peirce and Uyeda have been positive. Both commissioners showed interest in engaging with the crypto industry. Crypto supporters see this as a good sign for future discussions and collaboration. The next 90 days will reveal if the SEC can build trust with the crypto industry and adopt a more balanced approach.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-19 11:53:00

The surge came amidst a slump in the broader crypto market caused by pressure from the U.S. Federal Reserve announcing a 25-basis point rate cut, coupled with projections of fewer rate reductions in 2025. Lighting Up the Market Gloom The Fed’s announcement seemed to have rattled investors, with major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum shedding 4% and 5% of their values, respectively, in the last 24 hours. Among the top ten, XRP and Dogecoin performed even more poorly, with the former down 6.8% while the latter lost 5.8% of its worth. Despite the gloom, Fartcoin was among the few altcoins to stay in the green, jumping 21% to reach an all-time high of $1.02. With a circulating supply of 999,995,862 tokens, the new price pushed its market cap to about $1.01 billion, according to CoinGecko data . However, the rally didn’t last long, with the meme coin subsequently retracing to $0.7158 before kicking off another recovery rally. At the time of this writing, it was changing hands at $0.9889, a 17.6% improvement across 24 hours and just 5.4% below its all-time high. The token’s current price puts its overall value at around $955 million, placing it at #129 among the largest cryptocurrencies in the market. Fartcoin’s gains were more pronounced across longer periods, with a whopping 446.1% increase over the past fortnight and an equally impressive 220.8% jump in the last 30 days. Additionally, over seven days, the meme coin registered an 85% uptick, significantly outperforming the broader crypto market, which was down 2.7% in the same period. Analysis and Future Outlook The irreverently named cryptocurrency’s performance aligns with a bullish five-wave impulse pattern noted by analysts. Its $1.01 ATH was the culmination of Wave 3 of that pattern, which was marked by major resistance. As such, market watchers are now predicting a corrective Wave 4 pullback toward the $0.70 to $0.58 range before the coin resumes its uptrend in Wave 5, with targets set at $1.12 and $1.27. However, they urge caution since, in their opinion, a drop below $0.58 could invalidate Fartcoin’s bullish outlook. Similarly, the meme token’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows overbought conditions, suggesting a potential cooldown before its next rally.

This time, the Crypto Open Patent Alliances is arguing Wright's attempt to sue for 900 million pounds ($1.1 billion) over intellectual property rights related to the Bitcoin system in October amounts to contempt of court after a judge ruled in July that he was barred from pursuing proceedings related to his claim to be Nakamoto. The two-day trial is due to end later Thursday and COPA, whose backers include Twitter founder Jack Dorsey and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), is seeking a prison sentence. ""COPA proposes an order committing Dr Wright for an initial term of 18 months and a further term of six months in the event that he does not mitigate his contempt by promptly discontinuing the claims which breach the order,"" COPA set out in its skeleton argument, court documents show. In March, Justice James Mellor ruled that Wright was not Satoshi Nakamoto . Mellor then issued a court order preventing Wright from pursuing proceedings in the U.K. and other jurisdictions related to the claim. ""Dr. Wright is perfectly capable, once the dust has settled, of ramping up his public pronouncements again,"" Mellor wrote at the time . Prior to COPA's victory, Wright had brought several court cases against the bitcoin community around the bitcoin whitepaper , libel suits as well as claims against developers .

Looks like the Fed has dashed those plans. First of all, Chair Jerome Powell's comments distancing the central bank from President-elect Donald Trump's potential creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve mean traders hoping for one will need some solid reassurance. Many are likely to sit on the sidelines until the new administration makes good on its promises. That will weaken the market's bid side until Trump takes office on Jan. 20. The second concern revolves around rate projections. Fed officials are anticipating just two rate cuts in 2025, saying they see the benchmark borrowing cost dropping to 3.9% in 12 months' time from the current 4.25%-4.5% range. That is a 50 basis-point upward revision from an earlier forecast of 3.40%. The market could quickly question a cut to below 4% should incoming data point to sticky inflation and/or labor market strength. This situation has led to concerns that long-end rates, including the 10-year yield, might be too low, according to ING. Interestingly, the 10-year yield has just broken out of a 14-month downward trend that characterized bitcoin's bull run to over $100,000 from $30,000. A further rise in yields could bolster the already strong while triggering a broader decline in risk assets, including BTC. Bitcoin dipped below $100,000 overnight and dragged the broader market down along with it. This yield breakout poses particular concerns for ether, often viewed as an ""internet bond"" with an annualized staking yield of around 3%, weakening the case for a sustained bounce in the ETH-BTC ratio. The continued decline in risk-sensitive assets like the Australian and New Zealand dollars and emerging-market currencies, partly reflecting worries about the Chinese economy, also signals caution. Still, pullbacks of 20% or more are typical in crypto bull markets, and the overall outlook remains positive. ""Looking ahead, heightened volatility is on the horizon as markets adjust to the expectations surrounding Donald Trump’s presidency. Although short-term turbulence may occur, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin and Ether remains bullish,"" said Valentin Fournier, an analyst at BRN. In this uncertain climate, traders might seek refuge in high-yielding crypto assets like Ethena's USDe, which offers returns of around 12%. Pseudonymous analyst OxJeff suggests these pullbacks could present a golden opportunity to invest in tokens linked to AI-powered systems in the blockchain space.

The Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut policy triggered a market-wide price correction. XRP maintains a bullish outlook despite the recent price corrections. XRP’s price fell 20% in less than 48 hours after a recent rally tied to Tuesday’s RLUSD launch, according to data from TradingView . The Ripple token retraced on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate cut news caused a market-wide price correction. XRP slid from Tuesday’s $2.7255 high to retest the support at $2.1708 early Thursday. Beyond the Fed’s interest rate news impact, XRP’s pullback looked like a “buy the rumor, sell the news” scenario. The crypto asset’s price rose before the RLUSD launch and started falling even before the Fed’s announcement. This has led crypto analysts to examine the recent price correction and whether it signals trouble for XRP.

Bitcoin (BTC) briefly tumbled below $100,000; U.S. equities dropped around 3%, while the dollar index (DXY) index soared to a two-year high of 108, which continues to put pressure on currencies worldwide. The most significant movement came from the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which skyrocketed by 74%, marking the largest one-day jump in the Wall Street's so-called fear gauge since Feb. 5, 2018. It was also the second-largest increase in its history. The VIX serves as a measure of market fear and expected volatility over the next 30 days. Historically, significant spikes in the VIX have marked local bottoms for both bitcoin and the S&P 500. Examining the top three one-day changes in the VIX, the first occurred on Feb. 5, 2018, when it surged by 116%. On that day, bitcoin plunged 16% to $6,891, which turned out to be a local bottom. By Feb. 20, prices had rebounded to over $11,000. The second-largest spike in the VIX occurred on Dec. 18, registering a 74% increase. The third biggest spike happened on Aug. 5, 2024, during the Yen carry trade unwind, when the VIX jumped 65%. On that occasion, bitcoin dropped 6% to hit a local bottom around $54,000 and climbed back up to over $64,000 by Aug. 23. A similar pattern has consistently played out in the S&P 500 over the years, data shared by Charlie Bilello , chief market strategist at Creative Planning, show. Let's see if history repeats itself. At press time, BTC traded above $102,000 while the S&P 500 futures pointed to a positive open with a 0.37% gain.",Markets|CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-19 12:00:24

As a result, DTX Exchange (DTX) has emerged as the most promising investment option. However, there are more. Solana (SOL) is also a great pick for the altcoin season. Next, we also have SUI. Lastly, there’s Ethereum (ETH). All four of these can bring you great profits during the altcoin season. Read on for more details! SOL’s Price Dips: Is This a Good Buying Opportunity for Solana? SOL’s price is decreasing right now. Before this, Solana’s token price reached over $260. This increase for Solana was mainly due to the US elections. After that, Solana’s price took a hit. Now, SOL’s price stands at $214. With this, Solana’s price is back where it was before the elections. So, SOL effectively erased its November gains. This might seem bad. However, experts say it isn’t. They say that this is normal for Solana. So, they see this SOL price dip as a good buying opportunity. That’s because they deem SOL to be one of the best investments for the altcoin season. They say that SOL’s price will go up again. This rise will be driven by the altcoin season and Solana’s utility. Namely, many will use Solana for transactions and trading. With that in mind, experts say SOL’s price can go above $300 in the altcoin season. So, now is a good time to stack up SOL coins! SUI Inches Closer to $5: Will It Cross This Level During the Altcoin Season? SUI’s price went to $4.89 recently. However, it failed to break above $5. Instead of rising more, SUI’s price went down to $4.69. However, experts say that this is still great for SUI. It shows that the DeFi coin is strong and still performing well. So, they’ve picked SUI as one of the best investments for the altcoin season. There’s also a lot of interest in SUI right now. This is another great sign that it will do well in the future. Also, the Sui network is always developing. So, new developments will help SUI’s price rise even more in the altcoin season. With that in mind, experts see SUI’s price at $8-$10 in the coming months. However, they say that the token price will likely decrease a bit more before it reaches these targets. Ethereum’s Price Dips After Hitting $4,000: Can ETH Rebound Soon? Many altcoins recorded big price increases recently. Ethereum did, too. Namely, ETH’s price went to $4,011. However, Ethereum’s price dropped soon after. Now, it is at $3,907. That’s because many Ethereum investors sold their tokens for a profit. So, it’s normal for ETH’s price to dip. With this in mind, experts say that Ethereum investors will soon be done taking profits. This means that ETH’s price will be able to rise again. That’s because selling pressure around Ethereum will subside. Ethereum will also reach key resistance levels. All of these factors point to increases in ETH’s price in 2025. Also, the altcoin season will give Ethereum a further boost. Because of this, experts see ETH’s price at around $7,000 in the months to come! What Makes DTX Exchange the Most Promising Investment for the Altcoin Season? DTX Exchange is a revolutionary new trading platform. As such, it’s set to change how we trade. Also, DTX Exchange makes trading much easier for everyone. How? Well, first, it lets you trade everything from one place. Also, DTX Exchange provides you with the Phoenix Wallet for better asset management. It supports a wide range of assets and makes managing them a breeze. Next, DTX Exchange offers incredible speeds. This will help you get better entries and make massive profits. It uses the VulcanX blockchain to do this. With this blockchain, DTX Exchange provides 100,000 TPS! This is much faster than Solana’s 600 TPS. Keep in mind that Solana is considered incredibly fast. So, imagine what traders can do with DTX Exchange when it finally goes live. But there’s more. DTX Exchange also gives everyone an equal opportunity to invest early. That’s because it has a great fair launch system. Most new projects are usually supported by VCs and whales. On the other hand, DTX Exchange isn’t. Instead, it has an incremental price structure. This ensures that DTX’s price increases gradually over time. So, VCs or whales can’t nuke the chart and leave smaller investors hanging! DTX Could be the Real Winner in the Altcoin Season: Get Yours Now Before the Presale Ends! You can buy your DTX tokens at just $0.12 right now. That’s because DTX Exchange is in Stage 6 of its public presale. This gives you the chance to invest very early in this promising project. So far, the DTX presale has raised over $10.2 million. This clearly shows just how much interest DTX has fetched so far! As the presale continues, DTX will rise in price with each new stage. At the end, DTX will launch at $0.20. So, even at launch, early DTX investors will make over 66% of profits. However, this will be just the beginning. Thanks to the massive benefits it offers, experts see DTX rising much higher during the altcoin season. Their primary target is a 100x increase for DTX by Q1 of 2025!

The Chairman said that there may only be two rate cuts for 2025. This news plunged all markets into the red, and Bitcoin sank to just above $100,000. Powell speech sends markets crashing Wednesday’s FOMC meeting ended with the customary speech from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. it was announced that there would be a 25 basis points rate cut, which the market was ready and prepared for. However, as his speech continued, he let it be known that there would likely only be two more adjustments to come for the whole of 2025. On top of this, the newly updated dot plot chart which has the future rate expectations of all the individual Fed members, was actually pointing to a rate rise of 50 basis points. As the news sunk in, the U.S. stock market plunged heavily, while the dollar rocketed to the upside. Bitcoin fell around $6,000 on the day, and the altcoins were generally smashed across the board. The Federal Reserve generally has the most incredible juggling act to do in some of these FOMC meetings. While it sees the absolute necessity of cutting, given the dire state of the jobs market, it does not want to give rein to inflation once again. Therefore, announcing a rate cut, while at the same time sounding incredibly hawkish in the speech afterwards, had the desired effect of dampening down any market enthusiasm. $BTC price touches bottom of ascending channel Source: TradingView For the Bitcoin price it was probably just business as usual. While the drop was very sudden and precipitous, the bears only really succeeded in bringing the price down to the bottom of the ascending channel, within which the price is currently traversing. The price did fall below a trendline that $BTC had been respecting since 4 November, and it now remains to be seen whether the bulls can regain the upper hand and push the price back above this trendline. The price is right at the trendline now, and therefore we will either see a confirmation of the breakdown and rejection, or the price will get above and head back to the top of the ascending channel. Weekly chart nothing out of the ordinary for $BTC Source: TradingView On the weekly chart view there doesn’t appear to be anything out of the ordinary going on with the $BTC price. Last week’s hammer candle, plus all the last few candle wicks to the downside, augur more upside movement to come. Looking at the bottom of the chart at the RSI, it can be seen that the indicator line has started to turn back down. That said, the 70.00 level could act as strong support, as it has done several times so far. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Memecoins and Bitcoin were followed by BNB with a rate of 14.2%. Interestingly, survey participants holding BNB are outperforming Ethereum, which has a 10.9% investment rate. The survey results show that memecoins are not only popular in terms of current investment rate, but also a cryptocurrency class that users are very excited about for the future.” While Binance survey respondents indicated that they were optimistic that memecoins would become market leaders by 2025, AI altcoins took the first place despite memecoin expectations, with 23% of respondents predicting that AI altcoins would drive market growth in 2025. Binance recently said that the survey results revealed that Binance Spot trading was the most widely used product among respondents. “25.89% of the 27,000 respondents identified Binance Spot as their preferred product.

The popularity of $DOGE suggests that traditional metrics, such as market capitalization, are no longer the sole indicator of value. “Meme” culture has become increasingly significant. The collaboration between HTX DAO and the Dogecoin community represents more than a simple connection; it signifies a broader movement toward decentralized ecosystems, pushing boundaries and exploring unlimited possibilities. During the event, Cheng Qian and Molly stated their mutual objective: collaborating on key areas like community governance, R&D, and ecological applications to foster a more open and inclusive decentralized ecosystem. This partnership aims to deliver greater value and innovation to global users while establishing a model for win-win cooperation within the cryptocurrency industry. The planned collaborations include: 1. Enhancing Cross-Community Interaction and Engagement: Joint events, online and offline exchanges, and active engagement on social platforms will strengthen ties between the two communities. 2. Optimizing Decentralized Governance: Collaborative initiatives will refine decentralized governance mechanisms, establishing a more transparent and effective decision-making process. This includes innovative approaches to governance proposals, equity allocation, and key decisions, ensuring all community members’ views and interests are considered. 3. Expanding the Utility of $DOGE and $HTX: The partnership will focus on elevating the ecosystem value of $DOGE and $HTX. More efforts will be made to enhance the practical application of $DOGE and $HTX, such as promoting collaboration within the Web3 ecosystem, expanding use cases in more payment scenarios, and driving deeper integration into the DeFi space. Cheng Qian and Molly also stated that they would work together to make HTX a more welcoming and beneficial exchange for users interested in meme coins, and empower the sustainable growth of the meme coin ecosystem. Co-Building and Sharing the Crypto Space: HTX DAO and HTX Committed to Driving Industry Progress During the event, Molly shared the latest developments of HTX DAO and $HTX. She reported that $HTX has seen a significant recovery from its low of $0.0000008 in early August, reaching a peak of $0.000003596. Currently, There are 695,540 $HTX holders, with over 164,000 holding on the HTX platform. The number of users holding more than 100,000 USDT worth of $HTX has increased by 110%, while the number of large holders has grown by 268%. HTX has also established 138 strategic partnerships. Molly, as a core builder of HTX DAO, explained earlier this year, that some people sold $HTX due to a lack of understanding and trust in the 50% burning mechanism and platform governance — essential for the healthy and long-term growth of HTX DAO. Those who maintained their belief and saw the market correction as an opportunity, have benefited from their conviction. Molly also highlighted the rapid transformation of the crypto industry and its impact on the global financial landscape. With innovations and gradual development of clearer regulatory frameworks in recent years, she emphasized that the crypto space is at a pivotal moment, moving toward greater openness, connectivity, and sustainability. HTX DAO and HTX believe the future belongs to everyone, not a select few, and that continued exploration and collaboration are vital to the foundation of this ecosystem. She stressed HTX DAO and HTX are committed to driving industry development and working with all co-builders to create an open, transparent, and equitable crypto future for everyone. The event concluded with a lively banana auction, a symbolizing community spirit. This auction captured the attention of the entire audience, with everyone vying for the banana in fierce competition. The winning bid of 650 million $HTX was placed by an elementary school girl, who in a post-auction interview, proudly stated, “I am also a Bitcoin holder,” generating laughter and applause, reflecting the enduring blockchain spirit and the enthusiasm of the next generation. About HTX DAO As a multi-chain deployed decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), HTX DAO demonstrates an innovative governance approach. Unlike traditional corporate structures, it adopts a decentralized governance structure composed of a diversified group, jointly committed to the success of this organization. This unique ecosystem advocates openness and encourages all DAO participants to propose ideas that can promote the development of HTX DAO.

This New Coin Resembles Solana (SOL) Right Before Its Epic 17,100% Rally in 2021",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/is-history-about-to-repeat-this-new-coin-resembles-solana-sol-right-before-its-epic-17100-rally-in-2021,"Every once in a while, the crypto market presents an opportunity so compelling it feels like déjà vu. Back in 2021, Solana (SOL) stunned the crypto world with its incredible 17,100% rally, transforming early believers into millionaires. Now, analysts are buzzing about a new contender— Lightchain AI (LCAI) —that bears striking similarities to Solana’s early days. Priced at just $0.003 during its presale, this AI-powered blockchain is creating waves for its innovative technology and explosive growth potential. Could Lightchain AI follow in Solana’s footsteps and deliver astronomical returns? Let’s explore why history might just repeat itself. How Solana Rose from $0.50 to Over $260 in 2024 Solana’s meteoric rise began with its promise of unmatched scalability and speed. Leveraging its unique Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism, Solana became a haven for developers seeking a high-performance blockchain for DeFi, NFTs, and gaming applications. Key drivers of Solana’s success included: Developer Adoption: A rapidly expanding ecosystem of decentralized applications. Institutional Backing: Support from major investors like Alameda Research. Community Growth: Grassroots campaigns that built strong investor confidence. By the time Solana’s ecosystem reached maturity, its early investors were already enjoying life-changing returns. Lightchain AI: The New Contender for Massive Gains Just as Solana transformed blockchain scalability, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is set to revolutionize the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with decentralized systems. Priced at just $0.003 during its presale, LCAI is positioning itself as a leader in AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps). Like Solana’s early days, Lightchain AI offers a developer-friendly ecosystem with tools tailored for AI-driven applications, including its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), which lets developers embed machine learning models into dApps. This unlocks new possibilities in industries like predictive analytics, logistics, and finance. For scalability, Lightchain AI introduces Proof of Intelligence (PoI), a consensus mechanism that rewards nodes for meaningful AI computations, advancing both network efficiency and AI research—similar to Solana’s Proof of History (PoH). Lightchain AI’s growing community reflects Solana’s grassroots beginnings. With over $1.2 million raised in its presale and rising interest from institutional investors, it’s quickly becoming a transformative player in the blockchain and AI space. Keep an eye on Lightchain AI as it bridges AI and decentralized tech. Key Features That Set Lightchain AI Apart Lightchain AI is more than just another blockchain—it’s a next-generation platform designed to address real-world challenges through AI integration. Data Privacy Innovations: Lightchain AI enables secure data sharing using advanced encryption methods, ensuring compliance with global privacy regulations. Cross-Chain Interoperability: Unlike Solana, which faced congestion issues, Lightchain AI supports seamless interactions across multiple blockchains, providing unparalleled flexibility for developers. Deflationary Tokenomics: With a burn mechanism that reduces token supply over time, Lightchain AI ensures long-term value appreciation for LCAI holders. Why Analysts Predict a Massive Rally for Lightchain AI Just like Solana took the chance for big blockchains in 2021, Lightchain AI is ready to le͏ad the next round of new ideas with its AI-linked blockchain answers. Experts guess that LCAI might hit $5–$10 by 2025, giving a possible return of 1,500 times to 3,000 times for first investors. The plan’s path is just as hopeful. By start of 2024, Lightchain AI aims to start its testnet and begin taking in builders. In March 2025, a mainnet will go live, letting full use for its Proof of Smartness (PoS) plan and Artificial Mind Virtual Machine (AMVM). After 2025, the project wants to grow into business-level AI uses and make cross-chain links paving the way for more adoption and new ideas. A Rare Opportunity in the Making Investors and crypto enthusiasts alike are keeping a close eye on Lightchain AI , as the project has all the makings of a potential game-changer. With its innovative technology, growing community, and strong backing from both retail and institutional investors, Lightchain AI could very well follow in Solana’s footsteps and provide astronomical returns for early believers. But as with any investment opportunity, it is important to conduct thorough research and due diligence before making any decisions. While history may be hinting at a repeat performance, there are always risks involved in investing in emerging technologies. Only time will tell if Lightchain AI can deliver on its promises and potentially become the next big thing in the crypto world. So, it is crucial to keep a close eye on this exciting project as it continues to evolve and make its mark in the ever-changing landscape of blockchain and AI technology. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

It has been one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies this year, rising by 440%. Will the Sui token price crash now that the total value locked (TVL) in its DeFi protocols and the number of developer commits are falling? SUI Price At Risk of Crash As DeFi TVL Sinks Sui price is trading at $4.56 on Wednesday and is close to its all-time high of $4.9. One reason for its surge is that the volume of assets in its DeFi protocols is rising, and currently sits at over $1.7 billion. This growth makes it the ninth-biggest blockchain in the industry. It is bigger than other popular chains like Avalanche, Aptos, and Polygon. However, the ongoing surge in DeFi assets is mostly because of the ongoing Sui price surge, which has lifted the volume of its assets. The TVL has been in a downtrend in SUI terms after peaking in September this year. It has moved from 730 million in SUI terms to the current 385 million, its lowest level since April. This is a sign that its DeFi protocols are not doing all that well, which could, in theory, affect its price. SUI DeFi TVL SUI Network Commits And Core Developers Falling The other potential risk for the SUI price is that the number of developer commits is falling. Commits refers to changes made by developers and saved to a network. Ideally, more commits are signs that the network is seeing more activity. Data shows that the number of commits in December stands at 950, down from a peak of 5.3k in May last year. They peaked at 2.93k in January this year, and the trend has not been all that promising. The number of core developers has dropped to 44 from the year-to-date high of 86. However, Sui is also seeing some positive fundamentals. For example, the volume of stablecoins in its chain has risen to over $377 million. Its DEX protocols like Cetus, Bluefin, Kriya, and DeepBook are also seeing strong volume. SUI Core Developers SUI Technical Analysis As Rising Wedge Forms The daily chart shows that the SUI token price has been in a strong uptrend. Using trend-following principles, this uptrend will likely continue for a while since it remains above all moving averages. However, some potential risks have come up and point to a potential retreat. It is forming a rising wedge chart pattern, a popular bearish sign. This pattern happens when an asset forms two ascending and converging trendlines. A bearish breakout happens when they near the tip. The other risk is that it is nearing the extreme overshoot level of the Murrey Math Lines, where most assets retreat. Also, it remains much higher than the 50-day moving average, meaning that a mean reversion may happen. SUI Price A breakdown would lead it to the major S&R pivot point at $3.125, which is about 30% below the current level. On the flip side, a move above the year-to-date high of $4.96 will invalidate the Sui price bearish view and point to more gains to $6.

This can significantly boost LUNC and USTC burn rates, increase funds in the Community pool and Oracle pool, and trigger a rally in LUNC price. The community remains divided on increasing the on-chain tax rate as some agree with Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao to keep the burn tax low. On the other hand, some believe the Terra Luna Classic chain revise it now. LUNC News: Terra Luna Classic Community Burn Tax Proposal The Terra Luna Classic community is voting on proposal 12149 “ Set On-Chain Tax Rate to 1.5% ” on the Station wallet. It aims to increase the on-chain tax rate from 0.5% to 1.5% and leave it unchanged unless the total supply reaches 10 billion LUNC. The move comes after the successful implementation of the v.3.3.0 LUNC network upgrade . The upgrade simplified tax handling and reduced the burden for developers and dapps to build on the Terra Luna Classic network. The 0.5% LUNC burn tax is currently split into 80% and 20%, with the 20% breakdown as — 10% to the community pool and 10% to the oracle pool. If the tax is increased to 1.5%, it will increase the burn tax to 1.2% from the current 0.4%. Also, it will increase the contribution to the Community Pool and the O racle Pool , making all components boost by three times. At present, the proposal has received 43.24% “Yes” votes, with 16.01% “No” and 40.74% “No with veto” votes. The voting by validators and delegators indicate the community remains divided again. A validator commented, “Please do not sabotage builders & L2 projects. Veto because the 30th attempt is one too much.” LUNC and USTC Price Action Raising the burn tax to 1.5% will increase the rate of LUNC and USTC burns from the tax, the community pool funding rate, and funding to the oracle pool for long-term Terra Luna Classic staking rewards. LUNC price fell 9% in the last 24 hours amid market-wide selloff, with the price currently trading at $0.0001135 . The 24-hour low and high are $0.0001115 and $0.0001243, respectively. However, trading volume has increased by 38% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, USTC price also dropped 7%, with the price now trading at $0.02029. The 24-hour low and high are $0.01887 and $0.02178, respectively. The trading volume saw an 87% rise over the last day.

37839639,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/viral-meme-coin-crypto-all-stars-raises-22m-just-days-before-launch-next-100x-token,1734610961,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/37839639.jpeg,Viral Meme Coin Crypto All-Stars Raises $22M Just Days Before Launch - Next 100x Token?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/viral-meme-coin-crypto-all-stars-raises-22m-just-days-before-launch-next-100x-token,"Crypto All-Stars (STARS) has emerged as the latest viral meme coin just days ahead of its highly-anticipated launch. The project is adding over $1 million to its presale total daily and has already raised $22 million. With the presale concluding on December 20th, the hype and FOMO have reached a fever pitch, positioning the project for a strong chance of surpassing the $25 million mark before its IEO. For perspective, First Neiro On Ethereum and Act I: The Prophecy had lower market caps when Binance announced their spot listings. STARS’s strong presale performance has impressed many prominent investors, some of whom are eyeing up to 100x returns from it. Crypto All-Stars - 11 Top Meme Coins Under One Roof Crypto All-Stars isn’t just any run-of-the-mill token. It doesn’t depend on an animal or a fictional character for its growth. Instead, STARS is a high-utility meme coin, with MemeVault being its key selling point. MemeVault is the world’s first multi-token staking platform. Soon after its launch, it will offer staking rewards for 11 top meme coins, including Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki (FLOKI), Based Brett (BRETT), Mog Coin (MOG), Milady Meme Coin (LADYS), Turbo (TURBO), Toshi (TOSHI), Coq Inu (COQ) and Bonk (BONK). Meme coins have become an increasingly significant part of investors' portfolios as they prepare for the 2025 supercycle. However, top meme coins like Dogecoin and Pepe do not offer any secondary source of income, unlike most of the newer projects. This means investors lose significant money in short-term price action as well as opportunity cost. For instance, those who purchased Pepe after it hit its all-time high of $0.000028 are now in a 25% loss. While the frog-themed meme coin will eventually recoup its gains, the lack of any passive income is a major flaw. However, holders can now stake their coins with MemeVault and earn significant passive income. The platform’s ERC-1155 design and multiple audits mean investors’ funds will remain safe and continue to attract staking rewards, irrespective of any short-term price action. STARS holders can earn thrice the rewards through MemeVault. They can also benefit from a secondary presale staking pool , which is currently offering a reward rate of just under 150%. Is The Viral Meme Coin The Next 100x Token A few prominent experts are viewing Crypto All-Stars as the next 100x meme token. Even some of the more conservative predictions have STARS seeing 10x growth following its launch. After all, it is not without any reason why the viral meme coin is seeing heavy whale bidding in its presale. Last week, a deep-pocketed investor swapped 50 ETH for Crypto All-Stars, buying nearly $200k worth of the meme coin, data from Etherscan reveals. He invested another $120k in STARS later the same day. These smart money investors are seeing strong upside potential for Crypto All-Stars, especially due to the strong demand for its MemeVault feature. Moreover, STARS is a meme coin with strong fundamentals. For instance, it has community-centric tokenomics, with no separate allocation for the developer team or any private sale. Similarly, the Crypto All-Stars smart contract has been audited multiple times and did not reveal any vulnerabilities or centralization risks. Most new meme coins do not offer this level of surety even before their launch. However, interested buyers now have less than 2 days to buy STARS at its current price of $0.0016782. They can visit the presale website, use the over-the-counter widget and buy the meme coin with just a few clicks. They are also advised to follow the project’s X and Telegram accounts for the latest on its upcoming launch.

The decision comes amid Coinbase’s controversial delisting of WBTC, sparking speculation about WLFI’s strategic direction. Now the question arises whether it is politically motivated or just a normal shift. Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain revealed that WLFI exchanged 102.9 cbBTC for 103.15 WBTC. This shift comes as cbBTC, Coinbase’s Bitcoin wrapper, gains momentum with a $1 billion market cap. Despite its rising adoption, WLFI’s decision highlights a clear preference for WBTC. While cbBTC gains traction, WBTC faces scrutiny and challenges. Let’s get into the insight. Justin Sun’s Role in the Move Justin Sun, founder of TRON DAO and a major WLFI investor, has played a key role in this transition. Recently Sun, a vocal critic of cbBTC’s governance and transparency, invested $30 million in WLFI and joined as an advisor. His association with BitGo, the custodian of WBTC, further underscores his influence on WLFI’s alignment. Sun’s involvement has also brought significant collaborations to WLFI, including partnerships with Chainlink and TRON. These alliances enhance WLFI’s infrastructure and reflect Sun’s vision for decentralized finance innovation. Coinbase Controversy Adds Fuel Coinbase introduced cbBTC in September, aiming to rival WBTC in the DeFi space. However, the exchange announced plans to delist WBTC, prompting a legal challenge from BiT Global, a custodian linked to WBTC. On Wednesday, a court sided with Coinbase, allowing the delisting to proceed. WLFI’s move aligns it with WBTC’s trusted infrastructure and market presence, distancing itself from cbBTC’s controversies. This decision also reflects a broader strategy to leverage Sun’s blockchain expertise and partnerships, including Chainlink’s decentralized services and TRON’s Scale program. It remains to be seen whether this represents a calculated risk or a deeper alignment. Actions like these remind us that narratives can influence markets just as much as numbers do.",News|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-19 12:22:56

Notably, the firm said that it added $100 million worth of BTC to its portfolio, with its Bitcoin Reserve hitting the $1 billion mark with this latest accumulation. This also comes amid a gloomy sentiment in the broader crypto market, showcasing the firm’s confidence in the flagship crypto despite the recent setbacks. Bitcoin Miner Hut 8 Buys $100M In BTC In a recent announcement , Hut 8 said that the firm has purchased 990 Bitcoin, worth around $100 million, or an average of about $101,710 per BTC. With this latest purchase, the Bitcoin miner’s total holdings surged to 10,096 BTC, reflecting a market value of over $1 billion, the firm said. Notably, the company also said that this latest acquisition also adds it to the “ten largest corporate owners of Bitcoin in the world”. This latest accumulation has fueled market optimism, especially as global leaders, as well as corporate firms, are racing to accumulate the flagship crypto. For context, MicroStrategy has continued its BTC buying , showcasing the firm’s increasing confidence in the asset. Simultaneously, Japan’s “MicroStrategy” Metaplanet has also shifted its focus towards accumulating the crypto, as evidenced by its recent moves. Meanwhile, this Hut 8 accumulation comes as the crypto market has recorded a robust rally since Donald Trump’s election victory in November. However, following a strong run, the optimism appeared to have cooled down recently, especially after the US Fed announced another rate cut yesterday. Notably, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signals a hawkish move ahead by the central bank, which has likely weighed on the investors’ sentiment. Following the comments, the broader financial market takes a hit. Bitcoin and other top altcoins also noted significant declines amid a hovering gloomy sentiment in the market. However, Hut 8’s recent revelation indicates that the institutional interest in the flagship crypto still remained strong despite the ongoing volatility. What’s Next For BTC? BTC price today declined 3% during writing to $102,000, while its trading volume jumped 23% to $96 billion. However, despite the current decline, the crypto has recovered from its 24-hour low of $98,792, signaling increasing investors’ participation. On the other hand, the US Spot Bitcoin ETF inflow was also strong over the past few weeks, indicating growing institutional interest in the crypto. So, considering the recent market trends, experts also remained optimistic about the future trajectory of BTC. Bitwise CIO recently said that the crypto is poised to hit $500K once the US finalizes its Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Simultaneously, these accumulation trends from corporates like Hut 8 further fuel market sentiment, showcasing the growing confidence of the Wall Street players towards the asset.

Bitcoin Miner MARA Buys 15,574 BTC for $1.53 Billion In a filing to the SEC , MARA said the acquisition was financed with proceeds from its recently completed zero-coupon convertible notes offerings. The firm also said it had repurchased about $263 million in aggregate principal amount of its existing convertible notes due 2026. It intends to use the remaining proceeds of the notes to acquire more Bitcoin. MARA raised $1.925 billion from 0% convertible notes in November and December. Using the proceeds from its zero-coupon convertible notes offerings, MARA has acquired 15,574 BTC for ~$1.53 billion at ~$98,529 per #bitcoin and repurchased ~$263 million in aggregate principal amount… pic.twitter.com/ycGRk9BYfv — MARA (@MARAHoldings) December 19, 2024 The company announced that it had acquired the Bitcoins at an average price of $96,000 per BTC. MARA also pointed out a Bitcoin yield of 12.3% QTD and 47.6% YTD. With this transaction, MARA now possesses 40,435 BTC, worth about $3.9 billion at current market prices. The move is reminiscent of a strategy popularized by MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, focused on large-scale Bitcoin accumulation. Saylor recently stated he sees MARA Holdings entering Nasdaq 100 Index soon. Buying Spree After the Price Drop MARA announced the purchase just a day after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell clarified that the central bank cannot own Bitcoin. The timing of the news coincided with a plunge in markets. Bitcoin fell 5% in its biggest plunge in more than three months as a wider sell-off was sparked by the Fed’s hawkish comments. The comments mentioned the trajectory of interest rates and the scant possibility of rate reductions in 2025. For a while, it approached, but then pulled back from, a $100,000 perch. This was the impact of both, Powell’s hawkish views and unease of Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Institutional Interest Soaring Hut 8 (HUT) joined the group of Bitcoin miners buying Bitcoin on the open market along with giants like MicroStrategy and MARA Holdings. Furthermore, the company based in Miami announced on Thursday buying 990 BTC for an average price of $101,710 each. This latest purchase increased Hut 8’s total Bitcoin in reserve to 10,096 BTC, worth close to $1 billion. This puts the company among the top 10 largest corporate Bitcoin holders. Recently, RIOT bought 667 BTC at an average price of $101,135 on December 16. For Bitcoin miners, buying large amounts of Bitcoin on the open market has proved a boon. Therefore, it has opened up new fundraising avenues in a period marked by pressures on profits after the recent Bitcoin halving.

The Bitcoin price plunged below $100K when the Fed Chair commented negatively on asking his opinion about the national Bitcoin reserve. However, the token has led a strong recovery as it rises above $102K in a short while suggesting the traders may have utilised yet another ‘buy at the dip’ opportunity. But what led to the downfall? The liquidations play a major role in impacting the prices of cryptos, mainly Bitcoin. Ever since the token started to rise above $100K, the longs started accumulating heavily above $105K and extended to $107K. However, these were expected to close, which triggered a massive pullback. As per the data from Coinglass, the markets have witnessed over $782 million in liquidation in the past 24 hours, which may have slashed the prices hard. However, Bitcoin liquidity is still sitting above $102K, which may appear scary but eventually flashes a bullish signal in the long term. Here the accumulation of longs at levels just above $102K suggests the price is about to experience a notable pullback after surpassing these levels. This could be the reason why the BTC price is facing a major hindrance in surpassing these levels. On the other hand, a huge pressure is being mounted here, which may compel the price to accumulate around this range. With this, there is the possibility of a short squeeze that may push the prices higher, probably above $110K. On the other hand, the BTC dominance has displayed a major comeback by heading back to 60%. In the times when the dominance was expected to drop below 50%, the latest reversal above 58% suggests a major reversal could be fast approaching. The levels have triggered a rebound and considering the previous price actions, the levels are believed to reach the upper resistance. This suggests the price is in the middle of the prevailing bull run and hence the next bullish wave could push the price towards new highs. However, as it happened earlier, a rejection may follow, triggering a fresh bearish wave across the markets, probably in the second half of 2025.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-19 13:30:16

The head honcho of the decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform suffered a series of mammoth liquidations earlier in 2024 after taking out loans to purchase CRV and bolster the price. $140 million in total was liquidated in June . ""Many of you are aware that I had all my loans liquidated. Size of my positions was too large for markets to handle and caused 10M of bad debt,"" Egorov wrote at the time. The most recent of those purchases was worth $1.2 million on Dec. 17, at which point CRV was at trading at $1.11 before it tumbled to around $0.91 on Thursday. Egorov took to X following Thursday's liquidation, stating that the liquidated CRV was tied to the uWu hack in June and that the liquidation was simply a ""receipt of Sifu's [uWu's founder] promise to repay the hacked funds."" This didn't prevent further selling, however, as CRV significantly underperformed against the CoinDesk 20 Index, which is down by 4.81% at the time of writing against CRV's decline of 12%.

Explosive Growth in Solana DApp Revenue According to Syndica, a research platform focused on blockchain analytics, Solana-based DApps collectively earned $365 million in November. Among these, the memecoin launchpad Pump.fun stole the spotlight by becoming the first Solana DApp to generate over $100 million in monthly revenue. Specifically, Pump.fun raked in a staggering $106 million in November, further cementing Solana’s position as a hub for thriving decentralized applications. Memecoin-related DApps have proven to be the largest revenue generators within Solana’s DApp ecosystem, with a remarkable $509 million earned this year. These applications alone have experienced an explosive 300-fold growth in 2024, with November alone contributing a hefty $183 million to their total. Pump.fun Faces Backlash Despite the financial success, Pump.fun’s rise wasn’t without controversy . On November 25, the platform was embroiled in criticism after disturbing reports emerged of users engaging in or threatening violent acts during livestreams. In response, Pump.fun paused its livestreaming feature indefinitely, pledging to introduce better moderation systems to prevent such incidents in the future. This move, however, led to a sharp decline in the platform’s weekly revenue, which fell by 66% in the final week of November. The weekly earnings dropped from $33.8 million to just $11.3 million after the livestream feature was halted. Despite the revenue drop, Solana’s ecosystem continued to shine with other top-performing DApps such as the token discovery platform Photon and the decentralized exchange (DEX) Raydium, which also contributed heavily to the overall revenue surge. The data indicates that Solana’s DApp sector has been largely fueled by DeFi and memecoin applications, with DeFi alone accounting for 83.7% of the total revenue generated in 2024. Interestingly, memecoin DApps have outpaced traditional DeFi applications in terms of revenue growth. Alongside these, other sectors such as Telegram bots and Spot DEXs have also contributed significantly. With the surge in DApp revenue, Solana has demonstrated not only its ability to attract top-tier projects but also its potential to capitalize on emerging trends, including the memecoin boom.

Between the flood of data, volatile market swings, and the constant fear of missing out (FOMO), it is easy to feel overwhelmed. Staying focused on the right strategies and tools can often mean the difference between success and missed opportunities. While many tools are available, not all meet the diverse needs of a trader like myself—from social media monitoring to tracking whales’ behavior. Yet, the good news is that whispers of new features and strategies from emerging platforms, such as Wisdomise , which I happened to be a user of since two months ago, hint at tools that could further simplify my decision-making and boost trading confidence. I thought about sharing my recent experience with these emerging intelligent tools with you. Wisdomise has this cool product called Coin Radar that has recently gained attention among traders and influencers for its ability to provide real-time insights, helping users navigate complex market conditions more effectively. There are growing discussions within the crypto community about potential upgrades to the platform as well as some news about the future of the platform being exclusive to the company’s token ($WSDM) holders only (while I’ve heard they are planning for some token-burning mechanisms as of next year as well). While the implications of these updates remain speculative, some analysts suggest they could influence the token's future value and exclusivity of the underlying platform. Let's explore four key tips to help you stay ahead and win in the crypto market in 2025 - all reflecting on my first-hand experience with Wisdomise’s products over the last few weeks. Analyzing Social Media and News: Stay Ahead of the Curve When it comes to fundamental analysis, news and social media can make or break a token, with trends often taking off on platforms like X before appearing anywhere else. A message from a major influencer, a new partnership announcement, or a regulatory update can cause prices to soar—or plummet—within hours, if not minutes. This makes monitoring social media and news channels crucial for spotting opportunities early. Take Elon Musk's tweets about Dogecoin as an example: traders who caught the tweet early and acted quickly saw significant gains. If you are not actively tracking crypto X or monitoring major headlines, you risk falling behind. However, manually scanning through all this data on social media is nearly impossible (and we talk about millions of messages daily) and can distract you from executing your overall strategy. That is why AI tools are becoming essential for consolidating and analyzing this data in a timely manner. Among the available tools, let’s consider Social Radar, one of the Coin Radar’s core features. It analyzes millions of posts across platforms like Reddit, X, and Telegram in real-time, offering actionable insights and timely signals about each moving coin. With its multi-source integration, the Social tab compiles insights from various social platforms, offering a centralized view of market sentiments. The Markets tab focuses on identifying current trading opportunities and market trends, while the Technical Ideas tab aggregates trading insights from sources like TradingView, helping traders access relevant data to support their trading decisions way faster than traditional ways. Using Indicators: Leverage Data for Smarter Decisions Technical analysis remains a cornerstone for traders looking to predict price movements. In the crypto market, indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) are among the key metrics traders use to predict price movements. They provide valuable insights into market conditions, but they come with their own set of shortcomings. RSI helps identify overbought or oversold conditions, yet it can be misleading during strong trends, where prices continue rising or falling despite extreme levels. MACD tracks momentum and signals buy/sell opportunities, but it often needs to catch up to price action, making it less useful in fast-moving markets. For traders, the challenge is understanding the inner dynamics of these indicators and knowing when to trust them. Relying too heavily on one can lead to false signals, while trying to incorporate multiple indicators can be overwhelming and confusing. Again reflecting on my experience with Wisdomise’s products, their Technical Radar is presumably using AI to simplify technical analysis , offering dynamic visualizations and real-time insights - in new ways, even for active traders like myself. As markets become increasingly volatile, such tools are becoming indispensable for navigating complex price movements. Technical Radar offers dynamic heatmap visualizations and multi-timeframe monitoring for RSI, making it easy to spot overbought/oversold conditions and patterns. For MACD, it tracks trend strength, momentum, and signal line crossovers and detects divergences. After getting used to their way of presenting technical indicators, it is not easy to switch to the old-school use of these indicators anymore. Following Smart Money: Track Major Players With Confidence Large players—whether whales, institutions, or major funds—are the invisible force behind many market movements in crypto (if not all financial markets). Their substantial trades can trigger sharp price shifts and influence the overall sentiment. For example, a whale accumulating Bitcoin can signal a bullish momentum, while a sudden sell-off might trigger widespread fear. By tracking whales’ trades, you can gain an advantage in spotting trends before they become mainstream. However, it is also important to note that whales can sometimes manipulate the market, and by the time most traders react, it may be too late. While monitoring whale movements offers valuable insights, it is not always a surefire way to profit. Identifying the right whales and pinpointing promising tokens requires time, effort, and precision. In my opinion, in 2025, platforms offering accurate and timely whale tracking tools will become increasingly popular. Interestingly, Wisdomise has thought about this angle as well with its Whale Radar, which enables traders to monitor significant transactions, detect accumulation or sell-off trends, and act quickly based on where “smart money” is flowing. Real-time visibility into major players’ movements can provide the sort of competitive edge traders need to identify trends early before they hit mainstream attention in order to capture supernormal yields.. 4.Bonus Hint: Whispers of Upcoming Upgrades and Features As traders look for reliable tools to navigate, some major platforms are generating buzz with rumors of new upgrades to their offerings. Referring to my personal experience with Wisdomise products, whispers among analysts and influencers point to significant news on the horizon, including a burning mechanism (hence, deflationary economy) for their $WSDM token, which could reduce the total supply and drive up value through scarcity. Adding to this some degree of exclusivity they are seemingly planning to impose in favor of their token holders brings $WSDM to my hot watchlist for 2025. They seem to have a new which, to my best of knowledge without testing or using any, involves AI automation covering multiple blockchains (sources have said TON, SOL and ETH thus far), which potentially can revolutionize DeFi trading. If done well these AI-driven automations, alongside accurate, real-time insights, will help traders of all levels stay ahead of the market and capture real profits through 2025. These potential upgrades could reshape the platform’s role within the crypto community, further solidifying its value to traders. While details remain speculative, analysts are keeping a close eye on developments that can impact the price and utility of $WSDM. All in all if these rumors materialize in reality, they may set a new standard for AI-powered crypto trading in the year ahead. Winning in the 2025 crypto market will require more than intuition; it demands access to cutting-edge tools and strategies. As tools evolve and new technologies emerge, traders who leverage these advancements in their favor will be best positioned to thrive in the next chapter of crypto’s bull market.

37841928,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630344,1734615801,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37841928.jpeg,There’s a reason Fed chair Jerome Powell hates Bitcoin. And it’s a pretty good one,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/reason-fed-chair-jerome-powell-hates-bitcoin/,"Jerome Powell is a remarkable man. Whether you like him or not doesn’t change that. A quick look at his resume tells you this is a guy with a level of intelligence only few have ever attained. Now as head of the Federal Reserve, he oversees the world’s most powerful central bank, a machine designed to keep the financial system in line. Then here comes Bitcoin, the decentralized, no-rules wild card of global finance. It’s absolutely no surprise that Powell is skeptical. But the reasons for his hate go deeper than surface-level complaints about volatility or hype. The Fed boss sees Bitcoin as a threat, not just to stability but to the entire financial order he’s tasked with maintaining. During his infamous press conference yesterday, Powell doubled down on where he stands. “We’re not allowed to own Bitcoin. The Federal Reserve Act says what we can own, and we’re not looking for a law change.” But it’s not even what he said. It’s how he said it. The comment was in response to a question that has to do with President Donald Trump’s proposed Bitcoin strategic reserve, and Powell almost looked insulted at it before he opened his mouth. As expected. Predicting his rate cut patterns might be hard, but it’s pretty easy to see that Mr. Powell will never like Bitcoin, even if he secretly respects it. And guess what? That’s completely fine. We’re not here to change his mind. Bitcoin’s bad image: Incels, degens, and chaos traders Bitcoin’s reputation doesn’t help its case either. While Wall Street giants and institutional investors Powell respect have started to embrace it, the crypto is still deeply tied to its roots in online subcultures. Terms like “incels” and “degens” get thrown around in Bitcoin communities, referring to high-risk traders who often treat the market like a casino than a strategic investment space. These are people hyping coins with memes, driving up prices with no basis in fundamentals, and cashing out before the crash. This speculative madness fuels Bitcoin’s extreme price swings. For someone known to be a calculated overthinker, Powell doesn’t have to look far to see the chaos here. Literally, just after his comments yesterday, the top crypto shed 5% of its value in mere hours, dragged down in part by the US stock market. Right there, that’s the problem. The toxic reputation extends beyond trading behavior. Online Bitcoin communities often come across as hostile and shockingly sexually inappropriate, alienating women and high-level thinkers like Powell. And if we’re being honest, Trump being pro-Bitcoin could also be seen as a red flag. Trump, Bitcoin, and the war over a strategic reserve Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis has proposed creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, an idea as bold as it is controversial, if not a bit ludicrous. Under the plan, the Treasury would purchase 200,000 Bitcoins annually, building a reserve of one million tokens. The funding would come from Federal Reserve deposits and gold holdings. So Trump would literally need a go-ahead from Powell to launch this thing. Analysts at Barclays believe the plan would face “stiff resistance” from the Fed. And as we’ve reported before, Powell has rare bipartisan support so strong that he’d easily defeat Trump in a face-off. He kind of already is. The way we see it, this guy is the most powerful person in the world. A single action of his will affect every single life in the world right now. Now to Powell, the idea of a Bitcoin reserve funded by the Treasury is an affront to the very principles of central banking. Why would he risk the global economy and his legacy just to appease the Oval? Powell doesn’t even need to argue against the bill, the numbers speak for themselves. A single comment from him can shave hundreds of billions off Bitcoin’s market cap overnight. Imagine what would happen if the Fed actually tried to hold it. Keep in mind that America is the largest economy on earth. If it goes down, everyone’s gonna go down. Powell’s resistance isn’t just about practicality. It’s also philosophical. The Federal Reserve exists to stabilize the economy, not to gamble on assets that spike and crash with tweets or Reddit posts. Powell’s approach is rooted in decades of financial experience too. Before leading the Fed, he worked at The Carlyle Group, a private equity powerhouse. He’s seen firsthand the dangers of unregulated markets, and Bitcoin checks all the wrong boxes. Powell’s long history of skepticism Powell’s career is a case study in risk aversion. As Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance, he dealt with the intricacies of financial regulation and policy-making. His role during the 2008 financial crisis shaped his perspective on stability and oversight. His leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic required aggressive monetary interventions to stabilize markets. Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against fiat currency collapses may hold to an extent, but to Mr. Fed, it’s just a nuisance — a volatile asset that could disrupt the delicate balance he works to maintain. However, it’s not unknown that Powell tends not to like being told what to do, especially when it’s coming from the man who publicly harassed and criticized him time and time again. He just might be itching for a fight. Yesterday, he said he doesn’t see them cutting rates for the most part of next year, which means they’ll be high. Trump hates that. He’ll talk. He’ll verbally attack Powell a lot. And that’ll only make him hate Bitcoin and everything else the president supports even more. Sure, Trump could sit down and have a chat with Powell, maybe even win him over. But he’s Trump, so it’s safe to assume that he likely won’t be doing that. When it comes to the 2025 Fed, Mr. President is the wrong hype man for Bitcoin.

World Liberty Financial has been making moves on-chain, having purchased millions of dollars worth of the cryptocurrency involved in its partnerships or integrations, including Aave ( AAVE ), Ethena ( ENA ), and Chainlink ( LINK ) tokens, all within the last week. Trading volumes with the platform have remained strong despite not publicly stating the swap tokens it replaced.

A ruling earlier today rejected Justin Sun-backed BiT Global’s claims and permitted Coinbase to remove Wrapped Bitcoin ( wBTC ) from the exchange’s listings. Coinbase’s removal of the token was due to Sun’s association with BiT Global and Tron’s ecosystem since the former had no direct control over wBTC’s custody.

Liu continued that more than 50% of the worldwide market share and over $60 billion of stablecoin assets are circulating on the Tron blockchain, which demonstrates the reliability and success of Tron. However, critics say that Sun’s reputation and past allegations of misbehavior are risks. Its high turnover rate and its integration with stablecoin ecosystems have forever plagued Tron but are the very things supporters point to as signs of its strength.

As reported earlier, Sun became an advisor to the platform after investing $30 million in WLFI, its native token. This partnership aligns with Trump’s pro-crypto stance during his campaign and cements Sun’s position in furthering the goals of World Liberty Financial. Sun’s participation brings both opportunities and risks. On the one hand, it reflects the growing synergies between technologies alongside strategic partnerships to advance the crypto landscape further. The move is significant for World Liberty Financial , as an active player in the market.

These promotions , which typically occur over a span of years, were made discreetly and without fanfare, raising questions about their timing and purpose. According to John Reed Stark, a crypto-skeptic and former SEC official, Gensler’s actions are an attempt to leave a lasting imprint on the SEC before the new chair, Paul Atkins, takes over. As the White House prepares to appoint a new leadership team, including a crypto czar, these five senior officers will likely remain in place, potentially causing conflicts when the new chair attempts to reverse Gensler’s crypto-focused policies. Of the five promotions, four of the officers have been highly successful in the SEC’s crypto enforcement efforts. These individuals have been pivotal in cracking down on cryptocurrency firms, and their success has earned them recognition as top crypto-enforcement lawyers. However, Stark argues that Gensler’s maneuver places these accomplished professionals in a difficult position as they may find themselves at odds with the incoming SEC leadership under Paul Atkins, who is expected to pursue a different direction, particularly in terms of crypto regulation. Conclusion: While some see Gensler’s actions as a last-ditch effort to solidify his legacy, others view it as a selfish and politically motivated maneuver that undermines the SEC’s future direction. The timing of these promotions, just before President Trump’s term ends, has also sparked debate, with Trump having made promises to overhaul the SEC’s approach to crypto. This situation also highlights cases like Ripple’s. Many believe that under Atkins, the case could be dismissed or have a more favorable outcome. However, it remains to be seen what Gensler will do during his final days and how his actions might affect the Ripple case, especially with the January 15 hearing approaching.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-19 13:56:55

However, if observed overall, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 5.84% of its value. Despite the massive downswing in the earlier part of this week, today the bulls secured a noticeable victory. Dogecoin 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of Dogecoin confirmed an increasing market trend for the currency. DOGE/USD value has stepped up to a $0.363 high during the day. On the other side, the overall market sentiment remained highly bearish, in line with the previous downswing. The distance between the Bollinger bands determines the market volatility. As this distance is expanding rapidly, this marks a rising volatility. Moving on, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, serving as the resistance band, has shifted to $0.465. Whereas, its lower limit, acting as the support band, has moved to $0.361. Dogecoin ascends to $0.363 amidst upside The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator confirms the increasing price movement. Its value has improved up to index 42.97 over the last 24 hours. The ascending curve on the RSI graph reflects a rising bullish strength. The buying activities remained higher as compared to the selling activities today. If the bullish pressure continues to accelerate, the market can enter a period of stability. DOGE/USD 4-hour price analysis The four-hour price chart of Dogecoin confirmed a declining market trend for the currency. DOGE/USD value has dropped down to a low of $0.363 in the past few hours. The red candlestick on the four-hour price chart is indicative of a downward momentum. The Bollinger bands are widening, leading to an increasing market volatility. This increase in the market volatility signals a relatively higher market unpredictability during the coming hours. Moving on, the upper end of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, is now situated at $0.418. Conversely, its lower end, serving as the support band, is present at $0.355.

Dogecoin price analysis gives out a bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin value has spiked up to $0.363 during the last 24 hours. Conversely, the market sentiment remains negative as the bears remained dominant in the past week. From an overall perspective, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 5.84% of its value through the day. Technical indicators give out a neutral verdict; however, the price charts continue to support the bulls. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has a strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is considered a highly volatile coin, and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification is advised. However, the coin is expected to touch the $0.249 level by 2025. Why is DOGE up? DOGE’s price increased to $0.363 as observed over the last 24 hours. Side by side, the presence of strong resistance at the $0.465 mark is yet to be overcome by DOGE. Will DOGE reach $0.250? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by August 2024. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value of $0.099, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, the robust community support for this specific meme coin can push it to $1 soon. Will DOGE reach $5? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. The market speculates that DOGE will reach the $5 level by 2033. Though the time is considerable, it’s worth holding for handsome profits. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is following a downward pattern since it peaked at $0.219 on March 28, 2024, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.66 mark by 2030, so holding it for longer can be beneficial. Recent news/opinion on Dogecoin CoinGlass data shows that Dogecoin’s trading volume has surged by more than 76%. The surge is attributed to significant whale activity. Analysts remain optimistic about Dogecoin and expect further upside in the coming days. Dogecoin recorded a 31% gain to lift its price to $0.28 over the weekend, maintaining its bullish momentum. Since November 2021, the token’s current price has been the highest it has ever been. The value of the meme coin has increased by 155%, and it is currently double what it was a month ago. CoinGecko data indicates that Dogecoin has increased by 86% in the past week. The number is still well below the $0.71 mark, which was the peak established in May 2021. Read more about it here .

By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001, but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. Dogecoin traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. In 2023, Dogecoin began trading around $0.08, and closed the year at $0.08955. DOGE began 2024 consolidating around the $0.08 region. The market-wide bull run of March 2024 saw DOGE trading above $0.2, reclaiming its November 2021 levels. After June’s crashing price action, when DOGE plunged to $0.122 from the $0.160 range, July observed a further low of $0.107, but the meme coin recovered back to $0.134 by the end of the month. In August 2024, Dogecoin’s price fell from $0.1216 to $0.1011, and in September, DOGE recovered back to the $0.1282 range. October saw some recovery, as DOGE/USD recovered up to the $0.1759 range by the end of the month, and in November it spiked to $0.4312. At the start of December, DOGE is trading near the $0.440 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-19 13:57:00

From Deutsche Bank’s push to integrate blockchain technology with regulatory safeguards through its Project Dama 2 initiative to Lens’ $31 million funding round for scaling its SocialFi-focused layer-2 blockchain, these moves show the industry's efforts to balance innovation with practical adoption challenges. Deutsche Bank Develops Layer-2 Blockchain with ZKsync for Compliance and Efficiency Deutsche Bank , Germany's largest financial institution, is reportedly developing its own layer-2 (L2) blockchain solution on Ethereum. Utilizing ZKsync technology, the initiative aims to address the intricate compliance challenges of integrating public blockchains into regulated financial operations. This marks a significant step in the bank's adoption of blockchain technology, setting a precedent for other financial institutions. Deutsche Bank's L2 blockchain, known as Project Dama 2, is part of a broader initiative under Singapore's Monetary Authority (MAS) called Project Guardian. This collaborative program brings together 24 financial institutions to explore the tokenization of assets on blockchain networks. According to a report by Bloomberg , Project Dama 2 is designed to enhance transaction efficiency while embedding regulatory safeguards into its infrastructure. Unlike traditional public blockchain applications, Project Dama 2 aims to integrate blockchain transparency with strict compliance mechanisms. This innovative approach is expected to reduce risks such as exposure to sanctioned entities while ensuring that financial regulations are adhered to. The platform will feature trusted validators and grant regulators special oversight capabilities, ensuring a secure and compliant ecosystem. The bank plans to release a minimum viable product (MVP) for its L2 blockchain in 2025, but regulatory approval remains a critical milestone for the project's success. Deutsche Bank’s foray into blockchain technology could have far-reaching implications for the financial sector. By addressing compliance concerns through advanced regulatory tools, such as ”super admin rights,” the bank is setting a precedent for how blockchain can coexist with traditional financial systems. This move could pave the way for greater adoption of decentralized networks by financial institutions. The integration of features like transaction monitoring and auditing aligns blockchain's transparency with the stringent requirements of regulated finance. If successful, Deutsche Bank's approach may inspire other banks and financial institutions to adopt blockchain solutions for asset servicing and cross-border transactions. Moreover, this initiative could reshape perceptions around blockchain technology, highlighting its potential to enhance efficiency without compromising regulatory oversight. The project sheds some light on the evolving role of financial institutions in the blockchain space, positioning Deutsche Bank as a leader in the convergence of traditional banking and decentralized technology. Layer-2 blockchains are designed to operate on top of layer-1 networks like Ethereum, offering enhanced speed, lower transaction costs, and improved scalability. These qualities are essential for financial institutions looking to adopt blockchain technology at scale. By leveraging ZKsync, Deutsche Bank's L2 blockchain can ensure high-performance transactions while maintaining Ethereum's security and decentralization. The use of zero-knowledge proofs adds an extra layer of privacy and efficiency, enabling the platform to handle sensitive financial data without compromising on security. Additionally, the platform’s regulatory features, such as “super admin rights,” provide a controlled environment where regulators can monitor and audit transactions when necessary. These tools ensure that the L2 blockchain adheres to compliance requirements, addressing a significant barrier to blockchain adoption in regulated industries. Partnership with Crypto.com Deutsche Bank's blockchain ambitions are not limited to Project Dama 2. On Dec. 10, the bank partnered with leading cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com to provide corporate banking services across the Asia-Pacific region. This partnership spans countries including Singapore, Australia, and Hong Kong, and includes fiat-to-crypto exchange services and cross-border trading support for crypto companies. This collaboration is part of Deutsche Bank’s broader strategy to integrate blockchain and cryptocurrency services into its core offerings. The bank has also hinted at expanding its partnerships to the United Kingdom and other European countries, signaling its commitment to becoming a key player in the evolving crypto ecosystem. Despite its innovative vision, Deutsche Bank faces several challenges in bringing Project Dama 2 to fruition. Regulatory approval will be a critical factor in determining the project’s success. Financial regulators will need to assess the platform's compliance mechanisms and its ability to operate securely within existing legal frameworks. Furthermore, the integration of blockchain technology into traditional banking operations presents technical and operational hurdles. Ensuring seamless interoperability between decentralized and centralized systems will require robust infrastructure and significant investment. A New Era for Blockchain in Finance Deutsche Bank's initiative marks a pivotal moment in the intersection of blockchain and traditional finance. By addressing compliance challenges through innovative solutions like ZKsync-powered Layer-2 technology, the bank is setting the stage for a new era of financial services. As the project moves toward its anticipated 2025 launch, it will be closely watched by regulators, financial institutions, and blockchain enthusiasts alike. Success could position Deutsche Bank as a trailblazer in blockchain innovation, encouraging wider adoption of decentralized networks across the financial sector. Lens Secures $31M to Revolutionize SocialFi with Layer-2 Blockchain on Ethereum In related news, Lens, a layer-2 blockchain platform developed by Avara, has raised $31 million in a funding round led by Lightspeed Faction. The funds will be allocated to scaling the network's infrastructure in preparation for its mainnet launch, scheduled for early 2025. This milestone positions Lens as a key player in the emerging SocialFi space, aiming to redefine the way decentralized applications engage users. Lens is designed specifically for SocialFi use cases, providing developers with a suite of customizable plug-and-play features. According to its Version 3 developer preview, the platform offers tools like accounts, usernames, social graphs, feeds, and groups, along with monetization capabilities. These features are designed to seamlessly integrate into any application built on the Lens blockchain, making it a versatile and developer-friendly platform. Stani Kulechov, the founder of Lens and CEO of Avara, emphasized the platform's mission to make blockchain technology more accessible for mainstream adoption. “Existing L2s are still too costly for mainstream adoption. To bring Web3 SocialFi to the mainstream, we’re building the fastest, cheapest, and safest L2,” said Kulechov. Lens aims to deliver the user experience (UX) of Web2 applications while leveraging the unique benefits of blockchain technology, such as data ownership, control, and portability. “For participants, Lens will offer the best UX and multiple monetization opportunities to build their own financial rails,” Kulechov added. Built with ZKsync technology, Lens leverages the data availability protocol Avail to ensure fast and cost-efficient transactions without compromising on security. Its infrastructure is further bolstered by partnerships with prominent blockchain projects and companies, including: Alchemy: Providing developer tools and APIs for efficient application building. Chainlink: Integrating decentralized oracle solutions for secure off-chain data. The Graph: Offering indexing and querying services for decentralized applications. MetaMask: Ensuring seamless wallet integration for users. Uniswap: Facilitating decentralized trading and liquidity solutions. USDC: Enabling stablecoin functionality for financial transactions. These collaborations aim to create a robust ecosystem where developers and users can interact seamlessly, fostering innovation within the SocialFi space. The $31 million funding round attracted a diverse group of investors, including Circle, Consensys, Foresight Ventures, Wintermute Ventures, and angel investors like Rune Christensen, Anurag Arjun, Anton Bukov, Spencer Noon, and Illia Polosukhin. Lens was launched in May 2022 by Kulechov, who is also the founder of Aave, the renowned DeFi protocol. In November 2023, Aave Companies rebranded as Avara and launched a $250,000 grant program to incentivize developers building on Lens. Around the same time, Avara acquired the company behind the Family crypto mobile wallet, further consolidating its position as a leader in blockchain innovation. Lens and AaveDAO’s Partnership with Trump-Backed WLFI In an interesting twist, AaveDAO recently approved a proposal from World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a Donald Trump-backed platform, to launch an instance of Aave on Ethereum . The partnership agreement includes a share of 20% of the fees generated and 7% of WLFI’s governance tokens. While Lens is not directly involved in this development, it shows the expanding influence of Avara and its ecosystem in both blockchain technology and global finance. Lens’s unique focus on SocialFi and its ability to integrate plug-and-play features into decentralized applications mark it as a potential game-changer. By offering tools for developers, monetization opportunities, and user-centric data control, Lens aims to make blockchain technology accessible to mainstream users. With its innovative approach, strategic partnerships, and strong backing from industry leaders, Lens is set to redefine the SocialFi landscape. As the mainnet launch approaches, the project will likely draw significant attention from developers, users, and investors eager to explore the future of decentralized social and financial applications.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY|ZK,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-19 14:00:00

Yet, as investors are hunting for the next crypto moonshot in 2025, 1FUEL’s presale has quietly become the ultimate play. 1FUEL presale’s first stage sold out at lightning speed, rewarding early adopters with a 20% price boost and raising over $600k. Could this emerging gem be the best cryptocurrency to invest in right now? Let’s find out. Can XRP hit $18? The post-election rally’s crypto king Ripple’s XRP has shot up 115% in just a month and 310% over the past year. It’s now firmly positioned as the third-largest crypto, with a massive $140 billion market cap, comfortably seated behind only BTC and ETH. This surge comes on the back of Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse announcing the launch of RLUSD, a new stablecoin set to debut on Dec. 17 on major exchanges like Uphold and Bitstamp. Regulatory approval from New York authorities signals Ripple’s intent to disrupt the $203.5 billion stablecoin market. RLUSD aims to boost XRP’s utility, especially in cross-border transactions, enhancing its appeal. Yet, XRP still trades 20% below its all-time high of $3.40 from January 2018. While speculation swirls about XRP hitting $18, the upcoming bull market and RLUSD’s adoption could determine if Ripple’s vision becomes a reality. 1FUEL: The best cryptocurrency wallet revolutionizing digital asset management In a sea of DeFi projects, 1FUEL emerges as the best cryptocurrency to invest in for 2025. While XRP dominates cross-border payments with strong institutional ties, 1FUEL carves its path by tackling secure, anonymous digital asset management. Designed as a next-gen cryptocurrency wallet , 1FUEL simplifies cross-chain transactions, solving a pain point for multi-chain users. With one-click functionality and cold storage, it sets a new standard for privacy and convenience. Built-in privacy mixers make it the ultimate solution for everyday investors seeking anonymity amid regulatory scrutiny. 1FUEL integrates P2P trading and offers crypto staking rewards up to 30% APR, making it a passive income powerhouse.

Ethereum ( ETH ) slipped to $3,540, marking a 10% drop from its peak earlier this week. This retreat coincided with the sell-off of other coins like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Solana ( SOL ). Despite the price drop, Ethereum’s fundamentals remain strong. Notably, Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds have seen steady inflows, now totaling over $2.46 billion. These inflows have increased for 18 consecutive days, reflecting growing interest from investors. Ethereum ETFs are gaining traction as investors anticipate the SEC may soon allow staking within these funds. Currently, the absence of staking options has likely deterred some institutional investors from fully embracing these ETFs Funds by companies like Grayscale, Blackrock, Fidelity, Bitwise, and VanEck are the biggest holders of Ethereum. Meanwhile, the number of staked ETH coins has continued rising. There are now over 54.7 million ETH tokens , are now staked, supported by a growing base of more than 206,000 unique stakers. This trend underscores long-term bullish sentiment among investors who plan to hold their ETH positions.

These funds are much higher than most other chains like Solana, Base, and Arbitrum, combined. ETH retreated after the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates and maintained a hawkish tone. It now expects to cut rates two times instead of four in 2025. Cryptocurrencies and other risky assets do well when the Fed has embraced a dovish tone.

US plans to resume USD services in early 2025, anticipating changes in U.S. crypto regulations. The exchange halted fiat operations in 2023 due to regulatory pressure and SEC claims. Interim CEO Norman Reed noted on Wednesday that the current SEC administration has caused significant harm to American consumers and the crypto industry, including Binance.US. SEC’s Regulatory Assault In June 2023, the SEC accused the subsidiary of violating securities laws. It alleged the company offered unregistered investment products and engaged in anti-fraud practices. The platform has operated under restricted banking access since June 2023, when SEC civil claims triggered a suspension of dollar deposits and withdrawals. He noted that a key part of this regulatory assault was a concerted initiative by the outgoing administration to unjustly deny cryptocurrency and fintech businesses access to banking services. Reed argues that the SEC’s resistance to innovation has hindered the U.S. financial system’s potential and blocked most Americans from accessing the benefits of blockchain technology. Going Ahead With Optimism Despite ongoing legal battles with the SEC, he is optimistic, emphasizing that the SEC has failed to provide evidence of any wrongdoing after 17 months of compliance. Looking forward, with Paul Atkin’s nomination as the next SEC Chair, he foresees a clear regulatory framework for digital assets in the U.S. As USD services prepare for a return, Binance.US plans to launch new features in the coming months and expand its product lineup. “While I can’t provide a definitive launch date yet, let me be clear: It is not a matter of if, but when,” interim CEO Norman Reed said in the statement. “We are closer than ever to restoring USD services and our plan is to achieve this important milestone in early 2025,” he added. He underscored that the platform offers unique features, including 0% fee Bitcoin trading on BTC/USDC, which no other major U.S. crypto platform provides. It also supports 160 cryptocurrencies and staking for over 20 assets, offering more options than any other major on-chain staking platform in the U.S. He strongly believes that 2025 will be a breakout year for Binance.US, with the teams working hard at building a comeback story for the ages.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-19 14:02:49

Bitcoin Mining Machine Prices Soar in Shenzhen Amid Bitcoin Surge Mining equipment manufacturers and distributors in Shenzhen report increasing demand, with buyers coming mainly from Russia, the United States, Canada and other international markets. Russia Leads Demand with Low Electricity Costs Russia has emerged as a major buyer of mining machines thanks to its low electricity costs, which have significantly increased mining profitability, making the country an attractive location for large-scale Bitcoin mining operations. “The profitability of mining in Russia due to cheap electricity is driving bulk purchases of machinery,” said a Shenzhen-based distributor. Global Demand for Mining Equipment The recent surge in Bitcoin prices has revived interest in cryptocurrency mining and increased demand for high-performance mining hardware. Buyers from North America and Europe are also contributing to this increase, and miners are trying to take advantage of favorable market conditions. In Shenzhen, one of the world’s largest hubs for cryptocurrency mining hardware, this increased interest has tightened supply chains, pushing prices even higher. The rising cost of mining equipment signals renewed optimism in the cryptocurrency market, with miners preparing to expand their operations. However, experts warn that mining profitability is also affected by network difficulty and Bitcoin price stability. As global interest in mining continues to grow, Shenzhen continues to remain at the center of the industry, adapting to the changing dynamics of the Bitcoin market. *This is not investment advice.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC.

This sell-off accelerated after the Federal Reserve’s hawkish decision on Wednesday. Fundamentals like the rising TON inflation, falling burn rate, and poor performance of its ecosystem tokens mean that the coin may continue falling in the near term. Toncoin Price At Risk As Burn Rate Drops TON price may be at risk as its fundamentals continue to deteriorate. According to TonStat , the number of Toncoin burned a day has dropped to less than 6,000. This is a big drop since the figure stood at almost 40,000 in September, noting a 85% drop. A token burn is a situation where crypto coins are removed from circulation, boosting the remaining ones. In TON’s case, the token burn comes from the fees that the network generates. In theory, a cryptocurrency often drops when there is not much token burn going on. Toncoin Burned Toncoin’s burn rate has fallen as the annual inflation has continued rising. TON’s inflation has risen to 0.31%, its highest level since August, and much higher than the year-to-date low of 0.33%. This inflation happened as the number of new Toncoin minted a day has continued rising. It rose to over 84,000 on December 18, increasing the amount of supply. Toncoin Minted a Day Further data show that the amount of fees collected in the TON blockchain has continued falling. It fell to 11,505 TON on Wednesday from the year-to-date high of 78,000 TON. TON Blockchain Ecosystem Struggles Meanwhile, the TON ecosystem has lost momentum. The total value locked (TVL) in its DeFi protocols has continued falling and now stands at $275 million from the year-to-date high of $760 million. Further, most TON tokens have plunged as the number of users retreated. For example, the Hamster Kombat token has fallen by 22% in the last 30 days and only 2.7% holders are in profit. Similarly, PunkCity has dropped by 34%, while Catizen has fallen by 31% in the same period. TON Ecosystem Tokens Toncoin Technical Analysis: TON Could Fall To $4.440 The TON price recently peaked at $7.10, where it formed a double-top pattern. This pattern is made up of two peaks with a neckline, whose in this case is $4.4392, its lowest level on September 6. Toncoin price has also dropped below the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, which are about to form a bearish crossover. It has also moved below the Ichimoku cloud indicator. Therefore, the outlook for the coin is bearish, with the immediate target being at $4.4392, which is about 18% below the current level. It is also a few points below the 50% Fibonacci Retracement point. A move below that level will point to more declines, potentially to the 61.8% retracement point at $3.90. Toncoin price Chart On the flip side, the bearish view will become invalid if the coin rises above the key resistance at $6, the highest point on September 27.

On Wednesday, Powell laid out a cautious approach to interest-rate cuts for 2025. Stocks nosedived 3%, bonds crumbled, and 10-year Treasury yields soared to their highest in seven months. The selloff was brutal—the worst post-meeting market reaction since the pandemic. Investors, drunk on years of rate cuts and easy money, didn’t take the news well. Powell’s message was simple: the Fed is tapping the brakes. After three consecutive rate cuts, officials now project just two more reductions in the next 12 months. For traders betting on a steady flow of policy easing to prop up asset prices, this was devastating. The risk-on rally that defined the past two years? It’s done. Powell’s “neutral” stance rattles markets Powell’s caution wasn’t entirely unexpected. Economic data has been painting a mixed picture: inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target, while the U.S. economy has proven surprisingly resilient. Traders had already started pricing in higher yields, pushing the 10-year Treasury rate up by 75 basis points since September. But even seasoned market participants were caught off guard by how close the Fed appears to the end of its cutting cycle. Markets adjusted quickly—and violently. The swaps market now expects fewer than two quarter-point cuts in 2025. Some traders, like those in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) options market, are even betting on the Fed reversing course and hiking rates again next year. And then there’s the wildcard: President-elect Donald Trump. With just weeks before he re-enters the White House, Trump has promised aggressive economic policies. Higher tariffs and tax cuts are on the table, moves that economists warn could stoke inflation. Powell’s caution makes sense in this context, but it doesn’t make it any easier for traders already on edge. Global markets feel the heat The euro, pound, and Swiss franc each dropped over 1%, while the offshore Chinese yuan hit its lowest point since 2023. Emerging markets didn’t escape the carnage. The Indian rupee plunged past 85 per dollar, setting a new record low. The yield on India’s 10-year bond climbed to 6.78%, and the NSE Nifty 50 index fell 0.6%. A combination of weak regional currencies, capital outflows, and a ballooning trade deficit added pressure on the rupee. Meanwhile, riskier corners of Wall Street, which had thrived on rate cuts and optimism about Trump’s growth policies, were hammered. Goldman Sachs’ index of most-shorted stocks dropped nearly 5%, its worst day since February. A basket tracking profitless tech firms slid 6.4%, the sharpest fall in two years. Tesla shares tanked 8.3%, while Bitcoin, hovering near $108,000, tumbled 5%. A hawkish pivot with lasting effects The Fed’s decision to cut rates on Wednesday—a quarter-point reduction bringing the range to 4.25%-4.5%—should have been a relief. But the forward guidance overshadowed the cut. Powell’s dot plot, a tool showing policymakers’ rate expectations, forecasts just two rate cuts in 2025, down from four predicted in September. Investors, already wary of stubborn inflation and solid economic growth, feared the Fed might halt cuts entirely — or even tighten again. Stocks reacted accordingly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped over 1,100 points, marking a 10-day losing streak not seen since 1974. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell 3% and 3.6%, respectively.

Marathon shared a Securities and Exchange Commission Form 8-K filing on Dec. 19, revealing it bought its latest BTC tranche at an average price of $98,529 per Bitcoin. U.S. publicly traded companies use Form 8-K documents to disclose developments relevant to shareholders. Marathon Holdings now holds 44,394 BTC, worth a staggering $4.45 billion when the leading cryptocurrency was trading at $100,151. The BTC miner also disclosed approximately $263 million in note buybacks. According to a Marathon post on X, the remaining note sale proceeds—about $132 million—will be used to buy more Bitcoin.

As BTC’s price rises, companies report BTC yield to highlight investment performance. Critics like analyst Jacob King have blasted Saylor’s playbook, claiming MicroStrategy’s approach is akin to a Ponzi scheme and could collapse if Bitcoin’s price experiences a sharp downturn. Saylor’s general response to these critiques likened BTC to New York real estate in its early days.

Though there is no solid evidence to back this news, social media especially X(previously Twitter) is heated with discussions of these rumors. According to the speculations,UAE holds between 300k to 400k Bitcoin. With Bitcoin at $100k this bag values between $3b- $4b. Why do these rumors feel more than just talk? Connecting the Dots The UAE’s crypto developments over the past year seem to support these claims. In October 2024, the country launched its own AE stablecoin , pegged to the Dirham. They designed it to boost digital transactions and solidify the UAE’s place in the digital economy. In another major move, the Federal Tax Authority announced VAT exemptions for cryptocurrency transactions, retroactively applying them from 2018. This tax-friendly approach aims to attract investors and promote blockchain innovation. Then there’s the landmark decision by a Dubai court in August 2024, which ruled that salaries can be paid in cryptocurrency. These changes show the UAE isn’t just experimenting with crypto—it’s laying down a solid foundation for a future heavily integrated with blockchain and digital currencies. According to Vivek Sen , journalist at Bitcoin magazine, the founder and ex-CEO of Binance CZ has hinted about UAE holding BTC in reserve. Source : X.com Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset The idea of nations holding Bitcoin as a reserve isn’t new. U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis even proposed that the U.S. should accumulate 1 million Bitcoins within the next four years. As Bitcoin’s reputation grows as a “digital gold,” countries looking to diversify their reserves might start taking this idea seriously. For the UAE, it could make sense. Bitcoin prices recently surged past $93,000 in November 2024, partly driven by rumors of Middle Eastern sovereign buying. With major players like Standard Chartered offering crypto custody services and Binance establishing a strong presence in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, the UAE is positioned to benefit from this trend. What to Expect Whether the rumors are true or not, UAE’s actions towards crypto and blockchain tells clearly that they are preparing for the digital leadership. The policies, legal reforms and the strategic partnerships, all these indicate that they have a long vision for the crypto sector. If the Bitcoin reserve speculation turns out to be true, it could mark a historical shift in how countries approach digital assets. On one side the US government is pushing to make America the hub for crypto while the UAE is already on the path.

Lightchain AI ($LCAI): An Overview At its core, Lightchain AI merges the capabilities of blockchain and artificial intelligence to create a decentralized ecosystem designed for efficiency, scalability, and real-world application. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that focus solely on financial transactions, $LCAI integrates AI-driven innovations that go beyond transactional value to address pressing industry challenges. Also, Lightchain AI is powered by a hybrid consensus mechanism, combining the strengths of both Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). This combination ensures speed, security, and decentralization while minimizing energy consumption – a crucial concern in today’s world. Key Features of Lightchain AI Proof of Intelligence (PoI): A revolutionary consensus mechanism that incentivizes AI computations, ensuring that blockchain validation contributes to real-world advancements rather than mere energy consumption. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): This AI-powered virtual machine supports intelligent smart contracts, enabling real-time analytics, predictive modeling, and machine learning directly on the blockchain. Scalable and Sustainable Design: Lightchain AI employs parallel processing and adaptive resource allocation to overcome traditional blockchain bottlenecks, ensuring scalability without compromising security. Versatile Applications: From healthcare to supply chain optimization, $LCAI’s technology has broad applicability, making it a favored choice for industries seeking AI-powered blockchain solutions. Why Predictions Indicate a 300% Growth in 2024 Several factors contribute to the optimistic forecast for Lightchain AI’s price surge in 2024: 1. Growing Adoption Across Industries The unique combination of blockchain and AI positions Lightchain AI as a transformative solution for industries such as: Healthcare: AI-powered diagnostics and patient data management. Supply Chain: Improved transparency and predictive logistics. Finance: Smarter DeFi applications and risk analysis. As more enterprises adopt $LCAI for its advanced capabilities, demand for the token is expected to rise exponentially. 2. Increasing Interest in AI-Powered Solutions 2023 saw significant advancements in AI, and this momentum is expected to carry into 2024. With AI becoming a cornerstone of technological progress, Lightchain AI stands out as one of the few projects that effectively integrate AI into blockchain technology. 3. Exclusive Presale Momentum The ongoing presale of Lightchain AI tokens has generated substantial interest, with early investors positioning themselves to benefit from its growth potential. This strategic rollout not only boosts liquidity but also strengthens confidence in the project’s roadmap. 4. Market Sentiment and Technical Indicators Crypto analysts have highlighted bullish trends for $LCAI, citing: Positive Price Action: A steady upward trajectory since its launch. Low Market Cap: Offering significant room for growth compared to established players. Strong Community Backing: A committed base of investors and developers driving adoption. 5. Collaboration Opportunities Speculation around partnerships with industry leaders has further fueled optimism. Such collaborations could amplify Lightchain AI’s visibility and utility, attracting new investors and enhancing its value proposition. Lightchain AI vs Competitors To understand why $LCAI is poised for exceptional growth, it’s essential to compare it with some of its competitors: 1. Ethereum (ETH) While Ethereum remains the king of smart contracts, its scalability issues and high transaction fees make it less competitive against Lightchain AI’s advanced solutions like PoI and AIVM. 2. Solana (SOL) Solana’s high-speed network is impressive, but it lacks the AI-driven functionality that makes Lightchain AI a more versatile option for industry-specific applications. 3. Dogecoin (DOGE) Although DOGE enjoys a strong community, its limited utility as a transactional token pales in comparison to $LCAI’s broad real-world applications. What Sets Lightchain AI Apart? 1. Real-World Use Cases Unlike meme coins or speculative tokens, Lightchain AI focuses on solving actual problems. Its adoption in industries such as logistics, healthcare, and finance underscores its potential as a practical solution. 2. Sustainability With its energy-efficient PoI mechanism, Lightchain AI addresses the environmental concerns associated with traditional blockchain networks. 3. Democratizing AI Development By integrating AI capabilities into a decentralized platform, Lightchain AI empowers developers and organizations to access advanced tools without relying on centralized entities. 4. Community-Driven Growth Lightchain AI’s decentralized governance model ensures that the community has a voice in its development, fostering trust and transparency. Challenges to Watch While the outlook for Lightchain AI is overwhelmingly positive, it’s important to consider potential challenges: Market Volatility: As with any cryptocurrency, $LCAI’s price is subject to market fluctuations.

According to Martinez, long-term holders of Bitcoin are reducing their positions, a phenomenon that coincided with a market top during the last two BTC cycles. “Long-term Bitcoin holders often sell near market tops. Interestingly, in 2017 and 2021, their biggest sell-offs occurred right before the final leg up. Could we be on the verge of a similar pattern?

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB.

Specifically, even though the token is up a staggering 115.99% in the last 30 days, it is 3.42% in the red in the last 7 days and 5.53% in the last 24 hours to XRP price today of $2.35. XRP 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold Such a downturn likewise ensured that the cryptocurrency saw its market capitalization collapse by approximately $7 billion from $142.13 billion on the evening of December 18 to $135.5 billion at press time on December 19. XRP 7-day market capitalization price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap What’s behind XRP’s $7 billion plunge? Though such a plunge might be concerning for cryptocurrency traders, given the stagnant performance prevalent since early December, it is noteworthy that the bloodbath has little to do with XRP itself. Indeed, on the evening of December 18, there was a far-reaching downturn that ensured the Wednesday stock market session wiped $1.5 trillion, that the wider cryptocurrency market capitalization fell by a total of $300 billion, and that even gold – traditionally a safe-haven asset – collapsed more than 1%. Such a calamity was triggered by the Fed’s announcement that, despite reducing interest rates by the expected 25 basis points (BPS), inflation is expected to be higher in 2025 at 2.5% instead of the previously forecasted 2.1%, and that there will be fewer cuts in the coming 12 months. What’s next for XRP? Still, as evidenced by XRP’s own performance – and the performance of multiple other assets – it remains unclear if the sharp collapse will have a lasting impact. At its lowest, the token market capitalization fell to about $125 billion – some $17 billion from where it stood on the eve of Chair Jerome Powell’s speech. Furthermore, whale activity recorded by December 17 highlights that the token’s current struggles are more likely to constitute an accumulation phase than a prelude to a deeper plunge. On the flip side, the fact that XRP began its fall hours before the FOMC press conference started – from December 18 highs at $147 and last seven days’ highs at $155 billion – indicates persistent uncertainty about the token’s next move.

We were excited to work with BRET and other leading memecoins as we’re embracing their rise as digital cultural icons and transformation into interactive experiences that engage communities in new ways through Web3 gaming,"" Memecoins Join The Web 3 Gaming Multiverse Launched in 2023, Pixelverse became one of the fastest-growing gaming platforms on Telegram, achieving viral success with over 75 million registered users and 5 million daily active players, making it one of Telegram’s top mini-games. The latest move shows the evolution of the platform, bringing in new gamified memecoins to players. The launch of MemeBattle aims to bring the memecoin characters into a tactical battlefield, pitting the memecoin communities in a fun, humorous and engaging game. MemeBattle will leverage Base’s scalable infrastructure, low fees, and vibrant memecoin ecosystem to onboard users into Web3 gaming, driving engagement and adoption on-chain. It will bring familiar memecoins from the Base ecosystem, such as Brett, along with existing partners like Pudgy Penguins, MEW and Turbo, to life as playable characters, giving users the chance to build unique squads, strategize in battles, and climb leaderboards to earn rewards. On its addition to MemeBattle, one of the spokespersons from Brett shared: “Brett is coming to Pixelverse as a playable character, making him an integral part of web3 gaming. This will make memecoins like Brett more engaging and accessible. By leveraging Brett’s renowned IP, we aim to onboard more users onchain.” Growing Innovation Across Web 3 Gaming Pixelverse growth has been a testament to the consistent development and investment placed into the project. It is backed by some of the leading Web 3 investors in gaming including Delphi Ventures, Mechanism Capital, and Merit Circle, and bolstered by tier-1 exchange listings like Bybit. In addition, the gaming platform also secured grant funding from Gate.io’s $50 million Meme Fund, set up to empower meme creators and drive community-focused projects with real-world applications. As one of the first recipients, Pixelverse will use this support to elevate memecoins on Base by transforming tokens into gamified ecosystems through Web3 gaming. The transition from a clicker game into a gamified platform for memecoins is expected to transform and redefine Web 3 gaming engagement.

Seems that the downtrend triggered large whale sell-offs, commonly referred to as whales, in the hope to profit from previous gains. Today even Cardano saw a massive whale selloff. A recent Shiba Inu whale sell-off has sparked concerns in the market. This whale, who initially invested $3,800 in SHIB back in 2020, recently liquidated 250 billion SHIB valued at $6.05 million, adding to their total profit of $109 million. Despite the sell-off, the whale still holds 2.15 trillion SHIB worth $52.18 million. A whale sold 250B $SHIB ($6.05M) for profit in the past hour! The whale spent $3.8K to buy 15.28T $SHIB ($1.22B at the peak) as early as August 6, 2020. This whale currently holds 2.15T $SHIB ($52.18M), with a total profit of $109M on $SHIB . https://t.co/BWxcnWuwFR pic.twitter.com/aQZFPyhYSv — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 19, 2024 Traders Left Wondering: Why Now? The timing has traders asking: why sell now, and will they sell more? In the downtrend, this move could be a sign of a potential shift in whale behavior, often a key market driver. Large-scale liquidations can increase further price drops and impact retail investors, especially when they occur near crucial support levels. SHIB’s price has slipped below the significant 50 EMA ( Exponential Moving Average ) support, currently trading at $0.00002408. If it fails to hold support levels at $0.00002283 and $0.00002045, a sharper correction could follow. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Solana Meme Coin Fartcoin Sees Explosive Growth Amid Crypto Market Decline , Current Market Scenario The market is also under the grip of “Fear” as the Fear and Greed Index sits at 69 with today’s bloodbath. This shows that there is no immediate catalyst to pull the market. Considering the current market, if another big sell-off happens, turbulence could follow. But if SHIB continues to show strength , it might emerge even stronger. However, the SHIB community is rooting for its recovery by 2025 once the market sees a fresh circulation of money. Despite Sell-off SHIB is Poised to Rise Despite short-term challenges, Shiba Inu retains a strong community and speculative appeal, especially with its role in DeFi and meme culture. Analysts project a potential rally, with SHIB possibly hitting $0.00009 by 2025 due to major developments and bullish sentiments. Technical indicators, like the Bollinger Bands , suggest SHIB’s price might fall further in the short term. At the same time, the lower band indicates the token nosedive to $0.0000238, expected to go as low as $0.0000228 in search of a local bottom. However, despite the selloff an early trader made a whopping profit of $109 million which shows that traders are going long for SHIB. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

As XRP and Solana battle for dominance, Rollblock emerges as the underdog with moonshot potential, raising $7.3m in its presale. Table of Contents Rollblock: GambleFi giant’s presale chalks up $7.3 million in liquidity XRP: Feel good story of the year just gets better. Or does it? Solana: ETH killer loses ground to XRP Conclusion XRP and Solana are embroiled in a dominance battle, with XRP currently holding the upper hand but with many asking if XRP is sustainable. Solana, conversely, has lost ground, but analysts say it’s a temporary blip before Solana rights itself. Either way, it makes for a volatile ride, and experienced traders know that while two big dogs fight it out, there’s a smaller, undervalued token just waiting to be discovered for its moonshot crypto potential. Rollblock is the new entrant dragging away the big bone, and investors are clamoring to get in on the Rollblock presale . Rollblock: GambleFi giant’s presale chalks up $7.3 million in liquidity The crypto market is as unpredictable as ever, with big swings keeping traders on edge. But seasoned investors know the real moonshot potential often lies not in chasing volatility but in presales. Presales are where fortunes are made, offering tokens at their earliest stages before they hit the open market. One such opportunity making waves is Rollblock, a GambleFi project seamlessly DeFi with the booming online gambling industry. Rollblock’s ace up its sleeve is that it not only gives investors the opportunity at a moonshot presale where price action can return astronomical heights but also a profit share. Rollblock is taking advantage of the $500 billion online gambling sector and is offering investors a monthly dividend as a reward for enhancing the platform’s liquidity. This explains why Rollblock’s presale has already gained over $7.3 million in liquidity –making it the moonshot crypto of the year.

Remember when XRP was the third-largest token next to Bitcoin and Ethereum? That was… today! In an act reminiscent of its 2018 heyday, XRP pulled a moonshot crypto move, and now it is in its rightful place as a top-3 token. Is XRP’s growth sustainable? On the pro side, many say the SEC’s humiliation in the courts has set XRP free to be what it always could be. The anti-side states this is nothing but a feeding frenzy, and FOMO is driving the price and an inevitable crash will come. Solana: ETH killer loses ground to XRP Solana is branded as the Ethereum killer and grabbed headlines a month ago when it flipped BNB to take the number 4 spot behind BTC, ETH, and Tether. It was Solana’s turn to be a moonshot crypto, and things were looking great. A new ATH was chalked up in November. And just like that, Solana’s fortunes changed. BNB flipped back, XRP leapfrogged it, and Solana was back at position number 6. Solana’s advocates say this is just profit-taking and point out that Solana is still on track to be the Ethereum killer as Solana’s growth far outstrips that of ETH, and XRP is but a temporary blip Conclusion XRP and Solana show just how volatile crypto can be. While there is a ton of profit to be made, traders and investors need to keep their finger on the market’s pulse and time buy and sell calls perfectly. Not many have that appetite. Rollblock offers the best path for short-term gains and long-term price realizations for a smoother investment journey without the stomach-churning drops.

This marks a sharp increase from the $660.5 million stolen in 2023 and underscores the critical role cybercrime plays in funding Pyongyang’s government operations. There was $2.2 billion stolen from crypto platforms in 2024, and North Korea accounted for 61% of it, according to Chainalysis. North Korean hackers stole more from crypto platforms than ever before: $1.34 billion, which represents 61% of the total amount stolen for the year. pic.twitter.com/tVBsOKW8U7 — Chainalysis (@chainalysis) December 19, 2024 The country’s cybercrime network conducted 47 separate attacks this year, double the incidents attributed to them last year. These exploits target crypto platforms and decentralized finance systems to siphon funds that experts believe are directed toward North Korea’s weapons development and ballistic missile programs.

Their operations have also expanded to include infiltrating cryptocurrency firms under the guise of remote workers. In one notable case, 14 North Korean nationals were indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice for using false identities to secure remote IT jobs, generating over $88 million through data theft and extortion. The scale and frequency of these attacks are increasing. North Korean groups carried out more large-scale hacks exceeding $100 million in 2024 than in previous years, demonstrating a growing capability for massive thefts. Smaller-scale hacks have also risen, with attacks under $50 million occurring more frequently. The international community has long raised concerns about North Korea’s reliance on cybercrime to bypass sanctions. U.S. officials estimate that up to a third of the regime’s missile program funding comes from illicit online activities.

Hacking activity slowed significantly after June, coinciding with closer ties between North Korea and Russia. Analysts suggest the regime may have shifted its cyber strategies following a meeting between Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin, which signaled increased cooperation between the two countries. “It is therefore possible that,” the report read, “in addition to redirecting military resources toward the conflict in Ukraine, the DPRK — which has dramatically increased its cooperation with Russia in recent years — may have altered its cybercriminal activity as well.” The slowdown did little to mitigate the year’s overall impact. North Korea has emerged as a dominant force in cryptocurrency theft, responsible for two-thirds of global hacking incidents in 2024.

Analysts think the bullish momentum will continue into 2025. All three cryptos received notable adoption from the onset. Three altcoins, ONDO, SOL, and SUI, have surged in the 2024 bull cycle. ONDO, for instance, has gained nearly 1,000% in 2024, considering the initial rally phase in the year’s first quarter and the recent surge in the last quarter of 2024. SOL and SUI exhibited similar trends. However, SOL gained over 1,500%, while SUI’s rally reflected a 1,364% yearly gain.

Will the MOVE Price Reach $1?,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/is-this-the-next-big-thing-in-crypto-space-what-is-movement-network-will-the-move-price-reach-1/,"The post Is This the Next Big Thing in Crypto Space? What is Movement Network? Will the MOVE Price Reach $1? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Movement price is on the rise, gaining over 15% upswing in the past few hours after maintaining a consolidated trend since the start of the day. Interestingly, it is happening in the times when the wider crypto markets are facing massive sell-offs, with the Bitcoin price plunging below $100K while the Ethereum price heading towards $3500. With over 110% rise in the trading volume, the MOVE price appears to be poised to mark a new ATH above $1.45 shortly. What is Movement? Why is the MOVE price on the rise? Movement (MOVE) is the native token of Movement Network built on Ethereum and offers faster and more secure transactions using the Move programming language. The leveraging layer-2 solutions are expected to get more enhanced scalability, aiming to improve the interoperability with advanced features. Soon after the Movement Foundation launched the mainnet network accompanied by the governance token, MOVE, the price spiked high, marking the highs at $0.8. Moreover, the price maintained a healthy upswing and surged beyond $1 in the next few hours towards the ATH at $1.45, which attracted massive bearish pullback. Now that the MOVE price has triggered a strong recovery, will it rise back above $1 today? The short-term price action of MOVE suggests the token may experience a small pullback as it failed to sustain above the neckline of the recovery curve. Besides, the hourly MACD suggests a drop in the buying volume and with a potential bearish crossover, the price is expected to drop slightly below the curve but sustain above $0.716. The DMI, which is heading towards the bearish crossover, validates the claim. On the other hand, the RSI & OBV remain incremental, which suggests the price still remains within a bullish range. Therefore, these minor dips can be considered a good buying opportunity as the Movement price is poised to trigger a rebound and head towards a new ATH, probably close to $1.6 in the coming days.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-19 15:54:00

While the market was experiencing a decline, the Solana (SOL)-based memecoin Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) attracted attention with its rise. Fartcoin surpassed the $1 billion market cap on Dec. 18, up 113% in the last 30 days, despite much of the altcoin market experiencing double-digit declines on the day. The Fartcoin rally did not last long. Shortly after its market value exceeded $ 1 billion, Fartcoin retreated. However, Fartcoin rose again afterward and exceeded the $ 1 mark. Fartcoin, which has been in business for about 2 months, was launched on October 24. Although Fartcoin has experienced significant volatility in its market value, it continues to attract attention with its rise. As comments on Fartcoin’s rise grow, Unlimited Funds co-founder Bob Elliott said in an X post, “If Fartcoin is experiencing a parabolic rally, perhaps monetary policy is far from being too restrictive.” Bone Fide Wealth president Douglas Bentforth also referred to Powell's Bitcoin statements in an X post, saying, “The Fed can't own Bitcoin, but they haven't said anything about Fartcoin.” Having increased by 18% in the last 24 hours, Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) continues to be traded at $1.04 at the time of writing. *This is not investment advice.

In a tweet, Ki Young Ju, the founder and CEO of the market analytics platform CryptoQuant, highlighted the latest feat for BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). The ETF’s assets under management (AUM) are nearly double the figure that the BlackRock iShares Gold Trust (IAU) took 20 years to attain.

However, data from the crypto derivatives data analysis platform CoinGlass shows IBIT’s AUM at $58.57 billion at the time of writing. This figure is almost double IAU’s AUM, and it took IBIT less than a year to achieve the milestone. Earlier this month, CryptoPotato reported that IBIT became the fastest ETF to reach $50 billion in AUM, crushing the milestone 5x faster than any fund ever launched. The previous holder for this record, BlackRock’s iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (IEFA), took 1,329 days to reach $50 billion in AUM, while IBIT achieved the feat in 228 days. It is worth mentioning that these feats have been driven by bitcoin’s (BTC) rising price. The cryptocurrency hit $100,000 for the first time on December 5 and has rallied as high as $108,200 since then. Crushing Milestones and Exponential Growth Besides doubling IAU’s 20-year AUM and crushing the $50 billion milestone faster than any other fund, IBIT has recorded other remarkable achievements since the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlit its listing on January 11. The BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF reached $10 billion AUM within seven weeks of launch, a feat attributed to 150 out of the 3,400 ETFs trading globally. IBIT joined the top ten United States ETFs with the longest inflow streaks after seeing inflows non-stop for 71 days post-launch. Additionally, IBIT surpassed the AUM of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) within 96 of trading, becoming the largest spot Bitcoin ETF with 288,671 BTC; the fund’s holdings have now ballooned to 549,920 BTC, cementing its position as the largest Bitcoin ETF trading volume, AUM, and market cap.

Both cryptocurrencies have grown by leaps and bounds in 2024, nevertheless, perspectives vary on which will finally prevail in the altcoin industry in the forthcoming year. Related Reading: XRP Will Create Millionaires, Analyst Declares In Wealth Projection The Swift Ascendancy Of Solana Solana’s outstanding numbers have attracted interest. It outperformed Ethereum in several important benchmarks in December, including application income and decentralized exchange (DEX) volume: Solana brought in about $141 million in application income; Ethereum earned $93.56 million. Moreover, Solana’s decentralized exchange volume attained an impressive $67.43 billion, in contrast to Ethereum’s $52.37 billion. This development has prompted several experts to forecast that Solana may surpass Ethereum as the preeminent cryptocurrency by 2025. Analysts credit Solana’s success to its rapid transaction speeds and minimal costs, rendering it especially attractive for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The forthcoming Firedancer upgrade is anticipated to improve Solana’s network performance, potentially reinforcing its status as a pioneer in the DeFi sector. Will Ethereum Outpace Solana? Though Solana’s stats are excellent, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan notes the fast development of Ethereum’s ecosystem and projects that will allow it to surpass Solana by 2025. He emphasizes how Layer-2 solutions such as Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum help Ethereum’s scalability, thereby bridging the gap between institutional trust and daily access. People’s mental model of Ethereum is out of date. The common consensus is Solana is cheap/easy/fun and Ethereum is slow/unwieldy/expensive. But look at what’s happening in the AI agent space. Some of the most exciting “fun” projects, like Clanker and Virtuals, are playing out… — Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) December 18, 2024 Hougan points to Ethereum’s increasing competitiveness with Solana’s user-friendly appeal, therefore negating its antiquated reputation for being slow and costly. He also mentions the success of initiatives like Clanker and Virtuals on the Ethereum Base network, proving their capacity to encourage creativity while preserving a strong infrastructure. The Institutional Attraction Of Ethereum Conversely, Ethereum has remained active. It recently attracted over $850 million in institutional capital inflows to exchange-traded funds (ETFs), demonstrating its sustained attractiveness to investors. The anticipation of Ethereum’s Petra upgrade enhances the enthusiasm, promising substantial enhancements in speed and overall performance. Additionally projected to grow is Ethereum’s price. Depending on the increase of ETF sponsorships and institutional interest, some analysts estimate it might value $6,000 to $7,000 by 2025. Related Reading: Solana Poised For Growth In 2025 With Record $173 Million Q3 Funding—Report A Competitive Environment Both cryptocurrencies exhibit special strengths and shortcomings as we get toward 2025.

With the sentiment shift, the market capital is also rotating to Stacks (STX) and the viral utility coin DTX Exchange (DTX). Many investors are adding the innovative hybrid exchange DTX Exchange because of its future potential and the price trajectory that could follow Dogecoin’s gains. The inflow in Stacks (STX) has reduced a bit because of the temporary reversal, but it could pick up as the influx in utility coins increases. Dogecoin (DOGE) Fails To Hold The $0.40 Support Level Dogecoin (DOGE) is the largest memecoin, boasting a market cap of $56.52 billion; it has also been the no.1 meme coin since its inception. DOGE performed remarkably in the previous bull leg; however, it is going through a correction in the current market reversal. The Dogecoin touched a high of $0.48 on 8th December and since has decreased 21%, breaking below the $0.40 crucial support. Dogecoin is still trading above the mid-term moving average, and analysts believe this average could cause a bottom reversal soon. Whale Alert reported that a massive withdrawal of 4.99 billion DOGE was recently made to an unknown destination. At the time, this staggering amount of Dogecoin was valued at $2 billion. The sheer size of the transaction surprised many commentators, with some speculating that it could be an internal transfer by Binance. sBTC Now Live on Stacks (STX) Mainnet Bitcoin L2 Labs has launched sBTC on the Stacks (STX) mainnet, bringing programmable Bitcoin capabilities to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. This new resource, backed by Bitcoin at a 1:1 ratio, aims to strengthen the chain’s DeFi ecosystem and create new yield opportunities. Although the launch was slightly delayed from the original September timeline, it follows the Nakamoto upgrade, which brought faster transaction speeds and 100% Bitcoin finality to the Stacks (STX) network. This upgrade, which was rolled out in October, provided the technical foundation for sBTC’s successful release. In this initial phase, users can mint sBTC by depositing Bitcoin on Stacks (STX), with deposit-only functionality available. DTX Exchange Attracts Investors With 16,200% Upside Potential The DTX Exchange (DTX) has gained recognition as the most innovative platform in the trading sector, offering an all-in-one solution for traders with sensational features like 1,000x leverage. It is also the only platform that provides access to over 100,000 digital assets across different markets – stocks, cryptocurrency, forex, and bonds. Access to new-age investing instruments like Real World Assets (RWA) has also gained significant popularity on this platform. The platform is renowned for its high speed and unmatchable API, supported by advanced trading tools like AI risk management and distributed liquidity pools. The proprietary VulcanX blockchain has broken industry records, achieving a speed of 100,000 Transactions Per Second (TPS), ensuring smooth and ultra-speed transactions for the users. The platform prioritizes its community and security with decentralized technology, aiming for a user base of close to 400 million in 2025. DTX Exchange’s commitment to disrupting the trading exchange industry and multi-fold growth projection has attracted investments of over $10.3 million in the sixth batch of the presale. With strong fundamental growth and rapid developments in the ecosystem, the DTX Exchange is preparing for explosive growth in 2025. Experts believe that DTX can surge 16,200% from its current price of $0.12.

After Donald Trump was elected president, XRP experienced a major rally and approached the $3 level. However, even though XRP fell back to $2.3 levels with the declines experienced afterwards, a cryptocurrency analyst listed seven important events to follow for XRP. At this point, the analyst nicknamed Velo maxi, who advised not to sell XRPs until the seven major events he listed occur, stated that these events could have a significant impact on the value and market position of XRP. 1-RLUSD Launch: First addressing the launch of Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD, the analyst stated that he believes the launch will positively impact the XRP price. 2-Trump's Inauguration: Donald Trump, who won the US Presidential elections, will be sworn in as the US President on January 20, 2025. The analyst argued that if Trump introduces pro-crypto policies, these will positively affect the XRP price. 3-Gary Gensler's Departure from the SEC: SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, known for his anti-cryptocurrency approach, will step down next month and be replaced by Paul Atkins. Although the SEC-XRP case clarified the legal status of XRP, the market believes that the threat to XRP will not be completely eliminated until Gensler resigns. At this point, the analyst believes that a change in leadership at the SEC will benefit the entire crypto industry, including XRP. 4-Possible Solution to the Ripple-SEC Case: The analyst noted that the next SEC chairman could help resolve the XRP lawsuit, adding that if the case is concluded, the XRP price could reach new highs. 5-Start of Altcoin Season: The analyst stated that the start of the anticipated altcoin season will lead to a major growth in the XRP price. Bitcoin’s dominance currently stands at 58%. If this rate drops below 50%, it will signal the start of an altcoin season. 6-Ripple’s Major Bank Partnership: The analyst noted that Ripple is likely to announce a major partnership with a major bank. If this happens, the XRP price will be positively affected. 7- Potential XRP ETF Approval: Noting that there are already XRP ETF applications and that they could receive approval with the new SEC chairman before the end of 2025, the analyst said that a potential approval could increase the XRP price by attracting more institutional investors. The analyst finally advised XRP holders to “Be smart, not stupid,” advising them to wait for these key events to occur before deciding whether to sell their XRP. *This is not investment advice.

Stacey Herbert, director of the Bitcoin Office in El Salvador, posted on Thursday that the government-issued Chivo wallet — launched in 2021 in a bid to spread bitcoin adoption across the country — will be ""sold off or wound down"" as part of the deal. Other bitcoin wallets operated by private companies will ""continue serving El Salvador,"" Herbert said. The IMF stated on Wednesday that, under the agreement, El Salvador will also make bitcoin acceptance by the private sector voluntary, and that taxes will only be paid in U.S. dollars (not bitcoin). ""For the public sector, engagement in bitcoin-related economic activities and transactions in and purchases of bitcoin will be confined,"" the document also said, without going into further detail. Herbert, however, wrote in her post that El Salvador will continue to add bitcoin to its reserves — possibly, even, at an ""accelerated pace."" The Central American nation is currently buying one bitcoin per day; at press time, it held 5,968.77 bitcoin, worth almost $596 million. Herbert said that many of El Salvador's bitcoin-related projects, including the development of bitcoin capital markets and the offering of bitcoin educational programs, will continue to occur. The cryptocurrency's legal tender status will likewise not be impacted. The IMF has had misgivings about El Salvador's bitcoin initiatives ever since President Nayib Bukele made bitcoin legal tender in the country in September 2021, giving it the same status as the U.S. dollar, the nation’s official currency. In 2022, the agency warned that El Salvador was incurring ""large risks associated with using Bitcoin as legal tender, especially given the high volatility of its price."" ""The potential risks of the Bitcoin project will be diminished significantly in line with Fund policies,"" the IMF stated on Wednesday. Salvadorans were offered $30 in bitcoin to sign up on Chivo, but national adoption never really took off. By mid-2022, more than 60% of recipients had yet to make a transaction, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. A survey from the Central American University found in January that 88% of surveyed Salvadorans hadn't used bitcoin in 2023. The IMF itself will only provide $1.4 billion as part of the deal with El Salvador. Funds from the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and regional development banks are expected to bring the total amount to $3.5 billion as part of the same program.",Policy|El Salvador|IMF|Bitcoin|Chivo,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-19 16:10:39

One Of The Largest Coinbase Stock Sales This is one of Ark Invest’s largest Coinbase stock sales since it sold $2.8 million worth on September 23. Ark’s strategy generally aims to prevent any single stock from making up more than 10% of an ETF’s portfolio to ensure diversification, which means they may continue adjusting their holdings based on Coinbase’s performance. As of December 18, Coinbase is the second-largest holding in Ark Invest’s ARKF ETF, making up 9.9% of the fund, just behind Spotify. ARKF’s Coinbase shares are worth about $110 million, and the fund has gained 54% this year. Recently, the Fed announced a 25 bps rate cut yesterday in line with market expectations. However, Chair Jerome Powell’s subsequent speech introduced a hawkish tone, cutting the outlook for 2025 rate reductions from four to just two. This unexpected shift unnerved the markets, despite steady signs of sticky inflation in recent months. Coinbase’s stock traded for $279.86 at market close on Wednesday, down 10.2% for the day. Bitcoin and the broader market also reacted to Powell’s hawkish stance. Bitcoin fell around 9% from above $108,000 before Powell’s remarks to below $100,000 at one point before recovering. It is currently trading at $100,470, down over 3% in the past 24 hours. Markets Reacts To Fed’s Hawkish Remarks The market reacted to Jerome Powell’s statement that the Fed can’t own bitcoin without Congress approval, seeing it as a hurdle to Trump’s bitcoin plan. However, Trump’s plan, along with Sen. Cynthia Lummis’s proposed bill, aims to have the U.S. Treasury buy one million bitcoins over five years, not the Fed. Despite bearish market sentiment, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw strong inflows, adding $275.3 million on Wednesday and extending their positive streak to 15 days, totaling over $6.7 billion. U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs also saw inflows, adding $2.5 million and extending their streak to 18 days with nearly $2.5 billion in total. Looking ahead, heightened volatility is expected as markets price in elevated expectations for Donald Trump’s upcoming presidency. Nevertheless, despite short-term turbulence, the long-term outlook remains bullish.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-19 16:10:50

Table of Contents Cardano forms bullish pennant Ripple could double if it crosses major resistance Intel Markets presale soars over 700%, $4.9m raised Final words Cardano (ADA) has formed a bullish pennant pattern on the chart. A potential breakout could occur in the coming weeks, which might send the altcoin to $1.5. However, Intel Markets (INTL) , with its unique AI technology, has been the center of attraction. Accompanying the surge of interest, the INTL coin has increased by more than 700%, something ADA has not achieved in years. Meanwhile, DonAlt forecasts the Ripple (XRP) price might surge to $5.2 soon. Cardano forms bullish pennant Cardano has been trading in a narrow range this month but a very special pattern suggests a reversal could occur in the next few weeks. The Cardano coin has formed a bullish pennant chart pattern, which is a long vertical line and a symmetrical triangle. This pattern is almost at the convergence point. The Cardano crypto could break out anytime from now. If this happens, the Cardano price could go up to $1.5. However, a break below the support at $1.00, on the other hand, would negate the bullish outlook. Meanwhile, other factors may propel the price of Cardano to a new level in the short term. For example, increased crypto adoption spurred by Bitcoin’s massive surge above $107k could push ADA above resistance levels. VipRoseTr forecasts the value of the ADA token could surge to $2.0387 in the coming weeks. In the meantime, ADA’s price is consolidating between $0.921 and $1.17 on the weekly timeframe, per CoinMarketCap. Ripple could double if it crosses major resistance According to DonAlt, a top analyst in the crypto space, the value of Ripple might pump by 2x in the coming months. However, it must break out of its current range top at $2.60. Such a move could push XRP to a peak of $5.2. Ripplelordz predicts the price of XRP may rally to $4.8 in the coming weeks. In the meantime, the altcoin price has increased on the weekly chart. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the value of the Ripple token has increased by 13.3% in the past week. It has also risen by 136.6% on the monthly level and 309.6% on the yearly timeframe. In other news, Ripple has announced its plans to launch its stablecoin, RLUSD, on Tuesday. The launch is expected to increase the Ripple coin price in the coming weeks.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-19 17:26:00

Leading cryptocurrency mining platform NiceHash has demonstrated its willingness to lead by example by relocating operations from the British Virgin Islands to Zug, Switzerland. This strategic move to Europe’s Crypto Valley will support NiceHash’s commitment to adhere to global standards, particularly as European regulations tighten. The transition began in November and is expected to conclude by mid-December, once the minutiae of shifting HQ has been finalized. In doing so, NiceHash joins a handful of other crypto companies that have pledged to set up shop in the EU, including several tier-1 exchanges. New Address, Same NiceHash The decision to make the move to Swiss territory feeds into NiceHash’s goal of positioning itself at the forefront of compliant crypto mining services. The transition not only aligns with Switzerland’s robust regulatory framework but ensures adherence to the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) and the Travel Rule, both of which are reshaping the cryptocurrency industry. Switzerland’s reputation as a hub for blockchain innovation and regulatory clarity makes it an ideal destination for crypto companies such as NiceHash. Zug, in particular, has become synonymous with the crypto industry, hosting a thriving ecosystem of blockchain startups, industry leaders, and regulatory bodies that foster innovation while ensuring compliance. Crypto Companies Comply With MiCA The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), set to come into full effect by December 2024, represents one of the most comprehensive regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies. Covering crypto issuance, trading, and service provision, MiCA aims to establish a unified approach to crypto governance across EU member states, promoting transparency and investor protection. The Travel Rule, a separate but equally impactful regulation, mandates that cryptocurrency service providers collect and share customer information during transactions above a certain threshold. Its goal is to combat money laundering and illicit financial activities, aligning crypto operations with global standards applied in traditional finance. While there have been some concerns raised in regards to the EU’s wide-ranging new regulatory framework, particularly in the context of stablecoin issuance, industry players have widely accepted the regulations as the price of progress. They’re designed to weed out less scrupulous players, driving crypto users into the arms of legitimate companies committed to upholding rigorous security and compliance standards. Simplifying Cryptocurrency Mining Founded in 2014, NiceHash has become synonymous with cryptocurrency mining, offering a marketplace that connects sellers of hashing power with buyers looking to mine cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional mining operations that require significant upfront investment in hardware and energy costs, NiceHash democratizes access by allowing individuals and businesses to lease computational power on demand. Sellers can monetize idle GPU or CPU resources, while buyers can choose from a variety of mining algorithms, optimizing profitability and efficiency. This two-way marketplace has made NiceHash a popular choice for seasoned miners with hashrate to spare and newcomers exploring the space. While already compliant with EU regulations, the move to Zug demonstrates its determination to maintain its status as Europe’s favorite crypto mining platform.",Information,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-19 17:30:00

Particularly, Bitcoin’s price action in the past 24 hours has been between $98,839.87 and $105,306, highlighting the potential corrections that could occur as the cryptocurrency continues to edge upwards. This fluctuation comes amid a broader bull market cycle that analysts like CryptoCon suggest is far from over. Bitcoin Crash Below $100,000 Not The End Crypto analyst CryptoCon has been a consistent voice in tracking Bitcoin’s movements using Fibonacci extensions during the current market cycle. Back in August, when Bitcoin was hovering around $60,000, CryptoCon projected a surge to $109,236 by December. This prediction was based on the 0.618 Fibonacci extension and eventually played out with remarkable accuracy. Related Reading: Cardano Price Eyes Recovery Toward $2 As Million-Dollar Whale Transactions Explode On The Network Since first breaking above the $100,000 mark on December 5, this price point has proven to be a psychological barrier and there have been multiple retests since then. Despite this back and forth, Bitcoin enthusiasts remain strongly optimistic, and the Crypto Feat And Greed Index remains in Extreme Greed. As such, the correction in the past 24 hours is viewed by CryptoCon as a minor event in a larger narrative. According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s rise to $109,000 marked just one step in its ongoing journey. The analyst emphasized that corrections, while inevitable, are becoming less significant in the context of the increasingly well-established bull market. “Corrections are an afterthought. That doesn’t mean they won’t come, it just means they’re not important,” CryptoCon said regarding corrections. The Next Target: $166,000 By February 2025 Looking ahead, CryptoCon has turned attention toward the 5.618 Fibonacci extension as the next key milestone in Bitcoin’s ongoing bull market. This projection aligns closely with a price target of approximately $162,000. According to the analyst, this ambitious target could materialize as soon as February 2025, given Bitcoin’s current rate of price growth. Related Reading: Analyst Who Correctly Predicted The Fantom Breakout Above $1 Reveals What’s Next In The Parabolic Trend At present, Bitcoin is trading at $101,600. For the cryptocurrency to reach the $162,000 level, it would need to register another 60% increase from its current price point. CryptoCon does not see the February 2025 target as the conclusion of Bitcoin’s bull run. In fact, the prediction is accompanied by a detailed multi-year chart outlining Bitcoin’s consistent upward trajectory since November 2023. This chart highlights a pattern of steady 52% gains before encountering resistance at Fibonacci extension levels. The path to $162,000 is viewed as one of some price targets before notable corrections. Interestingly, the analysis also hints at an even loftier price target tied to the 6.618 Fibonacci extension level. If Bitcoin were to reach this extreme milestone, it would translate to a price of around $254,100. For now, Bitcoin appears ready for a steady continued growth above $100,000, with corrections in between.

In a December 19 post on X, Ju criticized South Korea’s economic policies, highlighting the rising value of the Korean won and the diminishing appeal of domestic assets. CryptoQuant CEO @ki_young_ju warns of economic instability in South Korea, calls for financial policy reforms. pic.twitter.com/Ma88zAE4Sv — Coinwaft (@coinwaft) December 19, 2024 Ju stated, “Domestic assets, including the Korean won, are not attractive at all.” South Korea’s Economic Instability, Capital Flight, and the Crypto Sector’s Concerns The CryptoQuant boss pointed out that government efforts to stabilize the currency have largely failed, exacerbating economic instability. Ju noted that aligning the USDT value on Upbit with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) rate is a warning sign, indicating diminished confidence in the Korean economy. This trend, coupled with the declining South Korean won (KRW), could signal capital flight, a phenomenon where investors move their assets abroad to avoid economic losses. The CEO expressed frustration with the government’s approach to retaining capital, emphasizing the need for fewer restrictions and more incentives to encourage investments. “The government should not forcefully hold on to capital that is fleeing overseas,” he remarked. Ju also shared his growing dissatisfaction as a domestic business operator, hinting at plans to relocate his company after seven years in South Korea. Just called my counter part in Korea, he says that the reports are FUD. The position is that the Korean authorities are clamping down on unregulated exchanges and exchanges that are not compliant. Further they are auditing the quality of the KYC. A banis not on the cards. — Ran Neuner (@cryptomanran) January 11, 2018 This capital flight could further destabilize the local financial system, making South Korea less appealing to international investors and impacting its global economic standing. Market Impact of South Korea’s Political Unrest Amid Regulatory Challenges and Taxation South Korea’s political turbulence has compounded its financial woes. The December 2024 impeachment of President Yoon Suk-yeol after a martial law declaration created volatility in the stock market. BREAKING South Korea President Yoon just declared martial law in country. People are thinking North Korea have something to do with it and Koreans are in panic mode.

The National Assembly’s decision to pause all crypto-related legislation has added to market uncertainty. Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok’s reassurances about stabilizing the economy have done little to address investor concerns. Similarly, South Korea’s restrictive stance on cryptocurrency has long been a point of contention. Plans to implement a 20% tax on crypto gains from January 2025, which have been delayed multiple times due to opposition, continue to face resistance. Recent amendments propose raising the exemption threshold to annual gains of 50 million won ($35,919), but these measures may not be enough to retain investor confidence. Adding to the scrutiny, former Democratic Party congressman Kim Nam-guk faces legal charges for concealing significant crypto holdings, underscoring the nation’s rigid approach to crypto governance.

The chair highlighted the Fed will evaluate progress on inflation before making further cuts in 2025. Fed Chair Jerome Powell raised investors’ eyebrows in his statement after the Fed announced further interest rate reductions. The chair expressed that there was a lot of uncertainty that would require the Fed to move slower before making any more cuts. Powell expresses inflation is still a concern amid the rate-cut decision Jerome Powell indicated the Fed would apply a more cautious approach in 2025 before making further interest rate cuts. In the final policy decision in 2024, the Fed lowered interest rates by a quarter point. The institution also signaled two more cuts in 2025 in its Summary of Economic Projections released on Wednesday. Read Chair Powell's full opening statement from the #FOMC press conference (PDF): https://t.co/jjyoItUGmt pic.twitter.com/4bHHy3t80Z — Federal Reserve (@federalreserve) December 18, 2024 The decision to make further cuts was widely expected; however, investors were surprised by the “dot plot” indicated in the new policy. The plot suggested the Fed would only reduce its fund rate by half a percentage point in the coming year. In response to the announcement, markets recorded declines as investors reacted to the uncertainty. The S&P , for instance, fell by more than 3%, pulling from its all-time high, while the Dow Jones Average fell by 2.6%. The official expressed that he believed inflation would continue to be a challenge in the next administration. The central bankers’ prediction on inflation is reportedly ending higher than expected in this financial year and even higher in 2025. When the path is uncertain you go a little bit slower, It’s not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking into a dark room full of furniture. You just slow down. – Jerome Powell The chair emphasized the economy was still recovering from the shocks that hit the globe in 2021 and 2022. He acknowledged the labor market was where it was required to be and the labor market pressures had subsided. Powell noted the labor market was still cooling and looser than before the pandemic. He, however, emphasized the cooling was not sufficient to cause alarm. In response, the Fed reduced its unemployment predictions from 4.4% to 4.2% for 2024 and from 4.4% to 4.3% for 2025. Powell expresses uncertainty on Trump’s proposed policy effects on inflation Powell also commented on Trump’s policies and the potential for new tariffs. The chair noted that some bankers had evaluated the uncertainty around how the incoming president’s policies would be implemented. He emphasized that they had also weighed how the policies would affect inflation before making their prediction. He stated the Fed would wait until the policies were implemented before making any further rate cut decision. Trump announced that he would impose tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada after he assumed office. Economists warned that increased import taxes would adversely affect the economy, as merchants would pass the increased costs on to consumers. The Fed, on the other hand, signaled increased concerns about how such tariffs would affect inflation in the new statement. Other economists suggested that Trump was unlikely to implement the trade tariffs and would only use them as a bargaining chip. Powell stated the Fed did not know much about the new policies and that it would be premature to make any conclusion. He expressed uncertainty about whether there would be retaliatory tariffs or how they would affect inflation. The Chair expressed his optimism, noting the outlook for the US economy was bright. However, he warned that it was necessary to stay on task. Investors only have themselves to blame Does the Fed know it’s Christmas at all? Does Jerome Powell even wish traders well? Wait. Did investors expect anything different from the Fed chair? The good news is that stocks are a little less expensive than they were Wednesday morning. However, the bad news is that trillions have been wiped off the market following the FOMC meeting. Many investors blame the Federal Reserve’s “hawkish cut” for the mayhem. This does not get any better. While officials did cut rates, their median projection for core inflation (the important stuff) shows they now expect inflation to persist above their target next year. It’s looking like next year will bring tighter Fed policy. It is getting to the time when many start turning to resolutions for the new year. Here is a suggestion for the people who set interest rates: publish your estimates of where you expect rates to settle in the medium run. Then, live by those decisions and do not count on Jerome Powell, the Fed, or Donald Trump to pull you out of the economic rut.

Powell’s comments instantly impacted the market, with the price of BTC dropping considerably, dropping below $100,000 to a low of $99,047 before recovering and rising to its current level. BTC is currently down just over 2% and trading around the $101,200 mark. Speaking about the pullback, ChangeNOW CMO Pauline Shangett noted, ""Powell's comments sent shockwaves through the crypto market with over $700 million in liquidations in just 24 hours, reflecting the high volatility of the crypto space."" The market cap also slumped, dropping by 3.50% to $3.52 trillion. Almost all major cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP) , Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) are trading in the red. Bitcoin (BTC) Slumps After FOMC Meeting Bitcoin (BTC) and the crypto market retreated after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced plans to slow down rate cuts in 2025, with the benchmark federal funding rates declining to a range of 4.25% and 4.50%. The Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points, lowering the federal funds rate. The decision matched expectations from analysts and market watchers. Despite this, the crypto markets registered a substantial decline following the decision. According to analysts, the market reaction was not because of the December rate cut, which was along expected lines, but the outlook for 2025. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted the bank has revised its 2025 outlook and dropped potential rate cuts from 4 to 2, suggesting a more hawkish outlook for the year, triggering a selloff in the crypto market. The Fed also raised its expectations for PCE inflation from 2.1% to 2.5% at the end of 2025, indicating that inflation could increase in 2025. The Fed's decision to reduce rate cuts and the potential spike in inflation could also adversely impact the current bull run as investors anticipate an unfavorable market. Following the announcement, BTC slumped below $100,000, dragging the market down. Federal Reserve Not Allowed To Own Bitcoin Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell rained on the crypto market’s parade after stating the central bank is not allowed to, or looking to hold Bitcoin. As a result, the price of BTC plummeted below $100,000, falling to a low of $99,047 before recovering to its current level. Powell stated, “We’re not allowed to own Bitcoin. The Federal Reserve Act says what we can own, and we’re not looking for a law change. That’s the kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed.” Powell made the comments in response to a question on whether he saw any value in a federal Bitcoin reserve, an idea mooted by President-elect Donald Trump as a way for the US to stay ahead of the competition as other countries embrace digital assets. However, experts have warned of risks associated with volatile assets like BTC. BTC’s value has soared since Donald Trump’s election victory, with the President-elect promising to create a friendly regulatory environment for the crypto ecosystem. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is down over 2% in the past 24 hours, as its price dropped following the FOMC meeting. BTC slumped to an intraday low of $99,047 before recovering to reclaim $100,000 and move to its current level. The markets also saw liquidations reach a staggering $700 million following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterating the central bank cannot own Bitcoin. Powell also predicted it could take 1-2 years for inflation to reach the desired 2% target, triggering widespread selloffs. BTC was quite bullish last week despite starting it in the red.

Tron historic price sentiment TRON price history Tron, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, raised $70 million through an ICO the same year; it launched its mainnet in May 2018 and migrated TRX from Ethereum to Tron in June, which temporarily boosted TRX’s price to $0.09. TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again. In 2021, it reached a high of $0.16. Tron was also reorganized as a DAO as Justin stepped down as CEO of Tron Foundation. TRX was in a bear trend for the best part of 2022. In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touched $0.2130 in late November. At the start of December, TRX is trading near $0.228.",Crypto Price Predictions|TRON,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|ICO|LINK|MARKET|TRADING|TRX|BNB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-19 17:51:00

Bloomberg reports that the global investment bank is building a layer-2 blockchain for leading smart contract platform Ethereum ( ETH ) to address regulatory concerns of financial firms such as inadvertently dealing with criminals and sanctioned entities. The layer-2 chain is incorporated in the firm’s multi-chain asset servicing pilot, Project Dama 2, which is part of the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) Project Guardian initiative, a collaboration of 24 major financial institutions that explore asset tokenization. Deutsche Bank’s Asia-Pacific industry applied innovation lead, Boon-Hiong Chan, says public blockchains such as Ethereum come with risks for regulated lenders such as not knowing who validates transactions, concerns over payment of transaction fees to sanctioned entities and threats of unforeseen hard fork. Chan says the layer-2 solution can help address these issues. He says the platform will allow banks to curate a “more bespoke list of validators” and potentially grant regulators super admin rights that will enable them to scrutinize fund movements. “Using two chains, a number of these regulatory concerns should be able to be satisfied. You are not dependent on the layer-1 for detailed transaction records anymore.” The bank launched a test version of Dama 2 in November and is hoping to launch a minimum viable product by next year.

This figure represents a dramatic increase from $660.5 million in 2023, emphasizing the role of cybercrime in funding Pyongyang’s government and military programs. A report has just come out showing that North Korean hackers are responsible for 61% of the $2.2 billion in cryptocurrency stolen from platforms around the world this year, to fund the regime’s weapons development and ballistic missile programs in an effort to circumvent international sanctions. Increased Sophistication and Frequency North Korea-linked cybercriminals executed 47 attacks in 2024, which is more than twice as many incidents recorded in 2023. These include the hack of decentralized finance systems and crypto exchanges through sophisticated means such as advanced malware and social engineering. One of the major tactics has been hackers impersonating remote IT workers. The U.S. Department of Justice recently indicted 14 North Korean nationals who assumed fake identities to get remote jobs, ultimately generating over $88 million through data theft and extortion schemes. The scale of these attacks is also increasing. In 2024, North Korean groups carried out more hacks of over $100 million than in any previous year. Smaller-scale incidents- less than $50 million-have also increased , suggesting a diversification in tactics. A Shift Following Closer Russia Ties Most of North Korea’s crypto thefts took place in the first half of 2024. Hacking activity slowed significantly after June, coinciding with growing ties between North Korea and Russia. Analysts say the regime may have shifted its cyber efforts following a meeting between Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin that underscored increased cooperation between the two nations. The Chainalysis report suggests that one factor contributing to North Korea’s new direction could be its collaboration with Russia. The regime may be diverting resources to support Russia’s war efforts in Ukraine, or it may simply be pursuing other avenues of cybercrime. Global Concerns and Implications This includes continuing worry over North Korea’s rise in cybercrime activities meant to fund the state military programs. In particular, U.S. estimates account that up to one-third of the regime’s funding comes for missiles from illicit activities via online portals. Despite a mid-year slowing, 2024 appeared to solidify North Korea’s position globally at the top of crypto thievery. It’s really hard to be as confrontational as Kim when people are afraid and concerned-as they should be-end.",Bitcoin|Blockchain,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2024-12-19 17:57:01

Powell said the Federal Reserve is not allowed to own Bitcoin and is not looking to change that. Fed Can’t Own Bitcoin Powell commented in response to a question on whether he saw any value in a Bitcoin strategic reserve. President-elect Donald Trump has promised to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve to stay ahead of the competition as other countries embrace crypto. Powell stated the Fed is not allowed to own Bitcoin and is not looking for a law change. “We’re not allowed to own Bitcoin. The Federal Reserve Act says what we can own, and we’re not looking for a law change. That’s the kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed.” Powell’s comments adversely impacted the price of Bitcoin, which fell sharply. Experts have warned of the risks associated with volatile assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s value has skyrocketed following Trump’s election victory and the prospect of a crypto-friendly administration. Trump has repeatedly stated he will create a Bitcoin strategic reserve, a concept n rejected in Europe. However, the President-elect has provided no details on what the reserve would entail, only saying initial holdings could include seized Bitcoin, a stockpile of 200,000 tokens worth $21 billion at current prices. Bitcoin has doubled this year, creating history when it crossed the $100,000 mark. A Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Plans to create a strategic reserve are already underway, with Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis introducing a bill proposing a reserve. The bill proposes the US Treasury buy 200,000 Bitcoin annually until its stockpile reaches 1 million. According to the bill, Fed bank deposits and gold holdings would fund the purchases. Analysts from Barclays believe funding a strategic reserve would require the approval of Congress and the issuance of new Treasury debt. The analysts also expected such a plan would face stiff opposition from the Federal Reserve. Fed Cautious On Rate Cuts As expected, the Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points. However, it also revised its outlook for rate cuts in 2025, indicating only two reductions instead of the four forecast in September. Powell stated the central bank would be looking for progress on inflation, adding that consumers are feeling the effects of high prices rather than high inflation. “We have been moving sideways on 12-month inflation. We understand very well that prices went up by a great deal, and people really feel that, and it’s prices of food and transportation and heating your home and things like that. So there’s tremendous pain in that burst of inflation that was very global. Now we have inflation itself is way down — but people are still feeling high prices — and that is really what people are feeling.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This is just days after the country sealed a $1.4 billion loan deal with the International Monetary Fund. The deal forces the scaling back of Bitcoin policies, but the Salvadoran government remains undeterred in its quest to accumulate BTC for its strategic reserves. El Salvador Reaffirms BTC Commitment, to Keep Accumulating Reserves El Salvador recently struck a $1.4 billion deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It is also looking to secure a $3.5 billion deal, but with certain concessions regarding Bitcoin (BTC) to secure the funding. As part of the agreement, the country has agreed to scale back its Bitcoin policies, particularly in relation to its official digital wallet, Chivo, which the country plans to sell or retire. Stacey Herbert, the Director of the National Bitcoin Office, highlighted the fact that Bitcoin would keep on playing a critical role in the country’s financial strategy. She said that, while the Chivo wallet will stop being active, the government will speed up its buying of Bitcoin, continuing to add more BTC to its reserves. EL SALVADOR SECURES $3.5 FUNDING DEAL Bitcoin remains legal tender El Salvador will continue buying bitcoin (at possibly an accelerated pace) for its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bitcoin capital markets will continue to be built; for example, the recent tokenized issuance… — Stacy Herbert (@stacyherbert) December 19, 2024 Presently, El Salvador holds 5,968.77 Bitcoin, which is nearly $596 million, with plans to purchase one Bitcoin per day. The IMF required Bitcoin use in the private sector to be voluntary. It also limited public sector involvement in Bitcoin transactions. Despite these restrictions, Herbert stated that many Bitcoin-related initiatives will continue. These include developing Bitcoin capital markets and expanding Bitcoin education programs. Despite Incentives, Bitcoin Adoption Remains Low In September 2021, El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. This decision was met with skepticism from the IMF due to Bitcoin’s high volatility. The IMF warned that Bitcoin’s adoption could risk future monetary aid to the country. A 2023 survey showed that 88% of Salvadorans had not used Bitcoin in the past year. This highlighted poor national adoption of the cryptocurrency. The Chivo wallet once offered $30 in Bitcoin incentives to encourage sign-ups. Despite this, more than 60% of users never made a single transaction. Despite these setbacks, President Nayib Bukele remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s role in the country’s economy. Earlier this month he celebrated the recent surge past $100,000. Recently, crypto exchange Bitget has achieved a significant milestone, becoming the first digital asset trading platform to be granted a license as a Bitcoin Service Provider by El Salvador’s Central Bank. This development comes after Bukele revealed that El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings have generated an unrealized profit of $362 million. Though the IMF agreement requires the country to make adjustments to its BTC strategy, the government remains determined to keep Bitcoin as legal tender and to expand its use in key economic initiatives.

Traditional wallets often lack safeguards to address real-world coercion scenarios. Addressing this challenge, Deus Wallet introduces a new feature – ‘d uress mode.’ This technology, integrated into Deus’s non-custodial framework, provides an added layer of security to help safeguard cryptocurrency assets and user safety in high-risk situations. The issue – C rypto security is more than digital While digital security has advanced with multi-signature wallets, biometric authentication and hardware devices, physical security remains overlooked. Criminals have adapted their tactics, targeting crypto holders. Considering real-life examples 2022, London – Criminals broke into a businessman’s home and extorted $1.1 million in Bitcoin at gunpoint. 2023, New York – A crypto trader was kidnapped and forced to transfer $400,000 while held captive. 2021, Bangkok – A prominent investor managing millions in crypto was ambushed by an international gang and coerced into transferring $2.7 million. In each case, victims lacked the tools to mitigate risks under pressure. Standard wallets provide no ‘last line of defense’ for these real-world threats. Deus Wallet – Next-level protection Deus Wallet tackles this vulnerability with its non-custodial structure and duress mode. This approach allows users to retain full control over their assets while incorporating an additional security measure designed to address specific risks. Non-custodial goal With Deus, private keys are stored exclusively by the user – not on any centralized server. This eliminates third-party risks such as hacking, insider theft or regulatory overreach. In an era where centralization poses increasing threats, non-custodial wallets offer unparalleled independence and security. Duress mode was developed with one goal – to protect users in life-threatening situations. The way it works Duress PIN configuration – Setting a secondary PIN during wallet setup. Under coercion – Entering the duress PIN instead of the regular one. Seamless Decoy – The wallet opens a fake account with minimal or no funds, while users’ actual assets remain hidden. This feature ensures that attackers see what appears to be the entire wallet balance, without ever suspecting the existence of hidden funds. Deus Wallet is part of a growing movement to rethink cryptocurrency security. As the crypto ecosystem matures, protecting users in both digital and physical spaces is becoming more important. The bigger picture Rising crypto adoption – As cryptocurrencies enter mainstream finance, the average user profile shifts from tech-savvy enthusiasts to general consumers, many of whom lack advanced security awareness. Criminal adaptability – Criminals exploit the pseudonymity of blockchain transactions, knowing that once assets are transferred, they’re nearly impossible to recover. The security gap – While solutions like hardware wallets protect against cyber threats, tools like duress mode address the issue of physical security. Deus Wallet is at the forefront of this shift, setting a new standard for protecting users and their assets. Key features of Deus Wallet Non-custodial architecture – Full control of private keys ensures users’ funds are always theirs. Duress mode – A revolutionary feature to safeguard assets under physical coercion. User-friendly design – Intuitive interface suitable for beginners and experts alike. Advanced encryption – Multi-layered security protects against cyberattacks. Customizable settings – Users can define access parameters and duress mode triggers according to their preferences. Cross-platform compatibility – Available on iOS and Android. In today’s world, digital and physical security go hand-in-hand. Deus Wallet provides a comprehensive solution, ensuring that users’ assets and personal safety are never compromised.

For example, MARA raised $1 billion in convertible debt last month, giving investors exposure to BTC equity instead of traditional interest income. Hut 8 sees its Bitcoin reserve as more than just a store of value. “We view our strategic reserve as a dynamic financial asset that can generate returns beyond a simple price appreciation,” CEO Genoot said. *This is not investment advice.

The altcoins have been hit even more severely, with massive double-digit losses from the likes of ETH, DOGE, ADA, AVAX, LINK, and many others. Cryptocurrency Market Overview. Source: QuantifyCrypto CryptoPotato reported yesterday’s price movements, which came just minutes after the latest FOMC meeting, in which Powell said the Fed couldn’t purchase bitcoin, and he warned that the rate cuts for 2025 might be halted. BTC slumped from over $105,000 to just under $98,000, and the altcoins followed suit. The primary cryptocurrency managed to recover some ground today and even spiked to nearly $103,000 hours ago. However, the asset is in another freefall state as its price plunged by several grand once again minutes ago, dumping to a weekly low of $97,500 (on Bitstamp) for now. As the graph above demonstrates, the entire cryptocurrency market is deep in red. XRP continues to bleed out as it dipped beneath $2.2 earlier and is now down by over 10%. Similar or even more severe price dumps are evident from DOGE, SHIB, AVAX, LINK, ADA, BCH, DOT, XLM, SUI, and even ETH. The second-largest cryptocurrency lost the important $3,500 resistance level and now sits below it after an 11% daily decline. These massive price fluctuations have harmed over-leveraged traders, with more than 330,000 such market participants getting wrecked over the past 24 hours. The total value of liquidated positions is up to over $1 billion, according to CoinGlass. The single-largest wrecked order took place on Bitmex. It involved ETH and was worth north of $11 million.

In a recent interview , Trump made it clear he’s ready to “lead the charge” if lawmakers agree to eliminate the borrowing limit, which currently caps how much money the federal government can borrow to pay its bills. “The Democrats want to get rid of it. If they want to get rid of it, I would lead the charge,” Trump reportedly said. He dismissed the debt ceiling as an outdated concept, suggesting that even experts aren’t sure whether breaching it would result in catastrophe or prove inconsequential. “It doesn’t mean anything, except psychologically,” he said. The comments come amid rising tensions over a potential government shutdown, which could occur Saturday at midnight if lawmakers fail to pass a funding deal. Trump criticized the current negotiations, calling a bipartisan agreement to avoid a shutdown a “Democrat trap” and taking aim at House Speaker Mike Johnson for what he described as an unacceptable resolution. $36 trillion in national debt and counting The United States is facing an unprecedented national debt crisis, with total federal debt now exceeding $36 trillion as of December 2024. Publicly held debt makes up $29 trillion of that figure, or 99% of the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP). Projections show the debt-to-GDP ratio could pass 100% in 2025 and may hit 172% by 2054 if nothing changes. This year alone, interest payments on the debt have skyrocketed by 34%, reaching $882 billion—more than the federal government spends on defense, Medicaid, or children’s programs. Meanwhile, the annual federal deficit is stuck at $1.9 trillion, mirroring last year’s figure. Government spending continues to outpace revenue, thanks to a combination of tax cuts and high borrowing costs. With the federal funds rate at its highest level in decades, the cost of financing the debt has surged, raising alarm bells among economists about long-term sustainability. Trump’s stance on the debt ceiling comes against this backdrop of growing fiscal uncertainty. While Congress suspended the debt limit through January 2025 in a deal reached last year, the president argued the measure only delays inevitable fights over borrowing authority. He revealed he had discussed his concerns with Elon Musk before the billionaire took to X (formerly Twitter) to share similar views on government spending. “I told him if he agrees with me, he could put out a statement,” Trump said. He described Musk’s perspective as aligned with his own, particularly on cost concerns.

The world's largest cryptocurrency lost 5.74% of its value in the last 24 hours. BTC is trading at $98,074 at the time of writing. BTC fiyatında yaşanan genel düşüşü gösteren grafik. The reason for the decline is thought to be the hawkish FOMC statements following the FED's expected 25 basis point rate cut announcement yesterday and the hawkish speech made by FED Chairman Jerome Powell during the press conference that interest rate cuts would slow down. While the FED's dot plot chart previously predicted four interest rate cuts in 2025, this number was reduced to two with the revision made yesterday.
