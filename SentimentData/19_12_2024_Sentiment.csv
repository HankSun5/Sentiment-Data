The firm claimed that it has shifted its focus to Bitcoin as the leading cryptocurrency, which has been profitable, especially with the current price increases. *Metaplanet Projects First Fiscal Year Operating Profit Since 2017* pic.twitter.com/oYNKOtNatR — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) December 18, 2024 Metaplanet expects an operating income of ¥270 million ($1.8 million) for the year ending December 31, which is an improvement from the ¥468 million ($3.1 million) loss it made the previous year. Sales are also forecast to increase at a much faster pace – from ¥261 million ($1.7 million) to ¥890 million ($5.8 million). Bitcoin treasury management powers growth Metaplanet has attributed a lot of its success to its focus on Bitcoin, especially through Bitcoin put options trading. The company has projected that it will earn ¥520 million ($3.4 million) from put options only. Put options allow Bitcoin investors to sell the digital currency at a specific price providing both protection and profit-making chance. Metaplanet stands to benefit from earning premiums on these contracts and, when exercised, receiving more Bitcoin. This has helped it to increase the number of Bitcoins it has and also helped it to generate revenue. The company currently holds 1,142 Bitcoin worth ¥17.6 billion or $119.4 million as of now, and this makes the firm the second largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in Asia. It goes further than simple trading, as the company has announced that it will create a separate “Bitcoin accumulation and management” business. Besides treasury management, Metaplanet has expanded its activities in the Bitcoin sphere. Recently, the company obtained a license to launch a Japanese edition of Bitcoin Magazine, which has become a new player in the digital asset media market. This could open up new income streams since the use of Bitcoin is on the rise in Japan and the rest of the world. The deal was announced in July at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, which was attended by the former US President, Donald Trump. Metaplanet is set to officially launch Bitcoin Magazine Japan in the first quarter of 2025. Bitcoin Magazine was launched in 2012 by Buterin and others and is one of the earliest outlets focused on Bitcoin. In a bid to strengthen its position, Metaplanet has offered ¥9.5 billion ($64.5 million) in bonds to increase its Bitcoin reserves. The company intends to use both debt and equity as capital to facilitate the accumulation strategy in the business. Besides Metaplanet, other companies that have been actively accumulating Bitcoin include MicroStrategy. This week only, MicroStrategy acquired 15,350 Bitcoin for about $1.6 billion and now holds 439,000 Bitcoin in its portfolio with a total value of over $46 billion.

Santiment’s data, on the other hand, showed that 104 whale wallets with >100K ETH jointly held over 57% of the total supply worth $333.1B. ETH holders exhibited increased faith in the altcoin this year as the group’s overall balances grew steadily despite market volatility. IntoTheBlock’s ETH data summary revealed that 74% of the holders had held the token for more than 1 year, while large holders accounted for 53%. The number of transactions with a value of $100K or greater had a total volume of $65.4B in the last seven days as exchanges recorded a netflow of -$912.97M. The data suggested that most of the ETH supply was aggressively being moved into whale wallets.

Roughly 110 million $ETH is now held by long-term holders. pic.twitter.com/smh7DZL1of — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 18, 2024 According to Santiment’s latest data, 104 whale wallets currently hold nearly 58% of all existing ETH tokens. These holdings reached an all-time high, suggesting a positive shift in long-term holder sentiment. These 104 whales reflected increasing confidence among ETH’s largest stakeholders as they continued accumulating despite the token’s ability to hold above $4K. Conversely, mid-level ETH holders (100-100K) dropped to their all-time low supply ratio, accounting for ~33% of the total supply. The broader Ethereum ecosystem generally included a rising number of staking wallets, signalling a bullish long-term outlook. Such sustained accumulation by key stakeholders suggested increased conviction and reduced selling pressure, which aligned with positive market sentiment over time. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that ETH’s price movement historically correlated with shifts in long-term holder sentiments. Long-term holders could, therefore, enter the ‘greed phase’ as the current bull cycle suggested a parabolic price surge. These holders were now in the early stages of the ‘belief’ stage, indicating they felt optimistic about ETH’s future price potential. If history repeated itself, this indicated that Ethereum’s major upward movement could still be on the horizon as long-term investor sentiment strengthened. Bitwise predicts ETH’s value will rise significantly in 2025 Juan Leon, senior investment strategist at Bitwise, said that Ethereum stood to benefit from several big trends in 2025. Leon claimed that ETH had positioned itself as the most ‘battle-tested’ smart contract platform, with an 81% share of the tokenization market. He argued that ETH would be the driving force behind the tripling of tokenized funds in 2025. Leon called ETH ‘the comeback kid of 2025’, saying it would likely lead in the $100 trillion tokenized real-world asset market next year. Ethereum was overshadowed by Bitcoin and Solana in 2024. The Bitwise investment strategist noted that Ethereum ETFs had attracted over $2 billion in net inflows over the past 10 days. Farside’s data confirmed a new daily record of $428.5 million in ETH ETF inflows on December 5th. According to the data, Ethereum ETFs saw less than three-digit daily inflows in only three of the 10 trading days Leon considered. Leon estimated that fees generated from RWA-linked activity on ETH could surpass its $2.4 billion YTD fees by more than 40 times in 2025. He attributed Ethereum’s next year’s dominance to its status as the most secure and reliable decentralized smart contract platform. Ethereum’s growth could also be accelerated by regulatory tailwinds and its widely distributed validator network.

Though some lawmakers and President elect Trump support a U.S. Bitcoin reserve. Powell’s comments caused Bitcoin to drop 5.7%, with other major cryptos also losing value, and the stock market reacted negatively. Powell Says No to U.S. Bitcoin Reserve Jerome Powell Fed Chair has made a point during a press conference that the U.S. central bank is not allowed to hold Bitcoin. He explained that according to the Federal Reserve Act, there are rules about what the bank can own, and Bitcoin is not part of that. He also stated that the Federal Reserve is looking for something other than a law change by leaving the decision to Congress. “We’re not allowed to own bitcoin. The Federal Reserve Act says what we can own, and we’re not looking for a law change. That’s something for Congress to decide, not the Fed.” These statements came after questions about the possibility of the U.S. government building a Bitcoin reserve, similar to how it holds gold. Powell stressed that any decision on the U.S. government holding Bitcoin would be up to Congress and not the Federal Reserve. He clarified that the central bank is interested in something other than getting involved in Bitcoin or changing its laws. Despite Powell’s firm stance, there has been growing interest in Bitcoin as a potential asset for the U.S. government to hold. Trump has supported the idea, suggesting that the U.S. should not fall behind other countries in the global crypto race. Some pro- crypto senators including Senator Cynthia Lummis from Wyoming, have been pushing for this idea. Lummis has even drafted a bill requiring the U.S. Treasury to buy one million Bitcoin over the next five years. President-elect Donald Trump has also supported the idea of the U.S. creating a Bitcoin reserve, saying the U.S. needs to stay ahead of countries like China by embracing digital currencies. Market Reaction to Powell’s comments After Powell’s comments, the cryptocurrency market reacted quickly. Bitcoin dropped to $100,300 which is down about 5.7% over the past 24 hours. By the time of the press release, Bitcoin was trading at $100,740. The cryptocurrency market also fell. Ethereum fell by 6.8%, Binance Coin (BNB) dropped by 4.6%, and Solana (SOL) by 8.1%. Dogecoin (DOGE) performed the least among the top 10 positioned tokens which is dropping by 11% to $0.348. The stock market also equally reacted negatively to Powell’s comments. The S&P 500 closed with a loss of 1.55%, and the Nasdaq 100 dropped by around 2%. These show how market is reacting to the news about government policies, especially when it comes to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Powell’s stance on not supporting a Bitcoin reserve created uncertainty among investors and also, they quickly adjusted their positions by selling. Jerome Powell’s comments made it clear that the Federal Reserve is not interested in holding Bitcoin or supporting the U.S. Bitcoin reserve. The market’s reaction showed how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are dependent from investors and policymakers.

Alternative Larger Metrics Show The Answer,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-ready-to-run-11-ath/,"A crypto analyst has shared an XRP price chart, analyzing its action on the 4-hour timeframe while pinpointing key metrics of strength that suggest a possible rally. The analyst has predicted that XRP is preparing for a significant run to $11, marking a new All-Time High (ATH). Key Metrics Suggest XRP Price Set For $11 Surge In an X (formerly Twitter) post on Tuesday, prominent crypto analyst Javon Marks shared key observations of XRP’s price behavior, noting signs of strength through crucial metrics and a potential for a significant price rally to a new ATH at $11. The analyst has suggested that XRP shows clear upward momentum, with a sharp increase visible on the presented price chart. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Crash Incoming? Tron’s Justin Sun Unstakes $209 Million ETH From Lido Finance Looking at the chart, XRP has been breaking recent resistance levels and maintaining bullish momentum. XRP’s strongest resistance at $0.5, which lasted for over three years, was broken earlier in November, jumping above $1 following Donald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential elections. Currently, the XRP price is trading above $2.5, underscoring the massive growth surge it has experienced in less than two months. Marks has revealed that he was keeping a close watch on alternative larger-term metrics for the XRP price that signal a potential surge to new ATHs. The volume bars below the price chart indicate steady buying pressure for XRP, with increasing trading volume during upward trends. Recently, the XRP accumulation trend among large holders has increased significantly. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed via a price chart that whales have purchased a staggering 30 million XRP within the last 24 hours. This increased buying activity reflects the growing confidence in XRP, possibly fueled by the market’s bullish sentiment and expectations of a price rally. At the bottom of the XRP chart shared by Marks, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) illustrates a sharp upward curve, signaling the potential for a bull rally. The RSI appears as a fluctuating black line, clearly reflecting rising momentum. If XRP can sustain its current uptrend, it could surpass its current all-time high of $3.84 set during the 2021 bull market, potentially reaching a new high above $11 in this bull cycle. Update On XRP Analysis The XRP price has been persistently attempting to break through the resistance area at $2.5, aiming to reach new highs. Over the past month, XRP has had an impressive performance, recording a whopping 119.5% price increase. Despite being in consolidation, the cryptocurrency continues to exhibit strong growth, with its price climbing nearly 8% in the last seven days as it attempted to break through key resistance levels.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC.

The apex crypto tumbled by as much as 5.3%, dropping to $100,752 after briefly soaring past $108,000 earlier this week in a record-breaking rally. Traders, spooked by the slower-than-expected pace of easing, pulled back speculative bets, hitting Bitcoin and other riskier assets. Fed signals fewer cuts The Fed’s quarter-point rate cut on Wednesday was widely expected, but its forecast left markets cold. Officials projected the benchmark rate to fall to 3.75-4% in 2025, down from an earlier prediction of a full percentage-point reduction. Morgan Stanley described the updated outlook as “much more hawkish than we anticipated.” This cautious approach suggests the Fed is prioritizing inflation control over aggressive stimulus. Fed Chair Jay Powell admitted that the December decision was a “closer call” than previous ones. He said inflation was moving “sideways,” while risks to the labor market had “diminished.” These comments signaled that the central bank might adopt a more restrained pace of easing moving forward. The policy change sent shockwaves through global markets. U.S. Treasury yields climbed, with the two-year note—closely tied to Fed policy—rising 0.08 percentage points to 4.33%. The dollar strengthened by 1% against a basket of major currencies, while Wall Street’s S&P 500 dropped 1%. Risk assets, including Bitcoin, bore the brunt of this recalibration. A recalibration in monetary policy The Fed’s rate cuts have been framed as part of a broader “recalibration” of monetary policy aimed at curbing inflation. Officials raised their estimate of the neutral rate—one that neither stimulates nor constrains the economy—to 3%, up from 2.5% a year ago. Revised forecasts showed the Fed expects core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, to reach 2.5% in 2025 and 2.2% in 2026. These figures are slightly higher than earlier projections. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.3% over the next three years. Markets were already on edge following the September decision, where Fed Governor Michelle Bowman dissented, marking the first internal opposition to a rate cut since 2005. The December move, though expected, came amid continued debate among officials about inflation’s trajectory. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, rose at an annual rate of 2.8% in October. Powell described this phase as a “new process” in the Fed’s approach, explaining that future rate cuts would require a higher bar for approval. The Fed’s goal remains clear: bring inflation back to 2% without derailing the labor market or broader economy.

This collaboration enables BOB to secure transactions using Bitcoin as its anchor chain, providing a level of finality and irreversibility unique to the Bitcoin network. Integration Brings Bitcoin Finality to BOB The integration with Babylon equips Build on Bitcoin (BOB) with “Bitcoin finality,” ensuring that transactions recorded on its platform are permanently and irreversibly secured on Bitcoin’s blockchain. This mechanism, as a result, strengthens the security and trustworthiness of BOB’s hybrid layer two network, distinguishing it from other Bitcoin-based L2 solutions that lack Bitcoin-native security. Babylon, recognized as the leading Bitcoin staking protocol, manages a total value locked (TVL) of approximately $6 billion. The protocol, as a result, allows Bitcoin holders to stake their BTC, contributing to the security of decentralized applications and earning rewards in return. Introducing BOB as a Bitcoin Secured Network (BSN). Through our integration with @babylonlabs_io , we’re bringing Bitcoin finality to the Hybrid L2 and making @build_on_bob the best place to use BTC Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs). https://t.co/K6baJZ2TAs pic.twitter.com/YmQLiaa9r9 — BOB (@build_on_bob) December 18, 2024 Through Babylon’s protocol, BOB can use Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) to release Bitcoin liquidity into DeFi applications while retaining Bitcoin’s robust security. Hybrid L2 Model Combines Bitcoin and Ethereum Features Build on Bitcoin hybrid layer two model blends Bitcoin’s security with Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities. The network aims to create bridges to other blockchains while using Bitcoin as the final settlement layer. With over $200 million in TVL, 320,000 users, and 100 projects, BOB has positioned itself as a prominent player in the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem. The integration is also part of BOB’s larger roadmap. As part of Phase 2, BOB will launch bridges that connect Bitcoin to other networks using BitVM, a new computing framework enabling Ethereum-like smart contracts on Bitcoin. The testnet release for BitVM is scheduled for early 2025, signaling BOB’s commitment to expanding Bitcoin’s DeFi potential. Lombard’s LBTC Joins the BOB Ecosystem To further enhance its ecosystem, BOB has announced the integration of LBTC, the largest Bitcoin LST, managed by Lombard Finance. LBTC, with a TVL of $1.6 billion, becomes the fourth LST deployment on BOB, following Ethereum, Base, and Binance Smart Chain. Approximately 80% of LBTC’s TVL is already actively deployed in DeFi applications, reflecting its importance in the staking landscape. This addition bolsters Build on Bitcoin’s efforts to expand Bitcoin staking liquidity and amplify DeFi activity on its platform. Through partnerships with staking providers, wallets, and aggregators, BOB has simplified the process of staking Bitcoin with a one-click solution. Subsequently, to celebrate its integration with Babylon, Build on Bitcoin has launched a 45-day campaign aimed at incentivizing Bitcoin staking and DeFi activity. Over this period, an additional 4.5 million Babylon Points will be distributed daily to eligible users. In addition, the campaign includes additional incentives from BOB’s LST partners, such as Bedrock and PumpBTC, to encourage wider adoption. Users will be able to easily convert native Bitcoin into staking positions on Build on Bitcoin via the “BOB Stake” portal, which supports a seamless transition into DeFi applications.

The international body maintains that the technology presents both opportunities and challenges. According to the World Bank article authored by Jaime Saavedra (Human Development Director for Latin America and the Caribbean at the World Bank) and Ezequiel Molina (Senior Economist), if properly implemented, AI can boost learning and teacher training, which could also mean more specialized support for students. A good example of a country tapping into this use case is Ecuador. There is reportedly a successful AI tutoring program that was able to improve the math skills of students for a mere $18 per head in the country. The fear the general public and various governing bodies have regarding artificial intelligence is valid. It could even be necessary to ensure the creation does not spiral out of moderate ranges. Common fears about AI’s impact on education Critics have raised valid concerns about the impact AI will have on equity, effectiveness, and the very nature of learning itself. However, the truth is that AI is already being used in most aspects of human society which is why the World Bank believes it is important that we confront these challenging questions now. According to the World Bank, it is not irresponsible to promote AI even when many schools lack the minimum conditions to operate the technology. While it admits that many schools still require fundamental infrastructure and well-qualified teachers, the World Bank publication highlights how properly implemented technology can help bridge the gaps faster. AI can scale up teacher training and become a great learning aid that allows teaching materials to reach remote areas quickly. This means students who need extra support can get it more easily and effectively. On the question of whether AI will serve human communities or if it will be the other way around, the publication conceded that this is a truly legitimate concern shared by many people. AI development is concentrated in the developed nations of the Global North (North America and Europe), so it is possible for developing nations not to focus on their crucial local needs, such as native language content and culturally relevant teaching approaches. The solution according to the World Bank is strategic engagement. It recommended developing local AI talent via targeted scholarships and training, creating partnerships for local language content development, establishing clear regulatory frameworks that protect data sovereignty, and building teachers’ digital skills through comprehensive training programs. One country that seems to be ahead where creating a regulatory framework for AI is concerned is Uruguay. In the country, they’ve developed guidelines for AI use that respect local teaching methods while leveraging AI advances. Such a framework ensures the technology serves their educational purposes, and not vice versa. Will AI make students lazier? One of the most common questions teachers and parents have asked since generative AI like ChatGPT went mainstream is how it will affect students’ work ethic. While it is true that tools like ChatGPT will become a crutch, promoting intellectual laziness and superficial learning, the World Bank says what matters more is how people use it. The World Bank article argues that its capabilities mean students always have a high IQ partner to either brainstorm problems or more commonly, do homework. It went on to maintain that while AI can promote complacency among students, it did not invent cheating. Hence, it is ultimately up to a person to decide how to use it productively. The sophistication AI tools offer presents an opportunity to fundamentally rethink how we teach and assess learning. After all, we know technology can facilitate focusing on what truly matters: developing higher-order thinking skills, creativity, and critical analysis. One country that has proven this is Nigeria . In the country, the World Bank ran some pilot programs that revealed a fascinating fact: under proper guidance, students who learn to use AI tools thoughtfully actually engage more deeply with the material. So, rather than asking students to summarize texts (something AI can do instantly), teachers can urge them to critique AI-generated analyses, compare different AI interpretations, or even use AI as a brainstorming partner while coming up with their own novel ideas. According to the World Bank, a good teacher is able to encourage critical thinking via thoughtful conversations. With AI, more teachers can prepare effective lesson plans and activities for difficult-to-teach skills. Recommendations for implementing AI responsibly in schools In the field of education, there have not been many scientific breakthroughs regarding learning because educational research, unlike medical research, often struggles to reach classroom practice. However, the World Bank believes AI can change this pattern. How? By adopting the same evidence-based approach used in medicine, pharmaceuticals, or food safety – forging ahead consciously without allowing the fear of innovation to paralyze growth. Still, no new medical procedure or food additive is ever introduced to the public without proper testing, so a systematic approach to AI in education is required. According to the World Bank, we will have succeeded in properly harnessing the power of AI when we can manipulate the technology while keeping the human element at the center. Since education mainly focuses on human interaction, we have the opportunity to use AI to make this interaction more effective and enjoyable, but only as an assistant, not a replacement. Focusing on this principle will ensure that the technology serves our educational values and not the other way around.

In a recent complaint, the wBTC custodian and Sun-affiliated BiT Global accused Coinbase of using wBTC – the tokenized representation of Bitcoin ( BTC ) on the Ethereum ( ETH ) blockchain – as a “cash grab” before delisting it and replacing it with its own version of the asset. Said the complaint, “In the case of wrapped Bitcoin, Coinbase viewed it as just another cash grab. It saw a competitor, wBTC, that had something it wanted: an innovative product that released value inherent in Bitcoin and let users utilize that value in bold new ways… Coinbase decided it would take what it wanted. Once the value in wBTC had been demonstrated, Coinbase changed the rules, delisting wBTC from its platform so that it could no longer be traded on the Coinbase platform – and it did so shortly after launching its own knock-off clone called cbBTC.” In response to the complaint, Coinbase says it made the decision to delist wBTC largely because of its links to Justin Sun and the risks that would arise should he have any influence over it. The exchange notes that Sun’s name is “conspicuously” left out of BiT’s complaint. “Coinbase made the decision—based on a rigorous internal process—that wBTC should be delisted from Coinbase’s exchange due to the unacceptable risk that control of wBTC would fall into the hands of Justin Sun. BiT now asks the Court to override, on an emergency basis no less, Coinbase’s judgment that continuing to list wBTC could compromise the integrity of its platform and put customers at risk. BiT seeks to force Coinbase to do business with an entity that no longer complies with Coinbase’s standards due to Mr. Sun’s ‘material involvement.’ And yet, Mr. Sun’s name and connection to wBTC is conspicuously absent from BiT’s Complaint and TRO (temporary restraining order) request. So too is any acknowledgement that he has repeatedly been accused of, investigated for, and sued for financial misconduct, and that reports of his alleged misdeeds abound in the press and crypto community more broadly.” Coinbase also alleges that Sun is “infamous” in the crypto community and that he has been accused of several wrongdoings, including market manipulation and misappropriation of digital assets.

The US Federal Reserve axed interest rates by 25bps as expected, but played down the prospect of substantial further easing in 2025. BREAKING: The S&P 500 falls sharply after the Fed cuts rates by 25 basis points, but raises inflation forecast. The Fed reduced their outlook from 3 to 2 rate cuts in 2025 and raised inflation expectations from 2.1% to 2.5%. Inflation is back. pic.twitter.com/kKtEHD0IF0 — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 18, 2024 US equity markets and major cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC) , which had probably been looking for an excuse to pull back following their very strong performance in recent weeks, were dumped. And this bled across in the highly speculative crypto meme coin space, with meme coin total market cap collapsing to $106 billion from $117 billion on Tuesday, per CoinMarketCap . Crypto bulls will likely remain confident that there will be a reversal of the market’s fortunes into the year’s end. That’s because the incoming Trump administration is set to be the most pro-crypto in history, a complete 180-degree shift from the anti-crypto stance of the outgoing Biden administration. And global crypto adoption is also accelerating, not least thanks to increased chatter about the establishment of Bitcoin strategic reserves in nations all around the world. If one country implements a Bitcoin strategic reserve you can kiss goodbye to your 4 year cycles. I already laid this out in January and assumed an adoption cycle. Think 2002 big tech. pic.twitter.com/k5mQQNJRLw — Tyler (@TylerDurden) December 17, 2024 That means there is fertile ground for the return of a new meme season, with Shiba Inu likely to lead any such rally. That said, the latest developments in the Shiba Inu price chart are concerning. Is a short-term price crash right around the corner? Bearish Chart Developments – Is the Shiba Inu Price About to Crash? The Shiba Inu price’s latest drop has seen it slump under its 50DMA, after falling below its 21DMA earlier in the month. Moreover, SHIB has now also broken to the south of an upward trend channel in play since mid-November. All that suggests a drop back towards the next major support zone around $0.00002160 is on the cards, a further 11% decline from current levels. However, things would only really get bad for Shiba Inu if the meme coin broke below its uptrend from its summer 2024 lows. That could open the door to a retest of the 200DMA under $0.000019 or lower. But SHIB bulls should not fear. Yes, maybe the Fed won’t cut interest rates as much as the market wants in 2025. But this is not the end of the world for crypto markets, nor meme coins like Shiba Inu. As noted, the US crypto industry is about to enter a new golden age and global adoption is accelerating. Bitcoin may be the initial beneficiary of this, but this will eventually work its way into the altcoin and meme coin space. As a leading name in the space with a massive community and vast web3 ecosystem, Shiba Inu is going to attract substantial demand. To, for investors able to hold through some near-term turbulence, Shiba Inu price dips are a great opportunity to accumulate this high potential meme coin .

According to Hougan, Ethereum’s reputation as slow and expensive is becoming outdated as advancements in its ecosystem address these challenges. Bitwise CIO Predicts Ethereum Layer-2 Growth Will Outpace Solana by 2025 According to a recent tweet by Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, Ethereum Layer-2 networks are transforming the platform’s reputation and usability. Hougan noted that Ethereum’s advancements in scalability and user experience rival those of Solana, traditionally recognized for its ease of use. Moreover, Hougan highlighted projects like Clanker and Virtuals, AI-driven applications thriving on Ethereum Base network. These developments demonstrate Ethereum’s ability to support innovative, user-friendly solutions while maintaining its robust infrastructure. This shift is pivotal for ETH as it aims to combine institutional-grade credibility with improved accessibility for everyday users. Matt Hougan added, “If Ethereum can retain its institutional bona fides but level up ease-of-use, 2025 will be a good year indeed. It’s the Layer-2 network thesis playing out in real-time.” Despite the competition between Ethereum and Solana blockchains, VanEck predicted new all-time highs for both assets by 2025. Ethereum is projected to surpass $6,000, driven by Layer-2 growth and staking integration, while Solana is forecast to exceed $500 due to its scalability and adoption in DeFi and NFTs. VanEck also expects Bitcoin to reach $180,000, fueled by U.S. adoption and corporate holdings. Layer-2 Networks Propel Accessibility Ethereum’s evolution is largely driven by its top Layer-2 solutions, such as Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum. These solutions address long-standing issues of scalability and high transaction costs. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan emphasized the importance of these networks in making Ethereum ecosystem competitive with platforms like Solana. By leveraging Layer-2 technology, Ethereum provides a more seamless experience for developers and users. This advancement positions the platform as a hub for projects that require both scalability and affordability. Bitwise CIO predicts that this Layer-2-driven transformation will drive Ethereum’s growth in 2025. Moreover, Ethereum’s infrastructure is favored for projects in artificial intelligence (AI) and decentralized finance (DeFi). With a growing number of applications leveraging its infrastructure, Ethereum continues to demonstrate its versatility. Bitwise CIO believes this adaptability strengthens Ethereum’s position as a leader in blockchain technology. While Ethereum makes strides in accessibility and innovation, Solana recently overtook it as the leading ecosystem for new developers. According to Electric Capital, Solana experienced an 83% year-on-year growth in monthly active developers, ending Ethereum’s eight-year dominance in this metric. Despite Solana’s achievements, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan remains confident in Ethereum’s trajectory.

Here’s Why Qubetics Is the Next Best Crypto to Buy Under $1,https://thecoinrise.com/renders-success-left-you-wishing-heres-why-qubetics-is-the-next-best-crypto-to-buy-under-1/,"In the world of cryptocurrency, timing can be everything. The regret can be palpable for those who missed the opportunity to invest in Render during its early days. Render ($RNDR), now a household name among blockchain enthusiasts, began humbly but rapidly captured the attention of forward-thinking investors. Its ICO price was a mere fraction of its current value, and those who recognised its potential have seen their investments soar exponentially. However, if you’re feeling you’ve missed out, there’s a new opportunity on the horizon that could rival Render’s success – Qubetics ($TICS). The Rise of Render: From Underdog to Powerhouse Render debuted with an ICO that saw tokens priced at just $0.05, an absolute bargain in hindsight. Its vision was revolutionary at the time: a decentralised GPU rendering platform designed to streamline creative industries. Despite scepticism, early believers reaped life-changing gains as the project gained traction. Fast-forward to today, and Render is valued significantly higher, delivering returns that make investors’ eyes light up. But what about those who missed the boat? While hindsight can be cruel, the crypto market constantly evolves, offering new opportunities to capitalise on innovation. This is where Qubetics comes into play – the best crypto to buy under $1 right now. Why Qubetics Could Be the Next Big Opportunity Qubetics is currently in Presale Phase 13, and excitement is reaching a fever pitch. Unlike Render’s initial days, Qubetics has already achieved impressive traction, with over $7 million raised, more than 10,600 holders, and 355 million tokens sold. The price of $TICS tokens is just $0.034, making it an attractive entry point for investors seeking the best crypto to buy under $1. With weekly presale phases bringing a consistent 10% price hike, Qubetics is designed to reward early adopters handsomely. By the final presale phase, the token will experience a 20% price jump, making now the most compelling time to act. Post-presale projections suggest a target price of $0.25 per token, delivering a staggering ROI of 630.27% for those entering at this stage. Analysts are even more bullish, predicting Qubetics could soar to $10 or even $15 following the mainnet launch, offering potential returns of 29,106.88% and 43,660.31%, respectively. Imagine investing today and seeing your portfolio multiply beyond your expectations. Could Qubetics be your second chance at capturing gains similar to those who believed in Render early on? Innovating Cross-Border Transactions: The Qubetics Advantage What sets Qubetics apart isn’t just its presale success – it’s the groundbreaking utility it offers. The Qubetics Network empowers banks and financial institutions by enabling near-instant cross-border payments and settlements using the $TICS token. Institutions can leverage blockchain technology to perform transactions faster, more cost-effectively, and with enhanced transparency. The ability to execute international payments efficiently is crucial in an increasingly globalised business environment. Traditional systems are slow, riddled with inefficiencies, and lack the transparency that businesses and individuals now demand. Qubetics’ solution addresses these pain points, ensuring funds are transferred securely and swiftly. This means improved cash flow and operational efficiency for businesses, while for individuals, it ensures faster remittances and reduced delays. For anyone seeking the best crypto to buy under $1, Qubetics offers a rare combination of real-world utility and explosive growth potential. Why Timing Is Everything As we’ve learned from Render’s story, hesitation can be costly. Those who waited on the sidelines missed the chance to buy low and reap the rewards of early adoption. Qubetics offers a similar, if not greater, opportunity to position yourself for significant gains. With the next presale phase imminent and the token price set to rise again, the window of opportunity is shrinking. Every passing week brings higher prices, and the potential for missed gains grows larger. If you’re searching for the best crypto to buy under $1 that combines innovation, strong community backing, and exceptional growth prospects, Qubetics is a clear frontrunner. Conclusion: Don’t Let Another Opportunity Slip Away Cryptocurrency history is filled with stories of missed opportunities and rich with tales of redemption. Render’s meteoric rise may be behind us, but Qubetics presents a fresh chance for investors ready to act. With its presale success, groundbreaking real-world applications, and analysts’ bullish predictions, Qubetics is the best crypto to buy under $1 today. The presale phase is your chance to get in early, secure a favourable position, and watch your investment grow. Will you seize this chance, or will you look back with regret, wondering why you hesitated? The choice is yours, but the clock is ticking.

This bumps their ENA holdings to 741,687, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. WLFI’s December buying spree totaled nearly $45 million , expanding its position across multiple crypto assets. The breakdown: $30 million secured 8,100 Ethereum (ETH). $10 million was invested in Coinbase Wrapped Bitcoin (cbBTC). $2 million each allocated to Chainlink (LINK) and Aave (AAVE). $250,000 picked up 134,216 Ondo (ONDO) tokens via Cow Protocol on December 16. WLFI tokens rally as the market responds The crypto market hasn’t ignored WLFI’s spending spree. Several of its key assets have rallied, with Chainlink (LINK) leading the charge at a 28% surge, now valued at $28. Aave (AAVE) followed with a 17% gain, landing at $52. Ethereum (ETH) edged up by 8%, trading at $3,912. WLFI’s purchases have fueled speculation about the project’s ability to boost confidence in these tokens. The platform has partnered with AaveDAO, leveraging Aave’s protocols for lending and borrowing services. In return, AaveDAO gets 20% of WLFI’s fee revenue and 7% of its total token supply. And then there’s Justin Sun, founder of TRON, who invested $30 million in WLFI. His involvement has been a bit controversial, but the backing undeniably adds firepower to WLFI’s arsenal. But WLFI hasn’t had it easy since its September unveiling. Early token sales brought in $220 million, but wallet authenticity concerns during the launch cast doubt over the project’s credibility. Despite the briefly strong start, sales have slowed. WLFI wanted to sell $300 million worth of tokens but has managed to offload less than 25% of the remaining supply.

Choi Sang-mok, the nation’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Strategy and Finance, admitted that “domestic and international uncertainties” remain in the wake of a successful vote to impeach President Yoon Suk-yeol earlier this month. Not Negative on Crypto: Finance Chief Per Newsis , Choi told reporters that the government would “not let its guard down” in spite of the turmoil . Choi Sang-mok, South Korea’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Strategy and Finance, speaking on December 17, 2024. (Source: JTBC News/YouTube/Screenshot) He claimed Seoul would “manage the economy as stably as possible” by “gathering all the capabilities of the public and private sectors.” South Korean lawmakers have recently claimed to have issued an “all-stop” or pause on all crypto-related legislation following the political chaos of early December. Yoon declared martial law on December 3, only for lawmakers to force their way into parliament and overturn his decision. Impeachment Ruling Lawmakers have since voted to impeach the President. But the ruling is yet to be ratified by the constitutional court. Yoon has been suspended pending a verdict, with the People’s Power Party faction de facto ruling the nation in his stead.

(Source: CoinGecko) Choi responded to questions from the media on December 18, with one journalist asking him about US President-elect Donald Trump’s “position on strategic crypto reserves.” “Since the specific details of the strategic cryptoasset proposal from President-elect Trump have not been revealed yet, this is not the time to evaluate it. We plan to prepare a response and other measures when the new US administration takes office. We will act after these and other and new proposals related to cryptoassets become concrete.” Choi Sang-mok, South Korea’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Strategy and Finance Crypto Tax Delay The Deputy Prime Minister also spoke about the National Assembly’s recent vote to delay the launch of crypto tax to 2027. He explained: “The government is not negative on cryptoassets. As regulations and related systems are still in their infancy, we decided to defer [the crypto tax launch]. Because we judged that it would be appropriate to monitor the progress [of regulations] before we introduce taxation.” Trading volumes on the South Korean crypto exchange platform Upbit over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Choi further claimed that the central Bank of Korea, financial regulators, and “other related authorities” are currently “preparing new regulatory policies” for the crypto sector. He said these focus “not only on customer protection,” but also on “the legal nature” of crypto. And Choi said these parties were also looking at more “general” issues on “how to regulate this sector domestically.” “Everything has happened at lightning speed from beginning to end.""

The People’s Power Party has faced stiff opposition from the Democratic Party, which has a large majority in the National Assembly.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-18 23:36:00

After hitting a local top of $1.32, ADA retraced over 30%, dropping to $0.91 before returning to a critical support level. This price action has left investors speculating whether the current recovery marks the start of a new bullish phase or simply a temporary pause before further downside. Related Reading: Solana Monthly Chart ‘Looks Ready For A Monster Run’ – Details Top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared key insights on X, leveraging Santiment metrics to shed light on whale activity driving Cardano’s market movements. According to Martinez, large ADA holders began taking profits as the price rallied from $1.15 to $1.33. However, the story shifted dramatically as ADA dropped below $1, with whales accumulating again at the $0.91, signaling renewed confidence in the token’s potential. With whale activity and market dynamics heating up, Cardano has returned to a pivotal price range that could define its trajectory in the coming weeks. Investors are now closely watching whether this accumulation phase will fuel a sustainable rally or if further consolidation lies ahead for ADA. One thing is certain—Cardano remains a token to watch as volatility continues to shape its price action. Data Reveals Cardano Whales Behavior The past few weeks have been highly volatile for Cardano (ADA), reflecting the broader market’s unpredictable movements and the strategic plays of smart money. ADA has become a focal point for large investors making calculated moves as the market evolves. Top analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted data from Santiment that underscores the pivotal role of whale activity in shaping ADA’s price action. Martinez revealed that Cardano whales began offloading their holdings as the price rallied from $1.15 to $1.33, locking in significant profits. However, as the price dropped sharply to $0.91, these same whales re-entered the market, purchasing an impressive 160 million ADA during the dip. This buying spree has sparked optimism, suggesting that smart money views Cardano as bullish over the coming months. Such activity often indicates confidence in the asset’s potential to rebound and possibly outperform. However, it’s crucial to consider an alternative perspective. This accumulation phase might also serve as a short-term liquidity strategy designed to attract retail investors into ADA, potentially setting the stage for another wave of profit-taking by larger holders. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Load Up: Bullish Sign Or Bear Trap? As ADA hovers near critical levels, its next moves will likely depend on how these dynamics unfold. Whether this is a prelude to a sustained rally or a tactical maneuver by smart money, Cardano remains a key asset to watch in the weeks ahead. Price Holding Above $1 Cardano (ADA) is trading at $1.04, marking a swift recovery after spending only a few days below the critical $1 mark last week. This rebound showcases strong buying interest around the $1 level, which has historically acted as a psychological and technical support zone. If ADA manages to sustain its position above $1 in the coming days, the next target lies around $1.20—a price level that previously triggered significant selling pressure. Reclaiming this level would confirm bullish momentum and signal buyers are ready to challenge higher resistance zones. For ADA bulls to maintain momentum and drive the price higher, breaking and consolidating above the $1.20 mark is crucial. This would demonstrate the market’s strength and potentially pave the way for a broader rally. However, failing to claim $1.20 could result in another period of consolidation or even a pullback, as sellers may step in to defend this resistance level.

However, experts like Nic Carter caution that its volatility could destabilize the global financial system. Despite these risks, Bitcoin’s growing adoption suggests it could play a larger role in future finance if the Government adopts it. Bitcoin has become an investment and a potential store of value. As governments and states explore new ways to hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, one of the best ways is the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Several U.S. states are now considering Bitcoin as a reserve asset, which could alter how financial systems operate. Bitcoin as a Financial Asset Unlike traditional currencies Bitcoin isn’t controlled by any government or central authority. Over the years, Bitcoin has grown with both retail and institutional investors considering it as an alternative investment. Some see Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, a store of value, and even a potential future currency. In recent times, even governments and large corporations are starting to take notice of Bitcoin’s potential as Reserve. One of Bitcoin’s biggest supporters has been Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy. Saylor has purchased about 439,000 Bitcoins which is about$46 billion worth for his company’s treasury. This sets an example for other companies and governments to consider Bitcoin a reserve asset. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Interest from U.S. States Ohio has recently introduced a proposal for a “Bitcoin Reserve Fund,” which is allowing the state to purchase Bitcoin as part of its investment strategy. Recently, El Salvador and the Central African Republic have both adopted Bitcoin as an official legal tender. Companies like Metaplanet also adopts Bitcoin reserve as an asset, As this follows from other states of U.S. like Pennsylvania and Texas, which have also proposed laws to create Bitcoin reserves. In Ohio, House Republican Leader Derek Merrin introduced the Ohio Bitcoin Reserve Act (HB 703) in December 2024. This bill would give the Ohio State Treasurer the authority to buy Bitcoin, protecting against the devaluation of the U.S. dollar. Merrin stated, “The U.S. Dollar is being rapidly devalued, and our State Treasurer should have the authority and flexibility to invest in Bitcoin when determining proper asset allocation.” As Bitcoin offers strong potential as a reserve asset due to its deflationary nature, with a fixed supply of 21 million coins making it a hedge against inflation. It ensures security and independence from political or banking instability. Bitcoin also provides diversification for state reserves, which is reducing reliance on traditional assets. Risks and Challenges of a Bitcoin Reserve Nic Carter, founding partner of Castle Island Ventures recently in Bloomberg expressed concerns about the potential adoption of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset during an interview on Bloomberg TV. He argued that such a move could undermine global confidence in the US dollar, which is the most important of the current financial system. Carter stated, “I don’t think this is going to happen because it would erode confidence in the dollar, and that would be a negative outcome for everyone involved.” He also believes that using Bitcoin as a reserve asset could cause more problems than benefits. He pointed out that Bitcoin’s price can be very unstable, which could create issues for the global financial system, which currently depends on the stable US dollar. He said, “This is not a good idea because it could lead to volatility and instability in global markets.” As Bitcoin becomes more popular, it’s important for policymakers and financial institutions to think about these risks. As we all know the main problems with using Bitcoin as a reserve asset is its price volatility. Bitcoin’s value can change dramatically in a short period. For example, in 2021, its price went from nearly $70,000 to around $30,000. This kind of price swing makes Bitcoin an unstable choice for governments, as it could lead to unexpected losses if its value drops suddenly. Another issue is the lack of clear regulations around Bitcoin as he mentioned. Recently, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently said that nothing to do with Bitcoin that there are no laws governing its use. So, the market reacted all of a sudden when Powell’s comments. That led to a sudden drop in Bitcoin’s value from $107,00 to $101,300. So, Bitcoin can be a risky asset for governments, as sudden changes in the market can lead to financial instability for investors. Possible Futures for Bitcoin R eserves Matt, Bitwise CIO said that in an interview by December 2025, Bitcoin will likely surpass $200,000. He highlights three key things could support for the rally, ETFs, public companies like MicroStrategy, and even governments buying Bitcoin. As Matt puts it, “there’s just too much demand, not enough supply,” which he believes that will make the price higher. Also, Matt argues that we’re still in the early stages of this journey. As he said, “if we do get a Bitcoin strategic reserve where the government is buying Bitcoin… you’re going to be looking at three, four, $500,000 Bitcoin.” Although he still thinks the odds are less than 50%, but it could gain traction especially with the support from key leaders. He added, If the U.S. government starts holding Bitcoin as a reserve, its price could go up by reaching $300,000 to $500,000. While this is just an idea. Some U.S. states like Ohio, Texas, and Pennsylvania are thinking about holding Bitcoin as part of their reserves, hoping it could protect against inflation. But its price swings and lack of clear rules are big concerns.

PlayStation’s lead architect, Mark Cerny, who first introduced the PS5 Pro in September, announced on Wednesday that the two companies were creating a deeper collaboration to work on “machine learning-based technology for graphics and gameplay.” Sony wants to improve game graphics According to an article by The Verge , the two companies already have an existing partnership on the PS5 Pro and PS5 Pro’s GPUs based on AMD’s RDNA 2 architecture. The article further explains that PS5Pro uses a feature called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) to improve image clarity and frame rates. The new GPU is a combination of what was already offered on the PS5 with, according to Engadget , some cherry-picked features from the more advanced RDNA3 architecture that AMD introduced in 2022. That’s paired with ray tracing techniques that Cerny says in a video are from future RDNA tech on AMD’s roadmap and custom machine learning features created for the PS5 pro. The machine learning components are also reportedly a crucial part of AMD and Sony’s future work together. In the 37-minute presentation , Cerny explained the technical aspects of the PS5 Pro and other additional information about the “multi-year” project with AMD which is codenamed “Amethyst.” “And I’m honored to announce that we have begun a deeper collaboration with a focus on machine learning-based technology for graphics and gameplay,” said Cerny. Although he did not give the finer details about when and where the Project Amethyst tech will be used, it appears like something the market could see on the next PlayStation and other future hardware of which AMD is a part of. “These components should be key in increasing the richness of game graphics.” Cerny. According to Cerny, the two firms have two goals with Project Amethyst. “The first goal is a more ideal architecture for machine learning,” explained Cerny, adding the second goal is to develop “a set of high-quality CNNs for graphics.” “Both SIE and AMD will independently have the ability to draw from this collection of network architectures and training strategies, and these components should be key in increasing the richness of game graphics as well as enabling more extensive use of ray tracing and path tracing,” added Cerny. The technology should extend beyond PlayStation The collaboration between them is a culmination of the companies’ desire to push gaming tech even further. Additionally, the collaboration is expected to improve on what PlayStation has already accomplished with SP5 Pro, with their results starting to show with future console iterations like the inevitable PS6. Cerny explained that both Sony and AMD do not want the technology to be exclusive to PlayStation but to be used “broadly across PC and console cloud.” “Through this technology collaboration we’re looking to support broad work and machine learning across a variety of devices,” said Cerny. In the video, Cerny further discussed three specific areas and their future potential growth – rasterized rendering, ray tracing, and machine learning. According to Cerny, out of the three areas, rasterized rendering has the lowest potential for growth with improvements coming from using larger GPU or faster memory. Ray tracing has growth potential as the technology is still new and the tech is expected to see “quantum leaps” in the next decade, while machine learning has the greatest growth potential, which explains which it is the current focus for AMD and Sony. In his presentation, Cerny also highlighted chances were high the market might not see hardware that uses technology from Project Amethyst until PlayStation 6, since creating a console is “roughly a four-year journey.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",AI|PlayStation 5|Sony,EN,0,0,MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-19 00:06:04

In fact, with fresh presales, community-driven projects, and new use cases, the meme coin scene is evolving into something much bigger than a passing trend. If you’re looking for the best meme coins to invest in December 2024, then you’re in luck. This December, three meme coins stand out from the crowd: BTFD Coin (with a raging presale that gathered $4.1 million so far), Turbo, and COQ Inu. Each of these projects is packing a serious punch in terms of potential, utility, and community support. Let’s dive into why analysts are so optimistic about these coins and why they could make great investments before the year wraps up. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin That’s Making Waves As we approach the end of 2024, BTFD Coin continues to generate massive buzz in the meme coin market. The best meme coin to invest in December 2024 just might be this one, thanks to its explosive presale, highly engaged community, and features that make it a standout in the meme space. Currently in Stage 12 of its presale, BTFD Coin is priced at $0.00013, having raised over $4.1 million. The presale has been a total success, with over 56 billion tokens sold and 5,900+ Bulls holding tokens already. For investors looking to capitalise on this presale opportunity, here’s an investment scenario to consider: If you were to invest $7,000 at the current presale price of $0.00013, you’d be able to snag an impressive 53.8 million BTFD tokens. Now, if the price increases to $0.0006 post-presale (which many analysts are predicting), that $7,000 investment could skyrocket to $32,300. That’s over 460% growth—and it’s all thanks to the strong foundation and massive community backing BTFD Coin. BTFD Coin’s ecosystem also includes staking rewards, offering one of the highest APYs in the meme coin space (think 90%+). This creates an additional layer of opportunity for investors to grow their holdings even more. Add in the fact that BTFD Coin has a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that ties in directly with its ecosystem, and you’ve got a meme coin with long-term potential far beyond just its presale. Turbo: A Meme Coin Changing the Game with TurboChain Turbo was born from an AI-generated meme coin idea, and it has evolved into something far more significant thanks to the launch of TurboChain. This Layer-1 blockchain is set to support decentralised finance (DeFi) applications, blockchain-based games, and much more, giving Turbo a huge edge in terms of real-world use. The collaboration between Aurora Labs and NEAR Protocol has paved the way for TurboChain to support fast transactions and scale well beyond what most other blockchains are capable of. This will be a game-changer for developers looking to create decentralised apps (dApps) on TurboChain, which has been designed with customisability in mind. Developers can now innovate quicker and more efficiently than ever before. Turbo’s market cap sits at $690 million, and it’s listed on major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, and KuCoin. What’s more, all gas fees on TurboChain will be paid in Turbo tokens, which further increases the utility and demand for this coin. The combination of high demand for transactions, increasing blockchain usage, and an expanding ecosystem means that Turbo is one of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. Additionally, analysts are predicting big things for Turbo in 2025, with the price forecasted to rise from its current value of $0.06049 to around $0.10 by mid-2025. COQ Inu: The Meme Coin with Community Power and Strong Personality COQ Inu has developed a strong presence on the AVAX blockchain, making it one of the most popular meme coins on the network. With a $138 million market cap and a circulating supply of 69.42 trillion tokens, COQ Inu may have taken a slight dip recently (down 11.16% in the last 24 hours), but this is precisely why some investors are jumping in to buy the dip. COQ Inu was founded by respected members of the community who initially placed the entire coin supply with 150 AVAX in liquidity. The team has fully renounced the contract and burned liquidity, ensuring a strong foundation for long-term growth. What makes COQ Inu particularly interesting is its community-oriented nature and meme culture. The token’s personality revolves around fun, light-hearted branding that has struck a chord with meme coin enthusiasts, helping to establish it as a cult favourite. While COQ Inu doesn’t have the same kind of groundbreaking utility as Turbo or BTFD Coin, its growing presence on top exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, and Gate.io has cemented it as a meme coin worth watching. Additionally, with a price currently sitting at $0.000002, there’s room for big gains should the price rebound and continue upwards in the coming months. Conclusion: The Best Meme Coins to Invest in December 2024 BTFD Coin’s massive presale success, Turbo’s powerful blockchain tech, and COQ Inu’s tight-knit community all combine to make them the meme coins you’ll want to add to your portfolio this month. Whether you’re diving into BTFD Coin’s presale or taking advantage of Turbo’s Layer-1 blockchain development, these meme coins are primed for major growth. Don’t wait too long—these coins are already turning heads, and there’s plenty of room for price action as we head into 2025. Time to get in before the next big wave!

The Fed cut interest rates by 25bps but pushed back against expectations for a continuation of rapid interest rate cuts in 2025. What just happened? The Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points which is exactly what 97% of market participants wanted. But, the S&P 500 just posted its largest post-Fed drop since March 2020, erasing $1.8 TRILLION of market cap. Why? Let us explain. (a thread) — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 18, 2024 Despite the sharp intra-day decline, the Dogecoin price is holding above support in the form of the 50DMA and its recent range lows around $0.35 for now. After such a strong rally in recent weeks since Donald Trump’s election victory in early November, some are concerned that a deeper retracement could be on the cards in the short term. $0.33-35 has been a key level for Dogecoin going all the way back to mid-2021. Should this level go, the Dogecoin price would be at risk of a sharp dump back towards its early 2024 highs in the $0.23 area. While Dogecoin investors might need to brace for a short-term market dip, there remains plenty of reason to be optimistic on the cryptocurrency’s chances for 2025. Here’s why. Bullish Dogecoin Price Outlook for 2025 – When Will DOGE Hit $1? Dogecoin has two main factors that are playing in its favor. Firstly, the arrival of the Trump administration and a new US Congress is expected to usher in a new golden age for the crypto industry in the US. Meanwhile, chatter about the establishment of a US strategic reserve in the US and in other major nations continues to grow. These combined factors suggest there is massive potential for price growth ahead for major cryptocurrencies – as the number one meme coin, Dogecoin is in a prime position to benefit. Secondly, Dogecoin is inexorably tied into the new Trump administration, with Elon Musk’s new Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) named after it. Department of Government Efficiency pic.twitter.com/HFeHYNIkJN — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 7, 2024 Musk has been a long-term supporter and proponent of Dogecoin. The world’s largest meme coin is all but guaranteed to retain a leading portion of mind share in the meme coin market as Musk’s D.O.G.E. makes headlines, for better or for worse. So, assuming everything goes to plan – Bitcoin reserves are established and the crypto industry booms – in the coming years, it’s probably just a question of when, not if, Dogecoin hits $1. Analyzing Dogecoin’s relationship to Bitcoin during the last three market cycles can help us answer this question. During the past three market cycles, when Bitcoin (BTC) entered a new phase of price discovery (as it did in April 2017, December 2020 and just recently in November 2024), Dogecoin has always still been languishing well below its record highs. This time is no different. But during the past two market cycles, it only took the Dogecoin price between 1-3 months to catch up and break out to its own record highs. So, assuming history does repeat itself, a DOGE breakout could be coming as soon as early 2025, with $1 likely to be quickly hit. Does This Vote-to-Earn Meme Coin Have Even Bigger Upside Potential? Dogecoin could easily more than 2x in 2025 to hit $1. But there are many smaller, lesser-known meme coins that could post far larger gains. The team at crypto news.com keeps a close eye on the meme coin market as they hunt for high-potential projects. And one new meme coin they like a lot is an exciting new DAO-powered vote-to-earn meme coin called Flockerz (FLOCK) . One of the reasons analysts at crypto news.com are so excited about this token is the impressive pace at which is has been raising funds from earlier investors. Despite only launching a few weeks ago, Flockerz (FLOCK) has already attracted over $7 million from eager buyers. The Flock is growing day by day! 7M raised and this flocks here to stay! pic.twitter.com/a8gFhYt4P8 — Flockerz (@FlockerzToken) December 17, 2024 Couple that with its impressive social media metrics, and this token is looking like a meme coin that could really pop. With new meme coins like Fart Coin recently hitting a $1 billion market cap, the appetite for novel new meme coins appears elevated. FLOCK could easily become one of the best meme coins to launch in 2024. ClayBro outlines in the video below why he thinks the token has 25x potential.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-19 00:52:00

Despite recent downward pressures, several factors suggest a potential upward trajectory for the popular memecoin. #1 Dogecoin Bounces Off Key Support Level (1D Chart) Crypto analyst CRG (@MacroCRG) highlighted the resilience of Dogecoin and PEPE, another prominent memecoin, stating, “DOGE + PEPE both bouncing from important areas. The memecoin demise is greatly exaggerated IMO. Next leg up gonna take many by surprise.” CRG’s technical analysis reveals that DOGE has maintained a daily close above the critical support level of $0.385 for nine consecutive days, despite substantial selling pressure. Similarly, PEPE has sustained crucial support, indicating that the “memecoin season” might be making a comeback imminently. Related Reading: Ex-Hedge Fund Guru Bets Big On Dogecoin As ‘Core Crypto Bet’ For Dogecoin, the short-term resistance zone at $0.42 remains a pivotal level. CRG suggests that a break above this threshold could signal the onset of a new bull run, potentially catching many investors off guard. #2 Bullish Market Structure (4-Hour Chart) Further technical insight comes from crypto analyst Gonzo (@GonzoXBT), who provided a technical breakdown of Dogecoin’s price action. Gonzo explained, “DOGE 4H EMA100 -> acting as resistance 4H EMA200 -> acting as support. Until we flip 4H EMA100 we will just chop in between, don’t want to see it lose 4H EMA200 tho.” This analysis underscores the importance of the 4-hour exponential moving averages (EMAs) in determining short-term price movements. The 4H EMA100 currently serves as a resistance level, while the 4H EMA200 offers support. A sustained breach above the 4H EMA100 could facilitate an upward breakout, whereas a failure to maintain above the 4H EMA200 might lead to further consolidation or decline. #3 Trading Against The Crowd Crypto analyst Ali Martinez (@ali_charts) presented another bullish perspective on DOGE’s immediate outlook. He noted, “Market sentiment for Dogecoin has turned negative. It seems as if traders are getting impatient during the ongoing price consolidation!” Related Reading: Bull Flag Formation Puts Dogecoin Price As High As $2.15 This Cycle Martinez’s analysis, based on Santiment data, indicates a sharp decline in both search volume and Weighted Sentiment. Specifically, Weighted Sentiment has plummeted to its lowest point since mid-October, while search volume has dropped to levels not seen since early November. Martinez speculated on potential catalysts that could quickly reignite positive momentum for Dogecoin, referencing the establishment of the new US Department of Government Efficiency under the leadership of Elon Musk. He suggested, “Or you can wait the first POPULAR action of the Department of Government Efficiency.” #4 Liquidation Dynamics Indicate Potential Upside Adding another layer to the bullish thesis, crypto analyst Carlos Garcia Tapia (@CAGThe3rd) shared insights into the liquidation heatmap over the past three days, commenting, “FOMO longs just got liquidated on the 3D chart. DOGE.” The heatmap by Coinglass illustrates a significant liquidation of leveraged long positions clustered between $0.393 and $0.385 over the past two days. But there’s a bullish caveat: with the majority of longs now liquidated, the remaining liquidation cluster is positioned around the $0.42 mark. This setup suggests that Dogecoin could experience a bullish candle formation, potentially triggering further liquidations of bearish positions and propelling the price upward. Why? Because liquidation heatmaps are valuable tools in forecasting price movements as they reflect the underlying market liquidity and leverage dynamics. These heatmaps highlight where traders are most susceptible to forced liquidations, acting as psychological and technical barriers.

Pseudonymous analyst Inmortal tells his 221,100 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum’s two-hour chart looks similar to Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price action over the last two weeks. The analyst says that while Ethereum struggles to clear resistance at $4,000, he notes that BTC also had trouble breaching $100,000 for weeks before surging to new all-time highs. “Same price action, but with one difference. God candle after the breakout. ETH.” Source: Inmortal/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that ETH will surge close to its all-time high of $4,800 after the breakout. At time of writing, ETH is worth $3,892. The trader also has his radar locked on the memecoin Floki ( FLOKI ). According to the trader, FLOKI appears to be trading in a symmetrical triangle pattern and is gearing up to shatter the structure’s diagonal resistance en route to new record highs. “Second leg up – loading. New ATH – loading. Price discovery – loading. FLOKI.” Source: Inmortal/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that FLOKI will explode to a new all-time high of $0.00038. At time of writing, FLOKI is worth $0.000219. Looking at Solana ( SOL ), the trader sees the Ethereum rival bursting above its diagonal resistance to rally toward $300. “Something like this. SOL.” Source: Inmortal/X At time of writing, SOL is worth $222.60.

Among them, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has gained attention from analysts forecasting significant price gains in the current market cycle. Shiba Inu Expected to Break Previous Record A notable market analyst, Crypto Sheriff, has predicted that Shiba Inu could surpass its all-time high of $0.00008616, achieved during the 2020/2021 market cycle. In a post shared on December 15, the analyst stated that the outcome is inevitable, emphasizing the coin’s potential in the ongoing bullish trend. It is inevitable that #SHIB will break down ATH in this supercycle! pic.twitter.com/owuMMgpwoh — CRYPTO SHERIFF (@Gem_Sheriff) December 15, 2024 This prediction follows the asset’s impressive performance in November 2024, where the token rallied approximately 98% after the U.S. presidential election. Many believe Donald Trump’s victory signaled a crypto-friendly shift in U.S. policy, contributing to the token’s rise from $0.00001687 to $0.00003343. Meanwhile, the asset has retraced some gains and is trading at $0.00002682. Analysts Highlight Shiba Inu (SHIB) Bullish Patterns While Crypto Sheriff maintains a positive outlook, other analysts have provided additional technical insights supporting the possibility of a significant price increase. On December 10, CryptoELITES identified a bullish cup-and-handle formation on Shiba Inu’s weekly chart. The analyst noted that if the token breaks above a long-standing downtrend line, it could potentially reach $0.0004729, marking a 1,700% increase from its current value. The downtrend, which has acted as a resistance level since October 2021, is considered a critical barrier. According to CryptoELITES, breaking through this resistance would confirm the bullish pattern and set the stage for a sustained upward trend. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Risk of Downside Movement Despite the optimism, some analysts have highlighted potential risks. As earlier reported by Times Tabloid, market commentator PouyanTradeFX warned that if Shiba Inu fails to overcome the downtrend, the token could significantly decline. In this scenario, prices might drop by as much as 150%, bringing SHIB to the $0.000011 range. Such contrasting analyses underscore the importance of closely monitoring technical indicators and market conditions. While many remain bullish, the outcome will largely depend on how the asset performs in the face of these key resistance levels. The asset’s recent performance and technical setups have fueled speculation about its potential to reach new highs. Analysts like Crypto Sheriff and CryptoELITES are optimistic about the token’s future, while others urge caution, emphasizing the importance of breaking resistance levels to confirm a bullish trend.

Despite meeting market expectations, the announcement sparked a significant selloff in equities and cryptocurrency markets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. The market’s negative reaction highlights concerns about the broader implications of the rate cut. Market Reaction to the Rate Cut Zero Hedge, a prominent financial news and analysis platform, posted the announcement on X stating “FED CUTS 25BPS AS EXPECTED.” FED CUTS 25BPS AS EXPECTED — zerohedge (@zerohedge) December 18, 2024 In response, user JP Friend 1 queried , “Why is market dumping on that news?” This question underscores confusion among retail and institutional investors, as rate cuts are traditionally viewed as supportive of financial markets. Another user, Bleeerg, offered an explanation stating “There is a theory that cutting rates after a period of raises means that there are issues with the economy and it marks the start of a recession.” Aron Meystedt, contributing to the discussion, provided historical context: “Yep. If you look at past charts over time for the major indices and overlay them with the fed funds rate, the stock drop (recession) happens AFTER the rates are dropped. It’s counterintuitive, but that’s the way it usually goes.” Historical Context and Recession Concerns The theory discussed by users aligns with historical patterns. During previous economic cycles, rate cuts following a prolonged tightening phase have often signaled underlying economic vulnerabilities. Policymakers typically lower rates to stimulate growth, but the decision can indicate that the economy has entered a period of contraction or is at risk of doing so. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This dynamic creates a paradox: while rate cuts reduce borrowing costs and aim to encourage investment, they can also signal that monetary authorities are bracing for economic downturns. Investors often react by selling risk assets, anticipating weaker earnings, reduced consumer spending, and tighter credit conditions. Cryptocurrency Market Impact The selloff was not limited to equities. Major cryptocurrencies also experienced sharp declines, with XRP down 9.8% in the past 24 hours, trading at $2.32. Meanwhile, Bitcoin , the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has fallen over 5% during the same period and currently trades at $100,700. Cryptocurrencies, often high-risk assets, tend to mirror the broader risk-off sentiment in financial markets. As fears of a potential recession grow, investors appear to be moving away from volatile assets and toward safer options such as bonds and cash. As the situation unfolds, investors will closely monitor upcoming economic data and Federal Reserve communications to assess the trajectory of monetary policy and its impact on global markets. For now, the reaction underscores the complex interplay between rate adjustments, market sentiment, and economic expectations.

In contrast to Web2’s centralized structure dominated by firms like Google and Facebook, Web3 grants users direct management of their digital interactions. Among the notable projects leveraging this shift are The Graph, Theta Network, and Web3Bay , each targeting distinct functionalities. The Graph is dedicated to decentralized data indexing for dApps, while Theta Network advances video streaming via decentralized bandwidth sharing. Nonetheless, these projects are somewhat niche in their focus. Web3Bay takes a broader approach by providing a decentralized e-commerce platform that amalgamates Web3 advantages including dual payment systems, community governance, and cross-chain functionality, establishing itself as a more comprehensive solution for blockchain-based commerce. Web3Bay: Spearheading Decentralized E-commerce in the Web3 Era Web3Bay distinguishes itself by pioneering a decentralized marketplace that transfers complete control of data and financial transactions back to the users. This approach starkly contrasts with that of traditional e-commerce behemoths like Amazon, which rely on intermediaries. By eliminating these middlemen, Web3Bay not only cuts down on costs but also enhances the privacy of its users. This empowers users with real ownership of their digital assets—a feature not seen in narrowly focused projects like The Graph and Theta. A standout feature of Web3Bay is its dual payment system, which accepts both cryptocurrencies and traditional payment methods such as PayPal. This flexibility makes it a bridge between the older Web2 and the new Web3, opening up the platform to both crypto enthusiasts and traditional users alike. This inclusive approach is absent in The Graph and Theta, making Web3Bay a uniquely accessible option in the marketplace. Another critical aspect of Web3Bay is its commitment to Community-Driven Governance via its DAO. This governance model allows 3BAY token holders to directly influence the platform’s direction by proposing and voting on initiatives, aligning the platform’s evolution with the desires of its community. Unlike The Graph and Theta, which do not facilitate such a level of user control, Web3Bay’s model promotes a genuinely decentralized approach, giving it a distinct advantage in the competitive landscape. The Graph: Specializing in Decentralized Data Indexing The Graph is tailored for managing blockchain data specifically for decentralized applications. By allowing developers to effectively query across multiple blockchain platforms, it becomes a fundamental tool for DeFi and NFT projects, where swift access to on-chain data is crucial. However, The Graph’s functionality is primarily confined to data indexing, serving a pivotal yet narrow role. In contrast, Web3Bay extends its reach into the broader aspects of the Web3 landscape, covering decentralized commerce and governance. This not only enriches the platform’s utility but also makes it a more holistic solution for users. While The Graph does a stellar job at enhancing data accessibility, it stops short of engaging in the broader, dynamic realms of commerce and governance where Web3Bay excels and truly makes a difference. Theta Network: Innovating Decentralized Video Streaming Theta Network is crafted to transform video streaming by leveraging a decentralized network that cuts down on bandwidth costs and boosts the quality of content delivery. Users can share their bandwidth and receive rewards in return, creating a sustainable and community-supported content distribution network. This model is especially advantageous for content creators as it lowers operational costs and improves the quality of streams. Yet, Theta’s dedication to just content streaming might limit its utility in other areas. On the flip side, Web3Bay extends its functionality by integrating decentralized storage solutions, automated payments through smart contracts, and a scalable infrastructure that supports a broad spectrum of e-commerce activities. This flexibility makes Web3Bay a more comprehensive platform. Additionally, Web3Bay ‘s forward-looking initiatives to explore NFTs and DeFi sectors significantly widen its scope, providing opportunities for users to create, purchase, and trade a variety of digital assets, moving beyond mere content. Why Web3Bay Surpasses The Graph & Theta Web3Bay’s emphasis on decentralization and scalability positions it above The Graph and Theta. By integrating dual payment options and fostering community governance, Web3Bay promotes a user-centric approach in line with Web3’s foundational values. Utilizing smart contracts and decentralized storage through IPFS, Web3Bay enhances security and operational efficiency, presenting an all-encompassing solution for digital commerce. Its scalable architecture, featuring Layer-1 with Layer-2 rollups, ensures low fees and rapid transactions, offering a user experience that outshines The Graph’s data indexing and Theta’s streaming capabilities. With plans to expand into NFTs and DeFi, Web3Bay demonstrates its commitment to leading a comprehensive Web3 ecosystem, transcending the limited functionalities of its competitors. Key Insights Web3Bay’s integration of e-commerce, community governance, and scalable infrastructure cements its status as a frontrunner among Web3 projects. While The Graph specializes in data indexing and Theta excels in streaming, Web3Bay’s extensive capabilities in commerce, payments, and governance render it a more influential and adaptable platform. With its user-centric, decentralized marketplace and diverse payment options, alongside future expansions into NFTs and DeFi, Web3Bay is not just keeping up with the Web3 evolution but actively driving the next wave of blockchain integration.

XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, recently surpassed Tether (USDT). Analysts and investors alike are growing excited about the possibility for XRP holders to become among the wealthiest investors in the foreseeable future, as indicated by the recent spike. Related Reading: Solana Poised For Growth In 2025 With Record $173 Million Q3 Funding—Report Potential Price Forecasts An analyst has expressed an audacious outlook for XRP, indicating that those who retain the asset may experience substantial returns, which could result in life-changing wealth in the near future. He anticipates a significant increase in the price of the altcoin, with the goal of reaching a price point between $30 and $35 by 2025. #XRP HOLDERS WILL BE THE RICHEST PEOPLE YOU KNOW – HERE’S WHY! pic.twitter.com/k0tc6tCAq0 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 17, 2024 Based on this estimate, the present price of approximately $2.54 is expected to experience a staggering increase of around 1,277%. A $1,000 investment, for example, may potentially increase to $14,000 if these objectives are accomplished. It is also possible that those who have made larger investments will have the opportunity to become millionaires as the value of XRP continues to climb. This optimism is perpetuated by recent fluctuations in prices. In the last 30 days, XRP registered a solid 124% increase, which coincided with a successful retest of its 2021 peak of $1.97. According to analysts, the demand for the crypto will continue to rise as Ripple expands its partnerships throughout Asia and beyond, further driving up its price. Causes Of Wealth Formation The positive outlook for XRP is due to a number of reasons. Investors have a lot more faith in Ripple now that its legal fight with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been settled. Legal certainty is about to arrive, hence many people believe that using XRP in worldwide banking will hasten the adoption. Since big financial institutions see Ripple’s technology’s ability to transform cross-border payments, institutional interest in it is also piquing. Some wealth managers suggests that XRP has the potential to revolutionize international payments in a manner similar to that of early Amazon. They anticipate a future in which XRP processes trillions of transactions daily, which could result in a price increase of an astonishing $132—a preposterous 23,900% from its current level.

Although forecasts are hopeful, they are not guaranteed since the market for cryptocurrencies is somewhat erratic. Analysts emphasize the need of realizing gains as prices rise instead of waiting for a climax that might never come to pass. Their advice for investors: make wise judgments and closely check price swings.

This has prompted ADA holders to join PropiChain’s (PCHAIN) token presale to capitalize on its potential for huge profits in 2025. PropiChain is gaining attention, raising over $1 million in the ongoing presale. The RWA altcoin is tipped to transform the $300 trillion real estate industry through AI, blockchain, and the metaverse. It has drawn from investors and DOGE whales who think the Dogecoin price action hints at fading momentum. Could PropiChain deliver up to 32,390% returns by mid-January, surpassing even DOGE’’s impressive growth? Dogecoin Price: DOGE Loses Momentum The Dogecoin price jumped from $0.1467 in early November and reached a local high of $0.4758 before surrendering gains. At $0.3964, the Dogecoin price has surged 170% in less than 2 months. After the slide, investors think DOGE is losing momentum. This also comes as old coins that surged in the same period are tanking. These include XRP and Cardano. Analysts believe the Dogecoin price will see further downside before having any chance of rising again. This has pushed ADA holders to seek better opportunities in promising presale tokens. The Dogecoin price is 46% below its May 2021 all-time high. Growing Presale Demand Highlights PCHAIN’s Innovation Dogecoin is known for its explosive rally and volatility, yet an analyst says PropiChain is well-positioned to outperform the meme coin and other blue-chip assets. The RWA altcoin has seen an increase in its demand, with the token presale raising over $1 million in the first round. There are two more rounds to go before the public launch but savvy investors are rushing to buy now before it is sold out. Analysts have lauded PropiChain’s several features as the reason behind its presale success. The project is tokenizing real estate, enabling fractional ownership. PCHAIN’s users will have access to the global real estate market by buying pieces of property. Additionally, PropiChain’s users will have their real estate management workload significantly reduced thanks to its smart contract automation feature. The feature will handle transactions such as auto leasing and lease renewals. Automated transactions have no room for error and there is no human intervention needed. The project’s innovation continues with automated valuation models (AVMs). This is an AI-driven algorithm that evaluates the true price of properties. This feature enables buyers and sellers to get fair pricing for their real properties. PCHAIN’s set of exciting set of tools gets another exciting addition in the form of the metaverse. This feature is reserved for investors in distant locations but willing to invest in properties. The metaverse allows users to view properties remotely. By offering a 3D, immersive experience, PropiChain enables investors to make informed purchasing decisions without being present. The exciting PropiChain platform has increased demand for the PCHAIN token, with analysts projecting a 32,390% growth by 2025. Dogecoin Price Action vs PCHAIN’s Momentum The Dogecoin price momentum is waning and holders are starting to book profits and rotate into promising altcoins. PCHAIN’s focus on real estate tokenization makes it stand out altcoin with high upside potential. Analysts are predicting more than 32,000% gains after listing for the RWA altcoin. PCHAIN: Presale Enters Round 2 After Raising Over $1 Million PropiChain continues with its impressive presale that has entered the second round. After raising over $ 1 million with whales signing up every day, now is the best time to secure PCHAIN before it is listed on secondary exchanges. Investors are pleased with the project as it has exceeded expectations. A CoinMarketCap listing and independent smart contract audit by BlockAudit have enhanced its credibility in the market. The RWA altcoin has become the best opportunity to invest in now as the Dogecoin price loses momentum. Don’t miss this opportunity. Join PropiChain’s presale and watch a $1,000 investment turn into $300K as the platform brings practical innovation to the real estate sector.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-19 02:14:04

With a near 4% price increase, Ripple is once again proving its ability to innovate in the cross-border payments space. Meanwhile, Binance Coin (BNB) remains a pillar of the crypto market, raising discussions about its long-term security and investment potential, especially as the Binance ecosystem continues to dominate. But the real dark horse in this conversation is Qubetics ($TICS) . While established giants like XRP and BNB focus on pushing boundaries in their respective domains, Qubetics is tackling crypto’s usability challenge head-on. By creating a non-custodial wallet that simplifies transactions and integrates seamlessly with Apple Pay and Google Pay, Qubetics is making crypto accessible to everyone. Let’s explore why these three projects are among the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024 and how they’re leading the charge for blockchain innovation. Qubetics: Making Crypto Usable for Everyone Let’s be honest—crypto can be daunting for newcomers. Complex wallets, unpredictable market swings, and high fees often keep people at bay. Qubetics is here to change all that with a wallet that makes using crypto as easy as tapping your phone . Imagine you’re a small business owner, and a customer pays you in Ethereum. Usually, you’d need to convert that crypto into fiat, track exchange rates, and hope the market doesn’t crash. With Qubetics, payments are automatically converted at the point of sale . Whether you’re a freelancer working internationally or a café owner in New York, Qubetics makes transactions seamless and stress-free. What sets Qubetics apart is its smart contract conversion mechanism, which shields users from crypto market volatility. Plus, it works across iOS, Android, and desktop, integrating with Apple Pay and Google Pay for ultimate convenience. It’s like bringing crypto into the real world without the headaches. Currently in Presale Phase 13, Qubetics has already sold over 355 million tokens and raised $7 million. At $0.0342 per token, $TICS is a steal. But act fast—the next phase brings a 10% price hike, with the final phase promising a 20% increase. After presale, the price is set to hit $0.25, delivering a jaw-dropping 900% ROI. If you’re looking for the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024, Qubetics is a must-watch. Ripple: The Cross-Border Payment Innovator Ripple (XRP) has long been a trailblazer in the crypto space, and its recent launch of the RLUSD stablecoin proves it’s not slowing down. Designed to enhance cross-border payment efficiency, RLUSD is Ripple’s latest move to solidify its role as a leader in global finance. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) network continues to expand, with partnerships across the banking and payments industries. This network allows XRP to act as a bridge currency, enabling near-instantaneous transactions at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. For global businesses, this is a game changer. Regulatory clarity in key markets like the U.S. is also boosting investor confidence. Ripple’s recent legal victories have positioned XRP as one of the most resilient cryptos, even amid market volatility. For retail investors, XRP offers both utility and long-term growth potential. If you’re searching for the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024, Ripple’s innovation in cross-border payments makes it a strong contender. Whether you’re an enterprise or a casual investor, XRP continues to prove its relevance in an evolving crypto landscape. Binance Coin: The Backbone of the Binance Ecosystem Binance Coin (BNB) is more than just a cryptocurrency—it’s the fuel powering the Binance ecosystem. As the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance relies on BNB for everything from transaction fee discounts to staking opportunities, making it a cornerstone of the crypto market. Security has been a hot topic for BNB, with analysts debating its long-term viability. But one thing’s clear: Binance’s focus on compliance and security upgrades has strengthened investor trust. BNB’s deflationary model, driven by quarterly token burns, ensures a steady decrease in supply, boosting its value over time. The Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is another reason why BNB is a must-watch. With its low fees and fast transactions, BSC has become a hub for DeFi projects, NFTs, and dApps. This growing ecosystem ensures that BNB remains relevant, even as new competitors enter the market. For investors eyeing the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024, Binance Coin offers a mix of utility, security, and growth potential. Whether you’re using it on Binance or staking it for rewards, BNB is a reliable pick for any portfolio. Wrapping It Up The blockchain world is evolving, and Qubetics, Ripple, and Binance Coin are leading the way. Qubetics is making crypto accessible with its innovative wallet, Ripple is revolutionizing cross-border payments with RLUSD, and Binance Coin remains a pillar of the market with its expansive ecosystem. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics, Ripple, and Binance Coin as the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024 . These projects aren’t just shaping the future of blockchain—they’re setting the standard for what’s possible. Don’t miss your chance to invest in these groundbreaking opportunities.

With the year wrapping up, investors are scouring for projects that could bring both short-term value and long-term gains. Recently, Qubetics, Solana, and Binance Coin have captured attention due to their impressive developments and growing communities. Qubetics ($TICS) continues to make headlines, having secured over 10,600 token holders holding more than 355 million tokens in its presale. Meanwhile, Solana is riding a wave of institutional adoption, and Binance Coin is fostering groundbreaking innovations on the Binance ecosystem. Let’s take a closer look at why these three stand out as the best coins to join in December 2024. Qubetics Sets the Stage with Over 10,600 Token Holders Qubetics ($TICS) is breaking barriers as the world’s first web3 aggregator , solving major interoperability issues in the blockchain space. At the heart of its ecosystem is its decentralised VPN (dVPN), a revolutionary solution designed to provide enhanced privacy, security, and unrestricted internet access. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on centralised servers, Qubetics’ dVPN operates on a peer-to-peer network, ensuring user data remains private and resistant to surveillance. For example, journalists working in regions with heavy censorship can use Qubetics’ dVPN to access information securely without the fear of government intrusion. Businesses that handle sensitive data across borders can also benefit, as the dVPN reduces the risks associated with centralised systems and potential data breaches. Currently, Qubetics is in its 13th presale phase, where tokens are priced at $0.0342 each. Each presale stage concludes every Sunday at midnight, bringing a 10% price increase. So far, the presale has attracted over 10,600 holders , with more than 355 million $TICS tokens sold, raising over $7 million. Analysts are bullish on its future, predicting that $TICS could reach $15 after its mainnet launch. For example, an investment of $400,000 today could deliver life-changing returns if these predictions hold true. You can learn more about this project by watching the video here . Solana Gains Momentum with New Staking Opportunities Solana continues to reinforce its reputation as one of the fastest and most scalable blockchain networks. Recent developments highlight growing institutional interest and innovative solutions within its ecosystem. A major boost came with Bitwise launching a Solana staking ETP (exchange-traded product) in Europe, offering an impressive 6.48% yield to institutional investors. This move not only improves accessibility to Solana but also reinforces its position in the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector. Adding to the momentum, the recent launch of the Solaxy ICO, a Layer 2 project built on Solana, raised over $750,000 in its first 72 hours. This demonstrates the strong investor demand for projects leveraging Solana’s high-speed, low-cost network. These developments position Solana as a serious contender for both short-term and long-term gains, making it one of the best coins to join in December 2024. Binance Coin Powers Innovation Across the Blockchain Space Binance Coin (BNB) remains a key player in driving blockchain adoption through its robust ecosystem. As the native token of the Binance exchange, BNB supports numerous applications, including transaction fee reductions, staking, and the Binance Launchpad. Recently, Binance Launchpad facilitated the listing of Simon’s Cat (CAT) on its spot market, resulting in a remarkable 50% price increase within 48 hours. The listing reflects Binance’s ability to propel promising projects into the spotlight and generate strong market interest. In addition, Binance’s continued efforts to diversify offerings through its HODLer Airdrop Program have further engaged its community, distributing tokens of newly listed projects to loyal holders. This proactive approach fosters innovation and cements Binance Coin’s importance in the blockchain ecosystem. With its consistent utility and support for emerging technologies, Binance Coin is undoubtedly one of the best coins to join in December 2024. Conclusion: Qubetics, Solana, and Binance Coin Shine Bright As 2024 comes to a close, Qubetics, Solana, and Binance Coin offer exciting opportunities for crypto investors. Qubetics has already attracted 10,600 token holders and sold 355 million $TICS tokens, with analysts predicting an extraordinary surge to $15 post-mainnet launch. Meanwhile, Solana is gaining institutional traction with new staking opportunities and a successful Layer 2 ICO. Binance Coin remains a cornerstone of blockchain innovation, driving projects that generate real value for investors. For those looking to position themselves for growth, these projects are the best coins to join in December 2024. Now is the time to research, evaluate, and make informed moves in the dynamic world of crypto.

A potential reason for this drop is the recent Federal Reserve rate cut meeting. Reason Behind the Crypto Market Decline During the conference, the Federal Reserve announced an interest rate ceiling of 4.50%, aligning with expectations, compared to the previous rate of 4.75%. Jerome Powell made a bold statement on cryptocurrency that significantly impacted the overall market. In a statement, Powell noted that we are not allowed to own Bitcoin and have no desire to change the laws. This statement by the Fed chief shows that the U.S. central bank has no interest or intention to support a scenario where the government would accumulate a significant amount of Bitcoin. Regarding the legal issues surrounding Bitcoin ownership, Powell stated, “That’s the kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed.” The idea of creating a so-called “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” appears to be failing, as the Federal Reserve has no intention of participating in such an initiative until President-elect Donald Trump takes office. This indicates that central banks are distancing themselves from holding large amounts of Bitcoin, unlike gold reserves. Federal Reserve’s Meeting Impacted Crypto Prices These statements by Powell have caused a significant downturn in the overall cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency, dropped by over 6.5%, falling below $100,000 after reaching the $108,000 mark. Meanwhile, other assets, including Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE), experienced price declines of 5.5%, 14.20%, 9.45%, and 11.5%, respectively. Additionally, this notable price decline in the crypto market occurred following Powell’s statement.",News|Crypto news|Fed,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|FIAT|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-19 02:46:30

37824590,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52524,1734576438,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Analyst Makes Bullish XRP Price Projection For January 1, 2025",https://timestabloid.com/analyst-makes-bullish-xrp-price-projection-for-january-1-2025/,"Renowned cryptocurrency analyst Jason Williams has shared a moderate forecast for XRP, predicting that the token will cross the $3 mark by early next year. Williams, a widely followed market observer, detailed his projection in a recent post on X . He also provided price targets for other leading altcoins. My Altcoin Prediction by January 1st – $ETH $5,325 – $XRP $3.10 – $FTM $4.25 – $HEART $0.20 – $IOTA $0.9 – $DOP $0.01 – $DOT $20 – $SEI $1.50 – $SOL $310 – $Pepe $1.00 What would you add to this list? — Jason A. Williams (@GoingParabolic) December 16, 2024 XRP Price Target Set at $3.10 Williams estimates that the token will reach $3.10 by January 1, 2025, marking a 31% increase from its current price of $2.36. Achieving this level within 13 days would solidify XRP’s market capitalization at approximately $170 billion, up from its current valuation of $135.36 billion. Such growth would maintain the token’s status as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The analyst also outlined price projections for several other altcoins. According to him, Ethereum could trade at $5,325, Solana at $310, Polkadot at $20, and Pepe at $1 by the same date. Although Williams did not specify the factors that might push the token to $3.10, several industry trends and developments could play a role in driving its value higher. Key among these is progress in the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Favorable rulings or settlements could boost investor confidence and increase institutional adoption of XRP. Additionally, the rapid adoption of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin could be another catalyst. Earlier this week, RLUSD’s introduction contributed to a 9% increase in XRP’s price , lifting it to $2.56. This followed a broader 20% price surge after the stablecoin received regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Significant adoption of RLUSD by major organizations or its listing on leading exchanges like Binance could further enhance the market performance in the coming weeks. Despite optimistic predictions, the token has faced challenges in reaching the $3 threshold. The last time the token surpassed this level was the 2017-2018 bull market, peaking at an all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Recent attempts have seen the asset approach this milestone without success. Earlier this month, XRP climbed to $2.86 on December 3 but encountered strong resistance, dropping to $1.90 shortly after. The cryptocurrency has since recovered, trading above $2 again and reaching $2.72 before falling back to its current price of $2.36 amid a market-wide correction. Recent Market Activity The digital asset initially saw a significant increase in trading activity, with its 24-hour trading volume rising by 54.25% to $19.23 billion. This surge in activity contributed to XRP overtaking Tether (USDT) as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization earlier this week. While Jason Williams’ projection of the asset reaching $3.10 by January 2025 may appear conservative compared to other forecasts, the target is achievable if key developments align in Ripple’s favor. Factors such as institutional interest, increased adoption of Ripple’s products, and progress in the SEC lawsuit could all support the token’s growth. However, market resistance at critical price levels remains a challenge, and traders should carefully monitor market conditions before making investment decisions.

Recent developments, like Shiba Inu’s forthcoming liquid staking upgrade and Dogecoin’s bullish technical indicators, highlight the evolving opportunities in this space. At the centre of this buzz is BTFD Coin , a standout newcomer with a booming presale that has captured the attention of meme coin enthusiasts worldwide. As we dive into these three projects, you’ll see why they rank among the best meme coins to invest in this month . From BTFD Coin’s presale milestones to Shiba Inu’s ecosystem expansion and Dogecoin’s market activity, there’s a lot to unpack. BTFD Coin: Where Bulls Run Strong Have you been waiting for the right meme coin to join? BTFD Coin, the latest sensation, might just be the perfect opportunity. With over $4.1 million raised in its presale, this coin has proven it’s not just a fleeting trend but a potential game-changer in the crypto world. Currently in Stage 12 of its presale at $0.00013 per coin, BTFD has caught the attention of over 5,900 investors—or as they like to call themselves, “bulls”. But why the hype? For starters, BTFD isn’t just about fun memes—it’s about financial opportunity. Consider this: a $5,000 investment at the current presale price would yield nearly $23,077 when the coin hits its post-presale listing price of $0.0006. That’s the kind of ROI that investors dream of. BTFD goes beyond the typical meme coin playbook by offering a 90% APY staking reward. Imagine letting your investment grow passively while enjoying community perks and market buzz. Add to that the P2E gaming feature, where the beta version is already live, and you’ve got a coin that’s merging entertainment with tangible rewards. The power of BTFD lies in its strong community of bulls, who aren’t just investors but advocates of the coin. The project’s tagline—“Own the Dip”—resonates with crypto enthusiasts looking for a coin that understands market dynamics and offers long-term growth potential. Shiba Inu: Expanding Ecosystem with Liquid Staking Shiba Inu, one of the most recognised names in the meme coin space, continues to evolve beyond its humble beginnings. Currently trading at $0.00002564, SHIB’s price may be down 5.23% in the past 24 hours, but its trading volume has jumped 13.79%, reflecting active investor interest. The Shiba Inu team is gearing up for a major upgrade with the introduction of liquid staking on ShibaSwap. This feature will allow users to stake their SHIB tokens while maintaining liquidity. In simpler terms, you can earn staking rewards without locking up your tokens. Liquid tokens representing staked assets can be traded or used as collateral on other DeFi platforms, enhancing utility and flexibility for investors. The Shiba Inu ecosystem continues to expand with projects like the Shibarium blockchain and ongoing token burns. These efforts aren’t just about reducing supply but creating a robust ecosystem where SHIB becomes a go-to token for DeFi solutions. The introduction of liquid staking is another step in that direction, offering both active traders and long-term holders more value. Dogecoin: Signs of a Bullish Breakout As the original meme coin, Dogecoin has consistently held its ground in the crypto market. Currently trading at $0.3841, DOGE’s price is down 3.99% over the past 24 hours, but its one-month performance shows a modest 2.46% increase. Beneath this surface-level stability, however, technical indicators suggest a much bigger story. Dogecoin is in what analysts call an “accumulation phase,” where market activity hints at a potential breakout. The 200 EMA, a key technical indicator, signals that DOGE could soon enter a bullish phase. Combined with increased transactions and the movement of previously dormant tokens, these factors suggest that DOGE may be gearing up for a significant upward move. Despite being a meme coin, Dogecoin has proven its resilience and versatility over the years. From its integration into Tesla’s merchandise store to its widespread acceptance as a payment method, DOGE continues to hold a unique position in the market. With bullish signals and growing speculation, it’s no wonder investors are keeping a close eye on Dogecoin as one of the best meme coins to invest in this month. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin market is as vibrant as ever, with new opportunities emerging for savvy investors. BTFD Coin leads the charge with its record-breaking presale and innovative features, making it a must-watch for anyone looking to join the crypto bull run. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu is solidifying its ecosystem with game-changing upgrades like liquid staking, and Dogecoin is showing signs of a bullish breakout that could take it to new heights. If you’re looking to ride the wave of the best meme coins to invest in this month, these three projects offer unique opportunities for growth. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the action— join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your spot in what could be the next big meme coin success story.

Among the projects gaining traction, TON (The Open Network) stands out for its significant institutional adoption, setting a benchmark for others to follow. Now, Lightchain AI ($LCAI) is emerging as a game-changer, combining blockchain and artificial intelligence to drive innovation. As $LCAI continues to make waves, the spotlight is on its Lightchain AI Presale , offering early access to this transformative project. This article dives into the factors behind TON’s institutional success, explores what makes Lightchain AI unique, and assesses whether $LCAI can carve a similar path in the institutional space. Understanding TON’s Institutional Appeal TON has emerged as a blockchain platform designed for scalability, speed, and ease of use. Its appeal to institutions lies in its ability to address the limitations of traditional blockchains, such as slow transaction speeds and high costs. TON’s recent partnerships with leading financial institutions and enterprises highlight its potential to reshape the blockchain landscape. Key Factors Behind TON’s Adoption: Scalability: TON’s architecture supports millions of transactions per second (TPS), making it ideal for large-scale applications. Interoperability: The platform’s ability to integrate with existing systems allows institutions to adopt blockchain technology without overhauling their infrastructure. Developer Ecosystem: TON’s developer-friendly tools and APIs enable quick deployment of decentralized applications (dApps), attracting both startups and established enterprises. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborations with major players in finance and technology have bolstered TON’s credibility and accelerated its adoption. Regulatory Compliance: TON’s focus on transparency and adherence to regulatory standards makes it attractive to risk-averse institutions. Lightchain AI: A Unique Proposition While TON has excelled in creating a blockchain tailored for institutional use, Lightchain AI offers something fundamentally different: the integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) to solve real-world problems. $LCAI aims to transform industries by enabling decentralized, AI-driven solutions that combine the transparency of blockchain with the computational power of AI. Key Features of Lightchain AI: Proof of Intelligence (PoI): Lightchain AI’s revolutionary consensus mechanism rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations, such as model training and optimization. This approach ensures that network security contributes directly to AI advancements. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): The AIVM enables developers to execute AI-specific tasks on the blockchain, such as predictive analytics and real-time decision-making. This unique feature sets $LCAI apart from traditional blockchains. Real-World Applications: From healthcare to supply chain management, Lightchain AI’s technology addresses critical inefficiencies, providing scalable and sustainable solutions.

Comparing TON and Lightchain AI Although TON and Lightchain AI serve different purposes, their trajectories share common themes, including technological innovation, scalability, and a focus on solving real-world challenges. Here’s a closer look at how these two projects stack up: Scalability: TON: Optimized for high-speed transactions, TON’s infrastructure can support large-scale enterprise applications. Lightchain AI: While TON excels in transaction speed, Lightchain AI’s scalability is tailored for AI workloads, making it a frontrunner in decentralized AI. Utility: TON: Primarily focuses on decentralized finance (DeFi), payments, and general-purpose dApps. Lightchain AI: Goes beyond traditional blockchain applications by integrating AI, enabling industries to leverage predictive analytics, machine learning, and more. Institutional Appeal: TON: Attracts institutions through its interoperability and compliance features. Lightchain AI: Targets industries that require advanced AI solutions, such as healthcare, logistics, and finance, positioning itself as a leader in decentralized intelligence. Partnerships: TON: Collaborates with major financial institutions and tech giants to drive adoption. Lightchain AI: Establishes strategic alliances with industry leaders like IBM and Intel, enhancing its credibility and technological prowess. Can Lightchain AI Follow TON’s Path? The potential for Lightchain AI to replicate TON’s success in institutional adoption hinges on several factors: 1.

Institutions seeking to integrate AI into their operations are likely to find $LCAI’s technology compelling. 2. Industry Applications: While TON’s appeal lies in its versatility, Lightchain AI’s focus on solving specific industry problems gives it a unique edge. For example: Healthcare: AI-driven diagnostics and predictive modeling. Supply Chain: Enhanced transparency and predictive analytics. Finance: Smarter risk assessment and fraud detection. 3. Early-Stage Investment Opportunity: At its presale price of $0.003, $LCAI offers a rare entry point for investors. As the project achieves its roadmap milestones, demand for $LCAI tokens is expected to rise, mirroring the growth trajectory seen with TON. 4. Strategic Partnerships: Lightchain AI’s alliances with established players like IBM and Intel position it well to attract institutional interest. These partnerships provide access to cutting-edge technology and expertise, enhancing $LCAI’s appeal. 5. Regulatory Alignment: As institutions prioritize compliance, Lightchain AI’s transparent governance model and focus on sustainability align with their requirements. Challenges and Opportunities While Lightchain AI has significant potential, it must address certain challenges to achieve widespread institutional adoption: Challenges: Market Awareness: Educating institutions about the benefits of blockchain-AI integration will be crucial for adoption. Competition: The emergence of other blockchain projects with similar features necessitates continuous innovation. Regulatory Hurdles: Navigating complex global regulations will require strategic planning and adaptability. Opportunities: Growing Demand for AI: With AI becoming a cornerstone of technological progress, Lightchain AI is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. Institutional Focus on Sustainability: $LCAI’s eco-friendly design addresses growing concerns about blockchain’s environmental impact. Expanding Ecosystem: As Lightchain AI’s ecosystem grows, its utility and value proposition will become increasingly evident to institutions. Final Thoughts: Lightchain AI’s Path Forward While TON has set a high bar for institutional adoption, Lightchain AI’s unique integration of blockchain and AI positions it as a strong contender to follow a similar path. By addressing specific industry needs, fostering strategic partnerships, and leveraging its innovative technologies, $LCAI has the potential to attract institutional interest and establish itself as a leader in decentralized intelligence. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, projects like Lightchain AI that combine technological innovation with real-world applications will be at the forefront of the next wave of adoption. For investors and institutions alike, Lightchain AI represents an exciting opportunity to be part of a transformative journey.

Amid this, Ethereum has recorded a 2.4% decrease in the past 24 hours with a current trading price of $3,858, marking a 21.1% decrease away from its all-time high of $4,878 seen in 2021. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Load Up: Bullish Sign Or Bear Trap? Ethereum Withdrawals from Binance Surpass 7.8 Million ETH Data from CryptoQuant reveals that approximately 20.8 million ETH have been withdrawn from centralized exchanges in the past two months, a trend reminiscent of the 2021 bull market. Binance has played a central role in this movement, accounting for over 7.8 million ETH, which represents 33-39% of the total outflows. These outflows could be indicative of investors accumulating ETH for long-term holding or staking purposes, as suggested by CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk. The analyst added: These significant outflows from Binance indicate the platform’s continued influence on the cryptocurrency market, especially in balancing supply and demand for Ethereum. Notably, Binance’s influence is particularly evident given its global user base of 250 million and a record $21.6 billion in deposits this year, according to Crazzyblockk. The substantial outflows from Binance align with bullish market sentiment, as large-scale withdrawals often signal investor confidence. These movements suggest that Ethereum holders are moving their assets off exchanges. This reduction in the available supply of ETH on exchanges can create upward pressure on prices, should demand remains consistent or grows. Etheruem Market Performance And Outlook Ethereum has so far been struggling to make significant price move to the upside ever since the latest crypto market bull run began months ago. Despite Bitcoin seeing consistent gains recording new all-time highs nearly every month, Ethereum has lacked enough upward momentum to push its price past the $4,000 barrier. It is worth noting that this sluggish performance from Ethereum comes amid the positive developments ongoing in the crypto space including the recent news of Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest lender reportedly working on its own layer-2 (L2) blockchain on Ethereum using ZKsync technology. JUST IN: Deutsche Bank building its own Layer-2 on Ethereum – Bloomberg pic.twitter.com/5O5K3R1fRg — Radar🚨 (@RadarHits) December 18, 2024 Regardless of such news, ETH has seen a slight increase of 2.3% in the past week, , a lower performance compared to that of Bitcoin’s 5% increase over the same period.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB.

Dogizen Prepares for Liftoff Amid A-Grade Partnerships,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/next-big-crypto-dogizen-prepares-for-liftoff-amid-a-grade-partnerships/,"The altcoin season we’ve all been waiting for has finally dropped, and there’s one token that’s looking like the next big crypto to 100x. Telegram gaming platform Dogizen has reeled in over $1.6m. And is offering those who invest today 41.56% in gains before the presale ends. With Dogizen being the first-ever Telegram ICO and benefiting from multiple partnerships with dynamite names in the Telegram space, 2025 is Dogizen’s for the taking. Here’s why. Why Dogizen is looking like 2025’s next big crypto Alongside the partnerships, the market for Telegram games is entering a golden age. The sector rocketed from essentially $0 last spring to over $1.5 billion in a matter of months. There are just a handful of players in this space, which means that almost every project is approaching blue-chip status. Sector leader Notcoin has cleared over $2 billion in market cap. And Catizen , a project whose market cap has cleared as much as +$200 million, has generated an average revenue per user 200x that of the average crypto project. Also, these projects are getting Binance listings faster than you can say CZ loves you. Makes sense—especially when you consider their insane ability to onboard new users thanks to their simple UX, easy accessibility via one of the world’s most popular messaging apps, and viral growth power due to them being easily referable between Telegram users. Plus, Telegram, in particular, is witnessing outsized growth right now. It’s nearly 1 billion users strong and is growing at a phenomenal rate. Especially in the developing world; African Telegram crypto communities have exploded by +180% since 2023 . How Dogizen improves on the competition Unlike the Notcoin/Hamster Kombat/Catizen cohort, Dogizen is holding an ICO instead of airdropping its tokens. Such a strategy resulted in all of Dogizen’s rivals seeing their token prices slump after launch. Dogizen’s ICO is designed to onboard the loyal. Getting buy-in before the token hits the open market encourages long-term holding, a key element of sustaining and pumping a token’s price. It’s also the only Telegram ICO in the messaging platform’s history. This means that Dogizen is being fed straight to Telegram’s nearly 1 billion strong audience. An audience that is already hyper-engaged with crypto and Web3. Dogizen partnerships are pouring extra gas into the tank From Telegram wallet Grindery to Telegram game SHARKS , Dogizen has teamed up with some of the best names in its space. Not only does this open Dogizen up to a 3 million+ audience, but it also gives Dogizen some juicy brand equity as it piggybacks on these big names. The crypto market has been forecast to triple in size next year. And it’s game-changing products in promising sectors such as Dogizen that are ready to see the outsized gains. You can buy DOGIZ on the official Dogizen website .",Press Release,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|ZRX|BNB|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-19 03:57:08

This $3 level has been a tough barrier for XRP, and the price hasn’t yet broken down the overall bullish trend, despite some short-term pullbacks. Right now, XRP is in a sideways consolidation phase, and it appears to be staying within this range for the time being. Key Fibonacci Levels The key Fibonacci levels have been met, but there could still be a small dip before any further upward movement. The price has maintained an overall bullish trend, with the possibility that the price bottomed around $1.90 in 2020, and we’re now seeing an upward movement that could continue. Bullish Flag Breakout According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, XRP recently broke out from a bullish flag pattern, signaling short-term upward movement. Even with a small pullback, the price is still above the breakout point, meaning those who entered the trade are still in profit. The price target for this breakout is around $3.80, which suggests a potential 47-48% increase from current levels. Resistance Levels to Watch However, resistance levels remain important. If XRP hits the $2.90-$3 range, it could struggle to move higher. Therefore, while the bullish target is in play, other factors need to be considered. Short-Term Support and Resistance XRP is bouncing from short-term support around $2.50. If it falls below this level, the next support is around $2.38. The analyst said that a drop below $2.38 would invalidate the current bullish outlook. It is important to note that at the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.36 level. Short-term resistance to watch includes levels around $2.70, $2.78, and $2.85. If XRP breaks these levels, it could face more resistance near $2.90-$3. Conclusion Overall, XRP is still stuck in its current price range, with no clear breakout yet. The price is likely consolidating before making another move upward, but we should wait for the market to stabilize before making any conclusions, especially after the recent Fed decision.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-19 03:59:04

The price retested the $2.20 support zone and is currently attempting a recovery wave. XRP price started a fresh decline from the $2.720 zone. The price is now trading below $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.45 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if it clears the $2.40 resistance. XRP Price Dives To $2.20 XRP price failed to start a fresh increase above the $2.50 level and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $2.45 and $2.40 levels. The price declined over 5% and there was a move below the $2.320 support. Finally, the price spiked below the $2.20 support. A low was formed at $2.171 and the price is now correcting losses. There was a move above the $2.250 level. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.720 swing high to the $2.171 low. The price is now trading below $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.40 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.450 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.45 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.720 swing high to the $2.171 low. The next resistance is $2.50. A clear move above the $2.50 resistance might send the price toward the $2.55 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.620 resistance or even $2.80 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.00. Are Dips Supported? If XRP fails to clear the $2.40 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.25 level. The next major support is near the $2.20 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.20 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.050 support. The next major support sits near the $2.00 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

With countless cryptocurrencies vying for attention, choosing the right one can feel overwhelming. Today, we’re spotlighting Qubetics ($TICS) , Monero ($XMR), and Stacks ($STX)—three projects that stand out for their unique features and recent developments, making them the best cryptos to join today. Among these, Qubetics is redefining the market with its groundbreaking asset tokenisation feature. Meanwhile, Monero and Stacks continue to attract users with their strong focus on privacy and smart contract innovation, respectively. Let’s dive into what sets these projects apart. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionising Asset Tokenisation Qubetics, the world’s first Web3 aggregator, is a rising star in the crypto landscape. In its 13th presale stage, $TICS is priced at $0.0342. With over $7 million raised, 10,600 token holders, and 355 million tokens sold , Qubetics is steadily building momentum and trust within the community. One of Qubetics’ standout features is its asset tokenisation capability. This innovation allows users to convert tangible and intangible assets into digital tokens on the blockchain. Imagine a real estate developer tokenising property shares or a business owner digitising intellectual property. By doing so, Qubetics enables fractional ownership, easier transferability, and enhanced liquidity for these assets. For professionals like lawyers or financial advisors, asset tokenisation simplifies complex transactions, reducing paperwork and ensuring transparency. Investors can diversify portfolios by owning fractions of high-value assets—a game-changer for those previously excluded from such opportunities. Explore the full scope of Qubetics . With ROI projections of up to 43,711.73% if $TICS reaches $15, it’s clear why this token is attracting attention. Combined with its asset tokenisation feature and growing community, Qubetics is undoubtedly among the best cryptos to join today. Monero ($XMR): A Pioneer in Privacy In its latest update, Monero enhanced its privacy protocol, improving efficiency and scalability. This ensures $XMR remains competitive and reliable in a rapidly evolving crypto environment. Monero has long been a favourite among privacy-conscious users. Its robust blockchain ensures anonymity for all transactions, shielding sensitive details from public scrutiny. Launched in 2014, $XMR continues to deliver unmatched privacy and security. Monero’s unique ring signatures and stealth addresses obscure transaction details, making it the go-to choice for individuals and businesses requiring confidentiality. For example, a journalist operating in a restrictive regime can securely receive donations or payments in Monero without risking exposure. Stacks ($STX): Empowering Smart Contracts on Bitcoin Stacks is bringing smart contracts and decentralised applications (dApps) to Bitcoin, combining the world’s most secure blockchain with advanced programmability. By leveraging the Bitcoin network, Stacks offers a unique approach to building Web3 applications. Stacks recently announced new partnerships with Web3 developers focused on decentralised identity solutions. This expansion underscores its commitment to building a robust and scalable ecosystem. As Bitcoin’s ecosystem expands, Stacks plays a crucial role in enabling smart contract functionality. For businesses and developers seeking to innovate on a secure foundation, $STX provides the perfect platform. Conclusion: Three Projects, Endless Potential Qubetics, Monero, and Stacks each bring something unique to the table, making them the best cryptos to join today . Qubetics’ asset tokenisation feature is a game-changer for professionals and investors alike. Monero’s privacy solutions remain unmatched, while Stacks bridges the gap between Bitcoin’s security and smart contract functionality.

Brandt, with decades of experience in the financial markets, has highlighted a significant bullish formation on the XRP/USD chart. The potential breakout could drive XRP to new heights. The “Half Mast Flag” Pattern On December 17, Peter Brandt shared an analysis of the XRP/USD trading pair, identifying a “Half Mast Flag” pattern. According to Brandt, this pattern often signals that an asset is gearing for an upward move, with the potential price increase matching the initial advance leading to the flag’s formation. The “Half Mast Flag” typically occurs when an asset’s price experiences a sharp move, followed by consolidation before resuming its upward trajectory. If this pattern completes as expected, XRP could be set for a significant price surge. Brandt’s observation has drawn agreement from various market commentators, with some suggesting that the asset’s price could exceed $3 if the breakout materializes. XRP @xrpusd appears to be resolving a half mast flag. If so, distance to upside should equal advance into tip of flag pic.twitter.com/Wj5c4gu5qE — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 17, 2024 In parallel, crypto analyst Ali Martinez also noted bullish signals for the token. Martinez identified a “Bull Flag” formation and predicted that breaking the $2.60 resistance level could pave the way for the token to climb toward $4. Major Transactions Linked to Binance While technical patterns point to bullish potential, on-chain activity has also caught the attention of analysts. Recently, a massive deposit of 69.3 million XRP, valued at approximately $175.8 million, was transferred to a Binance wallet from an unidentified address, according to data from the analytics platform Bithomp. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Before this, Whale Alert reported two large transfers involving Binance wallets. The transactions, totaling 920 million XRP—equivalent to $1.92 billion—indicate significant movements within the Binance ecosystem. While these transfers were substantial, they remained within Binance-associated wallets, raising questions about potential strategies or preparations linked to asset price activity. Ripple USD Stablecoin Gains Attention Adding to the excitement around the asset, the Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin officially launched on December 17. Ripple minted nearly $66 million worth of RLUSD after receiving regulatory approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services. This stablecoin is expected to enhance liquidity and expand decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities on the XRP Ledger. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson also expressed enthusiasm for RLUSD, describing it as “awesome” in a recent post on X . When asked whether Cardano might adopt RLUSD, Hoskinson indicated ongoing efforts toward this goal. As the asset consolidates near the $2.60 resistance level, the combination of technical patterns, whale activity, and ecosystem developments paints a promising picture. Breaking above the resistance could confirm the bullish formations identified by analysts, potentially driving the token toward $4 or higher.

Users should avoid sharing personal details and verify information only through official channels. Beware, ShibArmy Shibarium Trustwatch recently issued another important alert concerning the Shiba Inu community. The team cautioned that scammers request victims to send them an email containing information about the meme coin SHIFU. “Fraudsters are asking people to send them an email asking how to buy and claim SHIFU or if SHIFU has not appeared in their wallet,” the warning reads. The team advised people to remain vigilant and not send emails to anyone. Verifying information through official channels and avoiding sharing personal details is also a must . SHIFU is a dog-themed Shiba Inu-related meme coin introduced by the lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, at the beginning of December. While it is available for trading on certain decentralized exchanges, major platforms like Binance have not yet listed it. Earlier this week, the meme coin project launched a special airdrop. The team revealed that 30% of the token’s total supply (equaling 30 billion SHIFU) will be distributed to the community. 22 billion SHIFU will reach some of those holding at least 100,000 SHIB, and 100 BUBBLE. 2 billion tokens will be allocated to eligible LEASH holders, whereas lucky BONE owners will get 1 billion coins. The remaining 70% of the supply will be distributed for other purposes such as “liquidity and public pre-sale,” treasury, and market initiatives. Previous Warnings Shiba Inu has one of the largest community bases, which explains why fraudsters often target it. Last month, Shibarium Trustwatch cautioned users to stay away from dubious individuals who offer services with the meme coins SHI and TREAT. The team said the tokens are not live yet, advising people to follow the official X accounts of Shiba Inu, Shytoshi Kusama (the pseudonymous leading developer of the meme coin), Kaal Dhairya (another prominent developer), and Treat for more clarity on the matter. A few weeks later, Shibarium Trustwatch maintained that bad actors use Shytoshi Kusama’s name to promote fraudulent tokens in fake groups. “Always verify the authenticity of any group or token before participating. Stay vigilant and protect yourself and others from these scams,” the warning reads.

John Reed Stark, a former SEC enforcement official and crypto skeptic, recently appeared on Docket Media LLC podcast and opened up about the historic Ripple decisions. He said that the Ripple ruling doesn’t provide broad legal clarity and should only be applied to cases with similar specific facts. He criticized the Ripple decision, claiming that many people misunderstand the ruling, likely because they haven’t fully read it. He argued that Judge Torres was ‘mistaken on multiple counts, a view shared by other judges who have reviewed the case. “There’s so many things about the Ripple decision that people get entirely wrong because I don’t think they read it. It’s completely… it’s respectfully to Judge Torres, I think she was mistaken on multiple counts, as does Judge Rakoff and every single other judge that has looked at that decision (thought),” he said. Stark pointed out that the Ripple decision was twofold. First, he agreed that the initial offering of XRP tokens to sophisticated investors should have been registered as securities to protect those investors. However, Stark disagreed with the decision when it came to the secondary market, where XRP was traded on exchanges. ‘Ripple Decision Created Confusion’ He argued that the lack of a direct relationship between Ripple and retail investors meant they weren’t protected, which he believes is an unfair argument. Stark compared it to buying stocks in companies, where investors don’t have a direct contractual relationship with the company but are still protected under securities regulations. Stark also criticized the Ripple decision for creating confusion, especially after pro-crypto companies began citing it to argue that tokens were not securities. In response, the SEC sought an interlocutory appeal, hoping to stop the ongoing proceedings. However, the judge rejected the SEC’s request, stating that the Ripple decision could not be used as precedent unless the exact same circumstances were present.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-19 04:43:49

People from the crypto industry spend huge funds to support candidates who align with industry goals. This influence didn’t stop with campaigns. Crypto-friendly Republican senators also pushed hard to ensure Crenshaw wouldn’t continue her role. Even Democrats felt the heat. Sherrod Brown, one of Crenshaw’s supporters, lashed out at the crypto industry, calling their lobbying efforts a “disgusting smear campaign.” But it wasn’t enough to save her spot. What Happens Now? With Crenshaw leaving and Gensler stepping down in January, things are already shifting. President-elect Donald Trump’s administration is shaping up to be much more crypto-friendly. Paul Atkins, who’s known for his pro-crypto views, will take over as SEC Chair. There’s also talk about who might replace Crenshaw. Names like Chris Brummer and TuongVy Le are being floated. Brummer, a blockchain expert, seems to have the strongest backing, but nothing is confirmed yet. If he’s chosen, it would send a clear message: the SEC might finally be ready to work with the crypto industry instead of fighting against it. What’s Next This feels like a turning point. For years, crypto companies have been calling for clearer regulations. Now, they might actually get them. Big names in the industry, like Tyler Winklevoss of Gemini , are already celebrating. He called Crenshaw’s departure “a roadblock removed” and emphasized the need for clear rules. Source : X.com The U.S. has lagged behind other countries in embracing crypto.

The Hong Kong-based company BiT Global is allegedly tied to crypto entrepreneur and TRON founder Justin Sun, who had sought the order to prohibit Coinbase from removing Wrapped Bitcoin ( wBTC ), arguing it would inflict “irreparable” damage to its business. The ruling from U.S. District Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín permits the delisting to move forward as scheduled. The court also observed that “ self-inflicted wounds are not irreparable injury ”, suggesting that BiT Global’s purported injury stemmed from BiT Global’s own actions and decisions and was not caused by Coinbase’s delisting. As covered by crypto.news earlier, the American cryptocurrency exchange giant Coinbase revealed on Nov. 19 that it would delist wBTC from its platform on Dec. 19. The decision came as a result of Coinbase’s regular review process, which BiT Global alleged was biased. The firm subsequently filed a lawsuit alleging violations of competition laws and libel, claiming the exchange damaged wBTC’s reputation by promoting its own tokenized Bitcoin product, cbBTC. Coinbase’s legal counsel characterized the suit as frivolous and suggested sanctions could be imposed against both BiT Global and its counsel. They pointed to a failure of evidence to support claims that Coinbase’s actions had caused users to abandon wBTC. You might also like: BiT Global sues Coinbase for $1b over WBTC delisting Coinbase, as a private company, defended its decision and mentioned . A spokesman for the exchange rejected the allegations, saying that they have the right to decide whether to list or delist a token. The company further denied accusations of monopolistic behavior, saying it represented less than one percent of all wBTC trading activity. cbBTC, on the other hand, has taken off since its Sept. launch , with a market cap exceeding $2.11 billion . You might also like: This altcoin could pump 17100% like Solana 3 years ago BiT Global also asserted Justin Sun, the firm’s adviser, had been wrongly involved in the scandal. Still, Coinbase pointed to Sun’s previous accusations of financial misconduct and argued that his distancing from wBTC was a strategic decision. BiT Global also claimed that wBTC is crucial to the crypto ecosystem and defended their stance by accusing Coinbase of impartial listing policies and accusing the exchange of listing meme coins such as Mogcoin ( MOG ) and pepe ( PEPE ) that serve little purpose. So in a court filing today, @Coinbase gave their reason why they delisted wBTC, and it's basically just they don't like Justin Sun. That's really just it. They don't give any technical or legal arguments about why wBTC can't be listed. It's just guilt by association pic.twitter.com/bJmMnAue7x — Pledditor (@Pledditor) December 17, 2024 However, many crypto enthusiasts are siding with BiT Global saying Coinbase’s decision to delist wBTC is because they “don’t like Justin Sun”. Critics further argued that wBTC is more acceptable than cbBTC does not provide proof of reserves, unlike its competitor. A token requires proof of reserves to prove an issuer possesses enough assets to back the token and to expand transparency and trust. For wrapped tokens such as wBTC or cbBTC, it shows that each token is actually 1:1 backed by the original asset, in this case, Bitcoin ( BTC ). The absence of proof of reserves, on the other hand, puts each user at an increased risk of insolvency, fraud, or mismanagement by the issuer.

December’s end brings not just festive cheer but also an opportunity to spotlight the coins that have captured attention with their strong year-end momentum. So far, $CHO, $DOGE, and $HYPE are looking like the ones to watch for gains by January 1, and there’s a good chance they’ll keep it up into 2025. $CHO $CHO, the native token of Choise.ai , an enterprise crypto platform with over one million users, experienced a 700% spike from February to April, setting a yearly high . With the token’s utility growing through updates to Choise.ai’s expanding ecosystem of products, it seems poised to cap off the year with even greater gains. One of the most recent announcements from Choise.ai highlights their work with Vault , a B2B platform specializing in white-label crypto banking solutions, on Meme Bank, a new Choise.ai ecosystem addition designed to introduce real-world utility for meme coins. This will enable holders to, for example, spend their meme coins in real life via Visa and Mastercard. Meme Bank will actually feature individual banks for each meme coin, offering seamless transactions, exchanges, withdrawals, additional utility-driven features like token burns, staking options, and many more. This is probably going to be huge for $CHO because portions of the token will be burned during transactions within Meme Bank, alongside the associated meme coins, directly increasing their scarcity. With millions of transactions anticipated, $CHO holders stand to benefit as supply decreases and demand grows. In a recent post on X, Choise.ai revealed that the first meme bank will soon be unveiled, with community chatter suggesting that $DOGE will be the inaugural coin, and this means potentially tapping into its massive community of over 6 million active holders. Image Source: X Adding to the momentum, Choise.ai just announced the addition of Ryan Horn, a former Binance executive known for high-profile partnerships like those with Cristiano Ronaldo, to its Board of Directors. Earlier in the year, $CHO’s surge was partly fueled by its listing on BingX, building on its presence on exchanges like KuCoin and MEXC. Now, anticipation is building for a new tier-1 CEX listing, which could significantly broaden its audience and drive further demand. $DOGE As of 2024, meme coins command a staggering market capitalization of over $127 billion. And, even though many of them, such as $PEPE or $POPCAT, have gained serious attention and seen impressive growth, $DOGE, the original meme coin, still stands out as having the most genuine potential. With 11 years under its belt, its rise is driven by utility, not just speculation or hype. $DOGE has already seen a 342% increase in yearly growth, and the last two weeks of 2024 could push it even higher. The most popular meme coin certainly benefited from the overall bullishness in the market, especially after Bitcoin smashed through $100,000. But the momentum continued for another reason: hints from Elon Musk about $DOGE payments for X’s premium features, as well as President Trump’s appointment of Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the new Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). The name alone sparked attention, boosting $DOGE’s trading volume and hinting at its expanding utility. Plus, beyond its current use for payments within Tesla and various online and offline stores like Newegg, Jomashop, Burger Bear, Travala, and AirBaltic, $DOGE seems poised for more. After a healthy retest, which followed the big jump in November, $DOGE appears ready to finish the year with even stronger gains. One factor that could fuel this is if it actually becomes the first meme coin bank within Choise.ai’s Meme Bank project. If this scenario unfolds, burning $DOGE with each transaction could drive up demand while decreasing the supply in circulation. Additionally, expanding $DOGE’s utility and increasing its real-world applications could also be a major boost for its further growth. $HYPE Hyperliquid burst onto the scene on November 29 with the launch of its $HYPE token, marking one of the most talked-about token generation events in recent memory. As a decentralized perpetual trading platform and layer-1 blockchain, Hyperliquid allows users to trade perpetual derivatives and spot assets, all while pulling liquidity from multiple sources. At the heart of the platform is the $HYPE token, which does double duty as both a utility token for trading and the gas token for HyperEVM, the platform’s execution environment. Since its launch, $HYPE quickly climbed into CoinGecko’s top 30 cryptocurrencies. Over $1 billion in USDC net inflows have been recorded, and the token is being celebrated as one of the most successful airdrops ever, despite the absence of any major centralized exchange listings. What sets Hyperliquid apart is its commitment to decentralization; no token supply was allocated to private investors or exchanges, keeping ownership squarely in the hands of its users. The platform’s unique approach to decentralized perpetual trading has resonated with the DeFi community, and its rising popularity suggests it could become a key player in the space. However, with $HYPE’s value skyrocketing by 748% in less than a month, it’s important to tread carefully. While the token shows plenty of promise, its newness and rapid rise call for cautious optimism. Summary It doesn’t matter whether it’s the beginning or end of the year for coins with real potential and ongoing developments to get the recognition they deserve, but this time, the end of the year is lining up perfectly with big things happening for some projects. With teams like Choise.ai constantly building, there’s a lot in store. With the Meme Bank launch on the horizon, $CHO seems set for some nice gains, while $DOGE and $HYPE also have some strong potential to grow.",Information,EN,0,0,DOGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-19 04:55:00

USDT Exchange Inflows Have Remained High Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment discussed the trend in the Exchange Flow Balance for Tether’s USDT. The “Exchange Flow Balance” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the net amount of a given asset entering or exiting the wallets associated with centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the inflows outweigh the outflows, and a net amount of the coin is entered into the exchanges’ wallets. Such a trend is usually a sign of demand among investors for trading away the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Ethereum On-Chain Demand Should Sustain ETH Above $4,000, IntoTheBlock Says On the other hand, the negative indicator implies the holders are withdrawing a net number of tokens from these platforms. This kind of trend suggests the market is in a phase of accumulation. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Exchange Flow Balance for USDT over the last couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the Exchange Flow Balance for USDT has observed several large positive spikes over the past month, implying that large investors have been depositing their tokens. For assets like Bitcoin, a positive Exchange Flow Balance can be a bearish sign, as it could suggest the holders are planning to sell. However, the same isn’t true when the asset involved is a stablecoin. Investors generally store their capital in these fiat-tied tokens to avoid the volatility of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Such users eventually plan to venture into the volatile side once they feel the conditions are right. And when the time comes, they naturally transfer to exchanges to swap to Bitcoin or whatever desired coin. This act of selling USDT does not affect its value since the coin is, by definition, always stable around the $1 mark.

As such, stablecoin exchange inflows are usually considered a bullish sign for Bitcoin and other assets. During the last eight weeks, exchanges have received a net average of $40 million USDT. “Helping to fuel this bull rally and the many historic crypto pumps, look for stablecoin ‘dry powder’ to continue flowing in during this final stretch of 2024,” explains the analytics firm. Bitcoin Price Bitcoin set a new all-time high (ATH) beyond the $108,000 mark yesterday, but the coin appears to have seen a pullback since then, as its price is now trading around $104,500.

There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.015 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.1113 swing high to the $0.9151 low. The next key resistance might be $1.050. If there is a close above the $1.050 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $1.0650 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $1.10 in the near term. Another Decline in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $1.020 resistance level, it could start another decline.

This system is a step toward bridging non-smart contract cryptocurrencies, such as XRP , Bitcoin, and Dogecoin, with decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Testing on Songbird will span six weeks for each asset, operating under specific financial parameters to ensure security and reliability. Flare has introduced a $2 million issuance cap per asset and offers $300,000 in loss protection through Flare Labs, providing an added layer of security for participants. Collateral for this testing phase will be backed by Songbird’s native token (SGB) and USDX, a stablecoin linked to U.S. Treasury values. Incentives for Testing Participation To encourage active engagement, Flare has allocated $260,000 in rewards through rFLR tokens for users involved in minting, redeeming, and trading FXRP. Participants can access the system via various minting applications, reducing reliance on any single platform and mitigating centralization risks. Developers also have access to comprehensive testing parameters through the Flare Developer Hub, ensuring a wide range of tools for experimentation. The FAssets protocol, which powers FXRP , utilizes an over-collateralization model to provide security and stability. Each bridged token is backed by collateral exceeding its value, a strategy that sets it apart from traditional bridging approaches that rely on custody or multi-signature wallets. Additionally, automated liquidation processes are in place to maintain system stability and protect user assets.

By tokenizing these assets, Flare enables their use in activities such as lending, trading, and staking, unlocking new opportunities while maintaining security through robust collateralization measures. The ongoing Songbird testing phase is a preparatory step before the potential deployment of FXRP on Flare’s main network. This stage aims to identify and resolve operational challenges and optimize the system for scalability and reliability. Flare’s infrastructure incorporates decentralized oracles at the network level, which support data processing for various blockchain operations. This setup enables the seamless handling of price feeds, blockchain events, and external API data, all critical components for DeFi functionalities. By focusing on advanced asset-bridging techniques and maintaining strict collateralization protocols, Flare demonstrates its commitment to balancing accessibility with security in cross-chain operations. This initiative aligns with the broader industry trend of integrating traditional cryptocurrencies into the rapidly expanding DeFi ecosystem. The FXRP integration on Songbird signifies Flare’s innovative approach to blockchain interoperability, paving the way for non-smart contract tokens to achieve greater utility in decentralized finance.

This is a big deal for the crypto world because Crenshaw has been against crypto. The majority of the lawyer’s community has voiced against her renomination with over 107,000 emails from crypto supporters, helping block her re-nomination. Now, everyone is eyeing a pro-SEC Commissioner who might be more supportive of cryptocurrencies. What’s Happening at the SEC? Caroline Crenshaw, who has been a Commissioner at the SEC since 2022, is known for being tough on crypto. As per Elenor Terror, Fox Business Journalist the Senate decided not to move forward with her re-nomination, leaving a spot open at the SEC. This is important because the SEC controls rules for financial markets, including crypto. Apart from Crenshaw’s exit, Gary Gensler, the SEC Chairman, is also expected to leave in January . Gensler has been tough on crypto, but his replacement, Paul Atkins , is expected to be more supportive of the industry. This could mean fewer regulations and more freedom for crypto to grow. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Fed’s Anti-Bitcoin Stance Triggers Major Crypto Market Sell-off , Who Could Replace Crenshaw? By law, Crenshaw’s replacement must be a Democrat, and several potential candidates are already being discussed. One of the top names is Chris Brummer, a Georgetown law professor who was close to becoming the head of the CFTC in 2021. Another strong contender is TuongVy Le, who works as the general counsel for Anchorage Digital, a crypto bank. These candidates are seen as more crypto-friendly. Other names being floated include Jai Messai, a blockchain expert, and Carla Carriveau, an advisor to the New York Department of Financial Services. Why This is Important for Crypto With new leadership at the SEC, Senator Cynthia Lummis predicts that 2025 will be a Bitcoin year, along with David Sacks serving as the crypto czar . This optimism is further boosted by Crypto.com dropping its lawsuit against the SEC after meetings with political leaders, including President-elect Donald Trump, to discuss future crypto-friendly appointments. There is also buzz that the new chair may dismiss all pending crypto cases starting with Ripple. We have to wait and watch if Trump manages to make these strategic changes in top administration as it is very crucial if he wants his Bitcoin Strategic Reserve plan to succeed. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bitcoin’s 21 Million Supply Cap: Unwavering or Vulnerable? The debate over Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million has once again taken center stage in the cryptocurrency community, following a provocative disclaimer in a recent explainer video by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. The video, which aims to shed light on Bitcoin’s fundamentals, has ignited speculation over whether its famously fixed supply cap is as immutable as many investors believe. Released on Dec. 17, BlackRock’s three-minute video touted Bitcoin’s capped supply as a key factor underpinning its value as a deflationary asset. However, a disclaimer in the video raised eyebrows: “There is no guarantee that bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap will not be changed.” This statement has sparked a flurry of discussions, with critics and supporters alike weighing in on the implications for Bitcoin’s future. Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap has been integral to its reputation as “digital gold.” By limiting supply, Bitcoin mirrors gold’s scarcity while eliminating the risks of monetary debasement associated with fiat currencies. This deflationary design has made Bitcoin a store of value, particularly in inflationary economic environments. BlackRock’s video focuses on this point, stating that Bitcoin’s hard-coded rule “controls supply, purchasing power and helps avoid the potential misuse of printing more and more currency.” Yet the disclaimer hints at the theoretical possibility of altering this cap, a notion that runs counter to Bitcoin’s core ethos and could shake investor confidence. MicroStrategy’s executive chairman and vocal Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor reposted the video, amplifying its reach and sparking further debate. Detractors, such as Joel Valenzuela, Director of Marketing and Business Development at Dashpay, expressed skepticism, claiming that such a change would undermine Bitcoin’s legitimacy. Ethereum developer Antiprosynthesis also chimed in, asserting, “BlackRock understands Bitcoin better than Bitcoiners.” Could the Supply Cap Be Changed? Technically, Bitcoin’s supply cap could be altered through a hard fork, a process that would require widespread consensus among Bitcoin stakeholders, including node operators, developers, miners, and investors. However, such a change would be contentious and complex. Bitcoin developer “Super Testnet,” the mind behind BitVM, explained that while a hard fork could theoretically create a new blockchain with an uncapped supply, it would no longer represent Satoshi Nakamoto’s original Bitcoin . “The inflation cap is definitional to Bitcoin,” said Super Testnet, referencing Bitcoin’s whitepaper. “Eliminate that, and whatever you have isn’t Bitcoin anymore. You might as well ask what it would take to turn Bitcoin into PayPal.” This perspective suggests that any version of Bitcoin with an altered supply cap would lack the philosophical and economic underpinnings that make Bitcoin distinct. As history has shown, such changes are unlikely to gain traction. During the Blocksize War of 2016–2017, a proposal to increase Bitcoin’s block size limit was supported by 95% of miners but was ultimately rejected by node operators and the broader community, leading to the creation of Bitcoin Cash instead. The primary argument for uncapping Bitcoin’s supply centers on its long-term security model. Bitcoin miners rely on block subsidies and transaction fees to maintain the network. However, block subsidies halve approximately every four years, creating a financial challenge for miners unless Bitcoin’s price or transaction fees rise significantly. As of now, miners earn 3.125 BTC per block, worth around $316,950 at current prices. This reward will halve to 1.625 BTC in 2028, putting further pressure on the economic viability of mining. The final Bitcoin is projected to be mined in 2140, after which miners will depend entirely on transaction fees. Some argue that Bitcoin’s application layer, including developments in decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, must evolve to sustain sufficient network activity and fee revenue for miners. During the Bitcoin Ordinals craze, transaction fees spiked, benefiting miners. However, such periods of high activity are often short-lived. While miners have a vested interest in sustaining the network’s profitability, their influence alone is insufficient to enforce changes, as demonstrated during the Blocksize War. The broader community’s resistance to altering Bitcoin’s rules suggests that any proposal to increase the supply cap would face significant hurdles. The debate over Bitcoin’s supply cap is not merely technical but deeply philosophical. For many in the community, Bitcoin’s fixed supply is sacrosanct, a core principle that defines its identity and value. Any move to change it would likely fracture the community and create competing chains, as seen with Bitcoin Cash. BlackRock’s disclaimer, while hypothetical, has reignited this longstanding debate, reminding the community of Bitcoin’s decentralized governance structure. Ultimately, the question of whether Bitcoin’s supply cap is truly fixed may rest not on its code but on the collective will of its stakeholders to preserve its foundational principles. As of now, Bitcoin’s identity as “digital gold” remains intact, but the ongoing discussion serves as a potent reminder of the delicate balance between innovation and tradition in the cryptocurrency world. El Salvador to Scale Back Bitcoin Initiatives as Part of IMF Loan Agreement In other Bitcoin news, El Salvador , the first country in the world to adopt BTC as legal tender, is set to significantly scale back its Bitcoin-related initiatives in a move tied to securing a $1.4 billion loan deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This agreement marks a significant shift in the Central American nation’s approach to cryptocurrency, aiming to address its mounting debt challenges while reducing the risks associated with its Bitcoin experiment. The IMF announced on Dec. 18 that the loan agreement spans 40 months and includes measures designed to lower El Salvador’s debt-to-GDP ratio. The deal also introduces sweeping reforms to the country's cryptocurrency policies, reversing some of the bold steps taken under President Nayib Bukele’s leadership since Bitcoin was made legal tender in 2021. Among the most notable changes is the plan to make Bitcoin acceptance by private-sector merchants voluntary rather than mandatory. When the Bitcoin Law was enacted in June 2021, businesses were required to accept the cryptocurrency as a means of payment if they had the technological capability to do so. This policy, which sparked global attention and criticism, will now be revised to allow businesses to choose whether to accept Bitcoin. “For the public sector, engagement in Bitcoin-related economic activities and transactions in and purchases of Bitcoin will be confined,” the IMF said in its statement . Additionally, the government’s involvement in the state-backed Chivo wallet, which facilitates Bitcoin transactions for citizens, will be gradually reduced. Taxes in El Salvador will also continue to be payable only in US dollars, the country’s official currency. El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office has reported that the country currently holds 5,968.8 BTC, worth approximately $602 million at current market prices. However, Bitcoin usage among Salvadorans has remained low. A recent survey conducted in October revealed that 92% of respondents did not use Bitcoin for transactions, a slight increase from the 88% reported in a 2023 survey. Despite the low adoption rates, President Bukele’s administration has continued to promote Bitcoin as a key part of its economic strategy, touting its potential to attract tourism and foreign investment. The IMF, however, has repeatedly raised concerns about the speculative nature of Bitcoin and its potential to destabilize the country’s economy. IMF’s Conditions and Broader Financing Plan The $1.4 billion loan agreement is contingent on the IMF Executive Board’s approval. If approved, the agreement will unlock additional financing from global institutions, including the World Bank, bringing the total financial package to over $3.5 billion. These funds aim to stabilize El Salvador’s economy, which has faced mounting debt and limited fiscal space. The IMF has long criticized Bukele’s Bitcoin policies, citing risks tied to volatility, financial instability, and the speculative nature of the cryptocurrency market. The institution views the latest agreement as a step toward mitigating these risks and aligning El Salvador’s economic policies with global standards. Reactions to the IMF agreement have been mixed. Max Keiser, a prominent Bitcoin advocate and adviser to President Bukele, dismissed the IMF’s measures as “bureaucratic, meaningless nonsense.” In a series of posts on X, Keiser claimed that Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador remains robust and growing despite IMF objections. “Bitcoin use in El Salvador was always voluntary and its usage has never been higher,” Keiser wrote, dismissing concerns about the reforms' impact on adoption. However, critics argue that the low adoption rates among Salvadorans undermine the administration’s claims of Bitcoin success. Many point to surveys showing limited usage of Bitcoin for everyday transactions as evidence that the policy has failed to resonate with the public. The reforms signal a pragmatic shift in El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment. While President Bukele’s government has championed Bitcoin as a tool for economic empowerment and innovation, the new measures suggest that financial stability and debt reduction have taken precedence over furthering the cryptocurrency agenda. The gradual unwinding of the Chivo wallet, the voluntary nature of Bitcoin acceptance for merchants, and the limited public-sector involvement indicate a significant pivot. However, the government’s substantial Bitcoin holdings and the continued promotion of Bitcoin-related tourism and investment projects suggest that El Salvador is not entirely abandoning its crypto ambitions. As El Salvador navigates its obligations under the IMF agreement, the global cryptocurrency community will closely watch how these reforms impact the country’s Bitcoin narrative and its broader economic landscape. While the era of mandatory Bitcoin adoption may be coming to an end, the legacy of El Salvador’s bold experiment will likely influence debates about cryptocurrency adoption worldwide for years to come.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BCH|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|FORKS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-19 05:30:00

While Bitcoin has slumped after setting a new all-time high above $108,000 on Tuesday, Kiyosaki still thinks BTC can reach $350,000 next year. Robert Kiyosaki Sees $350K Bitcoin In 2025 In a post on X, Robert Kiyosaki reminded his 2.6 million followers that Donald Trump, the first-ever Bitcoin president in the United States, was reelected into office last month. During his 2024 election campaign, Trump made several crypto-related promises, including establishing a strategic Bitcoin stockpile. The concept has since picked up steam both in the U.S. and abroad. While there have been plenty of discussions and proposals, lawmakers have yet to review in detail a clear roadmap and timeline for the enactment of the national BTC reserve. Nevertheless, Kiyosaki believes the premier crypto Bitcoin will skyrocket to a new epic high in 2025 and reach a staggering $350,000 per BTC. Thus, he said, it makes sense to acquire more Bitcoin. “BITCOIN to $350K in 2025. OWN more BITCOIN in 2025,” Kiyosaki posited. Interestingly, a Bitcoiner created a poll to find out whether other Kiyosaki followers believe the flagship crypto will indeed reach $350,000 heights next year. Although only a handful of X users responded to the poll, the majority of the responders are skeptical of the sky-high price target. Are Kiyosaki’s Bitcoin Predictions Reliable? Since May. 2020, Kiyosaki has been a huge advocate for asset classes that cannot be directly manipulated by the Fed, having once advised investors to “Get Bitcoin and save yourself” after the Fed launched its mass money printing sprees to bolster the economy during the pandemic. It’s worth noting that Kiyosaki has a rather questionable track record of predicting Bitcoin’s price. Back in June, the best-selling author predicted that Bitcoin would be worth $350,000 by August. We are already in December, and the crypto’s current all-time high stands at $108,135 following the parabolic rally witnessed in recent weeks. Kiyosaki recently suggested that BTC was headed to $500,000 in 2025 and then climb past $1 million by 2030. In his belief, the gargantuan price appreciation would be triggered by artificial intelligence (AI) dramatically disrupting the global financial sector. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $101,046, down roughly 2.7% over the last 24 hours.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-19 05:30:34

This includes a collapse in the yen and its slow growth just before the parliament returns to Tokyo for a pivotal session next week. According to The Japan Times , the BOJ’s decision came after a two-day policy meeting. In the meeting, analysts were split over whether rates should be raised to 0.5 percent or held at the current 0.25 percent. Markets had already begun to anticipate the BOJ’s decision, moving on to a pause. This is a cautious measure after two 2024 rate hikes ended a yearslong freeze on negative interest rates. BOJ governor will address the further moves of the bank The uncertainty was exacerbated by Trump’s threat of further tariffs on Chinese, Canadian, and Mexican goods. Promoted as a tool for preventing illegal immigration and drug trafficking, the trade strategy raises questions regarding the encouragement of the beginning of a more general attack on the global trading system. Markets are waiting for BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda’s updates about the bank’s next moves when he addresses the decision later.

A failure to hold support near $101K could lead to a drop below $100K. Analysts predict Bitcoin’s 2025 average price could reach $119,218, signaling growth. Bitcoin’s price trends have long intrigued investors and analysts. With 2025 on the horizon, speculation is growing about the digital currency’s potential to reach $350,000. This bold forecast from Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, has sparked interest, especially in light of former President Donald Trump’s endorsement of Bitcoin.

Nexo has generously donated $105,000 to Brink , a non-profit organization dedicated to open-source Bitcoin development.

The funds will be used to support our engineers’ work of securing Bitcoin software through their efforts of fuzz testing, code review, and other projects outlined in our recent annual report . Thank you Nexo! — [Mike Schmidt, Executive Director, Brink] Thanks to community donations, Brink has become a bug-hunting force, actively identifying and fixing critical vulnerabilities in the Bitcoin software. Recent disclosures on BitcoinCore.org offer a glimpse into the types of threats Brink and Bitcoin Core developers tirelessly combat, ensuring the network’s robustness for everyone. “Bitcoin Core developers are Bitcoin’s unsung guardians. By supporting their work, we help ensure that Bitcoin remains the most secure, innovative, and decentralized asset for future generations. This donation will directly fund Brink’s developers and is a testament to our shared responsibility to safeguard Bitcoin’s future. Stepping in to support critical development work that relies on contributions like these to move forward is crucial for the digital asset industry and we hope it inspires others to recognize the importance of funding Bitcoin Core development for securing the network’s future for millions worldwide.“ — [Elitsa Taskova, CPO, Nexo] This dedication to Bitcoin’s health isn’t lost on Nexo, a platform founded by “HODLers” (long-term Bitcoin believers).

This isn’t just a one-time act; Nexo is committed to Bitcoin’s future, ensuring its security for generations of HODLers to come. The collaboration between Nexo and Brink extends beyond finance.

Magic Eden (ME) and Ponke (PONKE) holders have faced huge losses that prompted them to turn to a new and lucrative PropFi altcoin that is making headlines with its advanced features and stable gains. While the rise of Ponke and the launch of Magic Eden’s ME token dominated the headlines, a new crypto coin is outpacing them rapidly in profit potential. This DeFi coin offers massive growth potential, real utility, and remarkable investor benefits, positioning it as a great investment option for stable gains. Here is why you do not want to miss this PropFi altcoin investment opportunity! >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE ME Token Struggles While a New DeFi Coin Rises With a 100x Profit Potential Magic Eden’s ME token was introduced on December 10, 2024, with an airdrop valued at more than $700 million. Initially, the token traded at around $4.50 , reaching a peak of $8.26 before dropping sharply to stabilize near $5.07. More than 70,000 users acquired 69 million tokens within the first hour, but most faced issues like app glitches and claim errors . Despite the challenges, traders leveraged the volatility, with one making $586,800 in profit. Listed on mainstream exchanges, the ME Foundation attributed challenges to increased app traffic during the launch. While Magic Eden’s ME token launch drew attention, a new PropFi altcoin surpasses it with groundbreaking innovations. Its impressive presale performance makes the new crypto a better investment due to its price stability and projected 100x growth potential. ME sold at $3.84 on December 15, down 68.54% in the past week. Holders are diversifying from ME to the PropFi altcoin due to its massive profit potential.

If PONKE’s adoption increases as projected, the token could hit its ambitious price goals, transforming it into a potential hidden gem with huge profits for early investors.

With its practical features, massive growth potential, and unrivaled trading flexibility, this DeFi coin offers a more lucrative, utility-driven opportunity than Ponke’s speculative potential. PONKE traded at $0.4482 on December 10, 2024, down 23.82% in the past week.

(Tokyo: 3350), a Japanese company that has earned a huge reputation in the crypto industry through its Bitcoin strategy, has announced its debut in the United States market. The company announced earlier today that its shares will commence trading on the United States OTCQX, a top-tier marketplace for over-the-counter stocks, on Thursday, December 19, 2024. The Metaplanet shares will trade on OTCQX under the ticker MTPLF, which will complement its stock trading in Japan. According to Simon Gerovich, the CEO of Metaplanet, the listing of the company’s stocks at OTCQX will help strengthen its Bitcoin strategy in the long haul. Metaplanet and The Bitcoin Strategy Following the adoption of the Bitcoin strategy earlier this year, which has seen the company accumulate over 1,142 BTCs, Metaplanet is projecting the first fiscal year operating profit since 2017. Furthermore, the company’s stock market has rallied like a meme coin this year, with a return of about 2,068 percent year-to-date (YTD) to trade at about ¥3,685 at the time of this writing. Having added the Bitcoin treasury operations as the official new business line, Metaplanet is well positioned to attract more investors akin to MicroStrategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR) . Late last month, Metaplanet announced the issuance of moving strike stock acquisition rights to raise ¥9.5 billion, equivalent to about $62 million , for accelerated Bitcoin accumulation. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Japan Considers National Bitcoin Reserve as Countries Embrace Crypto , Market Impact The relentless Bitcoin accumulation by Metaplanet has strengthened the Bitcoin market in the Asian region.

37828883,https://coingape.com/?p=230028,1734587966,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Crypto Market Crash: Bitcoin, ETH, XRP, DOGE, SOL Trigger $860M In Liquidations",https://coingape.com/crypto-market-crash-bitcoin-eth-xrp-doge-sol-trigger-860m-in-liquidations/,"After the US Federal Reserve announced a 25 bps rate cut on Wednesday, the Bitcoin price came crashing under the $100K level to trigger the broader crypto market crash. The selling pressure was a reaction to the Fed’s future monetary policy guidance for 2025 and coming years. Along with Bitcoin, altcoins also faced strong pullback correcting to the tune of 10% and more. Top altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP, Solana (SOL), and others corrected 5-10% triggering more than $860 million in liquidations. Crypto Market Crash Saw Over $860 Million in Liquidation Bitcoin Price Drops Following Fed’s Hawkish Stance for 2025 On Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve announced its third rate cut of 25 bps on the expected lines with Jerome Powell setting up a hawkish undertone for 2025. Powell stated that the US central bank will proceed with only 2 rate cuts in 2025, against the anticipated 4 rate cuts. This was enough to send the Bitcoin price crashing under the crucial support of $100K levels. Thus, this recent correction has wiped out all the weekly gains for BTC, after hitting an all-time high above $108K earlier this week. Jerome Powell stated that the Fed remains committed to bringing inflation under the desired 2% target. The Fed chair also stated that achieving the 2% inflation target could take 1-2 years further adding to the hawkish tone. BTC Performs Better Than S&P 500 Despite Crypto Market Crash Blockchain analytics platform Santiment reported that BTC had shown a greater relative strength in comparison to the drop in the S&P 500. “This can actually be interpreted as a sign of strength once the dust settles over the next 24-48 hours,” noted Santiment. Source: Santiment Also, a majority of the US Bitcoin ETFs registered net outflows including Bitwise’s BITB, Invesco’s BTCO, Ark Invest’s ARKB, and Grayscale’s GBTC amid today’s crypto market crash. However, BlackRock’s IBIT saw a strong $356 million in inflows cancelling the overall negative impact. Despite the current turbulence, crypto market analysts continue to remain positive. Popular economist Alex Kruger wrote: “Next week is Xmas, which may change things. In my book BTC bouncing off 98 and SOL off 195 would be ideal. And then, up only into inauguration. Euphoria and leverage have been largely flushed out from crypto already, which should minimize the downside. Bigger picture unchanged IMO.” Bank of Japan Keeps Interest Rates Unchanged The Bank of Japan maintained its short-term policy rate at -0.1% on Thursday, choosing to monitor wage growth and inflation trends before making any adjustments. The widely expected decision underscores a cautious approach to monetary policy. In response, the yen weakened further, slipping past the critical 155 mark against the dollar, as the central bank refrained from raising borrowing costs. As a result, BTC price bounced back from the lows of under $100K and is currently trading at $101,020 as of press time. As per Coinglass data, the 24-hour BTC liquidations have soared to $148 million with $114 million worth of long liquidations. Altcoins Register Steeper Fall Than Bitcoin Along with the price of Bitcoin down today, altcoins faced an even greater fall with ETH, DOGE, XRP, and SOL all plunging between 5-10%. Other altcoins saw an even greater correction of between 10-20% in today’s crypto market crash. Crypto market data provider Santiment reported significant declines across several major altcoins over the past 24 hours. Avalanche (AVAX), Chainlink (LINK), and Litecoin (LTC) each dropped 16%, while meme coin Pepe (PEPE) fell 17%, reflecting widespread market turbulence. Santiment noted that while the pullback has been sharp, it could present an opportunity for dip buyers. “If this was indeed an overreaction, there is a reasonable chance that the projects with the biggest drops will offer the most attractive buying opportunities,” the report suggested. Well, this total crypto market volatility has led to total crypto market liquidations soaring to $860 million, per the Coinglass data . The 24-hour long liquidations have surged to $684.93M million while $200 million in short liquidations amid the crypto market crash. As CoinGape reported, altcoin season index has come crashing further to 55 leading to speculation of the end of the altcoin season. As per the Blockchain Center data, the altcoin season index is currently at 55, testing the crucial support of 50. Crypto market analysts expect a bounce back from here. Source: Blockchain Center ETH Price Bounces Back from Crucial Support Levels The ETH price crashed nearly 6% but bounced back from the crucial support of $3,550. Crypto analyst IncomeSharks highlighted Ethereum’s resilience amid recent market fluctuations, noting that the Supertrend indicator remains intact and bullish. “Ethereum ($ETH) hasn’t broken its Supertrend, maintaining a bullish outlook,” the analyst stated. “Currently, prices are holding at support levels, and in such conditions, shorting is not advisable.” Source: IncomeSharks XRP Price Rally to Continue Amid Crypto Market Crash? Amid the broader crypto market crash, the XRP price has dropped 6.2% all the way to $2.25. Crypto analyst IncomeSharks has highlighted a critical juncture for XRP as it tests its Supertrend support. “If bulls can defend this Supertrend level and establish a bullish consolidation pattern, it could provide a strong rationale for re-entry,” the analyst noted. Moreover, another analysis predicts XRP price potential rally to $6.

With as little as $100, savvy investors can gain exposure to emerging projects with exponential growth potential. Among these altcoins, FXGuys ($FXG) stands out as the most promising, leading the charge as a Top PropFi Project . Let’s explore FXGuys and four other emerging altcoins that could deliver massive returns in the next bull cycle. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE 1. FXGuys ($FXG): The Future of Trade2Earn and Staking FXGuys is redefining the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape with its unique Trade2Earn model and revolutionary Trader Funding Program . Designed as more than just a token, FXGuys combines trading incentives with a robust staking system, making it the best defi token for investors looking to maximize returns. Staking Rewards : The FXGuys ecosystem rewards investors through high-yield staking programs that generate passive income. Utility-Driven Token : The $FXG token powers the FXGuys platform, offering real-world utility through funding opportunities for traders and yield incentives for holders. Low Entry Price : At just $0.04, FXGuys presents a golden opportunity for investors to enter early and ride the wave of its projected growth. FXGuys has already raised millions during its presale stages, with demand continuing to surge. For investors seeking top defi coins with explosive potential, FXGuys is the leading choice. 2. Raydium (RAY): A Solana Ecosystem Powerhouse Raydium, a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) within the Solana blockchain, offers a combination of low fees and lightning-fast transactions. Its innovative liquidity pools and automated market-making (AMM) features make it a favorite among traders. Why It Stands Out : Raydium integrates with other Solana projects, enhancing its ecosystem value. Growth Potential : With Solana’s resurgence, Raydium could see significant price appreciation. 3. Flow (FLOW): The Go-To Platform for NFTs and Gaming Flow is a high-performance blockchain specifically designed for NFTs, gaming, and consumer applications. Known for powering projects like NBA Top Shot, Flow has earned a solid reputation in the digital asset space. Why It Stands Out : Its scalability and developer-friendly ecosystem make it ideal for mainstream adoption. Growth Potential : As NFT markets rebound, Flow is well-positioned to capitalize on renewed interest. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE 4. Movement (MOVE): A Rising Star in DeFi Movement (MOVE) is an emerging altcoin focused on providing cutting-edge solutions for decentralized finance. With a growing user base and active development, MOVE is quickly gaining momentum. Why It Stands Out : MOVE’s focus on scalable, low-fee DeFi products sets it apart in the competitive market. Growth Potential : Its accessibility and utility make it a strong contender in the high potential altcoins category. 5. Arweave (AR): A Leader in Decentralized Storage Arweave is revolutionizing data storage with its permanent, decentralized storage solutions. As demand for decentralized cloud services grows, Arweave remains one of the most valuable tokens in the space. Why It Stands Out : Arweave’s “permaweb” ensures data is securely stored forever, a unique feature among storage solutions. Growth Potential : Growing enterprise adoption could significantly drive AR’s value in the coming years. Why FXGuys Is Leading the Pack While all these altcoins present strong growth opportunities, FXGuys stands out for its unique combination of trading utility, staking rewards, and a low entry point. Backed by its innovative Trader Funding Program and Trade2Earn model, FXGuys is attracting attention from both retail and institutional investors, positioning it among the best proprietary trading firms and top defi coins of 2024. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE Conclusion With just $100, investors can enter the crypto market and gain exposure to projects like FXGuys ($FXG) , Raydium, Flow, Movement, and Arweave. Each of these altcoins brings unique value to the ecosystem, but FXGuys’ blend of utility, staking, and growth potential makes it the clear frontrunner. For those seeking the next top defi coin or high potential altcoin , FXGuys is the ultimate opportunity to turn a small investment into life-changing returns.

Coinciding with this development, Binance declared its intent to delist WazirX’s native token, WRX , on December 18th, escalating challenges for the exchange. Allegation of Fraud and North Korea Involvement The court’s directive came regarding a cyber attack reportedly from the North Korean hacking group, that was able exploit the vulnerabilities of the intended platform during the period of sJuly 2024. While attempts to recovery the stolen money have been made , only 57 percent of the lost amount could be recovered implying that 43 percent of the stolen customer money is untraceable. It also drew focus to Masud Alam, a man from West Bengal, who was arrested in November. Alam is alleged to have signed up the fake account which was later sold to a hacker through the Telegram platform to affect WazirX. The actual perpetrator of the attack as still on the loose and this increases pressure on the police force to produce good results. Of Binance, Delisting and WRX Impacts The ruling arrived shortly after Binance moved to suspend its WRX listings over the company’s failure to meet the set operational norms. Although Binance, which has always refuted having any ownership stake in WazirX, says the mentioned exchange platform is operating under Indian laws by Zanmai Labs. The delisting due to be implemented on December 25 has already sparked reactions in the market, with the value of WRX falling over 51% as of writing. Regarding operational integrity concerns, investors’ trust in the platform is still declining. A Path to Recovery? Recently WazirX has stated that it intends to relaunch the platform with a focus on better service and increased transparency and has announced its 5th town hall meeting. It has the vision to begin reopening under a recovery-oriented strategy, with the key of forging a new-age DEX. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Here’s What You Should Know,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/has-bitcoin-fallen-into-the-hopium-trap-heres-what-you-should-know/,"The post Has Bitcoin Fallen Into the Hopium Trap? Here’s What You Should Know appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin price has been surging since the start of the quarter and the U.S. election results offered a huge boost to the rally. With this, the price soared effortlessly and marked highs above $108K, marking a fresh ATH. However, what happened next raised some concerns as the price quickly dropped below $100,000 with the Fed Chair comments on the Bitcoin reserve. This suggests the BTC price could be rising with hope but when they are facing reality, it has negatively impacted the price. Does this signal the rise in the BTC price since November is just a hopium? Will the price face a sell-off after Donald Trump resumes office? After the win, Trump had shared his plans of setting up a Bitcoin reserve, which created huge bullish waves across the markets, driving the price to new highs. However, the Fed Chairman, Jerome Powell, recently commented against forming a ‘National Bitcoin Reserve’. He said that the agency is not allowed to own Bitcoin and they have no plans for a law change, responding to a question to know his thoughts on the BTC reserve. In no time, the BTC price dropped really hard, which raises concerns over it’s performance in 2025 after the new president assumes office. What’s Next—Will BTC Price Face a Crash? In the past 24 hours, contracts worth over $400 million have been liquidated, of which longs have liquidated for more than $335 million and shorts for nearly $83 million. This points towards the market participants waiting for a substantial downturn during Donald Trump’s inauguration. The prediction of a likelihood of unfullied investor expectations regarding swift policy reforms is much expected, as citied by Arthur Hayes, CEO of Bitmex. However, these are just speculations, and the real impact is not much distinct with just a month remaining. Besides the rise in spot ETF volumes, MicroStratergy’s growing BTC holdings strengthen hopes of a consistent upswing. As rightly said by a popular analyst, Lark Davis , the Bitcoin price is expected to keep on moving to it’s ATH as Trump is taking office soon. Rate cuts are happening all over the world and the money printer has turned on with cheap capital flowing into the space. Therefore, the analyst believes the market is at the edge of a mega-altseason, setting the stage for an explosive market rally.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-19 06:17:13
