At the same time, Bitcoin maintains a bullish structure above key 50-day ( $114,797 ), 100-day ( $109,975 ), and 200-day ( $102,522 ) EMAs despite testing 20-day EMA resistance at $117,499 , positioning for a potential breakout or deeper correction. ChatGPT’s Bitcoin analysis synthesizes 19 real-time technical indicators to assess BTC’s trajectory amid Treasury policy clarification and consolidation at historically elevated levels around $117K . Technical Analysis: Historic Level Consolidation Tests Key Resistance Bitcoin’s current price of $117,208.67 reflects a modest -0.92% decline from the opening price of $118,295.09 , establishing a tight consolidation range between $119,216.82 (high) and $116,827.29 (low). This 2.0% intraday range shows controlled volatility typical of institutional positioning phases at historic levels. Source: TradingView The RSI at 50.61 sits perfectly neutral, providing balanced momentum without oversold or overbought conditions. Moving averages reveal strong bullish positioning with Bitcoin trading 2.1% above the 50-day EMA at $114,797 , 6.2% above the 100-day EMA at $109,975 , and 12.5% above the 200-day EMA at $102,522 . MACD shows exceptionally strong bullish momentum at 135.68, well above zero, with a signal line at 1,067.32 and a positive histogram at 931.64 . Source: TradingView This momentum strength during price consolidation often precedes major breakout moves, as technical indicators remain bullish despite sideways price action. Volume analysis shows unusually low activity at 9.87K BTC, indicating reduced retail participation while institutions position for the next major move. ATR presents a volatility paradox at 105,232.55 , suggesting massive potential despite current price stability. Market Context: Treasury Clarification Creates Measured Response Bitcoin’s August performance demonstrates resilience following Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s clarification that U.S. Bitcoin acquisitions will be budget-neutral rather than direct government purchases. The measured -0.92% response reflects institutional sophistication in processing policy nuances rather than panic selling. The 2025 trajectory shows remarkable progression from January’s $93,576 opening to the current $117K levels, with strong volatility including February’s dip to $78,258 and July’s peak near $119,447 . Current positioning represents healthy consolidation within this historic bull run. Source: TradingView Current pricing maintains a 5.12% discount to the August 14 all-time high of $124,457 while securing extraordinary gains from historic lows. The proximity to recent peaks demonstrates Bitcoin’s resilience despite policy uncertainty and broader market liquidations affecting other cryptocurrencies. Market Fundamentals: Strong Metrics Support Historic Levels Bitcoin maintains the dominant cryptocurrency position with a $2.33 trillion market cap despite a modest 0.85% decline. The market cap stability accompanies reduced volume of $75.25 billion ( -29.7% ), indicating consolidation rather than distribution as institutional participants await directional clarity. The 3.23% volume-to-market cap ratio suggests measured trading activity typical of consolidation phases at historic levels. Source: CoinMarketCap Circulating supply of 19.9 million BTC represents 94.8% of the maximum 21 million token supply, with approaching scarcity supporting long-term value dynamics. Market dominance of 58.86% ( +1.08% ) demonstrates Bitcoin’s strength relative to altcoins during uncertainty. The fully diluted valuation of $2.45 trillion reflects total network value at current pricing, while the controlled supply mechanism continues to support institutional confidence. The technical fundamentals show Bitcoin trading 240,564,075% above its 2010 low of $0.04865 , with a store of value over 15 years of proven resilience. Social Sentiment: Mixed Signs Amid Policy Uncertainty LunarCrush data reveals cautious social performance with Bitcoin’s AltRank declining to 292 during Treasury policy clarification. A Galaxy Score of 38 reflects a temporary cooling of sentiment as participants process changes to the government’s Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Engagement metrics show substantial activity with 101.05 million total engagements despite a decline and 291.1K mentions ( +108.02K ). Recent social themes focus on institutional accumulation, with Brevan Howard disclosing $2.3 billion in Bitcoin holdings and reports of accumulation demand reaching historic levels.

The 100-day EMA at $109,975 provides major support with strong institutional significance. Key resistance emerges at the 20-day EMA around $117,499 , representing the primary obstacle for bullish continuation. Source: TradingView Breaking this level could trigger momentum toward $119K – $121K targets, while failure might test $114K – $110K support zones. The technical setup suggests a coiled spring formation with low volume, neutral RSI, and extremely strong MACD momentum, creating ideal conditions for a major directional move. Historical patterns indicate such consolidation phases often resolve with substantial volatility matching the extreme ATR potential. Three-Month Bitcoin Price Forecast: Breakout Scenarios Bullish Breakout (50% Probability) Successful break above $117,499 resistance combined with continued institutional adoption could drive Bitcoin toward $119K – $125K , representing 2 – 7% upside from current levels. Source: TradingView This scenario requires volume confirmation and Treasury policy stability. Extended Consolidation (30% Probability) Continued range-bound trading between $114K – $119 K allows technical indicators to reset while institutional positioning continues. Source: TradingView This scenario provides accumulation opportunities near support levels. Correction Testing (20% Probability) A break below $114,797 support could trigger selling toward $119,975 – $110K major support levels, representing 6 – 7% downside before potential recovery acceleration. Source: TradingView ChatGPT’s Bitcoin Analysis: Historic Consolidation Signals Major Move ChatGPT’s Bitcoin analysis reveals Bitcoin at a key inflection point between Treasury policy clarity and technical breakout potential. The consolidation at $117K levels with extremely strong MACD momentum suggests institutional preparation for a significant directional move. Next Price Target: $119K-$125K Within 90 Days The immediate trajectory requires a decisive break above $117,499 resistance to validate bullish continuation toward $119K psychological levels. From there, sustained institutional adoption could propel Bitcoin toward $125K + historic resistance, representing meaningful breakout potential. However, failure to hold $116,827 support would signal a deeper correction to $114K – $110K range, creating an optimal accumulation opportunity before the next institutional wave drives Bitcoin toward cycle highs above $125K .

According to a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, the hedge fund now owns around 37.5 million shares of IBIT. This is worth around $2.3 billion and represents a sizable increase since Q1, when the firm had only 21.56 million shares. With the increase, it now tops a list that includes hundreds of institutional investors ranging from traditional financial institutions to tech companies. Before now, Goldman Sachs was the biggest holder with 30.8 million shares as of the end of the first quarter 2025. At the time, it was valued at $1.4 billion and represented a 28% increase from its holdings at the end of 2024. Interestingly, Goldman Sachs has yet to disclose its most recent holdings in IBIT. So, it is unclear whether it has increased its stake. It would not be a surprise if the firm does, given that it also has a stake in the Fidelity FBTC ETF. Brevan Howard stake highlights the hedge fund’s interest in digital assets. The Jersey-based firm, which has around $40 billion in assets under management (AUM), is considered to be one of the biggest macro hedge funds. It has invested billions into digital assets and blockchain technology products and has a dedicated crypto assets division. More Entities gain and increase exposure to IBIT Meanwhile, Brevan Howard was not the only firm that increased its stake in IBIT during the second quarter of 2025. Based on SEC filings, Hong Kong-based Avenir owned 16.55 million IBIT shares worth over $1 billion as of June 30. This marks an increase from the 14.76 million shares it held back in March. Interestingly, the firm also reported a new IBIT put position worth $12.2 million, but its FBTC position remained at $5.5 million. However, not every firm increased its IBIT holdings. Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala disclosed that its 8.726 million IBIT shares did not increase since the last filing in May. On the other hand, Al Warda Investments, an investment fund that listed Abu Dhabi Investment Council as its manager, disclosed that it owned 2.41 million shares of IBIT worth $147.5 million on June 30. Mubadala owns the Abu Dhabi Investment Council. Nevertheless, the biggest news of exposure to IBIT has been from the Ivy League, with Harvard disclosing that it now has over $117 million stake in IBIT. This is more than the University’s exposure to tech giants such as Google and Nvidia. Several analysts believe it is a watershed moment for the Bitcoin ETFs. According to Macroscope on X, “It’s certainly one of the most important ownership disclosures since the inception of the Bitcoin ETFs. It will have an impact in the endowment space as well as the broader asset management sector.” IBIT hits $90 billion in AUM Meanwhile, the massive interest in IBIT from several institutional investors and sovereign wealth funds drove the BlackRock product to a new peak of over $90 billion AUM. This was enough to make IBIT the 20th largest ETF product out of over 4,400 ETFs in the US. According to the ETF expert, Nate Geraci, this is a massive milestone for IBIT, particularly given that the product achieved this milestone in just 19 months of existence, making it the best-performing ETF by a large margin. IBIT reaches $90 billion in AUM (Source: Nate Geraci) However, the recent decline in BTC prices, which has seen the flagship asset fall to $117,000 from as high as $123,000 on August 14, means that the AUM value might have dropped briefly. Still, there is a general sense of bullishness surrounding IBIT, which is evident in its minimal outflows compared to other Bitcoin ETFs. Farside Investors’ data shows that the product only saw three days of outflows between July 28 and August 14, and Geraci expects the fund to reach $100 billion in AUM soon.

For those keenly observing the intersection of AI and digital economies, particularly within the crypto space, understanding OpenAI’s expansive vision is crucial. It hints at new infrastructures, consumer interfaces, and potentially decentralized applications that could reshape how we interact with technology and, by extension, digital assets. This isn’t just about incremental model improvements; it’s about building a foundational ecosystem for the next era of AI. OpenAI’s Strategic Shift: Moving Beyond GPT-5’s Shadow The recent launch of GPT-5 , while significant, has prompted a broader conversation about OpenAI’s long-term trajectory. Unlike its predecessor, GPT-4, which set new benchmarks, GPT-5’s performance was perceived by some as aligning more closely with competing models from Google and Anthropic. This context, revealed during an exclusive dinner with tech reporters, underscores a pivotal shift in OpenAI’s strategy. The company appears to be less focused on model-centric releases as its primary measure of success and more on integrating AI into everyday life through diverse applications and hardware. This strategic evolution suggests that while foundational models remain critical, OpenAI’s ambition extends far beyond merely developing the ‘best’ AI model. The focus is now firmly on: Consumer Hardware: Developing proprietary AI-powered devices. Enterprise Software: Upending traditional business solutions with AI. Search Innovation: Challenging established search engine paradigms. This expansive vision indicates OpenAI’s intent to become a pervasive force across multiple tech sectors, signaling a maturity in its business model and a drive for broader market penetration. The Dawn of OpenAI’s AI Device: A Hardware Revolution? One of the most intriguing revelations from the evening centered on OpenAI’s foray into consumer hardware. Sam Altman , with a hint of playful defiance regarding phone cases, shared insights into a forthcoming AI device developed in collaboration with Apple veteran Jony Ive. This partnership alone speaks volumes, suggesting a strong emphasis on design, user experience, and seamless integration of AI capabilities into a physical product. The vision is not just about a smart gadget; it’s about creating a device so intuitively designed that users would forgo protective cases to appreciate its original form. This commitment to aesthetic and functional excellence positions OpenAI to directly compete in the consumer electronics market, aiming to deliver a distinct AI-first hardware experience. Such a device could revolutionize how users interact with AI, moving beyond screens and keyboards to more natural, intuitive interfaces. Exploring New Frontiers: Search, Social, and Beyond with OpenAI’s AI Future OpenAI’s ambitions are not confined to hardware. The company is actively exploring new applications that could redefine fundamental digital experiences. With Fidji Simo slated to join as CEO of applications, OpenAI is poised to launch multiple consumer apps beyond ChatGPT. Key areas of interest include: AI-Powered Browser: Reports suggest OpenAI is developing a browser to compete with giants like Chrome. Altman even hinted at a serious consideration for acquiring Chrome if it were ever on the market, a testament to their bold strategic thinking. Innovative Social Media: Altman expressed dissatisfaction with current AI applications in social media, stating a desire to build a “much cooler kind of social experience with AI.” This indicates a potential for entirely new paradigms of online interaction, leveraging AI to foster more meaningful or dynamic social connections. These ventures signify OpenAI’s intent to not just augment existing services but to fundamentally rethink and rebuild core internet functionalities using advanced AI. The potential impact on user data, content creation, and even digital identity could be profound, making these developments highly relevant to the evolving Web3 landscape. Strategic Investments: Sam Altman’s Bets on Brain-Computer Interfaces and More Beyond consumer products, Sam Altman is steering OpenAI towards even more futuristic and foundational investments. He confirmed plans to back Merge Labs, a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup, positioning OpenAI to potentially compete with Elon Musk’s Neuralink. While the exact integration with OpenAI’s models and devices remains to be seen, this move signals a long-term vision that extends into human-computer augmentation and the very interface of thought. Furthermore, OpenAI is making substantial bets in critical infrastructure, including: Data Centers: Ensuring the computational backbone for increasingly complex AI models. Robotics: Exploring the physical manifestation of AI beyond software. Energy: Addressing the immense power demands of advanced AI, potentially through innovative solutions. These investments paint a picture of OpenAI evolving into a sprawling technology conglomerate, akin to Google’s parent company Alphabet, but perhaps with an even broader scope. This diversification is crucial for meeting the massive capital demands that such ambitious projects entail, strongly hinting at an eventual public offering. Conclusion: OpenAI’s Expansive AI Future OpenAI’s recent dinner with reporters revealed a company on the cusp of a profound transformation. Under Sam Altman ‘s leadership, the focus is shifting from being solely a creator of cutting-edge AI models like GPT-5 to becoming a multifaceted technology powerhouse. With ventures into consumer hardware, revolutionary applications in search and social media, and strategic investments in brain-computer interfaces and core infrastructure, OpenAI is charting an ambitious course to shape the next era of technology. This expansive vision, likely paving the way for a future public offering, aims to redefine OpenAI’s identity, moving beyond its foundational models to establish itself as a dominant force across the entire AI ecosystem. For anyone tracking the future of technology and its impact on our digital lives, OpenAI’s trajectory offers a fascinating and critical case study in innovation and strategic expansion.

The latest tariff warnings from the POTUS are part of the United States government’s attempt to bolster domestic manufacturing, which includes imposing heavy duties on specific imports. Trump plans to impose duties on steel and semiconductor chips U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that he will impose tariffs on imports of steel and semiconductor chips in the coming weeks. President Trump first gave a glimpse of his phased plans for the new duties while he was speaking to reporters as he boarded Air Force One on his way to a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. “I’ll be setting tariffs next week and the week after on steel and on, I would say, chips,” Trump said. The president did not provide any specific rates, but he did clarify that the initial tariff rates would start lower to give companies an opportunity to establish or expand manufacturing operations in the United States before higher rates take effect. “I’m going to have a rate that is going to be lower at the beginning – that gives them a chance to come in and build – and very high after a certain period of time,” he said . The president expressed confidence that such a structure would encourage companies to choose domestic production over importing goods at elevated costs. Trump’s semiconductor chip tariff strategy will be phased Trump’s proposal to increase duties on chip imports is on brand with how he has handled perceived problems, including in pharmaceuticals, where steeply increased tariffs followed initially lower figures after a set period. These new tariffs are part of the U.S. government’s ongoing efforts to strengthen domestic manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign supply chains. Trump in February raised tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 25%. He announced in May that the tariff would be doubled to 50% to provide additional support for U.S.-based manufacturers. Regarding semiconductor chips, Trump said last week that a 100% tariff would be applied to imports. However, companies that commit to building manufacturing capacity within the United States would be exempt from the new duties.

Or Could Layer Brett Secure The 150x Meme Supremacy?,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/bnb-price-prediction-800-to-8k-ambition-or-could-layer-brett-secure-the-150x-meme-supremacy/,"BNB has been riding strong momentum, with some traders eyeing bold targets from $800 to $8K in the next market cycle. While these lofty goals fuel excitement, the latest BNB price prediction also comes with questions about sustainability and competition. At the same time, a new meme token, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) , is starting to capture attention in the meme coin scene. It’s in a crypto presale ($0.0042), it blends Ethereum Layer 2 speed, low fees, and massive staking rewards. All this could deliver 150x returns and challenge even BNB. BNB price prediction: Can Binance Coin climb from $800 to $8K? BNB has climbed over 21% in the last 30 days, breaking past $810 and closing in on the $850 resistance level. Strong buying at the $850–$853 support zone, along with higher lows, signals potential institutional accumulation. CEA Industries’ $160 million purchase made it the largest corporate holder of BNB, with other companies adding BNB treasuries. This steady demand, paired with disciplined price action, is fueling optimism that the latest BNB price prediction could target higher milestones, possibly setting the stage for a run toward the $8K dream. Market factors shaping the latest BNB price Several factors are influencing the latest BNB price prediction, starting with ongoing corporate adoption. Big moves like CEA Industries’ $160 million purchase, alongside treasury allocations from Nano Labs and Windtree Therapeutics, are adding credibility and demand. On the technical side, consistent buying pressure near the $800 support level shows strong market confidence. Institutional-style accumulation, higher lows, and successful resistance breaks are all reinforcing a bullish outlook, making the case that BNB could aim for much higher targets in the coming market cycle. Why Layer Brett is coming as the meme coin challenger to BNB Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is a new memecoin that’s seriously challenging BNB’s dominance, at least in terms of potential returns. While BNB’s growth relies on corporate adoption and exchange utility, Layer Brett is built on Ethereum Layer 2, offering faster transactions, lower fees, and huge scalability. Unlike many meme coins, it combines viral community energy with real utility, including staking rewards currently topping 20,000% APY for early buyers. Its fixed supply of 10 billion tokens adds scarcity, while the low presale entry price gives investors a chance at outsized gains. This mix is why some see $LBRETT rivaling even the boldest BNB moves. How $LBRETT’s features and staking rewards set up 150x potential The $LBRETT presale lets investors buy in early at a low cost, before listings drive wider demand. Built on Ethereum Layer 2, it delivers fast transactions, minimal fees, and strong scalability, features that attract both meme coin fans and utility-focused buyers. Early stakers can earn massive rewards, currently over 20,000% APY, making it one of the most lucrative setups in the market. With a fixed 10 billion token supply and growing community hype, these factors together create the foundation for $LBRETT’s bold 150x potential. Conclusion: From BNB price to meme supremacy with Layer Brett While the latest BNB price paints a bullish picture, its market cap leaves limited room for the kind of explosive growth many investors crave. That’s why attention is shifting to Layer Brett ($LBRETT), still in presale, offering staking rewards in the tens of thousands of percent for early participants. This window won’t stay open for long.

SEC Shifts Away From Regulation-By-Enforcement Approach News of Atkins’ latest interviews comes just days after he reaffirmed his dedication to shifting the SEC away from its prior regulation-by-enforcement approach to the blockchain sector . In an August 11 X post, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce praised the agency dropping its case against crypto platform Ripple. “A welcome development for many reasons, including that minds once occupied with litigation now can concentrate on creating a clear regulatory framework for crypto,” Peirce wrote . “Commissioner Peirce is right. With this chapter closed, we now have an opportunity to shift our energy from the courtroom to the policy drafting table,” Atkins said. “Our focus should be on building a clear regulatory framework that fosters innovation while protecting investors.” In short, Atkins’ message is clear: the SEC is shifting gears from fighting crypto in courtrooms to crafting rules that could cement America’s place as the world’s digital asset powerhouse.

Troller Cat (TCAT) — The 26-Stage Presale Turning Meme Culture Into Measured Gains Stage 12 of Troller Cat’s presale, themed “Twitter’s Horse_ebooks – The Poet of Nonsense,” pays homage to a legendary era of internet absurdity. Each of the 26 stages connects to an iconic trolling moment, creating a thematic journey for investors. This creative structure keeps the community engaged while adding collectible appeal to every stage. The presale is currently in Stage 17, priced at $0.00012859, having already raised over $460,000 with more than 1,700 holders. Early investors from Stage 1, when the price was $0.00000500, have seen gains exceeding 2,471%. With a projected listing price of $0.0005309, there’s still a forecasted 312.86% upside for those entering now. Troller Cat’s thematic presale design isn’t just about entertainment; it’s a growth mechanism. Each stage increases the token price, encouraging early action. 69% APY staking rewards reinforce the project’s economics during presale, liquidity locked for two years, and a deflationary buyback-and-burn model funded by ad revenue from its Game Center. How to Join the Troller Cat Presale Before Stage 18 Price Surge Investing in Troller Cat before Stage 18 can lock in the current $0.00012859 price and capture the projected 312% upside to its listing value. The process is quick and can be completed in just a few steps: Visit the official presale page at Trollercat.io. Connect your Web3 wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet recommended). Choose your investment amount; a minimum of $25 unlocks your referral code. Complete the transaction using ETH or USDT. Track your holdings and referral rewards via the live dashboard. Acting before the 10.03% price increase in Stage 18 can significantly boost potential returns. For example, a $2,000 investment at today’s rate could yield approximately 15.54 million TCAT tokens, which may be worth around $8,248 at the projected listing price—before staking and referral bonuses. Shiba Inu (SHIB) — Market Correction After Sustained Rally Shiba Inu’s 7.72% price drop over the past 24 hours, bringing it to $0.00001283, comes after a period of sustained bullish movement that had pushed it into overbought territory on several short-term indicators. This decline appears to be a combination of profit-taking by traders and a slight dip in overall trading volume. The meme coin, known for its massive community and ecosystem expansion, has been working to evolve beyond its origins by integrating DeFi, NFTs, and layer-2 scaling solutions like Shibarium. However, short-term price action still tends to be highly sensitive to speculative sentiment. For Shiba Inu to regain momentum in the near term, it may need either a significant network update, a spike in whale accumulation, or a return of broader meme coin market enthusiasm. Until then, its price could hover near current support levels while traders look for a catalyst. Brett (BRETT) — Pullback After Hitting Resistance Levels Brett’s price has fallen 11.73% in the last day to $0.05538, breaking below a short-term support zone and signalling a shift in momentum. The recent drop followed a rally that tested resistance near $0.062, a level sellers have defended multiple times over the past month. The token, built around a character from the Boys’ Club comic series, has leveraged cultural familiarity and community engagement to fuel rapid growth since launch. However, like many meme coins, its price remains heavily dependent on short-term hype cycles and trading volume surges. If Brett can reclaim the $0.058–$0.060 range and sustain volume above recent averages, it could attempt another push toward its previous highs. For now, technicals point to consolidation, and traders may be watching for signs of accumulation before re-entering in force. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Troller Cat’s current presale offers a combination of narrative-driven engagement, stage-based scarcity, and measurable upside that sets it apart as the Best Crypto to Buy Today. With over $460,000 already raised, a 2,471% ROI for early buyers, and a 312% projected gain still ahead before listing, it presents a structured path for both short-term and long-term growth. While Shiba Inu maintains strong brand recognition and an expanding ecosystem, and Brett enjoys cultural resonance with its fanbase, both are currently in price pullbacks. This makes Troller Cat’s upward presale trajectory even more compelling for investors seeking momentum-backed opportunities. For those looking to act, joining the presale before Stage 18’s price hike could be the optimal move, especially with staking rewards and referral bonuses enhancing potential returns.

Consolidation near key support and resistance levels sets the stage for a potential breakout or breakdown, making the next moves crucial for market momentum. Ascending Triangle Signals Strength Alpha Crypto Signal, in a recent post, highlighted that Bitcoin is currently shaping a textbook ascending triangle pattern on the daily chart — a well-recognized bullish continuation setup. The analyst explained that price action is consolidating just under the horizontal resistance zone at $122,500, while a series of higher lows continues to form along the rising trendline, signaling strong underlying demand. Related Reading: Bull Case For Bitcoin At $300,000 Triggers After Reaching Critical Level The analyst emphasized that as long as BTC holds above the 9 EMA at $118,738 and respects the ascending triangle’s support line, the overall bias remains bullish. These levels are crucial in maintaining the pattern’s structure, and a break below them could shift sentiment in favor of the bears. The persistence of higher lows indicates that buyers are consistently stepping in, preventing significant pullbacks, as indicated on the chart. In conclusion, Alpha Crypto Signal stated that a clean break above the $122,500 resistance, backed by strong volume, could open the door for BTC to push toward a new all-time high. Such a move is likely to confirm the ascending triangle breakout and potentially trigger the next major bullish wave in the market. Bitcoin Stuck Between $112,592 And $123,334 In an X post, X_Crypto, after examining Bitcoin’s action in a 4-hour timeframe, revealed that the flagship asset is currently trading within a defined range between $112,592 and $123,334, as highlighted on the chart. Meanwhile, the price is hovering around $119,106, with local support at $117,445 and the nearest resistance set at $123,334. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Wobbles Below Resistance – Could a Fresh Drop Follow? The analyst noted that above the current range, $124,576 stands out as a key resistance zone. If this level is breached, the next upside target would be $127,272, which could serve as a profit-taking point in a bullish scenario. These levels will be critical in determining the strength of any upward continuation. On the downside, X_Crypto pointed out that a break below $117,445 could open the way for a drop toward $112,592 — the lower boundary of the range and a strong support zone where buyers are likely to step in. This area, the writer stressed, will be pivotal for defending the broader bullish structure. Lastly, indicators on the lower timeframes, as mentioned by X_Crypto, are showing local oversold conditions, hinting at a potential short-term bounce. However, the analyst cautioned that without sustained consolidation above $119,106, selling pressure could persist, limiting any meaningful upside momentum.

Both coins are showing fresh price energy, sparking debates about which could deliver bigger returns in the months ahead. Yet, beyond the spotlight, a hidden crypto gem is quietly building its case for a massive 25x move. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now featured as one of the Best Altcoins to Buy Now. Let us understand why. Cardano and Avalanche in the Spotlight Cardano has been climbing steadily, with price action suggesting $1 could be in sight. Over the past week, ADA has jumped about 20%, catching the attention of chart-watchers. Popular trader Ali posted that Cardano $ADA breaking out! $1.50 in sight, hinting that the coin’s structure supports a bigger run. Cardano price analysis by Ali Avalanche has been no slouch either. The coin recently pushed through the $24 resistance, a level many saw as a key hurdle. Ali also noted , “If Avalanche $AVAX can break past $27, the path to $32 or $37 will be clear.” That target range would put AVAX among the best altcoins to buy for traders looking for a mix of technical clarity and growth potential. Both ADA and AVAX have been featured in countless “best crypto to buy now” lists, but this latest rally has reignited the debate: which has more upside from here? Cardano’s ecosystem strength and Avalanche’s expanding DeFi and gaming activity are both compelling. Yet traders who know the market’s cycles understand that big names aren’t the only place to find life-changing moves. The MAGACOIN FINANCE Pick: A Hidden Crypto Gem With 25x Ambitions Within its latest Best Altcoins to Buy Now coverage, MAGACOIN FINANCE has turned attention toward itself and is quietly setting up for what could be a breakout story. While ADA and AVAX command headlines, this project offers a different angle: low market cap entry and a growing base of early adopters. The idea is simple — high-quality altcoins often deliver their biggest returns before mainstream coverage floods in. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s spotlight aims to put traders in position before that happens. In past features, coins flagged early went on to post triple or even quadruple-digit percentage gains. Both Cardano and Avalanche have clear bullish targets: $1.50 for ADA and $37 for AVAX, according to trader calls. That would give strong returns, but in percentage terms, the hidden crypto gem in MAGACOIN FINANCE’s pick could blow past those figures if it hits its 25x growth goal. Final Word: The Big Players and the Sleeper Bet Cardano’s push toward $1.50 and Avalanche’s charge beyond $27 are exciting developments for the altcoin scene. They’re among the best altcoins to buy for traders seeking strength backed by proven ecosystems. But the more explosive potential may lie in the shadows, with a hidden crypto gem poised for a run that could reshape its place in the market. MAGACOIN FINANCE combines early positioning, strong growth signals, and an under-the-radar status that could make it one of the best crypto to buy now for those chasing high-risk, high-reward plays.

50152548,557922,1755298833,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50152548.jpeg,Looming Bitcoin Security Budget Crisis Is Fake — Expert Buries FUD,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-security-budget-crisis-is-fake/,"Pierre Rochard, VP of Research at Riot Platforms, one of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies and CEO of The Bitcoin Bond Company says the most persistent narrative about Bitcoin’s long-term security—an alleged “budget shortfall” as block subsidies decline—is built on a category error. In a series of posts on X today, August 15, he argues that critics conflate the rules of Bitcoin with the economics of settlement finality, and in doing so miss how the fee market, user controls, miner competition, and difficulty adjustments interact to raise the cost of attacks precisely when it matters. Bitcoin’s Security Budget Problem Is Solved “Bitcoin’s ‘security budget’ is often framed by altcoiners as a looming shortfall as block subsidies halve,” Rochard wrote. “That framing mixes two different things. The rules of Bitcoin (eg 21 million cap , validity of transactions, block weight limits) are secured by full nodes and private keys. Miners don’t set or change those rules; they only propose blocks that fit within them. What mining buys is settlement finality: how costly it is to censor or reorder recent blocks.” The question, in his view, is not whether a fixed pot of money exists to pay for security, but whether the network can make reorgs and censorship uneconomic as the subsidy shrinks. He rejects the notion—common in cross-chain comparisons—that Bitcoin’s “security budget” is a static paycheck. “Contrary to what Ethereum influencers claim, Bitcoin’s budget for finality is NOT a fixed paycheck; it’s a market price that rises when needed.” When marginal miners shut off after a halving, blocks slow temporarily and difficulty adjusts. When confirmations become scarce or unreliable, fee rates climb as users compete for inclusion. “At 1,000 sats/vB across ~1,000,000 vB, a single block’s fees are about 10 BTC—often more than the subsidy,” he noted, pointing back to “fee blow-offs in 2017 and 2021, and in May 2023 multiple blocks where fees alone exceeded the subsidy.” In practice, he says, miners “respond by filling blocks to capture those fees, not by leaving money on the table.” A large part of Rochard’s case is that users are not passive. Tools like Replace-By-Fee and Child-Pays-For-Parent allow wallets and receivers to “rebroadcast transactions with higher fees or attach a high-fee child to an unconfirmed parent, instantly elevating inclusion priority.” That routing of rewards, he argues, “concentrates [them] on blocks that confirm parents and makes omitted transactions a bounty for whichever miner defects from any censoring or undercutting strategy.” Mining pool competition operationalizes the game theory: “when fees are rich and visible, each pool has a dominant incentive to defect first and claim them now, collapsing any cartel that tries to suppress or sequence transactions for nefarious purposes.” If attacks persist, he adds, receivers can raise the number of confirmations required for high-value transfers, stretching the attacker’s time and energy budget while urgent senders bid up fees to start the clock immediately. “These logical user-side controls ensure that any sustained attack must burn growing resources against rising rewards for the honest chain.” His synthesis: “nodes lock the rules; difficulty adjustments re-equilibrate participation; the fee market prices scarce blockspace on demand; RBF/CPFP and mining pool competition route revenue to the parent-confirming chain; and confirmation policy dials assurance as high as needed.” From his perspective, the empirical record—“fee spikes during stress, miners maximizing fee inclusion, and rapid reversion to normal once backlogs clear”—already demonstrates the dynamic. “As subsidy declines, fees don’t have to be permanently high; they need to be responsive when finality is under threat. That responsiveness is exactly what we observe.” Could BTC Miners Be Bribed? Addressing a related meme—that Bitcoin would need a “bribe oracle” to know when to match an attacker’s payoff—Rochard says the premise is wrong. “Short answer: there is no ‘bribe oracle,’ and you do not need one. The network does not try to divine the bribe’s size. It sets a visible bounty for honest behavior and lets miners choose the higher expected payoff.” In his framing, “public bounty beats secret promise.” During censorship or a reorg attempt, wallets and receivers raise fees on the suppressed transactions, creating a pot that is “publicly visible and immediately collectible by the first miner who confirms the parent.” By contrast, “the bribe… is private, uncertain, and typically conditional on multi-party success. Rational miners compare a sure payout now to a risky off-chain IOU later.” Crucially, “you do not need to match the bribe, only its risk-adjusted value,” because any private offer is discounted by enforcement uncertainty, reputational and legal risk, and the probability a coalition fails when someone defects. The fee bounty “auto-scales without an oracle” as backlogs grow and users rebid; “every miner sees the same mempool price signals and can defect at any moment to take the pot.” That incentive makes “cartels brittle,” since “the first pool to break ranks earns the high fees and ends the attack,” forcing any briber to keep paying more parties as defections loom. And to sustain a 51% campaign , “bribes must be repeated, not one-off… for as long as users keep raising confirmations and fees.” The only truly “trustless” bribe, he says, is an on-chain one—“which is just a very large fee attached to a specific block outcome”—and that “collapses back into the public fee market.” The exchange drew a challenge from an Ethereum community member, who argued that Rochard’s logic “only works if the attacker is censoring,” and raised concerns about double-spends, “chaos sowing,” ASIC-level compromises, and pool collusion. Rochard separated two categories—“‘censoring forever’” versus “causing chaos for a while”—and argued neither is “easy or one-way.” Threats Of A Reorg On censorship and shallow reorgs, he reiterated that “with ~51 percent an attacker can try to exclude targets or reorg shallow history,” but as supply of confirmations drops, “urgent users rebid with RBF or CPFP, and the next parent-confirming block becomes very valuable. A single block at 1,000 sats per vB on ~1,000,000 vB pays about 10 BTC in fees. That visible bounty gives every non-attacking pool a dominant incentive to defect.” On double-spends and turbulence, he pointed to real-world behavior: “Exchanges and large receivers already raise confirmation counts when reorg risk rises… pushing a would-be attacker into a long, expensive campaign rather than a quick hit.” Colluding pools, he argued, face a payout-competition problem—“A colluding pool that omits high-fee transactions underpays its own hashers and quickly bleeds hashrate to rivals. Miners can repoint hash within minutes”—and he highlighted protocol-level trends that reduce coordination power: “Stratum v2 job negotiation further reduces pool-level control by letting miners choose their own templates, which makes coordinated censorship even harder to sustain.” On hardware compromise scenarios, Rochard framed them as throughput shocks rather than rule failures: “A large outage would slow blocks for a few epochs, then difficulty steps down and unaffected miners earn more. The outage also produces the same fee spike and defection incentives that pull additional hash online.” So-called “vampire” attacks like on Monero this week that redirect external compute are, in his view, “much harder on Bitcoin than on small CPU- or GPU-mined coins,” because “Bitcoin’s SHA-256 hash is mostly tied up in dedicated ASICs already mining BTC,” leaving no cheap, massive rental pool that can be quietly redirected. The upshot is that any credible, sustained attack would require “majority hash, unwavering cartel discipline despite a rising fee bounty for defection, exchanges that refuse to raise confirmations, and users who refuse to rebid,” plus a price crash large enough to outpace the attacker’s burn rate. “That stack of assumptions runs against how miners, exchanges, and users actually behave.” His bottom line compresses the argument into one sentence: “Bitcoin does not assume miners are altruists. It assumes they are paid to end your attack.” In Rochard’s telling, tip attacks reduce the supply of confirmations, users with money at stake raise fees, non-attacking miners defect to capture them, receivers lengthen confirmation windows, and difficulty resets the baseline. The “security budget problem,” on this view, is not a hole to be plugged with perpetual inflation but “a market process that scales up the cost of attacks precisely when it matters.” At press time, BTC traded $117,746.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin security|Bitcoin Security Budget|btc|BTC news|btc price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MINING|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-15 23:00:33

The firm says that total is about 30 times the combined lifetime mobile spending of rivals Claude, Copilot, and Grok. This year alone, the iOS and Android app has brought in $1.35 billion through July, a 673% jump from the $174 million recorded over January to July 2024. Average monthly spending now sits near $193 million, up from roughly $25 million a month last year. Competitors are far behind. Grok, the closest of the group, has taken in about $25.6 million so far in 2025. Its monthly consumer spending averages an estimated $3.6 million, equal to 1.9% of ChatGPT’s. These tallies reflect only mobile app store sales. They don’t include subscriptions bought on the web or other revenue, such as money from APIs used by companies and developers. Even so, the numbers offer a look at how consumers are finding and paying for AI assistants on their phones. Grok arrived later than ChatGPT, launching in November 2023. At first, it was part of X, not as a stand-alone app. Grok released its own iOS app in early January 2025 and landed on Google Play on March 4. Appfigures also looked at what users spend per download over the apps’ lifetimes. ChatGPT stands at $2.91 globally, compared with $2.55 for Claude, $0.75 for Grok, and $0.28 for Copilot. The U.S. is ChatGPT’s most valuable market In U.S. ChatGPT’s spending per download reaches $10, and the country makes up 38% of the app’s total revenue to date. Germany is second, with a 5.3% share. ChatGPT also leads on installs. It has an estimated 690 million lifetime downloads worldwide, versus 39.5 million for Grok. These numbers are the reason behing the complaints from X owner Elon Musk about the App Store’s charts and ChatGPT’s position there. Musk has threatened legal action , alleging Apple has made it “impossible” for apps to compete with OpenAI on the store. He also called OpenAI CEO Sam Altman a “liar” after Altman said Musk uses his platform to “benefit himself and his own companies.” Apple has rejected Elon Musk’s claims that the App Store suppresses competition, saying it is “designed to be free and fair of bias.” In 2025 so far, the app has been installed 318 million times, or 2.8 times the 113 million seen in the same period last year. By installs, India ranks first with 13.7% of lifetime downloads, while the U.S. holds second with 10.3%. As reported by Cryptopolitan just a week ago, Sam Altman played down Elon Musk in a live TV appearance , saying he barely thinks about him, just hours after OpenAI’s system beat Musk’s Grok in a chess tournament. Speaking on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Altman was asked about Musk’s latest criticism of OpenAI and replied, “You know, I don’t think about him that much.” He added “I thought he was just, like, tweeting all day [on X] about how much OpenAI sucks, and our model is bad, and, you know, [we’re] not gonna be a good company and all that.” The exchange followed an announcement a day earlier from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella that OpenAI’s newest model, GPT-5, will be built into Microsoft 365 Copilot, GitHub Copilot, Azure AI Foundry, and the standalone Copilot. Musk answered on X with a prediction that “OpenAI is going to eat Microsoft alive.” Nadella replied, “People have been trying for 50 years, and that’s the fun of it! Each day you learn something new, and innovate, partner, and compete.” He also gave a nod to Musk’s Grok 4 chatbot, noting it is already on Azure in a limited preview.

But while Chainlink , Litecoin , and Toncoin continue to generate headlines, savvy investors are quietly accumulating a lesser-known gem with massive upside — MAGACOIN FINANCE — now considered one of the top altcoins to watch before the next altseason hits. Bitcoin’s $200K Target Fuels Altseason Hype Bitcoin skyrocketed to $124,002 on August 14, 2025, surpassing its previous peak indefinitely, and the market’s sentiment was that the Fed would cut its rates, an executive order pro-crypto is going to be announced, and 401(k) crypto adoption under the Trump administration setting in. The BTC rally was on such a level that Bitcoin ETFs, in particular, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, attracted over $29 billion in institutional inflows YTD. Altcoin Season Chart: Blockchaincenter However, a wait was just for a short period after the release of hotter-than-expected inflation data but analysts remain quite optimistic with their forecasts targeting $200,000 in the next few months. But here’s the key takeaway: historically, when Bitcoin dominance peaks and ETF flows stabilize, capital starts to rotate. That means altcoin season is next — and it’s time to stack the best altcoins to buy before the breakout. Chainlink, Litecoin & Toncoin: Strong Contenders, Limited Upside? LINK made a big leap 12% to $23.72 after the announcement of the on-chain reserve expansion and partnership with ICE to provide data feeds of institutional-grade. Chainlink has gone beyond strong with more than $740 million of whale accumulation and solid regulatory compliance. But with LINK already near $24–$25 resistance , short-term upside may be modest. Meanwhile, despite ETF delays, Litecoin remains a favorite among institutions — with MEI Pharma allocating $100M in LTC for treasury reserves. Real-world usage is booming too: LTC accounts for over 14.5% of all crypto payments on CoinGate. However, LTC is battling strong resistance at $134 , and unless it breaks out soon, price action may stay range-bound. On the other hand, TON is riding bullish momentum from Telegram integration , Binance spot trading , and a $558M investment from VERB. It’s now testing resistance near $3.42–$3.75 , with further upside possible — but risk remains if breakout levels aren’t cleared. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Breakout Altcoin of 2025 While the market watches Chainlink, Litecoin, and Toncoin, early investors are piling into MAGACOIN FINANCE — a rising altcoin that could deliver life-changing returns during this next crypto cycle. Large Bitcoin holders, often referred to as whales, are steadily increasing their MAGACOIN FINANCE holdings ahead of the expected market rotation into altcoins. This move signals growing confidence in MAGACOIN’s potential. As the market shifts from Bitcoin dominance to altcoin momentum, these early whale entries could indicate a major breakout is coming. With Bitcoin showing signs of consolidation, capital is rotating to top altcoins to watch . MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the low-cap, high-upside profile that whales and early adopters target before parabolic runs. Final Thoughts Bitcoin may dominate the headlines, but if history repeats, altcoins will dominate the returns. Smart investors are now positioning into the best altcoins to buy before altseason — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is climbing to the top of that list. While Chainlink, Litecoin, and Toncoin offer solid plays, they can’t match the raw upside potential of MAGACOIN’s early-stage advantage. Bitcoin set the stage. The altcoin rotation is next. If you’re looking for top altcoins to watch , and want the chance to ride the next bullish wave , MAGACOIN FINANCE is your opportunity. The window to buy low and multiply your portfolio could close fast — especially once MAGACOIN hits exchanges or gets picked up by influencers and crypto media.

50153659,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78616,1755300611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Legend Patrick Bet-David Says XRP Could Reach $1,000 Under This SWIFT Condition",https://timestabloid.com/legend-patrick-bet-david-says-xrp-could-reach-1000-under-this-swift-condition/,"Cryptocurrency enthusiast Jack the Rippler has shared comments from American businessman and media personality Patrick Bet-David suggesting that XRP could potentially reach a price of $1,000 under certain hypothetical conditions. Patrick made the statement during a discussion in which Bet-David considered what could happen if XRP were to replace existing global payment systems such as SWIFT and FedNow. In the video captioned in the tweet, Bet-David began by noting that XRP was an asset worth paying attention to, particularly for those who might not be actively involved in cryptocurrency trading. He introduced the scenario by stating that if XRP were to replace SWIFT, and possibly FedNow, the implications for its demand and market value could be significant. Bet-David highlighted XRP Ledger’s ability to process transactions in three to five seconds at minimal cost, contrasting this with SWIFT, which he noted processes $5 trillion daily or $1.25 quadrillion annually. He suggested that if XRP were to capture even 10% of SWIFT’s annual transaction volume , that would amount to $125 trillion in volume processed through the XRP Ledger each year. He then referred to analyst estimates, stating that a $10 trillion market capitalization could push XRP’s price to $100 per token . Extending this logic, Bet-David said that full replacement of SWIFT could theoretically drive the price as high as $1,000 per XRP. While acknowledging that such outcomes could also apply to other competing technologies, he framed the example in the context of XRP’s speed and cost efficiency compared to traditional financial networks.

They stated that while the $1,000 price target for XRP is theoretically possible under extreme conditions such as complete replacement of SWIFT and massive demand growth, these circumstances are unlikely to materialize soon. They emphasized that the scenario described by Bet-David is more of a speculative extreme rather than a realistic short-term projection based on current market conditions. The commenter stressed that long-term price stability and growth for XRP will depend on measurable utility and widespread adoption, rather than relying on singular hypothetical events. Bet-David’s comments add to ongoing discussions within the cryptocurrency community regarding the potential market impact of blockchain-based payment solutions if they were to displace existing financial infrastructure. The hypothetical scenario outlined in the video assumes both a substantial shift in the global financial system and a significant concentration of transaction volume through the XRP Ledger. While analysts agree that such developments would substantially increase demand for XRP, most also caution that adoption on this scale involves regulatory, technical, and institutional hurdles that are unlikely to be resolved in the immediate future.

The index fell 0.29% to close at 6,449.80, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.40%, ending the session at 21,622.98. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the only one in green, closing at 44,946.12 after rising 0.08%, or 34.86 points, with most of that push coming from one stock; UnitedHealth. This came after a solid week across the board. Traders were cashing out some of their winnings. But Friday’s weakness wasn’t just about profit-taking. Chips were bleeding. Applied Materials plunged 14%, dragging the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) down 2%. Even Nvidia dipped close to 1%, which is pretty rare after weeks of AI-fueled hype. But consumer confidence took a hit too, with the University of Michigan’s index for August dropping to 58.6, down from 61.7 last month, mostly because people are still freaking out over inflation. UnitedHealth rockets after Buffett, Burry, Tepper pile in The only reason the Dow didn’t completely fall apart was because UnitedHealth Group ripped higher. The healthcare giant gained 12%, its best day since March 2020, after a bunch of heavyweight investors threw serious money behind it. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway bought 5 million shares, worth around $1.6 billion, as shown in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That news alone sent the stock flying. Shortly after, Michael Burry, the same guy who called the housing crash, and David Tepper from Appaloosa Management both disclosed new positions in UnitedHealth in their own SEC filings. That much money flowing into a single company in one day? Obvious reaction. It pushed the Dow Jones to an intraday record before it slipped back down. The company, often viewed as a benchmark for the health sector, became the entire story of the day. Valuation concerns rise as S&P trades near dotcom levels Away from all that, the rest of the stock market looks like it’s walking straight into another bubble. Bank of America’s Michael Hartnett warned that the S&P 500 is now trading at 5.3 times its price-to-book ratio, which is higher than the reading from March 2000, right before the dotcom mess collapsed everything. That valuation has only been seen during the late 90s, when everyone thought the internet would make them rich forever. “It better be different this time,” Michael said in a note sent Thursday. The difference now? AI stocks like Nvidia are getting flooded with investor cash, and everyone’s hanging onto every inflation report, hoping it means the Federal Reserve will cut rates soon. The latest data this week revived that hope. But not everyone thinks a rate cut will hurt the banks. Barclays strategist Venu Krishna said on Friday that the financial sector doesn’t always crash when rates fall. He said, “Falling rates are not a headwind for the sector unless the central bank is cutting into a recession. Earnings and valuations are supportive.” He also pointed to possible deregulation and mergers as reasons why the sector still looks strong. That view didn’t stop Buffett from trimming down his holdings in Bank of America, though. His firm sold 26.3 million shares in the second quarter, dropping Berkshire’s ownership down to 8.1%. But Piper Sandler analysts don’t see that as a big deal. They noted that Bank of America has been buying back more stock than Buffett is offloading. “The market is hopefully attuned to the regular sales,” they said. “BAC’s solid capital position means that it has the wherewithal to buy back every Q significantly more stock than Berkshire is selling… Thus, the practical impact of Berkshire’s sales should be negligible.” But the market’s strength is all riding on a bunch of assumptions. If inflation cools more, if the Fed cuts, if AI names keep climbing, if nobody pulls the plug. Big “ifs” everywhere. Get seen where it counts.

Filan has reported that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed a status report with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in its case against Ripple Labs Inc., along with related defendants. According to Filan, the filing states that the parties have submitted a Joint Stipulation of Dismissal for both the SEC’s appeal and Ripple’s cross-appeal, with the stipulation still pending and awaiting approval by the Court. The status report, dated August 15, 2025, references prior court orders from April 16, 2025, and June 16, 2025, which required updates on the matter. The SEC’s filing confirms that both sides have agreed to dismiss their respective appeals , with each party responsible for its legal costs and fees. The court documents list Ripple Labs Inc. as Defendant-Appellee-Cross-Appellant, with company executives Bradley Garlinghouse and Christian A. Larsen named as Defendants-Appellees.

Filan (@FilanLaw) August 15, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Reason for the Filing A community member, identified as Sherrie, provided further context to Filan’s update. She explained that the status report was filed because the Court of Appeals has not yet approved the joint stipulation of dismissal. She attributed the delay in approval to the summer period, suggesting that procedural timelines have been slower. Sherrie noted that the SEC was obligated to file the report before the end of the day, which explains the late-day filing. She further stated that if the Court of Appeals had approved the stipulation earlier that day, the SEC would not have been required to file the status report at all. Approval Process Sherrie also clarified that the approval of the joint stipulation is a procedural formality. The Court of Appeals must grant it, not Judge Analisa Torres, who presided over the case in the district court. The stipulation, once approved, would formally end both the SEC’s appeal and Ripple’s cross-appeal, bringing this phase of the litigation to a close. Given the filing and the agreement between the parties, the conclusion of the appeals process now appears contingent solely on the administrative completion of this approval step by the Court of Appeals.

TRX has cooled after its summer climb, stabilizing near $0.34, where traders watch for a breakout or deeper pullback. Meanwhile, the Hyperliquid price prediction has some market watchers locked on a $100 goal, driven by record revenue and growing daily volumes. But away from the charts, BlockDAG (BDAG) is carving a path toward long-term dominance through a completely different strategy. Its expanding Ambassador Program, rewarding 25% referrals, and global-level sports collaborations are turning it into a heavyweight contender for best crypto platform status. With $374 million raised so far and momentum still building, BDAG’s approach combines community power, incentive-driven growth, and mainstream visibility to set a foundation that could endure beyond market cycles. TRX Defends $0.34 Support Level TRON’s climb from $0.27 in July has now stalled at a decisive point, just under $0.34. Price action around $0.3367 has become a tug-of-war between bullish continuation and potential retracement. The level isn’t just psychological; it’s tied to past resistance and marks a major battleground for traders. A firm close above $0.34 could push TRX toward $0.36 and $0.38. Meanwhile, the $0.312–$0.315 support band has repeatedly absorbed selling pressure, giving bulls a safety net during pullbacks. However, if momentum slips, a retreat toward $0.31 or even the earlier $0.27 base is on the table. Whether TRX extends July’s rally or stalls will depend on buyers’ ability to defend this zone and keep short-term sentiment alive. HYPE Price Eyes $100 in Ongoing Rally Hyperliquid’s structure is holding strong after transforming its $38–$40 breakout level into a steady support base. The 20-day EMA remains a dynamic floor, while the mid-range RSI leaves space for more upside without triggering overbought signals. Next, analysts are watching $44–$45 as the resistance to clear. A breakout here could see moves toward $50 and $65 before attempting the bigger $100 milestone in line with its bullish channel. Performance on-chain matches the chart’s promise. July brought record monthly trading volumes and $87.73M in network revenue, even outpacing Solana. This mix of technical strength and robust liquidity gives weight to the idea that HYPE’s triple-digit talk isn’t just empty speculation. Inside BDAG’s Community Powerhouse Strategy! Where TRX and HYPE play in the arena of price patterns, BlockDAG is focused on building an ecosystem designed to last. Now in Batch 29 at $0.0276 with a confirmed $0.05 launch price, BDAG has already sold 24.7 billion coins and brought in $374 million, making it one of the most well-funded presale-stage projects in recent memory. At its core is the BlockDAG Ambassador Program, an active leadership track that equips members with tools, recognition, and real opportunities. From early update access to exclusive BDAG gear and entry into private strategic channels, ambassadors gain visibility and influence. Top performers can host official events, take on leadership roles, and represent BDAG at global blockchain events, providing a direct link to the Web3 space. The referral system strengthens this further, with 25% commission for referrers and 5% bonuses for those they bring in, fueling growth through community-driven momentum. Sports collaborations with the Seattle Orcas (Major League Cricket) and Seattle Seawolves (Major League Rugby) extend BDAG’s reach into mainstream entertainment, offering fan coins, NFTs, and exclusive media experiences that bring the brand into the real world. Together, these pillars, community leadership, incentivized growth, and cultural partnerships, form a long-term expansion plan that’s far bigger than short-term hype. The Bottom Line TRON’s test of $0.34 and Hyperliquid’s pursuit of $100 are compelling in their own right, but they hinge heavily on market action. BlockDAG is charting a different course, anchoring its growth in leadership programs, reward-driven expansion, and sports-backed visibility. With $374 million already raised, a favorable Batch 29 entry at $0.0276, and a clear $0.05 launch price on the horizon, BDAG is showing how a mix of community power and strategic branding can make a platform stand out. For those seeking projects with more than just quick price action, BlockDAG’s model offers a vision built for staying power.

Polygon’s MATIC is also heating up, with analysts calling it a hidden crypto gem and even a potential 30x crypto opportunity in the next market cycle. Both coins are drawing interest for different reasons—DOGE for its whale inflows and cultural reach, MATIC for its growing Web3 footprint. In the middle of this, MAGACOIN Finance is emerging as a rising star, with some market watchers predicting up to 35x gains before the cycle’s peak. Dogecoin and Polygon Gain Investor Attention Dogecoin is back in the spotlight after an intense wave of accumulation by large holders. In Q3 2025 alone, whales added around 2 billion DOGE to their positions, valued between $480 million and $500 million. This scale of buying has not been seen in months and signals growing conviction among big-money players. Dogecoin whale activity: Data from Perplexity On-chain activity shows whale transactions over $1 million have surged past 100 in a short span. These inflows suggest that institutional and high-net-worth traders see DOGE as one of the best crypto to buy now, especially with renewed community engagement and growing merchant adoption. Polygon is also making waves. The network’s focus on scalability and low-cost transactions has kept MATIC near the top of analyst watchlists. With upcoming infrastructure upgrades and a growing DeFi presence, Polygon is being tipped as a hidden crypto gem. Some analysts are even calling it a 30x crypto opportunity over the next cycle, pointing to its expanding NFT integrations and increasing role in gaming ecosystems. MAGACOIN Finance’s Bold 35x Target Analyst consensus is building around MAGACOIN Finance as a high-growth contender in the next bull cycle. Projections suggest that MAGACOIN could deliver up to 35x gains before the peak of this run, driven by its unique positioning and community-focused approach. The project’s growth plan involves combining established crypto appeal with innovative token mechanics that reward early backers. Where DOGE draws strength from whale inflows and MATIC rides the expansion of Polygon’s ecosystem, MAGACOIN Finance is aiming to carve its own niche as the best crypto to buy now for traders seeking early-stage upside. Final Take – DOGE, MATIC, and MAGACOIN in the Spotlight The surge in Dogecoin whale inflows reflects renewed interest from deep-pocketed players, positioning DOGE as a short-to-mid-term mover. Polygon’s MATIC, on the other hand, continues to stand out as a hidden crypto gem that could become a major crypto opportunity given its expanding role in Web3 applications. For traders weighing their options, DOGE brings market reach, MATIC offers strong fundamentals, and MAGACOIN provides speculative high-upside potential. In a market that rewards both hype and innovation, holding a mix of these could prove to be a strategic move.

This outcome immediately sent ripples through various sectors, raising questions about future geopolitical tensions and their potential effects on global markets, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. For investors and enthusiasts alike, understanding these broader implications is crucial for navigating the evolving global economic outlook . What Happened at the Trump Putin Press Conference ? The joint press conference involving U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin was highly anticipated. Many observers hoped for a breakthrough, particularly concerning ongoing international conflicts or diplomatic resolutions. However, the event concluded without any formal declaration of a ceasefire or significant de-escalation of existing issues. This absence of a clear resolution signals a continuation of the complex relationship between these two major global powers. The direct implications are felt across diplomatic circles and global economic forecasts. How Do Geopolitical Tensions Create Ripple Effects? The ongoing state of geopolitical tensions following the press conference is a significant factor for global markets. When major world powers do not find common ground, it often leads to increased uncertainty. This uncertainty can manifest in several ways, directly influencing the global economic outlook : Economic Policy Shifts: Governments might re-evaluate trade agreements or sanctions. Investor Sentiment: Fear or caution can replace optimism, leading to capital flight from riskier assets. Commodity Prices: Energy and other resource prices can fluctuate based on perceived supply chain stability. This interconnectedness means that political outcomes directly influence financial landscapes worldwide, impacting overall market stability . How Does This Event Affect Market Stability and Global Finance? The lack of a ceasefire announcement directly influences overall market stability . Traditional financial markets, such as stocks and bonds, often react swiftly to such news. Increased geopolitical uncertainty typically leads to: Stock Market Volatility: Major indices may experience declines as investors pull back. Safe-Haven Demand: Assets like gold, U.S. Treasury bonds, and sometimes even stablecoins within crypto, see increased demand. Currency Fluctuations: Major fiat currencies can strengthen or weaken depending on their perceived safety or exposure to geopolitical risks. These reactions are a direct reflection of investor confidence in the global economic outlook , and they often precede shifts in digital asset valuations. Can Cryptocurrency Resilience Be Tested in Uncertain Times? How does this impact cryptocurrency resilience ? Digital assets, while often seen as uncorrelated, are not entirely immune to global events. In times of heightened geopolitical tensions , two scenarios often play out for crypto, testing its inherent market stability : Initial Sell-off: Like traditional markets, crypto can see an initial dip as investors liquidate assets across the board. Long-term Safe Haven? Some cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are sometimes viewed as a hedge against traditional financial instability or inflation. This perception can lead to renewed interest if the broader economic outlook remains uncertain. The decentralized nature of many cryptocurrencies means they are not tied to any single government’s policies, offering a unique appeal during times of international friction. How Does This Event Shape the Global Economic Outlook ? The outcome of the Trump Putin Press Conference is a key data point shaping the broader global economic outlook . The absence of a ceasefire means that certain conflicts or diplomatic impasses may continue, affecting international trade, supply chains, and investment flows. For the cryptocurrency sector, this implies potential impacts on cryptocurrency resilience : Regulatory Scrutiny: Governments might increase focus on digital assets, particularly concerning their use in cross-border transactions. Innovation Drivers: Geopolitical pressure can also spur innovation in decentralized finance (DeFi) as individuals seek alternatives to traditional systems. Adoption Trends: Regions facing economic or political instability might see increased adoption of cryptocurrencies for remittances or wealth preservation. These dynamics highlight the evolving relationship between geopolitics and digital finance. The recent Trump Putin Press Conference concluded without a ceasefire, leaving a notable mark on the global stage. This outcome underscores persistent geopolitical tensions , directly influencing market stability across traditional and digital asset classes. While initial reactions might include volatility, the event also highlights the potential for cryptocurrency resilience as a unique asset class in an uncertain world. Understanding these complex interconnections is vital for navigating the evolving global economic outlook . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why was the Trump Putin Press Conference significant for global markets? A1: The conference was significant because it was a key moment for potential de-escalation of international tensions. The absence of a ceasefire announcement signaled continued geopolitical uncertainty, directly impacting investor sentiment and market stability. Q2: How do geopolitical tensions generally affect traditional financial markets? A2: Geopolitical tensions typically lead to increased market volatility, potential declines in stock markets, and a heightened demand for traditional safe-haven assets like gold and government bonds, as investors seek to protect capital. Q3: Is cryptocurrency immune to geopolitical events? A3: While often seen as decentralized, cryptocurrency is not entirely immune. Initial reactions to major geopolitical events can cause price fluctuations. However, some cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, are increasingly viewed as potential hedges against traditional financial instability in the long term. Q4: What is the meaning of “cryptocurrency resilience” in this context? A4: “Cryptocurrency resilience” refers to the ability of digital assets to withstand or even thrive amidst external shocks, such as geopolitical instability or economic downturns, potentially offering an alternative to traditional financial systems. Q5: How might the global economic outlook influence crypto regulation? A5: An uncertain global economic outlook, often driven by geopolitical events, might prompt governments to increase scrutiny on cryptocurrencies, particularly concerning cross-border transactions and financial stability, leading to new regulatory frameworks. Q6: Did the Trump Putin Press Conference directly mention cryptocurrencies? A6: No, the original report on the Trump Putin Press Conference did not directly mention cryptocurrencies. The article discusses the broader implications of such high-level geopolitical events on global finance, including the crypto market.

50154671,557961,1755302426,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50154671.jpeg,Was The Ripple Vs. SEC Lawsuit Just A Distraction? Pundit Claims US Government Owns XRPL,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-sec-lawsuit-distraction/,"Crypto analyst Pumpius has sparked a debate after claiming the long-running Ripple vs. SEC case was never an actual fight, but a carefully staged distraction. He says the fintech company and its backers crafted the “David vs. Goliath” image of battling U.S. regulators to hide its fundamental mission, building U.S.-backed global payment rails under the cover of regulatory conflict. The SEC Case Was A Smokescreen For Government-Backed Expansion Pumpius argues that Ripple was never the outsider many believed it to be. From the beginning, it built its technology for banks and institutions, not retail traders or hobbyists. It offered near-zero fees, instant settlement, and compliance with the ISO 20022 messaging standard before it was even required, the kind of features built for large-scale financial infrastructure. He says this is not the profile of a garage startup fighting the system, but of a network designed to replace SWIFT, the global payments messaging system. He says Ripple’s partner list shows its link to the government. These include Federal Reserve pilot projects, central banks in Bhutan, Palau, and Montenegro, payment corridors in the Middle East and Asia, and relationships with U.S. defense-linked banks such as BNY Mellon. To Pumpius, this is a footprint of sanctioned expansion, not rogue innovation. The lawsuit with the SEC , in his view, served as the perfect cover. While news headlines painted Ripple as “in trouble,” the company quietly signed over 1,700 contracts and NDAs with major financial institutions. Many of these were with foreign partners, creating the appearance that the company was “fleeing” the U.S. In reality, Pumpius says, this was part of a blueprint to open payment corridors abroad first, then bring the infrastructure back to the U.S. once it was ready. XRPL As Washington’s Blockchain: From Money To Identity Control According to Pumpius, the endgame goes far beyond payments. He claims the U.S. intends to use XRPL as the backbone of a blockchain-based reserve network, shifting control from traditional banking systems to a government-linked ledger. A key part of this plan, he says, is RLUSD , Ripple’s stablecoin “pilot.” It is fully U.S.-compliant, designed for institutional custody, and connects directly to the XRPL. Once activated, RLUSD could serve as the domestic bridge asset, while XRP handles global settlements. If the XRPL can move money, it can also move any asset, including sensitive identity information like DNA. Tokenizing bio-data, he warns, would give whoever controls the ledger influence not just over finance, but over personal identity itself. The idea is to make a project look like it is resisting the system, allow it to grow freely outside the spotlight , and then reveal its accurate alignment once the infrastructure is too entrenched to oppose. By the time the public understands the scope of the network, Pumpius says, the rails are already in place. In his view, Ripple built global financial rails under the guise of fighting regulators, while the U.S. ensured the technology would work seamlessly at home. From payments to real-world assets and eventually identity data, the XRPL could become the state’s blockchain arm. For Pumpius, the lawsuit was never the battle; the expansion was the mission.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|Ripple price|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|XRP|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-16 00:00:26
50155028,https://thecoinrise.com/cold-wallets-50x-roi-ambition-rivals-chainlinks-21-breakout-and-pi-networks-push-for-mainnet-utility/,1755302436,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/50155028.jpeg,Cold Wallet’s 50× ROI Ambition Rivals Chainlink’s $21 Breakout and Pi Network’s Push for Mainnet Utility,https://thecoinrise.com/cold-wallets-50x-roi-ambition-rivals-chainlinks-21-breakout-and-pi-networks-push-for-mainnet-utility/,"In 2025, the race to define the top crypto performers is shaping up between three notable names: Chainlink, Pi Network, and Cold Wallet. Chainlink’s (LINK) climb past $21, supported by whale activity and a major integration deal, points to a rise in institutional trust. Pi Network’s growing community and anticipated token utility are fueling market chatter about long-term potential. Yet, Cold Wallet is quickly emerging as the project to watch. Cold Wallet’s presale model blends cashback rewards on every transaction with a projected 50× return from its current pricing. This combination of practical use and strong ROI prospects is placing it alongside, and in some cases ahead of, established names in the top crypto performers category. Chainlink Price Surge Driven by Adoption Strength The Chainlink (LINK) rally beyond $21 has been backed by expanding network adoption and strategic partnerships. Large holders are increasing their positions, signalling conviction in LINK’s value as a primary data oracle provider for DeFi and enterprise networks. Its recent deal with Swift has further confirmed its role as a critical infrastructure layer. Technically, LINK remains strong, trading above both its 50-day and 200-day averages, with RSI levels in bullish territory. These indicators highlight consistent buying pressure and confidence in decentralised data solutions that underpin broader blockchain growth. However, Chainlink’s path as one of the top crypto performers may lean toward steady, adoption-led gains rather than sudden price spikes. The real potential for outsized moves lies in network-wide adoption events or sector-driven altcoin surges that expand its real-world integrations. Pi Network Price Holds Community-Driven Potential The Pi Network price continues to attract interest, fueled by one of the largest user bases in the sector and expectations for utility-focused growth. With a maximum supply cap of 80 billion tokens, scarcity combined with sustained demand could help Pi secure mainstream traction. Forecasts for 2025 to 2030 remain speculative, but its blend of mass participation and potential scalability keeps it in the top crypto performers discussion. If Pi manages to complete its shift to mainnet while rolling out real-world applications, it could deliver results that exceed many early expectations. Its mobile-first, socially powered model positions it as both a community-driven and potentially utility-based contender. That said, Pi is still in a formative stage. To fully realise its price potential, it must secure exchange listings, deepen liquidity, and establish functional use cases, key drivers that would anchor long-term value. Cold Wallet’s Rewards and 50× ROI Projection Gains Attention Cold Wallet is carving out a place among the top crypto performers with a model that turns regular blockchain usage into a revenue source for its community. Through the $CWT token, users earn rewards for covering gas fees, executing swaps, or using on/off-ramp services. This flips the standard fee structure by rewarding activity rather than just charging for it. Currently in Stage 17 of its presale, Cold Wallet’s $0.00998 price point has already attracted over $6 million in sales, with 717 million tokens purchased. The project’s launch projection of $0.3517 gives early participants a potential 50× return, an uncommon scenario among projects offering genuine utility. Its presale framework is designed to favour early adopters through lower pricing tiers, while discouraging short-term dumping by raising the price with each stage. Beyond this, planned Layer 2 integration or a custom scaling route will enable instant, gas-free reward payouts, ensuring both speed and cost-efficiency for everyday use. This focus on usability addresses one of DeFi’s biggest barriers: friction in transactions. While Chainlink excels in infrastructure and Pi thrives on community, Cold Wallet combines a working reward ecosystem with exceptional ROI prospects, positioning it as a clear contender in the top crypto performers list for 2025. Closing Perspective Chainlink’s price growth and strong infrastructure role keep it well-placed among the top crypto performers, while Pi Network’s scale and potential utility make it a wild card with room to grow. However, Cold Wallet’s mix of a functioning reward-driven model and a forecasted 50× return offers a rare balance of use-case relevance and upside potential. For those watching 2025’s market leaders, all three deserve a spot on the radar, but Cold Wallet’s momentum may prove hard to match.

Investors are already looking further at the potential upside of XRP, but also exploring new emerging opportunities in the market where other projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE have been generating buzz to investors with their strategic growth model and its early-entry opportunity. Legal Clarity The most remarkable twist of events happened this August when Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission officially closed the legal case that ran over 5 years. The case, as a result of a pro-crypto but anti-regulatory political shift in Washington, reconfirmed that XRP is not a security so long as it is traded on publicly listed exchanges, although some institutional XRP sales can remain covered by securities law. Ripple accepted to pay a fine, although the decision is regarded as a landmark victory of the company and the crypto space in general. With the lawsuit no longer hanging over its head, XRP has surged in market rankings, reclaiming the position of the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The clarity has also reignited interest from institutional players, a factor that is now clearly reflected in price charts and on-chain data. A New Contender Draws Early Attention Even though the legal win of XRP has positioned the digital currency on the path towards continued expansion, experienced investors also have their eyes on MAGACOIN FINANCE. It has been highlighted by analysts as one of the most exciting altcoins to take strategic bets on with the prospect of high returns in the next bull run. As investor allocations are getting more restrictive and available early rounds more competitive, MAGACOIN FINANCE is regarded by some as a unique opportunity to be able to get exclusive exposure before wider market adoption leads to an incredible price surge . Price Action and 2025 Predictions XRP began the year near $2.32 and has steadily climbed, trading between $3.25 and $3.50 through mid-August, after briefly touching $3.64 in July. On-chain metrics have flashed bullish signals, including a rare MVRV golden cross, historically linked to strong rallies. Whale accumulation has also reached record highs, underscoring confidence from large investors. Market forecasts range from measured to highly ambitious. A conservative view puts XRP at $4 to $5 by year-end, while aggressive models, drawing from past rally patterns, envision a surge toward $20 or more if momentum holds. A more cautious stance suggests consolidation between $2.50 and $3.50 while the market digests recent gains. Catalysts That Could Push Prices Higher Several developments could drive the next leg of XRP’s rally: ETF Potential Approval: Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are currently active in the U.S. An XRP spot ETF could bring large-scale institutional funding should it get added in October. Rising Institutional Adoption: Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity service is poised for greater integration among banks and payment providers now that U.S. regulatory barriers have been removed. International Regulatory Development: A fully implemented MiCA framework pioneered by the EU by the end of the year 2025 may set XRP as one of the few large-scale assets to have a unified global legal framework. Looking Toward Year-End The elimination of the largest legal restraint against XRP has redefined the market story behind it, which allows its further adoption and investment. Assuming future catalysts fall into place, including ETF approvals and institutional collaborations XRP might stand in a position to challenge its all-time highs . Meanwhile, other opportunities such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are catching the eye of investors who want to diversify their investments in early stage projects offering high returns.

Grayscale, a major player in digital asset management, has just made a significant move by filing an S-1 application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a Spot Dogecoin ETF . This development, initially reported by Crypto Briefing, marks a pivotal moment for the popular meme coin and the broader cryptocurrency market. It suggests a growing institutional interest in assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, potentially opening doors for more diverse Dogecoin investment opportunities. Understanding the Grayscale Dogecoin ETF Filing What exactly does this Grayscale Dogecoin ETF filing mean? An S-1 form is a registration statement that companies must file with the SEC before they can offer securities to the public. In this case, Grayscale is proposing an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that would directly hold Dogecoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to DOGE without actually buying and storing the cryptocurrency themselves. This simplifies the process for traditional investors and could significantly boost Dogecoin’s accessibility. What is an S-1? It’s the initial registration form required by the SEC for public companies to list their securities on a U.S. exchange. Why Grayscale? Grayscale has a history of pioneering crypto investment products, including their successful Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, and is at the forefront of pushing for regulated crypto access. Dogecoin’s Role: Despite its origins as a meme, Dogecoin has cultivated a strong community and notable market capitalization, making it a logical next step for firms seeking to expand their crypto offerings. The Potential Impact of a DOGE ETF Approval The prospect of a DOGE ETF approval is generating considerable buzz. If the SEC gives the green light, it could bring a wave of new capital into the Dogecoin ecosystem. A spot ETF provides a regulated and familiar investment vehicle for institutional investors and retail traders alike, potentially increasing liquidity and reducing price volatility over time. This kind of mainstream adoption could fundamentally change how the market perceives Dogecoin, moving it further from its ‘meme coin’ status towards a more established digital asset. However, the path to approval is not without its hurdles. The SEC has historically been cautious with cryptocurrency ETFs, particularly those directly holding volatile assets. They scrutinize market manipulation concerns, custody solutions, and overall investor protection. The outcome of this Crypto ETF filing will set a precedent for other altcoin ETFs in the future. Navigating the Path to SEC Dogecoin ETF Approval The journey for the SEC Dogecoin ETF approval will likely involve extensive dialogue between Grayscale and the regulator. The SEC’s primary mandate is investor protection, and they will thoroughly evaluate Grayscale’s proposed structure, custody arrangements, and market surveillance measures. While the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year offers a hopeful precedent, each asset presents unique challenges. Investors and Dogecoin enthusiasts should closely follow updates from both Grayscale and the SEC. The process typically involves: Initial filing and public comment periods. Amendments and responses to SEC inquiries. Final decision by the Commission. This careful regulatory review ensures that any approved product meets stringent standards, offering a safer avenue for Dogecoin investment . What This Means for Dogecoin Investment and Holders For current Dogecoin holders and potential investors, Grayscale’s S-1 filing is a significant bullish signal. Even if immediate approval isn’t guaranteed, the mere act of filing elevates Dogecoin’s profile and validates its position in the broader digital asset landscape. A successful Spot Dogecoin ETF could lead to: Increased Liquidity: More trading volume as institutional money enters the market. Enhanced Legitimacy: A regulated product adds credibility, attracting a wider range of investors. Price Action: While not guaranteed, increased demand from ETF inflows could positively impact DOGE’s price. This development underscores the evolving narrative around cryptocurrencies and their integration into traditional finance. It highlights a future where digital assets, even those with unconventional beginnings, gain recognition as legitimate investment vehicles. In conclusion, Grayscale’s audacious filing for a Spot Dogecoin ETF represents a monumental step for Dogecoin and the wider crypto industry. It reflects a growing appetite for diverse crypto-backed products within regulated financial frameworks. While the road to DOGE ETF approval may have its twists and turns, this move undeniably pushes Dogecoin further into the mainstream financial conversation, offering exciting prospects for its future and for new forms of Dogecoin investment . The journey continues, and the world watches as this groundbreaking proposal unfolds. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Spot Dogecoin ETF? A Spot Dogecoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Dogecoin. It allows investors to gain exposure to DOGE’s price movements through a traditional brokerage account, without needing to buy, store, or manage the actual cryptocurrency. Q2: Why is Grayscale filing for a Dogecoin ETF? Grayscale aims to expand access to cryptocurrency investments for a broader audience, including institutional investors. By offering a regulated ETF, they provide a familiar and secure vehicle for exposure to Dogecoin. Q3: How long does SEC approval for a Crypto ETF filing typically take? The approval process can vary significantly. It often involves several rounds of reviews, amendments, and public comments, potentially taking many months or even over a year, as seen with previous Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF applications. Q4: How might a DOGE ETF approval affect Dogecoin’s price? While not guaranteed, a DOGE ETF approval could increase demand for Dogecoin by opening it up to a larger pool of investors. This increased demand, combined with enhanced legitimacy, could potentially lead to positive price action and increased liquidity for DOGE. Did you find this article insightful?

The meeting, held at an Air Force base in Anchorage, was the first time both men met since 2019, but despite the buildup and the “Pursuing Peace” backdrop behind them, there was no progress on the main issue: stopping the bloodshed that’s already killed over a million people. Trump said they had “many, many points” of agreement but admitted they hadn’t gotten to the big ones. “So there’s no deal until there’s a deal,” he said, summing up what ended up being three hours of talks with no actual results. Putin gave short comments too, warning Ukraine and its European partners not to mess with the “progress,” even though nothing solid was presented. No questions were taken from the press. No documents signed. Just two presidents in front of microphones offering vague words and no commitments. Zelenskiy kept out as Trump aims for a second round Inside the base, Trump was flanked by Marco Rubio, the Secretary of State, and Steve Witkoff, his special envoy to Russia. Putin came with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and top foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov. They met in a secured room while the clock ticked, and by the end, the biggest headline was the lack of one. Trump’s original goal was to get Putin to commit to meeting Volodymyr Zelenskiy and hammer out a deal to end the war that began in February 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine. But Zelenskiy didn’t even get an invite. Fears from Kyiv and European capitals were mostly that Trump might let Russia keep the territories it’s already taken, locking in Moscow’s control over about 20% of Ukraine’s land. Trump tried to calm those fears, saying he wasn’t there to “negotiate for Ukraine,” but just to push everyone toward the table. “I want the killing to stop,” he said before boarding Air Force One. That killing didn’t stop. On the same day of the summit, a Russian missile struck the Dnipropetrovsk region, killing one and injuring another. Zelenskiy didn’t sit quietly. He posted on Telegram, writing, “It’s time to end the war, and the necessary steps must be taken by Russia. We are counting on America.” But from Anchorage, Trump had nothing concrete to give him. Putin walks out with optics, Trump leaves with questions Putin may not have secured a deal, but he got something he likely wanted: the image of Russia sitting down with the U.S. again, not as an outcast, but as a major player. Even with an active International Criminal Court warrant accusing him of deporting Ukrainian children, a charge Moscow denies, he got to shake Trump’s hand, walk the red carpet, and share the stage. Both countries aren’t members of the ICC, so the warrant had no effect on this summit. Trump rolled out the welcome treatment. He greeted Putin on the tarmac with a handshake and a pat on the arm before both rode in Trump’s limo to the summit site. That visual, already blasted across media, is being used by Moscow to claim Western isolation has failed. As for real outcomes, there were none. No agreement on a ceasefire. No next meeting scheduled. No roadmap. Just more promises from Trump, who once said he’d end the war “in 24 hours,” now admitting the job’s harder than he thought. “If this goes well, the three-way summit will matter more than today,” Trump said on Thursday, already downplaying the Alaska talks before they happened. Zelenskiy still insists on no territorial handovers. He also wants U.S.-backed security guarantees. Neither was discussed publicly. Trump promised to call Zelenskiy and NATO leaders after the summit to update them. But again, what’s there to say? Nothing was achieved. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s envoy to Ukraine, said earlier that combined casualties on both sides are around 1.2 million. And still, the summit ended with nothing but cameras and carefully worded lines.

This isn’t just a routine transaction; it’s a massive ETH withdrawal that often signals a deeper strategy from the market’s biggest players. Such events often highlight a significant move towards long-term crypto holding . This noteworthy crypto whale activity , tracked by leading on-chain analytics platforms, provides valuable insights into market sentiment and investor confidence. What Was This Massive ETH Withdrawal? Recently, an anonymous but very significant investor, often referred to as a “whale” in crypto circles, executed a substantial ETH withdrawal from the Kraken Exchange. This particular whale moved an additional 17,381 ETH, valued at approximately $76.9 million at the time of the transaction. This latest move brings their total withdrawals from Kraken to an astounding 34,973 ETH, worth around $154.73 million. This data comes directly from Onchain Lens, a reputable on-chain analytics platform, which highlighted the transaction on X (formerly Twitter). Such large withdrawals from centralized exchanges are carefully watched by market participants. They often provide valuable insights into the intentions of these influential holders. Why Do Large ETH Withdrawals Signal Long-Term Crypto Holding? When a substantial amount of cryptocurrency is moved off an exchange and into a private wallet, it typically suggests a particular intention: long-term crypto holding . Exchanges are primarily used for trading, where assets are readily available for buying and selling. Moving assets off an exchange, therefore, reduces the immediate selling pressure on the market. Reduced Selling Pressure: Assets in private wallets are less likely to be sold quickly. Increased Scarcity: Less supply on exchanges can, in theory, contribute to price stability or even appreciation. Investor Confidence: It signals that the whale believes in the asset’s future value, opting to hold rather than trade. This behavior is a strong indicator of confidence in Ethereum’s future trajectory. It implies that this whale is not looking for short-term gains but rather sees significant value in holding ETH over an extended period. What Drives Crypto Whale Activity? Understanding crypto whale activity is like peering into the minds of the market’s most influential players. These “whales” are individuals or entities holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency, enough to potentially impact market prices with their trades. Their actions are often a bellwether for broader market sentiment. Several factors can drive a whale’s decision to withdraw large sums: Long-Term Conviction: As seen in this case, a strong belief in the asset’s fundamental value and future growth. Security Concerns: Some whales prefer to self-custody their assets to mitigate exchange-specific risks. Staking or DeFi Participation: They might be moving ETH to participate in staking (e.g., Ethereum 2.0) or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, which offer yield. Tax Optimization: Strategic moves might also be related to tax planning. Regardless of the specific reason, the sheer scale of this Ethereum whale withdrawal from Kraken makes it a noteworthy event. It reflects a strategic decision that could influence how other investors perceive Ethereum’s stability and potential. How Do On-Chain Analytics Help Us Understand These Moves? On-chain analytics platforms, like Onchain Lens mentioned in the original report, are invaluable tools for tracking these large movements. They provide transparency by analyzing publicly available blockchain data. This data includes transaction volumes, wallet balances, and movements between different types of addresses (e.g., exchanges, smart contracts, private wallets). By monitoring these flows, analysts can identify patterns and draw conclusions about market sentiment. For instance, consistent withdrawals from exchanges often correlate with bullish sentiment, while large deposits to exchanges can sometimes precede selling pressure. This recent ETH withdrawal is a prime example of how on-chain data offers a unique window into the otherwise opaque world of institutional and high-net-worth crypto investments. It helps demystify some of the market’s largest shifts. In conclusion, the substantial Ethereum whale withdrawal from Kraken underscores a prevailing sentiment among large holders: a strong conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value. This significant movement, tracked by diligent on-chain analytics, highlights the strategic decisions made by influential market participants who are choosing to secure their assets for the future rather than actively trade them. It’s a powerful signal for the broader crypto community, suggesting a vote of confidence in ETH’s enduring potential. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a “whale” in the cryptocurrency market? A: In cryptocurrency, a “whale” refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence its market price through their buying or selling activities. Q2: Why is withdrawing ETH from an exchange considered a signal for long-term holding? A: Exchanges are primarily for trading. When a large amount of cryptocurrency is moved from an exchange to a private, self-custodied wallet, it suggests the owner intends to hold the asset for an extended period rather than selling it immediately. This reduces the circulating supply on exchanges, potentially signaling confidence in the asset’s future. Q3: What are on-chain analytics? A: On-chain analytics involve analyzing data directly from a blockchain’s public ledger. This includes tracking transaction volumes, wallet addresses, and movements of assets between different entities (like exchanges or DeFi protocols). It provides insights into market sentiment, supply, and demand dynamics. Q4: Does this ETH withdrawal guarantee Ethereum’s price will increase? A: While a significant Ethereum whale withdrawal signals strong confidence from a large holder and can be a positive indicator, it does not guarantee a price increase. The crypto market is influenced by many factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, technological developments, and overall market sentiment. This is just one data point among many. Q5: How can I track crypto whale activity? A: You can track crypto whale activity by using specialized on-chain analytics platforms and services. Many platforms offer free or premium tools that monitor large transactions, exchange inflows/outflows, and significant wallet movements. Following reputable crypto news sources and analysts who utilize these tools can also keep you informed. Did you find this insight into the latest crypto whale movements helpful?

Arbitrum, NEAR Protocol, and Hedera are grabbing headlines as undervalued altcoins poised for strong rebounds — but a fast-rising project with massive upside is capturing even more attention: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Now considered one of the best altcoins to buy during this correction, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the surprise winner from this market dip. Market Dip or Opportunity in Disguise? Despite bullish long-term signals like Bitcoin’s march toward $200K, the recent crypto dip has created fear-driven selloffs across altcoins. Yet experienced traders know: the biggest altcoin gains often begin in red markets. Top analysts and smart money investors are now using this rare moment to reposition into top altcoins to watch during the next leg up — especially those with solid fundamentals, fresh narratives, and undervalued entry points. Let’s take a quick look at why Arbitrum, NEAR, and Hedera are trending. Arbitrum (ARB): Breaking Out Despite Token Unlock Fears After six months of stagnation, ARB surged over 15%, shattering resistance levels as trading volume spiked to $1.46 billion. With PayPal integration and BlackRock exploring tokenized asset products on Arbitrum, long-term fundamentals are bullish. Short-term, however, an August 16 token unlock could create volatility. ARB remains one of the top altcoins to watch, especially with $4.75 billion TVL and explosive RWA growth — but investors wary of unlock-induced dips are looking elsewhere for cleaner upside. NEAR Protocol: Building in AI and DeFi NEAR has been bouncing between $2.75–$2.83 amid major partnerships and volatility. Integrations with IQ AI for liquidity automation and Infinex for DeFi user experience show a clear move toward utility. Meanwhile, the community voted to slash token inflation in half, tightening future supply. These are bullish signals, but near-term volatility and resistance at $3.10 may cap gains — pushing more risk-tolerant investors to earlier-stage plays. Hedera (HBAR): Enterprise-Grade and On the Rise Major implications for Hedera’s future are the mainnet upgrade on its way and the part it will take in the tokenization of institutional funds with such partners as BlackRock and Brevan Howard. Additionally, HBAR got a 17% price bounce after it managed to break out of a technical pattern. One reason for the recent hype around HBAR is the request for an ETF by Grayscale. Nevertheless, analysts are suggesting that if the supply of stablecoins on the blockchain continues to dwindle, then there is a potential for HBAR to drop by as much as 27%. This uncertainty has led some investors to take a wait-and-see approach — while reallocating into lower-risk, high-reward alternatives. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Altcoin to Accumulate Now While Arbitrum, NEAR, and Hedera position for longer-term growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is perfectly aligned for explosive short-term gains — especially for investors buying during this rare market dip. Analysts tracking new token launches have flagged MAGACOIN as one of the best altcoins to buy now. Data shows large holders (including former BTC and ETH whales) are now increasing MAGACOIN FINANCE positions, using this downturn to accumulate at steep discounts before momentum returns. MAGACOIN FINANCE is ranked the top crypto presale that is considered by long-term investors as the best way of building their wealth. Its solid foundation, community-centric tokenomics, and potential to increase in value to a great extent make it a unique early-stage project. Authorities in the field expect that it will reward investors with the followings: not just 1 or 2 quick rallies but also continuous profits for a few years. Final Thoughts: Dips Create Millionaires While the market pulls back, veteran crypto investors know this is not the time to panic — it’s the time to buy smart. If you’re scanning the landscape for top altcoins to watch, don’t just chase names already up 3x or 4x. Go where the upside is still ahead. MAGACOIN FINANCE is that opportunity. With the right timing, right fundamentals, and right bonus structure, this project could turn today’s dip into tomorrow’s windfall.

This vital indicator provides a fascinating snapshot of the prevailing crypto market sentiment , offering insights into the collective emotional state of cryptocurrency investors. Understanding this index is crucial for anyone navigating the dynamic world of digital assets, as it helps to gauge whether the market is driven by enthusiasm or apprehension. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a unique analytical tool developed by software development platform Alternative. Its primary purpose is to distill complex market data into a single, easy-to-understand score, ranging from 0 to 100. A score of 0 signifies “Extreme Fear,” indicating widespread panic and potential undervaluation, while 100 represents “Extreme Greed,” often suggesting an overheated market ripe for correction. This index serves as a powerful barometer for investor sentiment , helping participants understand when market emotions might be pushing prices to unsustainable levels, or when irrational fear creates buying opportunities. It’s a practical guide for those looking to make more informed decisions rather than being swayed by fleeting emotions. Decoding 56: What Does “Greed” at This Level Mean? A current reading of 56 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index places the market squarely in the “Greed” territory. While it’s a four-point decrease from the previous day, this level indicates that optimism generally prevails among investors. It suggests that despite minor fluctuations, the broader market remains confident, perhaps expecting continued price appreciation. However, it is important to remember that “Greed” can be a double-edged sword. While it reflects positive momentum, sustained periods of high greed can sometimes precede market pullbacks as prices become overextended. This particular reading highlights a cautious optimism, not yet reaching extreme levels of euphoria that often precede sharp corrections. Behind the Numbers: Factors Influencing the Index The comprehensive nature of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index comes from its multi-faceted approach, incorporating six distinct factors to calculate its score. Each component offers a unique perspective on crypto market sentiment : Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it to average values. Higher volatility can signal fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Analyzes current volume and market momentum, comparing it with average values over 30 and 90 days. Strong, consistent buying volume typically indicates greed. Social Media (15%): Scans Twitter hashtags and mentions related to cryptocurrencies, assessing the speed and volume of posts. High engagement and positive sentiment can reflect greed. Surveys (15%): Historically, polls asked investors about their market outlook. (Currently paused, but a significant factor when active). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Evaluates Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Increasing Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear, as investors might flock to the perceived safety of Bitcoin during uncertain times. Conversely, decreasing dominance might suggest growing confidence in altcoins. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google search queries related to crypto, looking for spikes in search terms associated with fear (e.g., “Bitcoin price manipulation”) or greed (e.g., “how to buy Bitcoin fast”). Understanding these underlying factors helps investors appreciate the depth of analysis that goes into each index reading. Navigating the Market: How Can Investors Use This Index? For savvy investors, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just an interesting statistic; it’s an actionable tool. It can help you: Gauge Market Extremes: Recognize when the market is in “Extreme Fear” (potential buying opportunity) or “Extreme Greed” (potential time for caution or profit-taking). Counter Emotional Biases: Use the index to check your own emotions. If the market is in extreme fear but your instinct is to sell, the index might encourage you to reconsider. Complement Other Analyses: Combine the index’s insights with technical analysis, fundamental research, and news events for a more holistic view of the crypto market . While the index offers valuable insights into collective investor sentiment , it should never be the sole basis for investment decisions. Instead, view it as a powerful confirmation tool, especially during periods of high market volatility . Conclusion: Stay Informed, Stay Strategic The recent reading of 56 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index confirms that optimism continues to define the crypto landscape, even with a slight cool-down. This index remains an indispensable tool for understanding the psychological currents driving the market. By monitoring this key metric and comprehending its components, investors can make more rational, less emotionally-driven decisions, positioning themselves strategically within the ever-evolving world of digital assets.

According to its U.S. IPO filing, it is joining a growing wave of crypto firms aiming for public markets. The New York-based crypto exchange and custodian posted a net loss of $282.5 million on $67.9 million in revenue for the six months ending June 30, compared with a $41.4 million loss on $73.5 million in revenue in the same period last year, according to its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday. Gemini twins ride crypto wave with $18B in assets and Nasdaq IPO plans Founded in 2014, Gemini manages over $18 billion in assets. In the first half of 2025, transaction revenue from volume-based trades accounted for 65.5% of its total revenue. The wave of crypto IPOs coincides with the Trump administration’s embrace of the sector, including recently signed crypto legislation. Stablecoin issuer Circle went public in June with a $1.2 billion IPO , surging 168% on its first trading day, while crypto exchange Bullish jumped 84% after raising $1.1 billion earlier this week. Gemini offers a crypto exchange, a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, crypto staking, a crypto rewards credit card, and institutional services such as custody and over-the-counter trading. Cameron Winklevoss serves as president, and Tyler Winklevoss is CEO. The filing shows that each twin has a net worth of $7.5 billion, and they are the only shareholders with stakes of 5% or more. Previously, Gemini faced SEC charges in 2023 over unregistered securities sales through its Gemini Earn program, which were later dropped. The company also paid $5 million to resolve a Commodity Futures Trading Commission lawsuit in January, without admitting or denying liability. The Winklevoss twins, who gained fame from a dispute with Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, attended President Trump’s signing of the stablecoin legislation in July. Bloomberg News reported they have invested in American Bitcoin Corp., a Bitcoin mining venture linked to Trump’s sons. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are leading the IPO, which will debut on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker GEMI. Bullish expands IPO as crypto firms ride a wave of public market listings The Gemini news comes as Peter Thiel-backed cryptocurrency exchange Bullish raised the size of its initial public offering. Bullish aims to raise $990 million , offering 30 million shares priced between $32 and $33 apiece, and targeting a valuation of $4.8 billion, according to a Monday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Gemini announcement comes as Peter Thiel-backed crypto exchange Bullish expands its initial public offering. According to a Monday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Bullish plans to raise $990 million, offering 30 million shares priced between $32 and $33 apiece, and targeting a valuation of $4.8 billion. Led by former New York Stock Exchange president Tom Farley, the company had earlier proposed 20.3 million shares at $28 to $31 each, targeting a $4.2 billion valuation, according to a filing last week. Bullish has given its underwriters—JPMorgan, Jefferies, and Citigroup—a 30-day option to sell an additional 4.5 million shares. The company’s stock will debut on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “BLSH.” According to the updated filing, BlackRock and Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management have indicated interest in purchasing up to $200 million of the shares. Bullish is among the most recent crypto firms to join the public market, reflecting reinvigorated capital markets driven by investor confidence and increasing regulatory support and clarity from Washington. Stablecoin issuer Circle made a strong market debut in June, while Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital uplisted to Nasdaq in May.

In a significant move, the Foundation recently sold an additional 1,100 ETH for DAI, amounting to $4.89 million. This transaction follows a pattern of substantial activity, bringing their total sales over the past three days to 7,294 ETH, valued at an impressive $33.25 million in DAI, according to insights from on-chain analytics platform Onchain Lens. What Exactly Happened with the Latest Ethereum Foundation ETH Sales? This latest transaction highlights a period of notable financial adjustments by the Ethereum Foundation . Beyond the sales, the Foundation also transferred a substantial 16,000 ETH, worth approximately $71.45 million, along with $6 million in DAI, to a newly established wallet. These actions suggest a strategic reallocation of assets, potentially for operational needs or diversification. It is important to understand that DAI is a DAI stablecoin , meaning its value is pegged to the US dollar. This offers stability in the often-volatile crypto market . On-chain analytics provide transparent data on these movements, allowing anyone to track significant transactions by major entities. Why Does the Ethereum Foundation Engage in Such Significant ETH Sales? The Ethereum Foundation , a non-profit organization, plays a crucial role in supporting the development and growth of the Ethereum ecosystem. Its funding primarily comes from Ether (ETH) holdings, often acquired during early stages of the network’s development. Periodically, the Foundation liquidates a portion of its ETH to cover operational expenses, fund grants for developers, and support various research initiatives that benefit the entire network. These ETH sales are not new; they are part of the Foundation’s long-standing financial strategy to ensure its sustainability. They allow the organization to: Fund core development and research for Ethereum. Support community initiatives and educational programs. Cover administrative and operational costs. This proactive financial management ensures the continued health and innovation of the Ethereum blockchain. What Do These Ethereum Foundation ETH Sales Mean for the Crypto Market? Whenever a major entity like the Ethereum Foundation executes substantial ETH sales , it naturally draws scrutiny from the broader crypto market . While these sales represent a significant sum, it is important to consider them in the context of Ethereum’s overall market capitalization and daily trading volume. Ethereum is a vast network, and even multi-million dollar transactions represent a small fraction of its total liquidity. Typically, such transactions are pre-planned and executed in a manner designed to minimize market impact. However, they can still trigger: Short-term price fluctuations: A large sale might temporarily increase supply on exchanges. Investor sentiment shifts: Some investors might interpret sales as a negative signal, though this is often a misinterpretation of operational needs. Experienced market observers understand that these are usually routine operational adjustments rather than bearish indicators. How Can Investors Interpret These Strategic Ethereum Foundation ETH Sales? For investors and participants in the crypto market , understanding the motivations behind these Ethereum Foundation ETH sales is key. Rather than signaling a lack of confidence, these moves are typically part of a long-term strategy to ensure the Foundation’s financial sustainability and its ability to continue fostering innovation within the Ethereum network. The Foundation’s goal is to advance Ethereum, not to speculate on its price. To gain clearer insights, investors should: Monitor on-chain data: Tools like Onchain Lens provide transparency into these movements. Follow official announcements: The Foundation often communicates its strategic objectives. Assess the broader market context: Do not isolate these sales from wider market trends. This comprehensive approach helps in making informed decisions. The recent Ethereum Foundation ETH sales , totaling over $33 million in DAI, are a testament to the Foundation’s ongoing financial management and commitment to the network’s future. These transactions, while notable, are a standard part of their operational strategy, ensuring continued development and growth for the Ethereum ecosystem. As the crypto market evolves, transparency from key entities like the Ethereum Foundation remains vital for informed decision-making.

The action also includes the confiscation of $70,000 in cash and a luxury vehicle. The warrants, unsealed in federal courts in the Eastern District of Virginia, the Central District of California, and the Northern District of Texas, are part of an ongoing criminal case against a foreign national accused of deploying ransomware to extort victims. Details of the Alleged Ransomware Scheme According to the Justice Department, the assets were traced to a wallet controlled by Ianis Aleksandrovich Antropenko, who is facing charges in the Northern District of Texas. Prosecutors allege that Antropenko used the Zeppelin ransomware strain to target a wide range of individuals, businesses, and organizations , both within the United States and internationally. The indictment claims that Antropenko and associates encrypted and stole victims’ data, demanding payment to restore access, refrain from publishing stolen information, or delete the data entirely. The Justice Department stated that the seized cryptocurrency and other assets are believed to be proceeds of ransomware activities or funds used to launder such proceeds. Investigators allege that Antropenko employed several methods to disguise the origins of the funds , including the use of ChipMixer, a cryptocurrency mixing service taken offline in a coordinated global law enforcement action in 2023. Other laundering techniques reportedly involved converting cryptocurrency into cash and making structured deposits to avoid detection. The case is being led by the FBI’s Dallas and Norfolk Field Offices, along with the bureau’s Virtual Assets Unit. Prosecutors from the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas, and several other districts are coordinating on asset forfeiture and related proceedings. The Justice Department noted that international cooperation has been a key element of the investigation, as ransomware attacks often involve cross-border operations and victims. Broader Context of DOJ’s Anti-Ransomware Efforts The Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) of the Justice Department is handling the prosecution. CCIPS specializes in investigating and prosecuting cybercrime, often in partnership with international law enforcement agencies and private sector cybersecurity experts. The statement release by the US DOJ revealed that since 2020, the section has secured convictions against more than 180 individuals involved in cybercrime and has recovered over $350 million for victims through court-ordered restitution. In addition to prosecutions, the Justice Department has coordinated operations that have disrupted several major ransomware groups, preventing victims from paying more than $200 million in ransoms. The Justice Department ALSO emphasized that while the seizure of assets can help return funds to victims, ongoing collaboration between governments, private industry, and the public remains essential to combating ransomware. The case against Antropenko is ongoing, and the department has indicated that further developments, including potential additional charges or asset recoveries , may follow as the investigation progresses.

Bitcoin and Ethereum. They set the pace for the rest of the industry. Bitcoin is known as “digital gold,” and many investors see it as a safe haven during inflation. Ethereum, on the other hand, is praised for its smart contracts and countless blockchain applications. Yet a new contender, MAGACOIN, is catching attention. Many believe it could rival both in gains. Bitcoin’s Edge as Digital Gold Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins. About 19.9 million are already in circulation. New coins come through mining. Once the maximum is reached around 2040, no more coins will be created. This scarcity is why many call it a strong inflation hedge. It behaves like gold in that regard. However, gold still has physical uses in electronics, dentistry, and jewelry. Bitcoin is just digital code on a blockchain. Gold is also far less volatile. It has served as a store of value for thousands of years. Bitcoin is only 16 years old and has had multiple drops of over 50%. Ethereum’s Flexible Supply Ethereum works differently. It has no fixed supply limit. Up to 18 million ETH can be created each year. But the EIP-1559 upgrade in 2021 added a burn mechanism. When network use is high, part of the ETH used in fees is destroyed. This can reduce the supply. In some periods Ethereum has even been deflationary.Its current supply has stayed near 120 million for two years. But Ethereum still faces the same volatility as Bitcoin. It is younger too, only launching in 2015. Which Is the Better Hedge? Bitcoin remains the most secure means of preserving your money against inflation. Its limited supply is a big help. It dominates nearly 60% of the crypto market as well. Ethereum excels in the creation of blockchain applications but is not yet as secure in storing value. Due to this, investors tend to hold both. Could SEI Token Outperform Both in 2025? SEI Token is due to explode this year. Traders are monitoring its application in the decentralized trading platforms. Due to this, SEI enjoys a certain degree of credibility that a lot of smaller tokens lack. SEI can produce significant returns in 2025 based on a good community and new integrations. Some consider that it may outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum in the immediate timeframe. MAGACOIN’s Early-Stage Opportunity MAGACOIN is still in its early stage, but demand is rising. It is gaining interest from traders who want high-growth potential. Blockchain audits confirm institutional-grade security standards, which gives confidence to early buyers. Analysts believe it could post massive returns if adoption keeps rising. Final Thoughts In the end Bitcoin and Ethereum will remain key crypto market players. However, SEI Token and MAGACOIN could surprise many in 2025. MAGACOIN especially looks like a bet worth watching.

50156874,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=805489,1755306011,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/50156874.jpeg,TRON’s Futures Map Says “Not Overheated” — Could Another Rally Be Coming?,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/tron-trx/tron-futures-map-says-not-overheated-could-another-rally-be-coming/,"TRON’s market momentum has eased after a recent rally that pushed its price above $0.365, with the asset now trading at $0.355, representing a 1.76% drop over the past 24 hours. This consolidation follows a steady climb in recent weeks that saw the network’s transaction activity and derivatives data draw increased analyst attention. According to CryptoQuant contributor Burak Kesmeci, the current TRX futures market remains in a neutral position, suggesting that the asset may still have room to advance before approaching a local top. Related Reading: TRON Long-Term Holders See Massive Gains As TRX Pushes Toward Multi-Year Highs Futures Market Indicators and Historical Context Kesmeci’s analysis centers on the TRON Futures Volume Bubble Map, a metric used to gauge periods of overheating in the futures market. Historically, this tool has flagged heightened risk when red-toned “bubbles” appear, marking moments of excessive speculative activity. The last notable instance occurred in early December 2024, when TRX rose from $0.26 to $0.45 before hitting a local peak. At present, Kesmeci notes that the indicator has not entered the high-risk zone, meaning TRX has not yet reached levels of speculative saturation. This, in theory, leaves space for further price increases if current market trends persist. Futures market analysis like this often helps traders differentiate between rallies supported by organic demand and those driven primarily by leveraged speculation. The neutral reading suggests that current TRX movements could be supported by genuine buying interest rather than excessive short-term leverage. A balanced outlook, however, would also consider that futures market conditions can shift quickly. If trading volume or open interest begins to rise sharply alongside price, the risk of a pullback could grow. For now, the neutral futures environment combined with moderate spot market activity provides a base for potential incremental gains. TRON On-Chain Data Reveals Exchange-Linked Transfer Spike In a separate observation, CryptoQuant analyst CryptoOnchain highlighted unusual network activity on July 19, 2025, when more than 3.426 billion TRX, valued at roughly $1.11 billion, moved across the blockchain in a single day. A closer breakdown of these transactions indicates that this surge was not the result of organic user demand but was instead tied to operational movements between a small group of large wallets. The data shows that two back-and-forth transfers of 612 million TRX each between two addresses accounted for around 36% of that day’s total value, fitting the pattern of a hot-to-cold wallet rebalance often associated with exchanges. Additional chains of transfers, including fixed-denomination movements of between 3 million and 7.5 million TRX, also align with common exchange deposit and withdrawal processing. Related Reading: TRON Crosses 11.1 Billion Transactions as USDT Activity Powers Its Momentum While over 85% of the day’s total transfer volume was traced to this interconnected wallet cluster, both Arkham and Tronscan list no official ownership labels for the addresses. Nevertheless, the mirrored transaction flows and their structured nature strongly point toward centralized custody, likely by an exchange or large service provider. Compared with a similar event in June 2023, the July 19 spike occurred within a broader trend of increasing transactions per second (TPS) and total transaction volume in 2025. This suggests that while the event itself was operational, TRON’s underlying network activity continues to expand. CryptoOnchain cautions that such operational spikes should be distinguished from genuine adoption surges to avoid overestimating organic growth.

The Altcoin Season Index is a key indicator for understanding whether Bitcoin or altcoins are leading the charge. Currently, this crucial metric points to a clear trend: we are firmly in Bitcoin Season . This insight helps investors and enthusiasts gauge the broader crypto market trends and make informed decisions about their portfolio. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index , meticulously tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), provides a snapshot of the market’s dominant force. On August 16, at 00:35 UTC, the index stood at 43, a figure consistent with the previous day’s report. This reading signals that Bitcoin is currently outperforming most alternative cryptocurrencies, guiding crypto market trends . But what does this number truly mean? The index measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies on CMC over the past 90 days, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. It’s a simple yet powerful gauge: For the market to be in Altcoin Season , at least 75% of these top 100 coins must have outperformed Bitcoin. Conversely, Bitcoin Season occurs when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to surpass Bitcoin’s performance. The index itself ranges from 1 to 100, with lower numbers indicating a stronger Bitcoin dominance and a clear direction for crypto market trends . Why Are We in Bitcoin Season? Analyzing Current Crypto Market Trends The current reading of 43 on the Altcoin Season Index clearly indicates that Bitcoin is the preferred asset for many investors right now. This shift often happens during periods of market uncertainty or when investors seek more stable, larger-cap assets. Bitcoin, as the pioneer and largest cryptocurrency, frequently acts as a safe haven within the volatile crypto ecosystem. This phenomenon shapes current crypto market trends . During a Bitcoin Season , we typically see capital flowing from smaller altcoins into Bitcoin. This doesn’t necessarily mean altcoins are performing poorly in absolute terms, but rather that their altcoin performance is lagging significantly behind Bitcoin’s gains. This period allows Bitcoin to consolidate its position and often leads to new all-time highs for the leading cryptocurrency, further influencing overall cryptocurrency market analysis . Navigating Altcoin Performance in a Dominant Bitcoin Market Understanding the current market phase is vital for strategizing. If you hold a diversified portfolio, observing the Altcoin Season Index can guide your actions. While Bitcoin is leading, it doesn’t mean all altcoins are stagnant. Some specific sectors or projects might still show resilience or even individual pumps, but broad-based altcoin rallies are less likely during this phase, impacting general altcoin performance . For investors focused on maximizing altcoin performance , this period might be an opportunity to: Re-evaluate portfolios: Consider if your altcoin holdings align with your risk tolerance during a Bitcoin-led market. Research promising projects: Identify altcoins with strong fundamentals that might be undervalued for future gains. Dollar-cost average: Gradually accumulate positions in preferred altcoins, leveraging potentially lower prices before the next shift in crypto market trends . However, caution is always advised. The market remains dynamic, and trends can shift rapidly, requiring continuous cryptocurrency market analysis . What’s Next for Cryptocurrency Market Analysis? The question on everyone’s mind is, how long will this Bitcoin Season last? Predicting the exact shift in crypto market trends is challenging. Historically, market cycles often see Bitcoin lead, followed by large-cap altcoins, and then smaller-cap altcoins. The current Altcoin Season Index suggests we are still in the early stages of a Bitcoin-led phase, or perhaps a consolidation period before the next major move. Key factors to watch for a potential shift back towards Altcoin Season include: A significant surge in Bitcoin’s price, potentially reaching new highs, which often creates a “wealth effect” that spills over into altcoins. Increased institutional interest in specific altcoin sectors like DeFi or NFTs, influencing overall cryptocurrency market analysis . Major technological upgrades or positive news from prominent altcoin projects that could boost their altcoin performance . Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index regularly provides valuable context for your cryptocurrency market analysis and helps you stay ahead of evolving crypto market trends . Summary: Staying Ahead of the Curve The Altcoin Season Index at 43 clearly indicates that we are in a Bitcoin Season . This means Bitcoin is currently the dominant performer, influencing overall crypto market trends . While this phase presents challenges for broad altcoin performance , it also offers opportunities for strategic planning and careful asset accumulation. Staying informed about these indicators through diligent cryptocurrency market analysis is crucial for navigating the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape effectively. Keep an eye on the index for shifts that could signal the next big move! Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Altcoin Season Index?

This specific WLFI transfer has sparked considerable speculation within the crypto community, as it marks an unusual shift for the asset. On-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X first highlighted this significant movement. While BitGo is well-known for providing secure custody and prime brokerage services, typically for stablecoin reserves like USD1, this marks the first publicly known instance of WLFI tokens being transferred to their platform. This unprecedented move immediately raises questions about the future trajectory of the WLFI project. Understanding World Liberty Financial and BitGo Custody World Liberty Financial operates as a decentralized finance (DeFi) project. DeFi aims to recreate traditional financial services using blockchain technology, eliminating intermediaries. Projects like WLFI often involve various on-chain activities, including token transfers, liquidity provision, and governance. BitGo, on the other hand, is a leading player in the institutional digital asset space. They offer institutional-grade security solutions for cryptocurrencies, including secure storage (custody) and prime brokerage services. Their robust security infrastructure is designed to protect large volumes of digital assets from hacks and theft. The fact that WLFI chose BitGo custody for such a substantial amount of tokens underscores a focus on security and potentially, institutional-level engagement. Custody Services: BitGo ensures the secure storage of digital assets, often using cold storage solutions. Prime Brokerage: This service offers institutional clients a suite of trading and financial services. Trust and Security: Opting for BitGo suggests a strong emphasis on safeguarding the transferred WLFI tokens. The Significance of a Multi-Sig Wallet Move The transfer originated from a multi-sig wallet . A multi-signature wallet requires multiple private keys to authorize a transaction, rather than just one. This setup significantly enhances security, as it prevents any single individual from unilaterally controlling or moving funds. It is a common practice for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), large projects, or institutional entities to use multi-sig wallets for managing substantial treasuries. When a project uses a multi-sig wallet, it implies a collective decision-making process for significant actions. The fact that this multi-sig wallet initiated such a large WLFI transfer to a custodian like BitGo suggests a deliberate and coordinated strategic decision by the World Liberty Financial team or its key stakeholders. This is not an impulsive act but a planned execution. What Could This WLFI Token Movement Mean? The transfer of 3.58 billion WLFI token to BitGo opens up several avenues for speculation and potential developments. While the exact reasons remain undisclosed, the crypto community is actively discussing possible implications: Enhanced Security: Moving assets to a professional custodian like BitGo often signals a move towards increased security and institutional best practices. This could be a preparatory step for future large-scale operations. Preparation for Exchange Listing: A significant portion of tokens moved to a custodian could indicate an upcoming listing on a major cryptocurrency exchange. Exchanges often require tokens to be held by trusted custodians for liquidity and security purposes. Strategic Partnership or Investment: The transfer might precede a major partnership, investment, or even a token swap. BitGo’s prime brokerage services could facilitate such institutional-level dealings. Treasury Management: It could simply be a strategic move to manage the project’s treasury more securely and efficiently, possibly in anticipation of future operational needs or funding rounds. Regulatory Compliance: Engaging with regulated custodians like BitGo can be a step towards enhancing regulatory compliance, which is increasingly important in the evolving crypto landscape. The crypto market thrives on information and speculation. This substantial WLFI token transfer to a reputable custodian like BitGo is undoubtedly a significant event for the World Liberty Financial project. Investors and enthusiasts will be closely watching for official announcements or further on-chain activity to understand the full implications of this strategic move. In conclusion, the recent massive WLFI transfer from World Liberty Financial’s multi-sig wallet to BitGo custody is a noteworthy development. It highlights a strategic decision by the project, emphasizing security and potentially paving the way for significant future announcements. Whether it’s a new exchange listing, a major partnership, or enhanced treasury management, this move positions WLFI for potential evolution in the decentralized finance space. The crypto community remains vigilant, awaiting the next chapter in the World Liberty Financial story. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is World Liberty Financial (WLFI)?

It even briefly overtook Google’s market value to become the fifth-largest asset in the world. MAGACOIN FINANCE is also catching fire with traders, and many are watching it closely as the next big breakout. With institutional adoption growing and Federal Reserve rate cuts expected, analysts believe Bitcoin could climb to $200,000 before the end of 2025. The way people view it has changed. It’s no longer just a risky bet — it’s becoming a serious asset for protecting wealth. Bitcoin’s Historic Milestone The market cap of BTC briefly passed Google’s $2.45 trillion. It now sits at about $2.46 trillion, placing it alongside Apple and Microsoft. Industry leaders say this proves Bitcoin is now part of global financial infrastructure. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, predicts it could hit $250,000 if the Fed moves back to money printing. Other analysts believe $175,000 would put it on par with Apple’s valuation.

Litecoin (LTC) is gaining traction as payment providers seek rapid, inexpensive payments. Telegram has a huge audience that is giving toncoin (TON) a boost. Its payment tools have the potential to bring millions of new users into crypto. Conclusion The pathway to $200,000 BTC seems viable each week. Altcoins such as Chainlink, Litecoin and Toncoin are sharing the same optimistic tide.

As part of the go, the task or idea aims to establish its views, as it is listed as the ‘gamification motor’ for crypto. “Four years ago, we built Ronin because Axie Infinity needed a faster, more efficient network. Ethereum was still early in its scaling roadmap. Necessity was the mother of our invention.” Ronin wrote in a blog. “However, things are different now. Ethereum is BACK. Transaction costs and speeds are better than ever. We’re early to a new era of growth, and Ronin is ready to rise.” Although some networks, such as Celo—which started as an independent Layer 1—have transitioned into Layer 2s, such moves remain uncommon. Ronin’s relaunch is slated for the first half of 2026. Ronin taps Ethereum’s strength amid rising blockchain competition The move is built on a cross-current of trends, including fresh enthusiasm over Ethereum. The second-largest blockchain has been mired in a narrative war with Solana, the rival chain they stifled for years, but now succeeded in taking mindshare and users away from Ethereum, fuelling internet hatred against the Ethereum Foundation for focusing on L2s over scaling the mainchain. This is also happening at a time when competition for launching custom blockchains (Circle Arc, Tether Stable, Stripe Tempo) is heightening. Nonetheless, ETH has found strength during the past weeks, primarily via Wall Street’s welcoming to Ethereum (it is still home to a majority of stablecoins and real-world assets), which operates the longest-running and most secure smart contract chain that has never experienced any downtime, coupled with the success of Ethereum ETFs and the rise of Ethereum Treasury companies. In its announcement, Ronin highlighted Ethereum’s recent achievements, citing a now “lean, nimble, and responsive” Ethereum Foundation, growing “Wall Street attention and investment,” and technological advances that make operating a Layer 2 “more cost-effective than ever.” The Sky Mavis team, which developed Ronin and Axie Infinity, said leveraging Ethereum’s security will make Ronin’s tokenomics more effective. Whether Ronin will adopt a tech stack similar to Arbitrum or Optimism for its Layer 2 remains unclear. Previously, the blockchain used Polygon’s software development kit to enable game developers to create their own blockchains on the Ronin network. Ronin revamps tokenomics and security after high-profile hacks RON, down about 2.5% on the day, will serve as the native gas token. The team highlighted that Layer 2s incur “a small fee” for Ethereum data availability, which is used to verify rollup transactions on the base layer and “is much less expensive than compensating validators with $RON in security rewards.” The announcement also revealed that the new chain will be 12 times faster and introduce a Proof of Distribution tokenomics model aimed at rewarding developers. Under this system, RON staking rewards will shift from “passive validators” to “active builders,” determined by the size of their total stake and a “Builder Score.” This score incorporates on-chain metrics such as gas fees generated Since launching, Ronin has seen 31 million wallet downloads and over four billion dollars in NFT trading volume. Alongside Axie Infinity, one of the most well-known games during the pandemic-era bull run, the network also features many other web3 games. In March 2022, its customer Ronin lost $600 million in a hack organized by the same group of North Korean state-sponsored Lazarus, the biggest hack ever. The successful attackers controlled five of Ronin’s nine validators, sparking debate surrounding the network’s centralization. Ronin was hit again in August 2024 in a smaller attack. Lazarus’ hack played a central role in the Department of Justice’s prosecution of Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm, who faced trial on sanctions-related charges.

From institutional upgrades on Ethereum to fresh targets for XRP and Binance Coin, 2025 could shape the next wave of digital asset leaders. While established giants look set for steady gains, a fresh entrant is catching attention—MAGACOIN FINANCE. Positioned as a rising contender in the hunt for the best altcoin to buy now, this new player has analysts talking about explosive growth potential. XRP, Ethereum & BNB Price Outlook for 2025 XRP (Ripple) – Institutional Support Fuels Price Ambition XRP has long been considered one of the top altcoins 2025 investors are watching. Standard Chartered projects XRP could reach $5.50 by late 2025, with some forecasts stretching as high as $15.00 if adoption in cross-border settlements accelerates. The combination of legal clarity and growing banking partnerships keeps XRP on the radar as a best cryptocurrency to invest in. Ethereum (ETH) – ETF Demand and Network Strength Ethereum remains a frontrunner for developers and investors alike. Standard Chartered has boosted its year-end 2025 target from $4,000 to $7,500, citing strong ETF demand and an expanding DeFi ecosystem. Some bullish scenarios even point toward $15,000. With its role in powering NFTs, smart contracts, and decentralized applications, Ethereum continues to be a best altcoin to buy now for long-term growth. Binance Coin (BNB) – Exchange Utility Keeps It Competitive BNB remains the lifeblood of the Binance ecosystem, with trading fee discounts and DeFi integrations supporting demand. Digital Money Market analysts predict a price range of $950–$1,000 by the end of 2025. While BNB may not deliver the same speculative surge as smaller-cap projects, it holds strong appeal for those seeking reliable top altcoins 2025 exposure. Bullish Price Predictions for XRP, Ethereum, and BNB: Data from Perplexity MAGACOIN’s 4,200% Growth Projection Analysts tracking MAGACOIN FINANCE believe it could post gains exceeding 4,200% before the final quarter of 2025. This projection is tied to anticipated catalysts in adoption, exchange listings, and expanding community engagement. Early investor interest is building around MAGACOIN as it positions itself in the conversation for the best cryptocurrency to invest in alongside giants like XRP and Ethereum. The project’s market strategy blends liquidity growth with token scarcity mechanics, creating an environment where price acceleration could occur rapidly once key milestones are met. With crypto traders actively seeking the best altcoin to buy now ahead of 2025’s speculative rush, MAGACOIN is starting to look like a high-risk, high-reward candidate. Final Verdict – Established Leaders vs. Rising Contenders Investors face a split decision in 2025—stick with the established leaders like XRP, Ethereum, and BNB, or seek potentially higher percentage gains in emerging projects like MAGACOIN. XRP offers banking network growth, Ethereum anchors DeFi innovation, and BNB benefits from Binance’s reach. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN brings speculative upside and growth catalysts that analysts believe could yield exponential returns. Amidst all forecasts, MAGACOIN FINANCE is definitely making its way into watchlists for the best altcoin to buy now and could be one of the most discussed names when Q4 2025 rolls around.

While certain tokens move slowly, others are building firm foundations and drawing attention with solid growth strategies. This year’s key focus is finding the top crypto gainers to watch before they make their next move. From wallets that reward actual usage to DeFi platforms securing major liquidity, there are plenty of opportunities. The four projects below each offer different strengths, from utility and adoption to market leadership. Cold Wallet is reshaping self-custody with rewards, BNB is close to a potential breakout, UNI maintains strong revenue growth, and AAVE leads the DeFi lending market. Whether aiming for steady holds or short bursts of momentum, these are worth keeping on the radar. 1. Cold Wallet Brings Rewards to Self-Custody Cold Wallet is more than a storage tool; it’s a self-custody wallet designed to give back to users for every action. Now listed on CoinMarketCap, it offers transparent access to live price data and updates. The project is in Stage 17 of its presale, priced at $0.00998 per CWT, with $6.11 million already raised. Its 150-stage presale format rewards earlier entry with more tokens for the same cost. The CWT token powers a cashback system where gas fees, swaps, and on/off-ramp transactions return value directly to the user. Instead of paying for wallet usage, holders earn back with every transaction. The tiered program increases rewards based on CWT holdings, reaching up to 100% cashback on gas fees at the Diamond tier. No staking or lockups are required; holding tokens in the wallet is enough to unlock benefits. A referral program adds another layer, giving 10% CWT bonuses to referrers and 5% to referees during the presale, funded from a set rewards pool. Currently running on Ethereum L1, the presale will be followed by Layer 2 or custom rollup integration to lower costs and speed up reward delivery. With its cashback model, scaling plans, and clear purpose, Cold Wallet stands out as one of the most practical top crypto gainers to watch this year. 2. Uniswap (UNI) Approaching Breakout Territory Uniswap is trading at $11.54, moving between $10.83 and $11.74 during the day, with a clear bullish trend building since April 2025. The token has surged over 145% in that time and is nearing a key resistance zone around $14.50. UNI has managed to hold above $10.95, which matches the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement area, showing that buyers are maintaining control despite price swings. Large holders have been active in this range, adding strength to the bullish view. To keep the upward move going, UNI needs to break through the $14.50 resistance. The protocol continues to lead in decentralized exchange trading volume, supported by rising fee revenues and strong Total Value Locked. For anyone tracking the top crypto gainers to watch, UNI offers both short-term breakout potential and long-term relevance in DeFi infrastructure. With market liquidity expanding and more traders shifting to on-chain platforms, UNI’s revenue and network activity are well placed to stay strong. 3. Binance Coin (BNB) Closing in on Major Price Target BNB is priced at $835.43, with an intraday low of $799.01 and high of $839.14. Momentum is strong, and the token is close to breaking its immediate $850 resistance. Interest from institutions is growing, highlighted by a $160 million corporate purchase that has positioned BNB as a notable reserve asset. Analysts have also noted a bullish fractal that mirrors Bitcoin’s past price patterns, projecting a possible move toward $1,200 if the $850 barrier is cleared. BNB’s value is tied to its broad utility, from powering Binance’s exchange and transaction fees to supporting DeFi and NFT applications. Its market position remains solid, with expanding use cases adding to demand. For those narrowing their list of the top crypto gainers to watch in 2025, BNB brings both consistent utility and breakout potential. A decisive move above $850 could set the stage for its next major rally, and market watchers are keeping a close eye on it. 4. Aave (AAVE) Holding the Lead in DeFi Lending AAVE trades at $320.30, moving between $293.25 and $326.47 intraday. It has kept levels above $300, rebounding from its 200-day EMA and showing steady buying interest at important support points. The protocol’s growth is reflected in a major rise in Total Value Locked, jumping from about $8 billion in early 2024 to nearly $47 billion now. With deposits near $50 billion and loans at $26 billion, Aave captures roughly 71% of revenue in the DeFi lending sector. The project is also seeing more liquidity after Coinbase relaunched its stablecoin bootstrap fund, with early allocations flowing into Aave. While technicals hint at a possible retest of the $269–$272 area, the core fundamentals remain solid. For anyone focused on the top crypto gainers to watch with proven dominance, AAVE’s market leadership and institutional relevance make it a key name. Its ability to maintain price stability while holding such a large market share keeps it firmly in focus. Final Perspective The second half of 2025 will be crucial for projects combining strong fundamentals with growing user adoption. Cold Wallet’s reward-focused self-custody model and active presale keep it unique in this lineup, boosted by its CoinMarketCap presence. UNI’s push toward a breakout, BNB’s path to $1,200, and AAVE’s stronghold on DeFi lending each offer clear reasons for attention. What ties these picks together is visible progress backed by active participation from their user bases. Whether through network utility, market share, or transaction volume, these four have the potential to guide market discussions this year. Keep them among your top crypto gainers to watch , and remember that in 2025, timing could be the key to capturing the biggest gains.

The conversation featured an on-air exchange where one commentator posed the question of whether XRP could be the “next big breakout coin,” before turning to BK, the station’s crypto expert, for practical insights. BK framed XRP’s potential in the context of international finance, noting that Ripple is targeting the SWIFT network in cross-border payments. He explained that this approach represents an upgrade to the existing global financial infrastructure, a market with substantial value and influence. “That’s a very big market,” he remarked, adding that this scope is a core reason for investor enthusiasm. The discussion then shifted to a brief demonstration of how to purchase XRP, highlighting the accessibility of cryptocurrency markets, which operate around the clock and are now easier to engage with than ever before.

The takeover has begun! #Crypto #BullRun pic.twitter.com/7I6ONstu2O — Ripple Queen (@Ripple_queen) August 14, 2025 XRP Receives Mainstream Recognition Ripple Queen (@Ripple_queen), a well-known crypto influencer on X, posted the clip with a caption declaring, “The FUD is dead. The truth is out. The takeover has begun!” She sees the coverage as a milestone moment for XRP, as this mainstream recognition could bolster investor confidence and potentially help it reach a wider audience. Her post quickly circulated on X, with many community members viewing the mainstream media acknowledgment as a validation of the digital asset’s long-term viability. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Modernization of the global payment system is a key part of XRP’s value proposition, and this recognition reinforces the narrative that the digital asset can play a central role in the evolving digital asset ecosystem, showing its potential to dominate the cross-border payment market . Improving Market Sentiment This mainstream recognition signals a stronger alignment between traditional financial platforms and the cryptocurrency community’s confidence in XRP. Ripple’s ambition to replace or enhance established payment infrastructure positions it uniquely in the market, and the prospect of challenging systems like SWIFT continues to appeal to investors who prioritize projects with clear, practical use cases. Positive media narratives can influence investor psychology, particularly when they come from high-profile outlets. In this case, CNBC’s portrayal of XRP as a potential “next big breakout” asset could help improve institutional confidence in the digital asset.

Having already raised over $373 million in its presale and now in Batch 29 at $0.0276, it’s rapidly approaching its ambitious $600 million target. Holders aren’t just buying a coin, they’re joining an expanding ecosystem fueled by real adoption, ultra-fast technology, and a growing global community. With speculation hinting at a potential $1 valuation after listing, today’s entry point could deliver more than 36x returns for those acting quickly. Unmatched Presale Performance BlockDAG’s presale performance has been nothing short of extraordinary. The project has already attracted 200,000+ holders, sold 19,000 ASIC miners, and drawn in 2.5 million X1 Miner app users from around the globe. This level of participation before trading even begins shows deep conviction from both retail buyers and high-net-worth whales. At Batch 29’s price of $0.0276, the confirmed listing price of $0.05 secures early adopters an immediate 81% paper gain before market debut. Recent buying trends indicate heavy accumulation from large-scale holders. Many are drawn to BlockDAG’s hybrid Proof-of-Work + DAG consensus combined with full EVM compatibility, a rare union of security, scalability, and developer freedom. Its marketing influence is also growing through high-profile partnerships, including sponsorship deals with Inter Milan, the Seattle Seawolves, and the Seattle Orcas, boosting visibility in sports markets across Europe, North America, and Asia. A Developer-First Ecosystem BlockDAG is not just capturing buyer interest, it’s building the infrastructure for lasting growth. The network already supports 4,500+ developers working on over 300 decentralized applications, spanning from DeFi protocols to NFT marketplaces. Thanks to EVM compatibility, Ethereum-based projects can migrate seamlessly, accelerating the dApp ecosystem’s expansion. This makes BlockDAG a credible Layer-1 contender alongside Solana, Avalanche, and Kaspa. While the listing price is set at $0.05, analysts foresee a rapid rise toward $1 during the next major bull cycle. This expectation rests on three pillars: presale scale, ecosystem adoption, and launch liquidity. If achieved, that would mean a 36x gain from the Batch 29 price, transforming a $5,000 holding into $180,000. For those chasing asymmetric upside, few assets in 2025 present a stronger case. The Urgency Factor Each stage of the presale triggers an automatic price increase, ensuring today’s buyers always lock in better terms than tomorrow’s. With the project already halfway to its $600M target, available supply is tightening as demand surges. The momentum is compounding, whales are expanding positions, retail users are joining through the X1 Miner app, and global partnerships are boosting awareness. The window for sub-$0.03 pricing is narrowing rapidly. From its record-breaking presale achievements to its expanding developer community and aggressive global marketing strategy, BlockDAG has firmly positioned itself as the standout crypto to buy right now . With Batch 29 priced at $0.0276, $373M raised, and a realistic $1 post-listing target, this is one of those rare crypto moments where early positioning could define future returns. In a market driven by both utility and hype, BlockDAG offers both in abundance, and the smart money is already moving in.

Related Reading: Chainlink Breaks 3-Month High Amid Record 2025 Enthusiasm That registration is an early, procedural move and does not mean the fund has been filed with or approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Markets reacted quickly; TRUMP rebounded from about $9.35 to $9.55 after the news, marking just over 10% gains for the week at press time. Regulatory Route And Competing Filings Based on reports, the registration adds to a growing list of institutional bids to package memecoins. Companies such as Grayscale, Bitwise, and 21Shares have already pursued funds linked to Dogecoin, while Osprey Funds and REX Shares filed for TRUMP-related products earlier in the year on January 21. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas has suggested Canary may be positioning for a filing under the 33 Act, which would differ from other teams that have used the 40 Act. That choice could change the form of filings and the timeline for review. Looks Canary is prepping to poss file for first Trump Coin ETF via the ’33 Act. They registered the name an entity as statutory trust (33 act). Tuttle has Trump (and Melania) coin ETFs filed but via ’40 Act.. h/t source: @Cointelegraph pic.twitter.com/crz2ZApHkE — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 13, 2025 What Registration Means And Why It Matters An entity registration in Delaware is a common legal step before formal SEC submissions like S-1s or 19b-4s. It signals intent and lets market participants spot plans early. It does not mean the SEC has weighed in, and approval would still hinge on custody, market surveillance, and other protections regulators demand. The filing has given TRUMP token holders reason for optimism because a regulated vehicle could bring new liquidity, but it would not change the token’s fundamentals. Momentum And Market Moves Reports have disclosed that the TRUMP token saw a price uptick after the registration announcement. That reaction is typical: headlines attract retail attention, and memecoins are highly sensitive to news flow. Related Reading: Dogecoin Draws New Attention As Open Interest Tops $3 Billion Still, TRUMP remains far below its January peak of $75 — about 60% below that high — and any fund launch would only channel speculation into a regulated wrapper, not create earnings or cash flows for the token itself. There are risks to watch. Memecoins are commonly treated as commodities by regulators, which helps the case for ETF structures, but concentration in a few wallets, unclear custody arrangements, and the potential for market manipulation are real concerns. Approval would likely require third-party custody, audits, and exchange surveillance plans that make the product less fragile than an unregulated token listing.

50161246,557890,1755309638,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50161246.jpeg,New York’s 0.2% Crypto Tax Push Sparks Fears of a Market Sell-Off,https://bitcoinist.com/new-yorks-crypto-tax-push-sparks-fears-market-sell/,"New York may soon add another chapter to its already strict crypto regulation playbook. Assembly Bill 8966, introduced by Democratic Assembly member Phil Steck, proposes a 0.2% excise tax on all crypto and NFT transactions, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins. If approved, the crypto tax would take effect on September 1, applying to both individuals and institutions trading digital assets in the state. Though 0.2% might seem small, the cumulative impact on high-frequency traders and large-scale transactions could be significant. A $50,000 Bitcoin sale, for example, would incur a $100 tax. The revenue, however, wouldn’t just go to the state’s general fund, it would be earmarked for substance abuse prevention and intervention programs in upstate New York schools. New York’s Regulatory History and Market Concerns New York has a history of leading strict crypto oversight. In 2015, the BitLicense framework became one of the first comprehensive regulatory regimes in the U.S., prompting some companies to exit the state due to compliance burdens. Now, this proposed tax could once again reshape trading behavior, potentially pushing traders toward states with more favorable laws such as Texas or Washington. Critics warn that the new levy might discourage innovation and drive crypto activity out of New York, weakening its status as a hub for blockchain startups and financial technology. Supporters argue the crypto tax is modest and has a clear social benefit, making it a fair trade-off for the industry’s long-term stability. What the Crypto Tax Regulation Means for Investors Before becoming law, Assembly Bill 8966 must pass committee review, a full Assembly vote, the Senate, and finally, secure the governor’s signature. The crypto industry is expected to lobby heavily during this process, citing concerns over competitiveness and market liquidity. If passed, New York’s move could set a precedent for state-level crypto taxation models, especially in the absence of federal rules. Other states may follow suit, particularly if the tax generates significant revenue without severely harming market participation. For now, traders and investors are watching closely. With Bitcoin recently hitting $124,000, any change in transaction costs could influence trading strategies, and if fears of a sell-off materialize, the impact might be felt far beyond New York’s borders.

They argue that these policies have been crucial to their growth and have helped them remain competitive against China. The appeal comes in response to new regulations proposed under the Trump administration, which tighten the eligibility of AI projects for federal renewable energy tax credits. Critics warn that these changes could slow power infrastructure development, potentially limiting electricity supply to data centers as AI demand continues to rise. In a letter to Bessent dated August 4, the data center owners stated that any current delays in introducing new energy supplies could greatly affect their capability to fulfill future electricity demand in the AI boom era. The Trump administration sets up stricter regulations for wind and solar energy subsidies Last month, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order demanding stricter regulatory measures for renewable energy tax credits. This also applied to AI projects, altering their initial construction definition. Industry executives mentioned that they had strictly adhered to the regulations set for the wind and solar energy subsidies for the past decade. Meanwhile, apart from data center owners, Clean Energy Associates, a North America-based firm highly reputed for reliable data and analysis in the solar and energy storage projects, also cautioned that if the Trump administration’s stricter regulations take effect, then the US should be ready to face a 60-gigawatt loss of solar power development come 2030. Additionally, these stricter regulations will affect the United States’ economic status. To illustrate this, reliable research reveals that the data center sector alone contributes roughly $3.5 trillion to the country’s total gross domestic product from 2017 to 2023. In addition, it offers job opportunities to around 600,000 individuals, per DCC’s analysis. The fate of these regulations will be determined on August 18, the deadline for the Treasury Department to release the final updated regulations for wind and solar energy subsidies. Trump refers to wind and solar energy as “unreliable” forms of energy On Friday, August 15, the US Treasury Department unveiled stricter regulations for solar and wind projects that required full physical attention from developers running big solar and wind projects, not the amount of funds they had invested in the project. Since Trump took office in January, his goal has been to reduce the industry’s dependence on wind and solar energy. Based on his argument, these energy sources are unreliable, expensive, and are connected to China’s supply chains. Hence, with these new regulations in place, Trump asserts that it will limit who can get tax credits. However, unless a massive part of a facility is constructed, this limitation will not apply. To be eligible for a 30% tax credit and bonuses to increase one’s subsidy, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act , which Trump recently signed into law, highlights that projects must be initiated by July 2026 or start operating by the end of 2027. Furthermore, these new regulations demand utility-scale projects to be highly centered on physical work to qualify for the credits for projects set to start construction on or immediately after September 2. In the meantime, the sector has four years to claim the subsidies.

His discussion sheds light on how these entities operate and their potential impact on the broader Ethereum ecosystem, offering a balanced view on their sustainability and inherent risks. What Are ETH Treasury Companies and Why Do They Matter? ETH treasury companies represent a fascinating development in the crypto space. Buterin explained that these companies acquire Ethereum (ETH) using funds raised from investors, rather than their own capital. This approach effectively broadens access to ETH, allowing more participants to engage with the asset without directly purchasing it on exchanges. For the Ethereum ecosystem, these companies can act as significant holders and potentially stabilize the market by providing consistent demand. They offer a structured way for traditional investors or institutions to gain exposure to ETH, fostering greater adoption and liquidity. Their growth signifies increasing maturity in the crypto market. Navigating the Perils of Crypto Leverage: Vitalik’s Crucial Warning While acknowledging the benefits, Buterin also issued a significant warning regarding excessive crypto leverage . He emphasized that relying too heavily on borrowed funds can create instability. If the market experiences a downturn, highly leveraged positions can lead to forced liquidations, putting downward pressure on ETH prices. This risk is a critical consideration for any entity dealing with substantial ETH holdings. It is important for these companies to manage their financial strategies prudently. Over-leveraging could undermine the very stability they aim to bring to the market. Buterin’s caution serves as a reminder for all participants to prioritize responsible financial practices, ensuring a more sustainable crypto future. Ensuring Sustainability in the Ethereum Ecosystem Despite the leverage risks, Vitalik Buterin maintains a largely optimistic outlook on the overall Ethereum ecosystem . He believes that the majority of participants are responsible and understand the importance of sustainable growth. This responsibility is key to the long-term viability of ETH treasury companies . For these entities to remain sustainable, effective management is paramount. This includes: Prudent Risk Management: Implementing robust strategies to mitigate market volatility and liquidation risks. Diversification: Exploring diversified investment approaches beyond just holding ETH. Transparent Operations: Building trust with investors through clear reporting and accountability. These practices contribute to a resilient and healthy crypto environment, fostering genuine sustainable crypto development. Vitalik Buterin’s Vision for Responsible Growth Buterin’s insights underscore a broader theme: the need for maturity and responsibility as the crypto industry expands. He envisions a future where ETH treasury companies can thrive, provided they operate within sensible financial frameworks. His statements offer valuable guidance not just for these specific companies, but for anyone involved in large-scale crypto investments. His emphasis on sustainability over speculative gains reinforces the foundational principles of a robust blockchain network. By prioritizing long-term health, the entire Ethereum community can build a more secure and prosperous future, demonstrating a commitment to sustainable crypto practices. In conclusion, Vitalik Buterin’s recent comments provide a compelling roadmap for ETH treasury companies . While they offer immense potential for broadening access to Ethereum and supporting its ecosystem, the critical caveat lies in managing crypto leverage responsibly. His balanced perspective highlights that with careful stewardship, these companies can indeed achieve sustainability, contributing positively to the dynamic world of Ethereum .

Whale wallet movements are lighting up blockchain trackers, with large crypto transactions suggesting something big is brewing. When major wallets start shifting assets, history says the tide can turn fast — and the best new meme coins for exponential returns are often the first to ride the swell. Over the past week, on-chain analysis has picked up massive digital asset whale movements across multiple meme coins, setting the stage for potential breakouts. These aren’t random blips — they’re coordinated plays. Cryptocurrency whale watch reports are flagging heavy accumulation in three standout projects: Arctic Pablo Coin (presale), FLOKI, and Brett. Each brings its own narrative, numbers, and market catalysts, and all three could deliver serious upside. Arctic Pablo Coin — The Myth, The Math, And The Million-Dollar Scenario In the heart of an icy expanse where legend meets ledger, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) isn’t just another token — it’s an unfolding adventure and a standout among the best new meme coins for exponential returns. Picture Pablo, a fearless snowmobile rider, carving through frostbitten terrains to uncover mystical $APC tokens hidden in ice-covered islands. Every meme coin presale stage is a new chapter in his journey, tied to unique mythical locations, and every week ends with unsold tokens burned — permanently gone, tightening supply. Whale Activity Alert: Massive token transfers detected in Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale wallets. Big players are moving in silence — could this be the opening act of a major run for one of the best new meme coins for exponential returns? Here’s where the math gets thrilling: invest $100,000 today in Stage 36 (price: $0.0008), and you’ll bag 125,000,000 APC tokens. If $APC lists at $0.008, that’s a cool $1,000,000 portfolio. Analysts say it could push to $0.10 in a bullish market — a staggering 12,400% ROI from today’s price. The project’s 66% APY staking sweetens the pot. Stake your APC tokens and earn while you wait, with all rewards vested for two months post-launch. Add referral bonuses and community competitions with USD prizes, and Pablo’s world isn’t just fun — it’s financially charged. Presale Momentum: Over $3.39M raised so far. Price climbs every week, no exceptions. Early joiners from Stage 1 are already sitting on over 5,233% ROI on paper. With each week’s burn, the deflationary environment tightens supply further, enhancing scarcity and value. Arctic Pablo Coin blends a high-ROI presale model, aggressive token burns, and a marketing narrative that hooks both retail and whale investors — exactly what earns it a place among the best new meme coins for exponential returns . FLOKI — Viking Spirit Meets Whale Strength FLOKI has been here before — storming social media, grabbing headlines, and turning small wallets into war chests. Priced today at $0.0001075 with a $1.02B market cap and $155.78M in 24-hour trading volume, FLOKI is riding a 9.08% weekly gain despite a daily pullback. FLOKI trades nearly 69% below its June 2024 all-time high, meaning there’s plenty of headroom. Despite this, it’s still up an insane 537,375% from its August 2021 all-time low — proof of its ability to pull off monster rallies. Community engagement remains its strongest asset. FLOKI’s marketing machine is relentless, blending aggressive influencer pushes with strategic token burns and ecosystem expansions. For investors hunting the best meme coins for exponential returns, FLOKI’s mix of brand power and whale accumulation makes it a solid contender. Brett — The Silent Heavyweight Of Meme Coins Brett, the Based meme token, sits at $0.05682 with a $563.15M market cap and $61.77M daily volume. While flat for the week, its long-term trajectory is anything but boring. From a February 2024 all-time low, Brett is up 52,775% — even after being 75% down from its December 2024 high. Unlike some meme coins that lean solely on hype, Brett has built a loyal holder base, with 9.91B of its 10B max supply already in circulation. This creates a scarcity setup whales love — fewer tokens available means higher price sensitivity when demand spikes. For those watching blockchain whale tracking tools, Brett’s recent large investor crypto moves suggest coordinated buying pressure. When the largest holders start moving, it’s rarely accidental. Final Take Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin, FLOKI, and Brett all show the rare convergence of narrative appeal, whale wallet movements, and market positioning that define the best new meme coins for exponential returns . Arctic Pablo Coin offers a presale with jaw-dropping ROI potential, deflationary burns, and staking rewards. FLOKI blends massive brand awareness with whale support. Brett brings scarcity and silent accumulation into play. The whales aren’t sleeping — they’re circling. If history repeats, the tide is about to shift. This is your moment to act before the price charts tell the story everyone wishes they’d caught earlier. Join the Arctic Pablo Coin presale now. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ Short Summary: Arctic Pablo Coin, FLOKI, and Brett are whale-backed meme coins primed for exponential returns. With Pablo’s presale math, FLOKI’s Viking momentum, and Brett’s scarcity, they could ride the next big crypto wave. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

This entity, reportedly associated with the Trump family, recently completed a significant ETH investment and WBTC purchase , signaling a noteworthy development in the ongoing saga of institutional crypto adoption . The total outlay for these digital assets reached an impressive $18.6 million, according to data from on-chain analytics platform Onchain Lens on X. This strategic acquisition of 1,911 ETH (valued at $8.6 million) and 84.5 WBTC (worth $10 million) has certainly captured the attention of participants in the ever-evolving DeFi market trends . What’s Behind the World Liberty Finance Crypto Purchase? This substantial World Liberty Finance crypto purchase involved a direct exchange of $18.6 million in USDC stablecoin for two of the most significant cryptocurrencies: Ethereum (ETH) and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). The transaction highlights a clear intent to gain exposure to leading digital assets. Onchain Lens, a reputable on-chain analytics platform, provided the crucial data regarding these transactions. Their reports confirm the specific amounts and assets involved, lending credibility to the news. Such transparency in blockchain data allows for real-time tracking of major movements within the crypto ecosystem. For a DeFi project like World Liberty Finance, accumulating significant amounts of ETH and WBTC can serve multiple strategic purposes. These assets are fundamental to many decentralized finance protocols, offering liquidity provision, collateral opportunities, and participation in various yield-generating strategies. This strategic acquisition positions the project to potentially expand its DeFi offerings or bolster its treasury. Why is This ETH Investment and WBTC Purchase So Significant? The ETH investment and WBTC purchase by World Liberty Finance carries considerable weight for the broader crypto market . When entities with notable affiliations or substantial capital deploy funds into cryptocurrencies, it often sends a ripple effect through the industry. This move underscores a growing trend of institutional crypto adoption . While the term “institutional” can encompass a wide range of entities, a project linked to a high-profile family signals increasing mainstream interest and confidence in digital assets. It suggests that even traditional finance circles are recognizing the long-term value proposition of cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, investing in ETH and WBTC, specifically, demonstrates a focus on established, high-liquidity assets. These are not speculative altcoin plays but rather investments in the foundational layers of the decentralized economy. This approach often indicates a more measured and strategic long-term outlook for the involved parties. Decoding DeFi Market Trends: What Does This Mean for the Future? This major transaction offers valuable insights into current DeFi market trends . Decentralized finance continues to be a vibrant and innovative sector within the crypto space, offering alternatives to traditional financial services. The significant capital deployment by World Liberty Finance into core DeFi assets like ETH and WBTC suggests a belief in the continued growth and utility of decentralized protocols. It can also imply an intent to participate more actively in the DeFi ecosystem, perhaps by contributing to liquidity pools or utilizing these assets as collateral for borrowing and lending. While the benefits of DeFi participation are vast, including potential yield generation and financial autonomy, challenges also exist. These can include smart contract risks, impermanent loss in liquidity pools, and regulatory uncertainties. However, large investments like this indicate that the perceived benefits are outweighing the risks for some major players in the market. The Road Ahead: Bolstering Institutional Crypto Adoption The substantial World Liberty Finance investment serves as a strong indicator of the evolving landscape of institutional crypto adoption . We are witnessing a gradual but steady shift where more traditional and well-capitalized entities are entering the digital asset arena. Actionable Insights for Investors: Diversify Your Portfolio: While ETH and WBTC are strong choices, the broader crypto market offers many opportunities. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on on-chain analytics and reputable news sources to track major movements. Understand the Fundamentals: Before investing, research the underlying technology and use cases of different cryptocurrencies. Assess Risk: Cryptocurrencies remain volatile. Only invest what you can afford to lose. This trend of significant capital entering the market from various sources, including projects like World Liberty Finance, could contribute to increased liquidity, stability, and ultimately, wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the global financial system. In conclusion, the recent $18.6 million ETH investment and WBTC purchase by World Liberty Finance is a compelling development in the crypto space. It not only highlights a significant capital injection into leading digital assets but also reinforces the accelerating pace of institutional crypto adoption and the ongoing maturation of DeFi market trends . This bold move by a notable DeFi project underscores the growing confidence in the long-term viability and potential of decentralized finance and the broader crypto economy.

As the likes of Dogecoin and Polygon (MATIC) continue to dominate the news for a range of reasons, smart investors are starting to notice a new disruptive token that might surpass all of them: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Dogecoin: Short-Term Pain, Long-Term Promise? Dogecoin, the original meme coin, has had some issues with its price lately. On August 14, 2025, its value went down by 8.4% within a day, after the U.S. inflation figures (PPI at 3.7% against a forecast of 3.0%) came out and were higher than expected. But it’s not all bad news. DOGE formed its first “golden cross” of 2025 , a bullish technical signal. There’s been a $6 million investment into Dogecoin ecosystem projects . These moves suggest Dogecoin might be preparing for a comeback— but it depends on macroeconomic shifts , and that’s a wild card. Polygon (MATIC): A 30x Opportunity or a Risky Bet? Polygon is undergoing major changes that could either catapult it to new heights or cause short-term hiccups. August 26 : MATIC will migrate to POL , a new token designed to drive the next phase of the Polygon ecosystem. August 27 : The network will go through a 6-hour maintenance to roll out native USDT0 support , improving stablecoin infrastructure. Leadership is shifting gears with co-founder Sandeep Nailwal becoming CEO , fast-tracking interoperability and scalability projects. MATIC’s current RSI (Relative Strength Index) is sitting at 38 , hinting at oversold territory —a potential signal for undervaluation. Still, regulatory uncertainties and cautious investor sentiment around the migration are keeping prices suppressed. In short, Polygon has long-term potential , but the near-term is cloudy . MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Fresh Opportunity Investors Need While Dogecoin rides the meme wave and Polygon upgrades its engine, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly preparing to dominate the next bullish cycle —and smart investors are taking notice. While Dogecoin and Polygon are making waves, their growth is increasingly constrained by existing valuations, macro trends, and technological bottlenecks. In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents a clean slate with exponential upside . MAGACOIN FINANCE has been recently listed among the best altcoins to buy now, especially for those looking to outperform during the upcoming altseason. This recognition highlights the project’s strong potential, early-stage growth, and increasing investor attention, making it a promising pick for big returns in 2025 and beyond. If you missed the early days of DOGE or didn’t get in on MATIC when it was under a cent, this might be your second chance . Final Thought Making real business in a market filled with noise is not an easy task, you need to have clear sight and be brave enough to find the right opportunities. While the likes of Dogecoin and Polygon are attracting a lot of attention, it seems that MAGACOIN FINANCE is not speaking loudly but is still gaining traction as the next big token .

On August 15, these investment vehicles collectively experienced a net outflow, a development that caught the attention of many market observers. Understanding these movements is crucial for anyone tracking the evolving institutional interest in digital assets. Unpacking the Latest Bitcoin ETF Outflows Recent reports from Trader T on X revealed that U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net outflow of $14.02 million on August 15. This figure, while not massive in the grand scheme of the crypto market, provides valuable insight into the daily ebb and flow of institutional and retail capital. Grayscale’s GBTC : This prominent fund saw significant outflows, totaling $81.82 million. GBTC’s movements often have a notable impact due to its size and history. ARK Invest’s ARKB : Following a similar trend, ARKB also reported outflows, amounting to $46.71 million for the day. BlackRock’s IBIT : In contrast to the outflows, IBIT posted a strong inflow of $114.51 million. This highlights continued demand for certain products even amidst overall net outflows. The remaining spot Bitcoin ETF products largely maintained their holdings, showing no dramatic shifts on that particular day. What Do These Bitcoin ETF Outflows Signify for Crypto ETF Performance? When we observe Bitcoin ETF outflows , it is natural to question their underlying implications. These daily fluctuations are often a blend of various factors, including market sentiment, profit-taking by investors, and strategic rebalancing of portfolios. While a net outflow might seem concerning, it is important to consider the broader context. For instance, the significant inflow into BlackRock’s IBIT suggests that capital is not necessarily leaving the Bitcoin ETF space entirely. Instead, it might be shifting between different products or finding new entry points. This dynamic demonstrates the maturing nature of the crypto ETF performance market, where different funds attract varying levels of investor confidence and liquidity. Analyzing these shifts is key to understanding overall crypto ETF performance trends. Understanding these dynamics helps investors make informed decisions. It’s not just about the total net figure, but also about which specific funds are experiencing these shifts and why. Navigating Spot Bitcoin ETF Investments: Key Insights For investors looking at U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs , daily net flows offer a snapshot, but long-term trends provide a clearer picture. Here are some actionable insights: Look Beyond Daily Volatility : A single day’s outflow, like the $14.02 million observed, does not necessarily indicate a sustained bearish trend. Market participants often adjust positions for various reasons. Monitor Individual Fund Performance : The contrasting movements of GBTC and IBIT underscore the importance of evaluating individual spot Bitcoin ETF products. Each fund has its own fee structure, liquidity, and investor base. Consider Broader Market Conditions : Bitcoin’s price action and the overall cryptocurrency market sentiment play a significant role in influencing ETF flows. These ETFs are inherently linked to the underlying asset. Diversify Your Portfolio : Relying solely on one type of investment can be risky. A balanced approach, considering other asset classes and investment strategies, is often prudent. Ultimately, the performance of these ETFs reflects the ongoing evolution of institutional adoption and investor appetite for Bitcoin exposure through regulated financial products. Conclusion: The Evolving Landscape of U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs The $14.02 million net outflow from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on August 15 serves as a reminder of the dynamic nature of the crypto investment landscape. While funds like Grayscale’s GBTC and ARK Invest’s ARKB saw outflows, BlackRock’s IBIT demonstrated robust inflows, highlighting a nuanced picture rather than a uniform exodus. These daily movements are part of a larger narrative concerning institutional engagement and the continuous maturation of the Bitcoin market. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider the broader context when interpreting such data points. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What caused the $14.02 million net outflow from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on August 15? A1: The net outflow was a result of various factors, including significant outflows from Grayscale’s GBTC and ARK Invest’s ARKB, partially offset by substantial inflows into BlackRock’s IBIT. Daily market dynamics, investor rebalancing, and profit-taking likely contributed. Q2: How do individual fund movements, like GBTC and IBIT, impact overall Bitcoin ETF outflows? A2: Individual fund movements directly contribute to the overall net flow. Large outflows from one fund, even if another sees inflows, can still result in a net outflow for the entire sector, indicating shifts in investor preference or strategy across different spot Bitcoin ETF products. Q3: Are Bitcoin ETF outflows a sign of declining institutional interest? A3: Not necessarily. While some funds experienced outflows, others like BlackRock’s IBIT saw significant inflows. This suggests a reallocation of capital within the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs market rather than a complete withdrawal of institutional interest. Q4: What should investors consider when interpreting daily spot Bitcoin ETF flow data? A4: Investors should look beyond daily numbers and consider long-term trends, the performance of individual funds, broader market conditions, and their own diversification strategies. Daily flows are snapshots, not definitive indicators of sustained market direction. Q5: How does crypto ETF performance relate to the broader crypto market? A5: Crypto ETF performance is closely tied to the underlying cryptocurrency market, especially Bitcoin’s price. ETF flows can reflect investor sentiment towards Bitcoin and the digital asset space, and significant movements can sometimes influence market liquidity and sentiment.

To seasoned traders, this is a matter of opportunity rather than concern. Numerous coins are trading at prices that have not been witnessed in weeks. This has provided an opportunity to those buyers who had been waiting on the sidelines. Certain investors are currently capitalizing on such prices to create their positions. This dip has also attracted attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE. Arbitrum Gains More Attention The development of Arbitrum continues. It is one of the most popular networks in the layer-2 scaling world now. Its network grows with new applications each week. The recent decline in prices renders the ARB tokens more affordable. The more investors have confidence in Ethereum scaling solutions, the more they are purchasing. Arbitrum has an expanding ecosystem, which makes it a good prospect to grow in the long term. NEAR Protocol Draws Long-Term Buyers NEAR Protocol is gaining more recognition for its developer-friendly platform. The focus of the protocol on scalability and low transaction fees is helping adoption. This correction has given long-term holders a good entry point. Activity on the NEAR blockchain is increasing steadily. Some analysts see its ecosystem as one of the most promising in the industry. Hedera’s Utility Attracts Interest Hedera Hashgraph is known to have a very unique consensus mechanism. It is gaining attention because its products are geared towards businesses. Large corporations are already developing on its network. In recent weeks, HBAR, the token of the network, has lost some of its value, and value hunters are taking notice. They believe that the token is undervalued relative to its potential worth. Reliability and performance are good buying motives. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Support MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum during this correction. Some Solana investors are diversifying into MAGACOINFINANCE for bigger upside. The new price run is sparking the increased attention of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its presale phase remains open and early investors perceive it as a high-reward move preceding its wider market prominence. It has a community-based strategy that is fostering robust engagement. According to analysts, the sentiment shift might favor MAGACOIN FINANCE. The riskier traders are finding the speculative plays more attractive due to the low market prices. Why This Window Matters Large price moves shake out the short-term speculators and leave them open to the long-term buyer. It can serve as the cushion that leads to the next rally. New attention is paid to new tokens like Arbitrum, NEAR, Hedera, and MAGACOIN FINANCE as they maintain good values despite declining prices. Conclusion Market corrections are not necessarily bad news. They can serve as the perfect opportunity to line up for the next push-up. Arbitrum, Near, and Hedera appear under valuated and MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly a popular choice among those in search of greater upside as well.

The Cardano ADA price surge has advanced past important resistance levels, while the Polkadot DOT technical setup shows stability by defending key support and drawing increased institutional interest. Yet, BlockDAG ’s achievements extend far beyond technical patterns. Its recent 10 BTC Auction awarded more than $1.206 million to top participants, while the presale has reached $374 million, advanced to batch 29 at $0.0276, and delivered a 2,660% ROI since batch 1, firmly establishing it among the top crypto picks. BlockDAG’s 10 BTC Auction Celebrates Leading Performers BlockDAG has recognized its standout performers following the close of its highly contested 10 BTC Auction, distributing over $1.206 million in prizes based on current Bitcoin values. Ten winners, identified by wallet addresses, earned their share of this notable reward pool, setting a new mark for community-driven milestones. This reflects not only their strategy and dedication but also the opportunities available within the BlockDAG network for those willing to engage and compete. The auction’s relevance reaches beyond the immediate prize distribution. It showcases BlockDAG’s focus on offering verifiable, high-value incentives that strengthen community involvement. By spotlighting these leading performers, the project reinforces the benefits of active participation and motivates others to join future competitions. In parallel, this milestone supports BlockDAG’s notable presale progress. With $374 million raised, a current price of $0.0276 in batch 29, and a 2,660% ROI since batch 1, alongside over 25 billion coins sold, the project continues to stand out among the top crypto picks for those seeking growth and consistent engagement opportunities. For the wider audience, these results serve as proof that strategic involvement can deliver exceptional returns. Whether through auctions, competitions, or presale participation, BlockDAG continues to provide meaningful pathways for success, with more opportunities ahead for new names to join its growing legacy. Polkadot’s Technical Strength Signals Recovery Potential The Polkadot DOT technical setup is showing resilience after holding the $3.84–$3.86 support zone and rebounding by more than 4%. The breakout above $3.92 resistance was supported by high trading volume, pushing DOT into an ascending channel with targets set between $4.15 and $4.20. Institutional buying during this breakout was substantial, with trading volume surpassing 7 million, signaling notable interest from larger market players. Developer activity further strengthens the outlook, with Polkadot ranked among the leading projects in both core development and ecosystem contributions. This combination of technical performance and consistent fundamentals underpins confidence in DOT’s continued upward movement. By securing critical support and attracting institutional demand, Polkadot is positioned for further gains. The present setup offers both traders and long-term holders a compelling opportunity to follow its momentum as the market watches for its next move. Cardano’s Momentum Pushes Toward Higher Targets The Cardano ADA price surge reflects renewed strength, as it climbed from the $0.68 support, moving above resistance levels at $0.75 and $0.80. This rise was reinforced by a break above the 50-day simple moving average and a rising trend line near $0.80, both supporting a bullish perspective. This momentum now brings ADA within reach of the $0.876 resistance, with potential extensions to $0.92 and $0.95 if buying continues. The rally underlines growing confidence in Cardano’s technical position and market potential. By holding vital support and breaking past significant barriers, ADA has set the groundwork for continued advances, offering traders and longer-term participants a strong setup to track in the sessions ahead. BlockDAG Maintains Lead Amid Broad Market Strength Cardano’s ADA price surge and the Polkadot DOT technical setup both demonstrate how solid support and breakout patterns can reignite interest. While these projects show significant promise, BlockDAG’s recent achievements give it a unique edge. Its $1.206 million 10 BTC Auction rewarded top participants, bolstering community engagement, while its presale results of $374 million raised, batch 29 pricing at $0.0276, and a 2,660% ROI since batch 1 highlight consistent growth. These results illustrate a project capable of delivering substantial value while maintaining expansion potential, securing BlockDAG’s position among the top crypto picks for those tracking performance and opportunities in today’s market.

Coinbase Premium Shoots Up,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/institutions-buying-bitcoin-dip-coinbase-premium/,"Data shows the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has witnessed a spike, a sign that American investors may be buying at post-dip prices. Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Has Seen A Sharp Positive Spike In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the latest trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap. This metric measures the difference between the Bitcoin price listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). The indicator tells us about how the buying or selling behavior differs between the userbases of the two platforms. The former is the main platform of the American investors (especially the large institutional entities), while the latter gets users from around the world. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bullish Signal: Whales Buy 2 Billion DOGE Here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the past week: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap surged to notable positive levels on Wednesday, indicating that BTC was going for more on Coinbase than Binance. In other words, Coinbase users were participating in a higher amount of buying than Binance traders. What followed the accumulation from the US-based entities was a surge in BTC’s price to a new all-time high (ATH). The cryptocurrency saw a plunge on Thursday and has continued to trade at lows today, but interestingly, the Coinbase Premium Gap has only noticed a further uptick. This could be a sign that American institutional investors are looking at the dip as a buying opportunity. Since the start of 2024, this cohort has often taken the driving seat in the market, so it only remains to be seen whether this accumulation would also lead somewhere. Another sign that could point at dip-buying occurring in the sector is the trend in the USDC Exchange Inflow, as the analyst has discussed in another X post. The “Exchange Inflow” is an on-chain indicator that tracks, as its name suggests, the amount of a given asset that investors are depositing into wallets associated with centralized exchanges. In the current case, the cryptocurrency involved is the stablecoin USDC. Generally, holders transfer their coins to exchanges when they want to sell, so an uptick in the metric for coins like Bitcoin can be a bearish sign for their prices. For stablecoins, however, the same isn’t true, as their prices are by definition stable around $1. Instead, stablecoin inflows have an effect on the volatile assets: investors use them to buy BTC and others, thus providing a bullish boost to their value. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Price Flips 200-WMA: What Happens Next? Since the BTC price plunge, the USDC Exchange Inflow has amounted to a whopping $3.88 billion. “Investors are treating it as a buy-the-dip opportunity,” notes Maartunn. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $117,800, down 1% over the last 24 hours.

On August 15, these significant investment vehicles experienced a total net outflow of $58.05 million, a figure that has certainly caught the attention of investors. This movement provides crucial insights into current market dynamics and investor sentiment surrounding digital assets. What Triggered These Significant Ethereum ETF Outflows? The recent data, sourced from Trader T on X, paints a clear picture of shifting investor capital within the Ethereum ETF outflows landscape. While a net outflow was observed, the details reveal a more nuanced story, showcasing both significant withdrawals and notable injections of capital. Fidelity’s FETH led the charge with a substantial $272.23 million in outflows. This considerable withdrawal indicates a significant shift in investor positioning for this particular fund. Grayscale’s ETHE , another major player, also saw considerable outflows, totaling $101.74 million. Other funds like Bitwise’s ETHW ($15.76 million) and 21Shares’ CETH ($4.39 million) also contributed to the overall negative flow. Even Grayscale’s mini ETH saw a modest outflow of $3.30 million. However, it was not all withdrawals. In a contrasting move that highlights the ongoing institutional interest in the sector, BlackRock’s ETHA recorded a remarkable inflow of $339.37 million. This substantial inflow from one of the world’s largest asset managers suggests strong confidence from a segment of the market, potentially offsetting some of the broader negative sentiment. Most other ETFs maintained stable holdings for the day, showing no significant changes. Understanding Broader Crypto ETF Trends These specific movements within US spot Ethereum ETFs are indicative of wider crypto ETF trends . The simultaneous occurrence of large outflows from some funds and massive inflows into others suggests a reallocation of capital rather than a complete withdrawal from the Ethereum ecosystem. Investors are likely optimizing their positions, perhaps seeking funds with different fee structures, liquidity profiles, or perceived stability. Analyzing these flows is vital for understanding the current state of spot Ethereum trading . It helps us gauge institutional appetite and retail investor behavior. While a net outflow might seem negative at first glance, the significant inflow into BlackRock’s product underscores a continued belief in Ethereum’s long-term potential as a digital asset. What Are the Implications for Ethereum Investment? For those considering Ethereum investment , these figures offer valuable insights. The market is dynamic, and capital flows can change rapidly. The August 15 data shows that even amidst overall outflows, there’s robust demand for certain structured products tied to Ethereum. This suggests that while some investors might be taking profits or rebalancing portfolios, others are actively increasing their exposure. It highlights the growing maturity of the digital asset market, where sophisticated financial products like ETFs allow for easier participation and capital movement. The continued growth and diversification of digital asset investment vehicles indicate a sustained interest from both institutional and retail participants. Challenges and Opportunities in the Ethereum ETF Landscape The challenges lie in the volatility and rapid shifts in sentiment that can characterize the crypto market. Large outflows can create downward price pressure, while significant inflows can signal bullish sentiment. For investors, understanding the underlying reasons for these movements—whether it’s profit-taking, regulatory concerns, or strategic rebalancing—is crucial. Opportunities, however, are also present. The emergence of diverse US spot Ethereum ETFs provides investors with more choices than ever before. This diversification can lead to more efficient price discovery and greater liquidity in the long run. As the market matures, these financial instruments will likely play an even larger role in how individuals and institutions gain exposure to Ethereum. In conclusion, the $58.05 million net outflow from US spot Ethereum ETFs on August 15, though notable, tells only part of the story. The contrasting massive inflow into BlackRock’s ETHA fund underscores a complex and evolving landscape. These movements reflect ongoing adjustments within the crypto market, highlighting both areas of caution and persistent confidence in Ethereum as a valuable digital asset. Keeping an eye on these capital flows remains essential for navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrency investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a US spot Ethereum ETF? A: A US spot Ethereum ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Ethereum as its underlying asset, allowing investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. Q2: What caused the $58.05 million net outflow from US spot Ethereum ETFs on August 15? A: The net outflow resulted from significant withdrawals from funds like Fidelity’s FETH and Grayscale’s ETHE, partially offset by a large inflow into BlackRock’s ETHA. The specific reasons for individual fund movements can vary, including profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, or strategic shifts by large investors. Q3: Why did BlackRock’s ETHA see significant inflows despite overall outflows? A: BlackRock’s substantial inflow suggests strong institutional confidence in their specific Ethereum ETF product, potentially due to its reputation, fee structure, or strategic positioning. It indicates a selective reallocation of capital within the Ethereum ETF market. Q4: How do these ETF movements impact the price of Ethereum? A: Large net outflows from ETFs can create downward pressure on Ethereum’s price due to selling activity, while significant inflows can signal increased demand and potentially support or drive up prices. These movements reflect broader market sentiment and institutional interest. Q5: What do these trends mean for future Ethereum investment? A: These trends indicate a maturing market where capital is actively managed and reallocated. While some investors may be exiting, others are entering or increasing their positions, particularly through established players like BlackRock. This suggests continued, albeit dynamic, interest in Ethereum as a long-term digital asset investment. Did this analysis of US spot Ethereum ETF movements shed light on your investment perspective?

Some are gaining speed with strong institutional support, while others are advancing through unique real-world applications. Cold Wallet (CWT) is making a notable impression with a presale already topping $6.11 million and a business model that turns transaction costs into rewards. At the same time, SUI is building partnerships with traditional banks, Solana is benefiting from talk of potential ETF approval, and XRP has cleared long-standing regulatory hurdles. Each is gaining attention for different reasons, leaving investors asking which holds the strongest case for major returns in the year ahead. Here’s a closer look at their recent progress, market strengths, and how Cold Wallet’s approach may be changing expectations. Cold Wallet Growth Accelerates with Utility and ROI Potential Cold Wallet is positioning itself as a strong candidate for the best crypto for 2025, with presale figures drawing attention. Having already raised $6.11 million, the project is in Stage 17, offering CWT tokens at $0.00998 ahead of a confirmed listing at $0.3517. This sets up a potential return of 3,423% for those entering now. Instead of deducting gas fees, swap costs, and bridge charges from user balances, Cold Wallet pays back users in CWT for these activities. There are no staking rules or lockup terms, just automatic cashback on actions that usually cost money. Its $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet instantly added over two million active users before launch, giving it a scale most projects spend years chasing. With MetaMask and Trust Wallet often criticized for their complexity, Cold Wallet stands out for its simple interface and income-focused design. Presale stages are closing quickly, and each step up raises the purchase price, reducing the potential return. For those evaluating the best crypto for 2025, CWT combines immediate utility with a defined ROI path ahead of launch. SUI (Sui): Traditional Banking Integration Strengthens Position SUI has gained attention with an 8% rise in recent days following news that Swiss bank AMINA will be the first to provide trading and custody services for the token. This move from traditional finance adds credibility and moves SUI closer to broader adoption. Institutional engagement is also on the rise, with Mill City Ventures increasing its stake to about 81.8 million SUI, worth over $316 million, earning around $26,000 per day in staking rewards. Mill City Ventures’ recent $20 million discounted purchase reflects strong confidence from major investors. With SUI trading near $3.77 and steady growth in on-chain activity, analysts believe there is room for more upside if momentum holds. While volatility risks remain, the combination of institutional support and expanding DeFi applications keeps SUI in the best crypto for 2025 conversation. Solana (SOL): Market Eyes ETF Approval Potential Solana’s current price is holding in a narrow upward band between $182 and $183 after breaking out of a late-July downtrend. Speculation is rising over a potential Solana-focused ETF, with some market watchers expecting a possible BlackRock application by October 2025. Approval could push targets toward $210 or beyond. Both retail and institutional interest are contributing to Solana’s steady performance. Its technology leadership remains evident, with projects like Remittix (RTX) in the PayFi space showcasing its scalability. Given Solana’s unmatched transaction throughput and active developer base, it stays firmly in the best crypto for 2025 discussion, particularly if ETF plans materialize. XRP (Ripple): Regulatory Resolution Fuels Confidence XRP has achieved one of its largest victories with the SEC ending its prolonged lawsuit against Ripple Labs, resulting in a $125 million settlement. The ruling confirmed that public exchange transactions involving XRP are not securities, providing long-sought regulatory certainty. Trading near $3.20, XRP is testing resistance at $3.22. A breakout could move it to $3.34 in the short term, while patterns like the cup-and-handle suggest potential longer-term targets between $11 and $34. Analyst Mario Nawfal projects $10 by December 2025 if Bitcoin reaches $225,000. With its legal challenges resolved, XRP is once again a strong contender for best crypto for 2025, offering a blend of proven infrastructure and new growth prospects. Key Projects Competing for Best Crypto for 2025 The competition for the best crypto for 2025 is intensifying across different market segments. SUI stands out through banking integration and growing institutional positions. Solana builds on ETF anticipation and technical scalability to sustain interest. XRP benefits from regulatory clarity that could unlock higher valuations. Meanwhile, Cold Wallet takes a different approach, combining a fixed ROI opportunity, active utility at launch, and rapid user growth ahead of debut. With $6.11 million raised, Stage 17 pricing at $0.00998, and a confirmed launch price of $0.3517, the risk-to-reward setup is distinct. In a market where sentiment can turn quickly, the projects that merge strong fundamentals, deep institutional connections, and investor-focused models have the best chance of leading. At present, Cold Wallet is positioned to claim that advantage.

50161248,558129,1755313218,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50161248.jpeg,Bitcoin Miner Tied To Trump Spends $314 Million On Chinese Computer Chips,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-miner-tied-to-trump-spends-314-million-on-chinese-computer-chips/,"American Bitcoin Corp., a mining company linked to US President Donald Trump’s family, has completed one of the largest hardware purchases in the crypto sector this year. Reports have disclosed that the firm paid around $314 million for 16,290 Antminer U3S21EXPH units from Chinese mining giant Bitmain . Massive Purchase Ahead Of Tariffs The order locks in a huge amount of high-performance ASIC machines capable of producing about 14.02 exahashes per second in combined hashing power. This level of output could boost American Bitcoin’s share of global mining capacity. The company originally had an option for as many as 17,280 units but decided to move fast to avoid price hikes from US tariffs on Chinese-made mining gear. Industry trackers say orders of this scale have been rare for American miners in 2025. While the firm has not revealed where the rigs will be deployed, sources familiar with the matter said they plan to distribute them across multiple large sites to reduce operational risks. Political And Trade Pressures The deal came just before the Trump administration began enforcing tariffs on imported Chinese mining hardware. The policy covers a wide range of technology goods, including ASIC miners, and is aimed at pushing production back to the US. However, critics say these tariffs could raise operating costs for domestic miners. Jaran Mellerud, CEO of BTC mining firm Hashlabs, warned that higher costs could cut into profitability. He warned that steep price increases could raise mining costs in the US to a point where demand collapses, blaming regulators he viewed as ineffective. Bitmain Eyes US Expansion Bitmain, which controls about 80% of the global ASIC market according to a University of Cambridge study, is adjusting its operations in response to the tariffs. The company plans to open its first US-based ASIC production site in early 2026. By the end of this year, it also expects to set up a new headquarters in Texas or Florida. The aim is to make its products accessible to US customers at reasonable prices and escape import taxes by manufacturing locally. Industry experts opine that this action would prompt other industry leaders such as MicroBT and Canaan to explore the possibility of diverting some production capacity to North America. Although the complete implications of the tariffs on the mining supply chain are still uncertain, this recent acquisition indicates the depth of stakes for manufacturers and operators alike. For American Bitcoin, the $314 million order indicates faith in the profitability of the industry in spite of fluctuating Bitcoin prices and increased competition. For Bitmain, it’s an indication that being able to bend with political and economic gusts will be the ticket to maintaining its dominance of the US market.

Price Action and Technical Setup Injective (INJ) traded near $15 at the time of writing, just under resistance around $16.12, which matches the 1.0 Fibonacci extension. Analyst Ali Martinez noted INJ “could be in the middle of a bullish retest before higher highs, ” pointing to an ascending triangle structure that has been in place since early April.

Holding above the trendline and breakout zone would maintain the bias in favor of buyers, while a drop back could lead to a move toward the $13.46 support level . Short-Term Pullback and Key Levels After a strong rally, INJ was rejected at $16.50, leading to a pullback. Analyst Crypto Eagles said the $14.2–$14.5 range is the next demand zone, adding, “If buyers defend this level, we could see a clean leg back towards $15.5+.” Analyst Smith noted INJ breaking from ascending support and projected a “ +120% move toward $34 ” if momentum resumes.

They’ve held the spotlight for years, but a growing number of traders are looking at SEI crypto as the possible disruptor heading into 2025. Analysts are making bold calls, traders are watching technical charts, and the conversation is starting to shift toward where the real growth could come from. MAGACOIN Finance, a rising project with shades of early Dogecoin energy, is also catching eyes in this shifting market narrative. SEI, Ethereum, and Bitcoin — The Big Picture for 2025 Bitcoin’s long-term dominance is being tested again. An X post by analyst Captain Faibik shows BTC still moving inside a rising wedge pattern. A break below could see a sharp correction toward $110K–$105K, but holding support might push it to $130K+. That kind of uncertainty is pushing more investors to think about the best crypto to buy now. Source: Captain Faibik’s BTC analysis Ethereum, on the other hand, is facing a supply crunch. Analyst Diana Sanchez notes ETH is leaving exchanges at an accelerating pace, which could lead to an aggressive price breakout if demand kicks in. In an Ethereum vs Bitcoin discussion, that kind of scarcity factor can’t be ignored — it’s part of what keeps ETH high on the list for the best cryptocurrency to invest in. SEI crypto is making its own headlines. Trader Ali predicts SEI could see a 160% rally toward $0.90. That puts SEI price prediction 2025 in a much brighter light, especially for those comparing SEI vs Ethereum in terms of speed, scalability, and niche positioning. SEI’s market push and the growing chatter around top altcoins 2025 make it hard to overlook for anyone scouting the next mover. MAGACOIN Finance — Mirroring Early Dogecoin Energy MAGACOIN Finance is getting attention for reasons that feel familiar to early Dogecoin watchers. Before its 85x rally, Dogecoin had a small but passionate community, a viral meme factor, and the right timing in a shifting market. MAGACOIN is building in a similar climate — a market looking for new stories beyond Ethereum vs Bitcoin and hunting for the best crypto to buy now. With an emerging presence, fresh branding, and community-driven momentum, it’s positioning itself among top altcoins 2025 candidates. The Road Ahead — Where the Next Big Moves Could Come From Bitcoin will likely keep its top spot in market cap, but traders aren’t blind to its slower growth potential compared to smaller caps. Ethereum’s shrinking exchange supply and Layer-2 ecosystem expansion keep it in play as one of the best cryptocurrency to invest in. SEI’s potential breakout makes it a strong contender for traders focused on faster percentage gains — and SEI price prediction 2025 numbers could become a self-fulfilling driver if hype grows. MAGACOIN Finance fits in as the wildcard. Whether it’s SEI vs Ethereum in performance or a smaller cap like MAGACOIN quietly preparing for a breakout, the search for the best crypto to buy now is far from over.

With clearer rules around its status and steady traction in payment partnerships around the world, many traders expect XRP to keep climbing as we head toward Q4 2025. The debate now is whether it will be the best performer – or if a smaller, faster mover could steal the show when capital rotates. Some investors are already positioning for that capital rotation. A newer altcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE, keeps popping up in trader chats as an early investment worth watching that could generate big gains at the end of the year. XRP’s Setup Heading Into Q4 2025 XRP does not have a sophisticated thesis, namely: genuine utility in cross-border transactions, enhancing liquidity and expanding a network of institutional partners. It has all the criteria that large players desire as fees and settlement time are competitive. In case risk appetite increases, XRP can enjoy new inflows that trend towards assets with established use cases and strong market depths. That makes XRP an essential holding in most portfolios as opposed to being a speculative hype. Where Early-Stage Bets Are Going While large caps can lead, rotation phases often funnеl fresh capital into еаrlier plays with higher upside potential. That is why some traders are eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE in the middle of their research lists. It is a simple strategy, the scarcity accumulates before Q4 2025 rotation events on the market, early access is scarce, and demand is known to be high when a new listing or significant milestone occurs. MAGACOIN’s incredible structure and tokenomics have attracted major attention since its inception and things aren’t looking to slow down in the near future. XRP: Catalysts, Risks, and Scenarios In the case of XRP, this seems to be a chain of catalysts piled on top of each other in the coming months. The trend can remain healthy through expanding corridors, deeper exchange liquidity and institutional rails. The danger side is primarily all about pace. Should the market rotate too fast into small caps, XRP can fall comparatively even though it may be moving higher. Conversely, with volatility rising to reprice risk, there is also the potential that capital rotates back into bigger names like XRP first, providing it an additional leg up before altcoins get their ordeal too. Conclusion The practicality and liquidity have kept XRP hanging around as an anchor to most investors. The traders playing rotations are hunting meanwhile on prior entries which may outrun large caps in brief periods. That is where interest in MAGACOIN FINANCE will be introduced – a scarcity narrative leading into Q4 2025 which many believe will perform a lot better when the shift in capital occurs.

Big traders are snapping up Litecoin, Avalanche, and Stellar before the wider market catches on. They’re also eyeing fresh opportunities in emerging names like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which some believe could see a sharp run once Bitcoin takes off again. If the market moves as it has in past cycles, this quiet buying phase could be the time to position for maximum upside — especially if you’re searching for the best altcoin to buy now. Bitcoin’s Price Spike Could Trigger an Altcoin Surge Analyst Michaël van de Poppe believes Bitcoin’s recent rejection is just part of a normal range before breaking higher. Historically, moments like this often precede strong upside. If the Bitcoin price forecast 2025 plays out the way many bulls expect, altcoins could rally even harder once the breakout begins. Source: Michaël van de Poppe X post When Bitcoin’s next price spike arrives, the market often shifts from steady accumulation to rapid price climbs. That’s when latecomers rush in — and when early whale positions start paying off. Whales Building Positions in Litecoin, Avalanche, and Stellar Litecoin (LTC) is seeing heavy institutional interest. Grayscale now holds 2.1 million LTC, worth around $180 million, making it a major altcoin position outside Bitcoin and Ethereum. Traders following the Litecoin price prediction 2025 believe its payment-focused network and growing institutional support could push it to new highs in the coming cycle. Avalanche (AVAX) has captured attention in the institutional tokenization trend. BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund has made it its second-largest blockchain position, with $53.8 million in assets tokenized on-chain. Those watching the Avalanche crypto forecast point to its expanding role in financial applications as a bullish driver. Stellar (XLM) is experiencing whale accumulation once again. In just 24 hours, 49.56 million XLM moved on-chain, followed by a week where 245 million XLM was transferred in minutes. A further 90 million XLM — over $21 million — was sent to dead wallets, tightening supply. For those tracking the Stellar XLM price prediction, reduced circulating tokens could fuel stronger price performance if demand rises. Smart Money Targets a 30x Surge Before Bitcoin’s Next Leg Up Among emerging projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE is catching attention. Early movers see it as one of the best altcoin to buy now for high-upside potential, aiming for a possible 30x move if Bitcoin kicks off a broader rally. The strategy mirrors whale tactics in larger altcoins — buy when the market is quiet, and wait for sentiment to turn. For traders who see Bitcoin’s next price spike as inevitable, early exposure to MAGACOIN FINANCE could be a calculated bet ahead of mainstream recognition. Quiet Accumulation, Big Market Moves Periods like this — before the breakout — are when the biggest plays are often made. Litecoin’s institutional build-up supports the Litecoin price prediction 2025, Avalanche’s traction fits the Avalanche crypto forecast, and Stellar’s supply squeeze adds weight to the Stellar XLM price prediction. The Bitcoin price forecast 2025 from many analysts points to a strong bull market. If that proves right, the coins whales are targeting now may be the first to run — and that list could include newer names like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is positioning for rapid growth. For traders scanning for the best altcoin to buy now, these are the ones to watch closely before Bitcoin’s next price spike arrives.

50163421,558179,1755316820,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50163421.jpeg,Stablecoin Concerns: US Banking Associations Push For Legislative Fixes,https://bitcoinist.com/stablecoin-concerns-us-banking-associations/,"The recent passage of the GENIUS Act , which marks the first stablecoin legislation in the United States, has sparked considerable interest among crypto investors. However, leading banking associations across the country have raised alarms about potential vulnerabilities in the law that could pose risks to the financial system. Alleged Risks In New Stablecoin Legislation In a letter addressed to the Senate Banking Committee, these associations, representing all 50 states, called for urgent amendments to address several identified loopholes. In their correspondence, the associations emphasized the importance of establishing a clear regulatory framework for the digital asset market. They underscored that the decisions made could significantly influence the structure, efficiency, and fairness of the financial system for years to come. Among their key recommendations is a call to strengthen the prohibition on interest payments related to payment stablecoins. While the law prohibits stablecoin issuers from offering yield, the letter points out that this restriction could be “easily circumvented” by exchanges or affiliates providing rewards to stablecoin holders. The associations argue that such practices distort market dynamics and may hinder credit creation by diverting deposits into stablecoins chasing higher yields. To protect the traditional banking system and maintain its role in credit intermediation, the banking groups urged Congress to extend the prohibition on interest payments to include digital asset exchanges, brokers, dealers, and related entities. They assert that this recommended adjustment would not only safeguard the financial ecosystem but also allow for the responsible growth of digital payment innovations. Banking Groups Call For Stronger Financial Oversight Another concern highlighted in the letter pertains to Section 16(d) of the GENIUS Act, which allows uninsured, out-of-state-chartered financial institutions, such as Special Purpose Depository Institutions (SPDIs), to operate without the approval of host states. The banking associations argue that this provision undermines the dual banking system, which they deemed is crucial for ensuring the safety and soundness of financial operations across state lines. They called for the repeal of this section to reaffirm state authority in licensing and supervising financial institutions, thereby ensuring consumer protection and a level playing field for all operators. Additionally, the associations urged lawmakers to close “loopholes” that permit nonfinancial companies to act as payment stablecoin issuers. The letter alleges that the separation of banking and commerce has historically protected the US financial system from conflicts of interest and excessive concentration of economic power. While the GENIUS Act currently prohibits stablecoin issuance by nonfinancial public companies, it includes pathways for exceptions, the letter further reads. The banking groups contend that allowing any exceptions could lead to regulatory arbitrage and further complicate financial regulation.

BlockchainFX ($BFX), Little Pepe (LILPEPE), and Cold Wallet stand out as contenders, each bringing different features and growth paths. For early participants, the chance to turn a small entry into a significant return remains a powerful motivator. As timing and usability often define success, these presales each bring something distinct. BlockchainFX ($BFX) is developing features for income, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is blending meme culture with future plans, and Cold Wallet combines secure storage with cashback benefits. Together, these three illustrate why 2025 is shaping up to be a key year for presales and why they are drawing attention from serious watchlists. BlockchainFX ($BFX) Builds Strength in Income-Focused Market BlockchainFX ($BFX) is gaining traction among 2025 presales with a model that combines decentralized finance and daily income potential. It aims to provide passive USDT returns simply for holding, appealing to those who value stability alongside growth. Current presale reports show steady interest, pointing to confidence in its approach and ongoing demand. The strength of BlockchainFX ($BFX) comes from its blend of safety and reward. Features such as audited smart contracts and transparency reports build trust among holders. As demand grows for income-focused crypto projects, its approach is aligned with a rising trend. This direction positions BlockchainFX ($BFX) to stay on the radar through the next year. Market interest highlights the appeal of strong tokenomics. Unlike projects built only on speculation, this presale emphasizes practical earnings from the beginning. The gradual price increase across stages encourages early entry. Should adoption grow after launch, the mix of stable yield and a loyal holder base could establish BlockchainFX ($BFX) as a top presale in 2025. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Brings Meme Appeal with Future Plans Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is another project catching attention in 2025 presales, mixing meme coin culture with a long-term roadmap. While inspired by viral trends, its plans suggest it is not limited to quick hype. The roadmap includes AI-powered tools and active community features aimed at sustaining engagement. The presale is attracting interest from smaller backers who see potential in its low entry price and branding. Meme coins can be highly volatile, but when paired with utility and structure, they can extend momentum. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is focusing on this angle, adding staking and gamified participation to drive continued use. Execution will decide how far this project can go. The branding is strong, pulling in online communities and building visibility. If it can combine its entertainment edge with meaningful utility, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) could move beyond short-term buzz into being a real contender among 2025 presales. Cold Wallet’s 50x Path and Cashback Features Cold Wallet has secured its place as one of the leading presales in 2025 because it blends secure custody with cashback benefits. Unlike projects focused only on speculation, Cold Wallet provides real value by giving cashback on every crypto action, from paying gas fees to making swaps and moving funds. This creates direct benefits for those using it actively. Currently, in stage 17 of its crypto presale , Cold Wallet is priced at $0.00998, with a confirmed listing value of $0.3517. This sets the stage for potential gains of up to 50x for early buyers. The presale uses a 150-stage model, ensuring gradual growth in value and rewarding those who joined at the earlier levels. With over $6.1 million already raised and more than 728 million coins sold, confidence in the project is clearly building. The difference lies in its utility. Cold Wallet is built for everyday crypto use, with a system designed to integrate smoothly with existing wallets. It also plans for future scalability through L2 or custom scaling to ensure its cashback remains cost-effective at higher transaction volumes. This guarantees rewards can continue without high costs even as activity grows. Cold Wallet sets itself apart by merging security, usability, and real returns. Its approach goes beyond price potential by fostering an ecosystem where daily activity brings earnings. With more than half of the presale already taken and community growth expanding, Cold Wallet is shaping up as one of the most practical projects to launch in the coming year. Final Thoughts BlockchainFX ($BFX), Little Pepe (LILPEPE), and Cold Wallet each show clear strengths that make them among the top presales of 2025. BlockchainFX ($BFX) focuses on consistent yield, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) combines meme culture with future-focused tools, and Cold Wallet offers cashback benefits alongside security. While all three hold promise, Cold Wallet’s mix of potential 50x gains, cashback utility, and long-term scalability puts it ahead of the pack. With 2025 expected to feature both high-risk and high-reward plays, these three remain at the top of the presale list for close attention.

According to a report by the Financial Times, sources familiar with the matter indicated that the company aims to purchase a publicly listed firm in Japan, with potential interests in Hong Kong as well. American Bitcoin Aims To Mirror Strategy’s Success American Bitcoin is already in the process of developing its own strategic Bitcoin reserve, mulling President Donald Trump’s very own vision of creating a stockpile of the market’s leading crypto for the country. The Financial Times asserts that the company established in collaboration with Hut 8 is currently engaging with investors in the Asian region regarding potential acquisitions. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces The Level That Decides Everything: Analyst The company’s ambition is said to mirror the successful approach of Michael Saylor, the founder of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which has the largest Bitcoin holdings of any public company, surpassing 600,000 BTC coins according to Bitcointreasuries.Net data. The firm’s goal coincides with that of other companies exploring the crypto treasury reserve approach. These companies focus on assets beyond Bitcoin, including Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and TRON, among others. These firms sell shares or debt to fund their purchases of digital assets, allowing investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrency prices without directly owning the tokens. This method has appealed to many traders, particularly in a newly favorable regulatory environment for digital assets in the US. Trump Family Strengthens Crypto Presence The company is preparing to go public in September via a reverse merger with Gryphon Digital Mining, which is already listed on Nasdaq under the ticker name GRYP. Eric Trump serves as the co-founder and chief strategy officer of American Bitcoin, a rebranded entity that evolved from American Data Centers (ADC), previously a subsidiary of Dominari Holdings. American Bitcoin recently disclosed its goal of creating an efficient platform for Bitcoin accumulation, emphasizing active treasury management and long-term value creation for shareholders. The company noted that while it is exploring opportunities in specific regions, no binding commitments have yet been made. The Asian market, particularly Hong Kong, has been making significant efforts to become a hub for digital assets. Establishing treasury companies in these regions could generate new demand for cryptocurrencies, which aligns with American Bitcoin’s vision.

President Donald Trump recently reported earnings of $57 million from his involvement with World Liberty Financial, which announced plans to acquire $1.5 billion worth of its own WLFI tokens. Meanwhile, the Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) intends to raise funds for a “Bitcoin treasury,” highlighting the family’s ongoing commitment to the cryptocurrency space. As of this writing, American Bitcoin holds 1,941 BTC, currently valued at approximately $227 million. Bitcoin is currently trading at $117,270, having retraced 5% from its record high of $124,100 earlier this week.

The race for dominance is intensifying between projects that combine breakthrough technology, mass adoption, and clear catalysts for growth. This year’s contenders aren’t just about hype they’re backed by strong fundamentals, expanding communities, and strategic positioning that could define the next bull run. Here, we break down four standout projects BlockDAG, the presale powerhouse with huge upside; Sui, attracting both institutions and retail traders; Solana, riding technical breakouts and hardware growth; and XRP, gaining momentum after a multi-year legal battle. While all four have unique strengths, one is emerging as the clear leader in potential ROI and market readiness. BlockDAG: The Presale Giant with Triple-Digit ROI Potential For those wondering what crypto to buy now with maximum upside, BlockDAG is already proving itself. It has raised more than $375 million in its presale, aiming for a $600M finish. At $0.0276 in Batch 29, this could be one of the last low-price entry points before later stages push valuations up. Analysts are openly projecting BDAG could reach $1 in its first bull cycle a massive triple-digit ROI for early buyers. Its hybrid DAG plus Proof-of-Work architecture combines lightning-fast transactions with decentralization, solving one of blockchain’s biggest trade-offs. With full EVM compatibility, Ethereum-based dApps can migrate instantly, accelerating network growth and giving developers a frictionless path to adoption. The adoption figures are already remarkable, with 2.5 million X1 app miners, over 200,000 holders, and 19,000 ASIC miners sold before the mainnet even launches. Aggressive global marketing, including an Inter Milan sponsorship, has pushed BlockDAG into mainstream visibility. For holders seeking what crypto to buy now that blends tech innovation, adoption momentum, and urgency, BlockDAG is hard to beat especially with so much room to grow before launch. Sui: Institutional Backing Meets Retail Excitement Sui is also attracting attention from those asking what crypto to buy now. It combines institutional credibility with growing retail enthusiasm. A recent 4% dip from long liquidations hasn’t stopped it from posting a 9% gain over the past month. Buzz grew after a rumored Robinhood listing, hinted at in a briefly posted and deleted blog. Backing from major players like Grayscale and Swiss bank Sygnum reinforces Sui’s image as a serious, long-term blockchain player with the financial muscle to compete in a crowded field. With $1.79 billion open interest and an expanding DeFi and gaming ecosystem, Sui’s fundamentals remain strong. The challenge will be turning its current momentum into lasting growth through 2025 and securing a stronger foothold in the altcoin market. Solana: Technical Breakouts and Hardware Expansion Solana remains a prime candidate for what crypto to buy now, thanks to strong price action and steady network expansion. It recently broke above the $175 resistance in a cup-and-handle pattern breakout, prompting price targets of $300 and in highly bullish cases, $1,315. Beyond price charts, Solana is innovating in hardware, having shipped over 150,000 Seeker phones worldwide. These devices feature on-chain key storage and a dedicated dApp store, making blockchain tools more accessible for the next wave of Web3 users. While short-term whale outflows have caused some selling pressure, Solana’s infrastructure development keeps it positioned for long-term growth, especially as demand for scalable Layer-1 solutions accelerates. XRP: Legal Victory Clears the Path XRP has always been in the conversation for what crypto to buy now, but legal uncertainty held it back until now. The SEC lawsuit has been officially resolved, ending with a $125 million fine and sales injunction. The market responded with an 11% rally, and XRP is now eyeing a breakout above $3.30. Some analysts using Elliott Wave theory believe XRP could hit $3.50 or higher in its next bullish wave. With regulatory clarity finally secured, XRP can shift focus entirely to expanding its global payments network and building adoption across financial institutions. These factors could provide the push it needs to reclaim a leading position in the market, making it a viable pick for those looking beyond short-term speculation. Wrapping Up When it comes to what crypto to buy now , the competition is stacked. Sui has institutional partnerships and retail energy, Solana has technical breakout potential and hardware innovation, and XRP’s post-lawsuit clarity is fueling renewed investor interest. But BlockDAG stands out above the rest. With a record-breaking presale, unique architecture, strong early adoption, and high-profile marketing, it offers one of the most attractive risk-reward setups in the market. At $0.0276, it’s still affordable, but with projections toward $1, the upside potential is enormous. In crypto, opportunities rarely linger. The months ahead could determine which of these projects dominates 2025. For buyers ready to act, this may be the moment to secure a position before the market’s next explosive run begins and BlockDAG could very well lead that charge.

This shift has sparked speculation across crypto circles. Traders are wondering why high-net-worth investors are suddenly loading up before the next market leg. The coin in question is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale project drawing attention for its bold growth projections. Whales are positioning early, believing it could outpace most established altcoins during the upcoming bull cycle. The last time a similar pattern emerged was during Shiba Inu’s early days when a few early believers made generational gains. Unlike hype-driven meme projects, this coin’s model targets real market gaps and a community-driven growth approach. That mix is attracting both speculative buyers and long-term investors. Analysts say timing is key, and these whales seem confident they are ahead of the crowd. Ethereum Whales Signal a Strategic Shift Ethereum’s recent price recovery has renewed optimism among long-term holders. The network remains one of the most dominant in smart contracts and decentralized finance. As prices climb, many ETH whales are securing positions in high-upside opportunities before the next liquidity wave. This behavior often signals where big players believe the strongest percentage gains will happen. Ethereum veterans are not abandoning their core holdings, but they are diversifying into altcoins that could multiply faster than blue-chip assets. The shift has been subtle but steady over recent weeks. On-chain data shows significant ETH inflows into smaller projects, with MAGACOIN FINANCE consistently appearing among the top destinations. Dogecoin Whales Join the Accumulation Trend Dogecoin may be a meme coin at its core, yet its largest holders are known for making calculated moves in other assets. These investors often shift profits into smaller tokens when they believe market sentiment is about to turn. Recent whale wallet activity shows several DOGE holders sending large transactions into presale projects. MAGACOIN FINANCE has featured heavily in those flows, suggesting shared conviction between Dogecoin and Ethereum’s biggest investors. This level of cross-whale interest is rare. It points to growing confidence that the next explosive move could come from an under-the-radar token rather than an established market leader. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Momentum Before Launch MAGACOIN FINANCE is no longer just another presale listing. It is quickly becoming a focal point for those seeking aggressive returns in the next cycle. Analyst projections see MAGACOIN FINANCE hitting 1000x in the upcoming market leg, a figure that has fueled retail and institutional curiosity alike. The project blends market-timed tokenomics with active community engagement, creating a setup where early buyers could see rapid appreciation once exchange listings begin. This potential has drawn steady inflows from experienced traders who typically avoid chasing hype. Conclusion Dogecoin and Ethereum whales rarely align on the same small-cap play, yet MAGACOIN FINANCE has pulled both groups into accumulation mode. If whale conviction is any indicator, this could be one of 2025’s most watched launches.

XRP has been breaking resistance, Ethereum has extended its rally, and market sentiment is shifting toward a full-scale altcoin market rally. For investors searching for the best altcoins to buy today, the list is getting interesting. While the market’s big names are leading the charge, a new contender — MAGACOIN FINANCE — is starting to draw attention from traders looking for the best crypto to buy now. XRP and Ethereum Driving Market Excitement The XRP price prediction trend has remained bullish as the token holds above $3. Over the past year, XRP has posted gains of more than 450%, driven by renewed optimism around adoption and legal clarity. This stability at higher levels is pushing traders to consider it as one of the best altcoins to buy today for both short- and mid-term strategies. Meanwhile, the Ethereum (ETH) rally has been equally attention-grabbing. ETH is up 33% over the last month, touching highs near $4,700. Market analysts point to strong network activity and upcoming scaling upgrades as catalysts. For many, Ethereum remains the second best crypto to buy now after Bitcoin, but with the potential for sharper gains during an altcoin market rally. This double surge from XRP and ETH is setting a tone of confidence across the sector, leading traders to rotate capital into promising new projects that could deliver higher returns in the next market leg. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Market Models Signal 27x ROI Potential Market forecasts are flagging MAGACOIN FINANCE as a standout opportunity before the next altcoin market rally. Analysts tracking early-stage token cycles suggest the project’s token could see a 27x return on investment in the upcoming rotation phase. This projection is based on a combination of community growth, liquidity expansion, and anticipated market listings. The appeal for traders comes from its timing — MAGACOIN is still in the early stages of wider exposure while the sector is entering a bullish cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s positioning could make it one of the best altcoins to buy today for those seeking higher-risk, higher-reward plays. Final Word: Where the Smart Money Might Flow Next With XRP holding strong above $3 and Ethereum surging toward new highs, the market is preparing for broader gains across altcoins. For those tracking the best crypto to buy now, large-cap tokens offer stability, but they rarely deliver the extreme multiples found in smaller-cap plays. That’s where projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE enter the conversation. MAGACOIN is gaining traction among investors looking beyond the big names — and that makes it a project worth keeping on the radar.

This marks the first time a publicly-listed Taiwanese firm has invested in a Bitcoin treasury company. Top Win International To Purchase Bitcoin According to an announcement today, Hong Kong–based Top Win International is the latest firm to raise funds for its BTC treasury strategy. The firm – traditionally a luxury watch brand – is steadily pivoting toward the digital assets industry. Wiselink led the funding round by purchasing a three-year convertible note worth $2 million. The remaining $8 million was contributed by other investors, including American asset manager United Capital Management of Kansas. The proceeds from the fundraising will primarily be used to purchase BTC. Top Win may also use the funds to invest in other publicly-listed companies with Bitcoin treasury strategies, subject to applicable regulatory requirements. The firm clarified that it has no intention of operating as an investment company. Notably, Top Win was listed on Nasdaq in April 2025 and subsequently changed its ticker symbol from TOPW to SORA following a partnership with SORA Ventures in May 2025. Meanwhile, Top Win shares fell sharply at market open, trading down more than 15% on the day. However, the stock remains up 12.41% over the past five days. In a similar development, NYSE-listed Sequans Communications recently announced an ambitious plan to accumulate 100,000 BTC by the end of 2030. The firm stated that it holds strong conviction in Bitcoin as a foundational asset for long-term value creation. Sequans initiated its Bitcoin strategy on July 8, with a $384 million strategic investment in convertible debt and equity. The firm also added 1,264 BTC to its balance sheet in the last month. As of today, Sequans ranks 21st among publicly traded Bitcoin holders globally. Michael Saylor’s Strategy, MARA Holdings, and Twenty One Capital hold the top three positions, respectively. Everyone Wants Exposure To BTC Corporate adoption of Bitcoin was once considered a novel and risky strategy. However, the trend has accelerated significantly following US President Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 election. Earlier this week, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund – Norges Bank Investment Management – revealed that it had significantly increased its BTC exposure, bringing its stake to a value of $844 million. Similarly, wealth management firm Choreo disclosed that it had invested roughly $6.5 million in multiple Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). At press time, BTC trades at $117,199, down 0.9% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Adoption|Bitcoin treasury strategy|btc|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|Nasdaq|nyse|Top Win International|Wiselink,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-16 05:00:06

Rising Exchange Inflows Signal Potential Supply Build-Up,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-under-pressure-rising-exchange-inflows-signal-potential-supply-build-up/,"Bitcoin remains under the $120,000 price mark following a pullback triggered by remarks from the US Treasury that the federal government will not be purchasing the cryptocurrency. At the time of writing, BTC is valued at approximately $118,612, representing a 4.1% decline from its record high above $124,000 reached earlier this week. The market seems to be currently assessing whether this consolidation phase will lead to renewed upward momentum or extend the correction. Recent blockchain data has brought attention to activity on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Related Reading: Bitcoin Act Is Still America’s Playbook, Clarifies Senator Lummis Bitcoin Exchange Inflows and Potential Impact According to CryptoOnchain, a contributor to the on-chain data provider platform CryptoQuant, the exchange has recorded one of the seven highest average Bitcoin inflows in recent months. This increase, measured by the Mean Inflow metric, reflects a greater volume of BTC being transferred into Binance wallets, potentially as preparation for selling, using as collateral for leveraged positions, or institutional portfolio adjustments. CryptoOnchain explained that persistent high inflows often indicate that more Bitcoin is moving from private wallets to exchange trading accounts. Without equivalent buying demand to offset this, the increase in supply can create short-term selling pressure. The positive netflow trend, where inflows surpass withdrawals, supports this interpretation, showing that Binance’s Bitcoin reserves are growing. Historically, similar patterns have preceded periods of price volatility, particularly if large holders decide to offload positions or hedge via derivatives markets. If inflows continue at their current pace without a parallel rise in demand, the analyst suggests the market could experience higher short-term downside risk. On the other hand, if these inflows are met with strong buying interest, they could provide liquidity for further price movement. The key factor remains whether the increase in exchange-held BTC is driven by selling intentions or strategic positioning ahead of market developments. Leverage Trends Point to Lower Speculative Risk A separate analysis from another CryptoQuant contributor, Arab Chain, examined Binance’s Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR) for Bitcoin. The ratio, which measures open interest relative to exchange reserves, recently dropped from its early August peak above 0.27 to around 0.25, before showing a modest rebound. From May to late July, both Bitcoin’s price and the leverage ratio rose together, suggesting heightened participation from traders using larger positions. The recent drop in leverage, despite prices remaining near $119,000, indicates a reduction in speculative exposure, possibly from liquidated high-risk positions or profit-taking after rapid price gains. Arab Chain noted that a lower leverage ratio during a period of price stability can be a constructive sign, as it implies that market support is coming from actual liquidity rather than excessive speculation. Related Reading: The Bitcoin Cycle You Knew Is Dead, Says Capriole Founder Should the ELR remain between 0.24 and 0.25 while Bitcoin gradually moves above $120,000, it could signal a price advance driven more by spot demand than leveraged trading. However, a sudden rise in the leverage ratio above 0.27 during another test of the $120,000–$124,000 range would increase the risk of a sharp correction. This would mirror the conditions seen during previous liquidation events, where a combination of high leverage and rapid price movements triggered large sell-offs, the analyst noted.

While many tokens are seeing modest growth, a few stand out for their current performance, strong fundamentals, and potential for massive returns. From innovative blockchain architectures to explosive trading volumes, these coins are catching serious attention. In this list, we’ll break down four top crypto coins right now, each with its own unique drivers and growth story. We’re looking at a major presale juggernaut that’s breaking records, a smart contract platform with growing ETF buzz, a high-performance DeFi token with surging market cap, and the second-largest crypto by market size that’s on track for huge institutional inflows.Let’s dive into the details so you know exactly why these coins are making headlines and what’s fuelling their rise. 1. BlockDAG – Presale Powerhouse Breaking Records BlockDAG is dominating attention as one of the top crypto coins right now, with a presale that has already raised over $375 million and sold more than 25 billion BDAG tokens across 29 batches with the price set at $0.0276. Its hybrid Layer-1 design blends Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology with Proof-of-Work consensus, delivering high transaction speeds, strong security, and full EVM compatibility for smart contracts. Batch 1 buyers are sitting on gains of about 2,660%, and even current participants could see an 81% jump at the projected $0.05 listing price. Analysts say that with major exchange momentum, BDAG could climb toward $1, giving it a massive upside from presale levels. The ecosystem is far from a simple whitepaper project, the X1 Mobile Miner app already engages over 2.5 million users daily, more than 4,500 developers are working on 300+ decentralized apps, and over 200,000 holders have joined ahead of launch. The project has also sold more than 19,000 mining units, showing real demand and community buy-in before listing. BlockDAG is confirmed for 20 exchange listings, including MEXC, BitMart, and LBank. But the big target is Coinbase and Gemini. These U.S. exchange listings would not only boost visibility but also strengthen investor trust, potentially triggering major price moves. For anyone scanning the market for top crypto coins right now, BlockDAG’s combination of funding power, adoption, and ambitious exchange strategy makes it a prime contender. 2. Cardano (ADA) – Bullish Momentum and ETF Hype Cardano has been on a serious run lately, with the price sitting around $1.012, swinging between $0.8456 and $1.012 in recent sessions. ADA is up roughly 18% in the past 24 hours and 35% over the past week, with $3.9 billion in daily trading volume. The big story is the growing talk around a U.S. spot ETF, with approval odds now as high as 80%, following Grayscale’s trust filing in Delaware. Institutional money is flowing in, with whales buying $157 million worth of ADA in just 48 hours, pushing whale ownership to 10.3% of the supply. On the technical side, ADA has formed a golden cross, breaking out from a descending channel, and analysts are pointing to upside targets of $1.725. A recent $71 million upgrade funding from Cardano’s treasury has added fuel to the bullish case. For those tracking top crypto coins right now, ADA’s mix of technical momentum, whale accumulation, and ETF anticipation puts it firmly in the spotlight. 3. Hyperliquid (HYPE) – DeFi Growth and Record Market Cap HYPE is currently trading around $48.40–$48.53, just shy of its $49.84 all-time high from July. Over the past week, it’s jumped between 25% and 29%, with a market cap of $16.2 billion and daily trading volumes around $550 million. With 333 million tokens in circulation (33% of its max supply), liquidity is strong, and price action remains bullish. Part of the excitement comes from strategic moves like the $583 million HYPE token treasury created through a business combination with Sonnet BioTherapeutics, plus a $50 million private financing that added 1.5 million HYPE to corporate treasuries. Hyperion DeFi’s co-branded validator with Kinetiq also adds a staking angle, supporting network stability. This combination of corporate backing, high TVL growth, and consistent technical strength has traders watching closely. If momentum continues, HYPE could push beyond its ATH, making it one of the top crypto coins right now with both institutional and retail appeal. 4. Ethereum (ETH) – Institutional Demand at 2025 Highs Ethereum has surged to around $4,776, moving between $4,616 and $4,783, up nearly 13% since August 11. Institutional inflows into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs have been staggering, hitting $704 million in a single day and over $2.2 billion total in just days. This has pushed ETH to 3.5-year highs, with analysts eyeing the $5,000 mark as the next big level. Standard Chartered now targets $7,500 for ETH by the end of 2025, while other analysts, like Tom Lee, see a possible $10,000–$15,000 range if momentum holds. The chart shows bullish structures, with support zones near $4,720 and resistance around $4,870. Macro tailwinds, regulatory clarity via the GENIUS Act, and rising institutional adoption of ETH’s smart contract capabilities are driving confidence. Given its size, liquidity, and growth trajectory, ETH remains one of the top crypto coins right now, combining blue-chip stability with high upside potential, especially if ETF flows maintain their pace. Key Insights Right now, the market is rewarding projects with both strong fundamentals and clear growth catalysts. BlockDAG is turning presale hype into a massive launch setup, ADA is riding technical momentum and ETF optimism, HYPE is locking in corporate-backed liquidity and climbing toward its ATH, and ETH is benefiting from record-breaking institutional inflows. These aren’t just random picks, they’re all proving their strength in real time. If you’re scanning the market for top crypto coins right now, these four deserve serious attention. The mix of presale opportunities, ETF catalysts, corporate partnerships, and institutional inflows makes them stand out in a crowded field. Whether you’re aiming for high-growth plays or established leaders with long-term potential, each of these coins offers a compelling reason to keep them on your radar today.

While range-bound trading may not grab headlines, smart money knows consolidation can be a launchpad. Polkadot (DOT) price analysis offers a different story: its 2.0 upgrade could boost scalability and cross-chain use, potentially driving DOT toward $10 by 2025. Yet, both are battling the same market headwind: the need for catalysts before momentum kicks in. That’s where Cold Wallet (CWT) breaks from the pack. With $6 million raised in crypto presale, a built-in 2M+ user base from its Plus Wallet acquisition, and Stage 17 pricing at just $0.00998 ahead of a $0.3517 listing, it is the highest trending crypto for a reason. While XRP waits and Polkadot builds, Cold Wallet’s ROI curve is already steep and its entry window is shrinking by the day. Why XRP’s Stalled Range Could Be Your Buying Moment XRP is currently trading between $2.90 and $3.30, following a strong rally in late July that peaked near $3.66. Since then, resistance around $3.30 has held firm, while support near $3.05–$3.10 continues to prevent deeper drops. The market isn’t making bold moves yet but that could be why now is a compelling entry point. Technical indicators are balanced, neither signaling a surge nor a slump. If XRP breaks above $3.30, we could see a run toward $3.50 or even $3.66. A failure to break that ceiling may lead to continued sideways trading. Even a minor drop below $3.10 could invite a dip toward $3.00. Could Polkadot (DOT) Surge to $10 by 2025? Here’s What’s Driving It Polkadot (DOT) is trading around $4.19 today, but analysts anticipate it could climb significantly, possibly breaching $10 by late 2025 if upcoming upgrades deliver on performance and interoperability. The network’s Polkadot 2.0 rollout, including elastic scaling and enhanced cross-chain functionality, may boost demand and use. On-chain metrics are promising too; user activity is nearing record levels, even as 2.3 million DOT tokens (worth around $9.4 million) are set to unlock soon, potentially creating short-term selling pressure. Cold Wallet’s $6M Presale Proves Growth Can Fund Itself But Stage 17’s Window Is Closing Cold Wallet’s expansion playbook isn’t built on ad spend; it’s embedded in the product itself. Its cashback model turns every transaction fee into a reason to use the wallet more, creating an organic feedback loop for growth. This isn’t a “spend now, hope later” approach. It’s a self-funding system where usage fuels adoption without draining treasury reserves. The acquisition of Plus Wallet added over 2 million active users instantly, meaning Cold Wallet starts life with a built-in audience instead of scrambling for one. For presale buyers, this structure matters. It means your entry isn’t funding survival; it’s funding scale. At Stage 17, each CWT is priced at just $0.00998, while the confirmed listing price sits at $0.3517 a potential ROI of 3,423%. With over $6 million already raised and momentum climbing, every stage sold chips away at that upside. Growth is locked into the core mechanics, and the market window to secure early multiples is narrowing with each batch. In a landscape where many crypto projects fade without constant marketing burns, Cold Wallet is engineered to thrive on usage alone making it one of the rare presales where sustainability and profit potential move in the same direction. Cold Wallet Isn’t Waiting And Neither Should You In today’s market, the XRP (XRP) investor outlook hinges on breaking above $3.30, while Polkadot (DOT) price analysis points toward a long-term climb if upgrades deliver. Both offer potential, but they also require patience. Cold Wallet, on the other hand, is engineered for acceleration. Its cashback-powered growth model doesn’t burn through marketing budgets; it fuels adoption organically. The Plus Wallet acquisition means Cold Wallet launches with scale already in place, something most projects take years to achieve. At Stage 17’s $0.00998 entry, with a projected $0.3517 listing, the highest trending crypto right now offers a potential 3,423% ROI before factoring in post-launch momentum. Each stage sold reduces that upside, turning hesitation into cost. For investors deciding between waiting on catalysts or riding an existing growth wave, Cold Wallet makes the choice as much about timing as about vision.

50165739,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=31514,1755320443,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png,DCG Files Complaint Against Genesis Over $1.1 Billion Promissory Note,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/dcg-files-complaint-against-genesis-over-1-1-billion-promissory-note/,"Venture capital firm Digital Currency Group (DCG) has launched fresh legal action against two of its subsidiaries, intensifying the ongoing fallout from the collapse of Three Arrows Capital (3AC). In a filing to the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, DCG alleged that Genesis Global Capital and Genesis Asia Pacific profited unfairly from a $1.1 billion promissory note tied to the 2022 default of 3AC. The complaint argues that instead of suffering losses, the Genesis entities received “hundreds of millions of dollars” in gains, creating an obligation to return overpayments to their parent company. Background to the Promissory Note DCG issued the 10-year note in June 2022 to cover a potential equity shortfall in Genesis Asia Pacific following 3AC’s failure to meet obligations. At the time, concerns loomed that the collapse of 3AC — one of Genesis’ largest borrowers — would trigger significant liquidity issues. However, according to DCG, cryptocurrency markets later rebounded, increasing the value of collateral held against the loans. That included shares in Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust, which surged alongside Bitcoin’s recovery. DCG claimed Genesis not only avoided financial damage but ultimately profited from 3AC’s collapse. “[T]he incremental amounts realized by Genesis after issuance of the Note were … far more than sufficient to overcome the prior $1.1 billion collateral shortfall — and, on information and belief, allowed Genesis to profit from [3AC]’s default by recovering nearly $2.8 billion on the original $2.36 billion in [3AC] Loans,” the filing said. Genesis Pushes Back Genesis, however, has rejected the latest complaint, accusing DCG of attempting to rewrite history. “DCG’s unfounded, haphazard and convenient about-face to withhold 3AC distributions is meritless,” said Luke Barefoot, partner at Cleary Gottlieb and counsel to Genesis. “It flatly contradicts the written agreements, DCG’s representations to the bankruptcy court, and the fact that DCG already handed over $100M+ in distributions.” This legal clash follows earlier suits filed by Genesis against DCG, its affiliates, and CEO Barry Silbert. In May, Genesis sought $3.3 billion in damages, accusing its parent company of fraudulent transfers and insider enrichment in the lead-up to bankruptcy. The Wider Market Context The 3AC default was one of several shocks that rattled crypto markets in 2022. The collapse of the Terra ecosystem triggered a cascade of failures, leaving investors with heavy losses and exposing vulnerabilities across the industry. That same year, FTX — once one of the largest exchanges — imploded in spectacular fashion, with executives later indicted for fraud. DCG’s filing referenced the wider turmoil, noting that even without 3AC’s collapse, Genesis would have struggled to survive. “Even had [3AC] not defaulted in June 2022, [Genesis Global Capital] would not have had sufficient capital to withstand the unexpected and devastating market rout that followed the collapse of FTX in November 2022,” the filing stated. Genesis halted withdrawals that month before officially declaring bankruptcy on January 19, 2023. Restructuring and Recovery After months of proceedings, Genesis completed its restructuring in August 2024. The plan involved distributing approximately $4 billion to creditors and other affected parties. While this was seen as a significant step toward closing one of the darkest chapters in crypto lending, disputes between Genesis and DCG remain unresolved. DCG is now seeking more than $105 million plus interest from its subsidiaries, arguing the terms of the promissory note require repayment given the profits made from 3AC’s collateral. Ongoing Legal Battle The latest filing highlights the complex financial web left by crypto’s 2022 crash, with companies still grappling over responsibility for billions lost and gained. For DCG and Genesis, the courtroom has become the battleground for settling questions of accountability. The outcome of this case could have major implications, not just for the firms involved but also for creditors seeking clarity on how recoveries from failed borrowers are handled. With tensions high, the dispute underscores how the ripple effects of 3AC’s collapse and the wider market downturn continue to haunt the sector.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BTC|REGULATION|ASIA,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-08-16 05:00:43

Nevertheless, Trump said both parties made some good progress on a few points, while Putin categorized the meeting as a “starting point.” This was the first time in almost a decade that the Russian leader set foot on US soil when he attended the UN General Assembly in New York City and met then-President Obama. “There were many, many points that we agreed on … I would say a couple of big ones that we haven’t quite got there, but we’ve made some headway,” Trump said at a joint press conference. Putin said the relationship between the two Great Powers has deteriorated to the “lowest point since the Cold War,” but noted that these talks can be considered a “starting point” for improving it. Before the meeting, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed disappointment that his country would not be represented, as many feared that a potential deal could compromise its sovereignty. “Ukraine is ready to work as productively as possible to bring the war to an end, and we count on a strong position from America … A meeting of leaders is needed – at the very least, Ukraine, America, and the Russian side.” Given the potential significance of the meeting, many experts anticipated a volatile crypto market , especially since it took place after Wall Street had closed for the day. However, this wasn’t the case. Bitcoin’s price had slipped ahead of the meeting to just under $117,000 but stopped its nosedive even as both parties failed to reach a peace conclusion. As of press time, BTC has neared $118,000 once again. The cryptocurrency was impacted a lot more by the hot PPI data that came out the day before, as it dropped from its all-time high of $124,500 to under $118,000 within hours. BTCUSD.

American Bitcoin (ABTC), a U.S. Bitcoin mining company, is setting its sights on a significant global expansion. This firm, notably backed by President Donald Trump’s two sons, is actively exploring strategic Bitcoin acquisitions of crypto-related companies across Asia. This bold move signals a new chapter for the company and the broader digital asset landscape. What’s Happening? American Bitcoin Targets Asia for Strategic Growth American Bitcoin is not just thinking big; it is acting decisively. Reports from the Financial Times indicate that ABTC is diligently reviewing potential acquisition targets in the Asia crypto market . Sources familiar with the discussions suggest a strong focus on acquiring a publicly listed firm in Japan. Additionally, the company may also consider opportunities in Hong Kong, further cementing its reach in key Asian financial hubs. While ABTC confirms it is reviewing opportunities in several regions, it emphasizes that no binding commitments have been made yet. This cautious approach ensures due diligence as the company navigates complex international markets. The potential for these acquisitions is immense, as they could significantly boost ABTC’s operational scale and market presence. Why Asia? Understanding the Drive for Bitcoin Acquisitions Why is Asia such a compelling target for Bitcoin acquisitions ? The continent represents a dynamic and rapidly evolving landscape for cryptocurrency. Many Asian countries have embraced digital assets, fostering innovation and significant market liquidity. This makes them attractive for companies seeking to expand their global footprint. Market Maturity: Countries like Japan have established regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies. High Adoption Rates: Asia boasts a large and growing user base for digital assets. Technological Hubs: The region is home to numerous tech-forward companies and skilled talent. ABTC’s focus on listed firms suggests a desire for established infrastructure and immediate market access, bypassing some of the challenges of building from scratch. The Path to Public Markets: American Bitcoin Mining Expansion Beyond its ambitious Asian acquisition strategy, American Bitcoin has a major plan for its domestic presence. The company intends to go public in the U.S. this September. This significant step will occur through a reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed miner Gryphon Digital Mining . A reverse merger allows a private company to become publicly traded by merging with an existing public company. This process often provides a faster route to market compared to a traditional Initial Public Offering (IPO). Becoming a publicly traded entity will provide ABTC with access to greater capital, which is crucial for funding its aggressive Bitcoin mining expansion and acquisition endeavors. Navigating the Landscape: Opportunities and Challenges for Gryphon Digital Mining The proposed reverse merger with Gryphon Digital Mining presents both exciting opportunities and potential challenges. For Gryphon, this merger could mean a significant boost in profile and operational scale by joining forces with a well-capitalized entity backed by prominent figures. For ABTC, leveraging Gryphon’s existing Nasdaq listing offers a streamlined path to public markets. However, international expansion, particularly into the Asia crypto market , comes with its own set of complexities: Regulatory Differences: Each country has unique rules for crypto operations. Cultural Nuances: Business practices can vary significantly across regions. Competitive Landscape: Asia already has strong local players in the crypto space. Careful navigation of these factors will be key to ABTC’s success in its global ambitions. In conclusion, American Bitcoin is making a definitive statement about its global aspirations. By eyeing strategic Bitcoin acquisitions in Asia and planning a major U.S. public listing via Gryphon Digital Mining , the company is positioning itself for substantial Bitcoin mining expansion . This ambitious strategy underscores the increasing interconnectedness of the global Asia crypto market and the growing institutional interest in digital assets. It will be fascinating to watch how these plans unfold and reshape the future of Bitcoin mining. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is American Bitcoin (ABTC)?

What’s next for the third-largest cryptocurrency, as it seems to be consolidating within a tight range? 120 million $XRP bought up by whales on the dip! pic.twitter.com/pU8BKXKRKx — Ali (@ali_charts) August 15, 2025 Whales are among the most significant players in the cryptocurrency markets, as their moves are usually substantial and impactful. After all, they have the ability to shake the underlying assets with massive purchases or sales. XRP investors could be hopeful in this regard as Ripple whales seem to be determined to acquire as much of the token’s circulating supply as possible, according to the most recent data. As Ali Martinez shared, they accumulated over $360 million worth of XRP during the most recent dip. However, that’s not all, as they have been on a buying spree for the past few weeks. As reported before, they had purchased another 320 million XRP (valued at roughly $1 billion) in the span of just three days. Such substantial acquisitions not only reduce the circulating supply but could also serve as an example to smaller investors that might follow suit and jump on the XRP bandwagon. The price of Ripple’s token has calmed in the past few weeks after going through an explosive July. At the time, it soared from under $2.30 to mark a new all-time high in the middle of the month at over $3.65 before it slumped back down toward $2.70. However, the past ten days or so have been less volatile as XRP has found itself in a tight range between $3.00 and $3.30. It tested the lower boundary on a couple of occasions in the past 36 hours, but the bulls stepped up and managed to defend it. According to Martinez, the upper boundary is at $3.26, and a break above it could send the asset flying to a new all-time high of $3.90. $XRP consolidates in a triangle!

Many are eyeing the charts for the next XRP bull run 2025, with experts debating whether the XRP $10 target is realistic. Institutional crypto inflows, growing tokenization, and the rollout of DeFi projects on the XRP Ledger are all cited as fuel for the next leg up. While XRP is a heavyweight with proven liquidity, smaller emerging projects are also gaining attention. One name that’s making waves is MAGACOIN FINANCE—a rising star with a major surge potential, according to bullish analyst outlooks. XRP Price Prediction for the Next Bull Cycle Market analysts are laying out four potential scenarios for XRP: Conservative: $5.50 with steady banking adoption. Base Case: $7.50 fueled by ETF demand and DeFi rollout. Bull Case: XRP $10 target with full EVM integration and tokenization growth. Ultra-Bull: $15 if mass CBDC adoption takes hold. The Ripple XRP forecast leans toward the base and bull cases, especially if institutional crypto inflows gather pace. Many traders see DeFi integration as the game-changer for network activity, while EVM compatibility could attract developers from other ecosystems. If XRP maintains momentum in these areas, the XRP bull run 2025 could be its strongest rally yet—placing the $10 level within striking distance. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Why Analysts Predict 78x Growth Potential While XRP attracts large-scale investors with its established network, MAGACOIN FINANCE is winning attention as a bold high-growth play. Crypto market watchers believe it could be one of the best crypto to buy now, with projections of a 78x price surge if community adoption accelerates. MAGACOIN FINANCE blends meme coin appeal with expansion plans aimed at keeping traders engaged beyond hype cycles. Early community traction, potential exchange listings, and market sentiment are all working in its favor. For risk-tolerant investors, the upside is eye-catching—making it a candidate for those hunting outsized returns alongside more stable assets like XRP. Final Outlook: Two Coins, Different Risk Profiles The Ripple XRP forecast shows a path toward the XRP $10 target if institutional crypto inflows and DeFi adoption stay on track. This makes XRP appealing for investors looking for stability and strong upside potential. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a speculative but potentially explosive opportunity. If its growth mirrors analyst expectations, its 78x surge prediction could make it a standout in the next XRP bull run 2025 cycle. Together, they present two distinct strategies—XRP as a steady climb and MAGACOIN FINANCE as the moonshot. Both could have a place in a well-balanced, forward-looking crypto portfolio.

The company intends to name the fund Grayscale Dogecoin Trust ETF, noting it will allow investors to gain exposure to Dogecoin without directly owning the token. If approval is granted, the fund will trade on NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol GDOG . Grayscale chooses Coinbase Custody Trust Company to safeguard its ETF assets According to the company’s filing, Dogecoin will serve as the trust’s sole asset, under the custody of Coinbase Custody Trust Company. Shares will also be issued and redeemed in blocks of 10,000, referred to as “Baskets,” with settlement initially taking place in cash rather than through Dogecoin transfers. The trust’s valuation will also be based on the CoinDesk Dogecoin Reference Rate, representing DOGE’s market price without factoring in fees or liabilities. It is also designed as a passive vehicle, with no active trading, leverage, or derivative usage. The filing also outlines several risk factors, including DOGE’s price volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and potential competition from other digital assets. The ETF proposal complies with NYSE’s updated listing requirements from January 31, 2025. However, the company insists its share offerings will only be accessible once the application has been authorized. Nonetheless, the asset filing has already impacted DOGE prices. After its filing, the token surged 2.5% rising to $0.22976 from $0.22395. Per Trading View’s data, DOGE’s price spiked toward the close of trading, ending a period of sideways movement. The token is up 2.67% in the last seven days and 14.65% over the past 30 days. However, the filing comes on the heels of the SEC decision to push back rulings on Solana ETF applications from Bitwise, 21Shares, and VanEck, plus 21Shares’ Dogecoin ETF. Bitwise filed its S-1 registration statement for a Dogecoin ETF Bitwise also submitted its Dogecoin ETF application for approval in late January to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. In the filing, the platform identified Coinbase Custody as the future custodian of the ETF’s assets. Though at the time, it did not disclose the ETF’s management fee, ticker symbol, or the exchange where it might be listed. REX-Osprey is also awaiting the SEC’s approval for its spot Dogecoin ETF. Nevertheless, the commission still has many other pending meme-coin ETF proposals featuring TRUMP, BONK, and Pudgy Penguins. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart believes that with the increase in firms applying for ETF approvals, most of them are “testing the limits of what this SEC is going to allow.” Grayscale had also submitted a filing for a US IPO during the crypto week, just a few months after Gemini filed for a confidential IPO. According to analysts, most firms opt for confidential IPO filings to have more control and avoid reputational risks. The process allows for regulator engagement and SEC feedback without external scrutiny. Still, going public with a confidential filing can be leveraged to create momentum in the market and test investor demand. Grayscale already has its Bitcoin and Ether investment funds with over $33 billion in assets under management and more than three dozen products.

Hong Kong SFC’s Crypto Custody Overhaul Targets Wallet Weakness In a website announcement , the Hong Kong SFC revealed a new circular addressing minimum custody requirements for all licensed virtual asset trading platforms (VATPs). The document touches on a variety of topics like cold wallet management and real-time threat monitoring, and also sets out examples of good practices. The SFC has placed these standards in response to overseas cybersecurity incidents that exposed vulnerabilities in the wallet management systems of crypto exchanges. According to a Hacken report , the industry lost $3.1 billion to attacks in the first half of 2025 alone. The Hong Kong regulator also conducted a targeted review earlier this year to test VATPs against similar vulnerabilities. “Whilst most Platform Operators reported having fundamental control measures in place, certain responses were deemed inadequate,” noted the circular. VATPs aren’t the only ones expected to meet the requirements in today’s document release. The same standards will also apply to virtual asset custodians, and the SFC notes these guidelines will serve as the prerequisites for transitioning to more advanced custody technologies. Dr Eric Yip, Executive Director of Intermediaries at SFC, said: In order for Hong Kong to foster a competitive, sustainable and trusted digital asset ecosystem, client asset protection must always remain a top priority for all licensed VATPs, which can leverage the SFC’s practical guide to step up their custody practices especially amid heightened risks globally. The move has followed other regulatory efforts by Hong Kong to present itself as more crypto-friendly. In May, the city’s stablecoin bill passed legislature and went into action at the start of this month. Big names like Standard Chartered in its joint-venture have lined up to apply for a stablecoin license under this rule. The first batch of approvals isn’t expected to come until 2026, however, according to reports . Bitcoin Price Has Slipped Under $118,000 The number one crypto, Bitcoin, took a blow on Thursday as its price plunged below the $118,000 mark. The fires of volatility were fanned by an interview involving US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said the government doesn’t plan to buy the digital asset for its Strategic Reserve and will instead build it using confiscated assets. A few hours later, however, Bessent took to X and clarified that the Treasury is also open to exploring budget-neutral ways of acquiring more of the asset. From the chart, it’s visible that BTC’s price made some recovery following the statement, but it didn’t last long as the coin has dropped back to $117,800.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto Custody|crypto exchanges|hong kong|Hong Kong crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-16 06:00:02

This pullback hasn’t slowed traders — instead, it’s redirected attention to top presales, where early-stage crypto investment often captures the highest upside. In past cycles, the best crypto presales have multiplied portfolios many times over, creating stories of life-changing gains. With a new batch of high-potential tokens entering the market, one name starting to gain traction is MAGACOIN FINANCE, tipped by some analysts as a standout for the 2025 bull run. Presale Popularity Surges as Bitcoin Drives Altcoin Rotation Whenever Bitcoin surges, liquidity often flows into smaller coins in search of higher percentage returns. That’s why seasoned traders keep an eye on the top presales — they’re hunting for projects before they hit exchanges, aiming for tokens that can deliver 25x gains crypto or more. Over the years, early participants in the best crypto presales have seen extreme returns, with meme coins, DeFi tokens, and gaming projects all producing breakout winners. This season is no different. High-conviction plays are attracting both retail traders and early institutional capital, building the kind of buzz that can send valuations soaring once trading begins. For many, getting in early is less about hype and more about stacking the odds toward exponential returns. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Institutional Attention with 95x Projections Institutional market forecasts are flagging MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most promising plays in this cycle’s best crypto presales list. Analysts tracking early-stage crypto investment models are projecting a potential 95x growth before the late-stage bull peak. The combination of high community engagement, strategic liquidity plans, and a politically charged brand identity has helped it stand out from other contenders. The MAGACOIN presale has already drawn attention for its potential to deliver 25x gains crypto, with some suggesting that, if market conditions align, the upside could extend far beyond that. Strategic Positioning Could Carry MAGACOIN Through the Bull Cycle Smart traders aren’t betting on just one token — they’re spreading exposure across multiple top presales to balance risk and maximize potential upside. MAGACOIN fits into that strategy as a high-reward allocation, with the possibility of holding through the cycle for peak value capture. If the bullish sentiment continues and altcoin inflows accelerate, MAGACOIN could see its profile rise sharply. Its unique branding and institutional attention suggest it may have the staying power to carry deep into the bull run. For those following early-stage crypto investment trends, MAGACOIN is a name worth tracking closely this year.

Market watchers predict a short-term rebound once the macroeconomic factors stabilize. While Solana price and other top coins consolidate, a very different trend is emerging: top whale wallets are redirecting capital into Remittix (RTX) , the fast-rising cross-border payment token now on the verge of a $20 million presale milestone. Whale Exits Trigger More Losses for Solana, Cardano, and XRP Crypto markets faced a sharp reversal following hotter-than-expected U.S. PPI data , wiping out over $1 billion in leveraged positions in a single day. Solana price fell to $187.55, down 4.57%, as persistent network congestion once again shook investor confidence. Transaction delays and throughput constraints have reignited concerns over the chain’s scalability as DeFi activity on rival platforms intensifies. Cardano saw its rally fade, retracing from $1.01 highs to close near $0.92. While ADA has broken through a long-standing resistance, heavy whale outflows threaten to undermine recent momentum. XRP slipped from $3.30 to $3.10 as whales sold nearly $1.9 billion worth of tokens in three days, overpowering fresh accumulation and keeping the $3.34 resistance intact. Solana Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko These price stalls, coupled with operational worries in Solana’s case, have accelerated capital rotation among high-net-worth crypto investors, who are increasingly seeking projects with growth potential before their public exchange debut. Remittix Becomes the New Whale Destination Amid Rising Presale Momentum While the broader market stalls, Remittix is moving in the opposite direction. The payments-focused blockchain project has now raised over $19.7 million and sold 602 million RTX tokens in presale, with whales from Solana, Cardano, and XRP among recent buyers. Importantly, the momentum isn’t just a speculative rush. Remittix is targeting a space traditionally dominated by banks and select fintech giants, positioning itself as a blockchain-powered alternative to SWIFT and costly remittance services. Remittix’s appeal lies in its real-world utility: Cross-border crypto-to-bank transfers across 30+ countries. Real-time FX conversion into 30+ fiat currencies. Multi-chain wallet support and gas fee optimization. Transparent, low-cost payment routing. With only a small gap left to the $20 million target, the point at which the first centralized exchange (CEX) listing will be announced, buying pressure has intensified. The 40% presale bonus is still active until that milestone, adding urgency for investors looking to secure the lowest entry price before public trading begins. Why Remittix Could Outrun Top Layer 1 Tokens Unlike Solana, Cardano, or XRP, Remittix is still at its ground floor valuation, offering a functional, near-ready product suite. Several catalysts could fuel a post-launch rally toward 100x: Immediate CEX listing impact once the $20M presale target is hit. Adoption of Beta Wallets in multi-chain environments. Entry into underutilized remittance routes in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Certik-audited smart contracts Strong tokenomics designed to reduce circulating supply over time. For whales leaving Solana price volatility, ADA’s uncertain breakout, or XRP’s whale-induced stalls, RTX offers a rare mix of early-stage upside and real-world payment utility. If presale momentum continues at its current pace, Remittix could debut on exchanges with more buy-side pressure than many established Layer 1s are seeing today.

This new approach seeks to move away from traditional methods like common stock sales and convertible bonds, which have already helped Strategy amass $75 billion in Bitcoin assets. Saylor’s Bitcoin Credit Model The perpetual preferred stock, branded “Stretch,” offers a unique financial structure—these securities do not mature and can even defer dividend payments, providing flexibility for the issuer while potentially unsettling investors. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces The Level That Decides Everything: Analyst The Stretch offering features variable-rate dividends and lacks voting rights, positioning it as neither conventional debt nor typical equity. Saylor believes this could provide the company with the necessary capital to continue acquiring Bitcoin. According to Bloomberg, over the next four years, he plans to retire billions in convertible notes, reduce common stock sales, and rely more heavily on preferred offerings as his primary funding source. This ambitious plan aims to establish a “BTC Credit Model,” where Bitcoin underpins a new stream of income. Saylor envisions the potential to raise “$100 billion… even $200 billion” if demand for these securities is strong. High-Yield Risks So far this year, Strategy has raised approximately $6 billion through four perpetual preferred offerings, with the latest $2.5 billion tranche being one of the largest capital raises in the crypto space this year. As Michael Youngworth from Bank of America noted, this retail-driven approach is unique in the corporate preferred market, which is typically dominated by investment-grade institutions. However, there are concerns about the sustainability of this model. The perpetual preferreds require ongoing, substantial dividend payments, which could be a challenge given that Bitcoin itself does not generate income. Saylor’s push for perpetual preferreds is also a strategic response to the limitations of the convertible market, which tends to exclude retail investors. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Could Explode 44,000% To Cross $1,000 Strategy’s CEO, Phong Le, has framed this shift as a way to create a more resilient capital structure, particularly in light of the challenges faced during the 2022 “crypto winter.” Despite the potential advantages, the high yields associated with perpetual preferreds—often between 8% and 10%—could become burdensome, especially in a market downturn, according to experts. Critics like short-seller Jim Chanos have labeled these instruments as “crazy” for institutions to buy, given their non-cumulative nature and the issuer’s discretion over dividend payments. When writing, Bitcoin trades at $117,260, retracing over 5% from the recently achieved $124,400 all-time high earlier in the week. Year-to-date, the market’s leading crypto is up 101%.

The token’s price has surged over 50% in 2025, spending a notable amount of time above $3, which has historically served as resistance. A Turning Point for XRP A major factor contributing to this growth is the recent agreement between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to dismiss their appeals , effectively ending the longest-running legal battle in the crypto space. With the lawsuit now over, the company can redirect its resources towards more critical areas. Market participants are also debating XRP’s price trajectory now that the regulatory environment is becoming increasingly crypto-friendly. We’ve asked ChatGPT-5 for insight into the digital asset’s price by the end of 2025. XRP Price Prediction for the End of 2025 Taking into account the current price of $3.08 and various market factors, ChatGPT-5 presents a nuanced view of XRP’s potential price trajectory. According to the chatbot, a conservative scenario would see XRP trading between $3.3 and $3.5 by year-end, representing potential growth ranging from 7.1% to 13.6%. In this scenario, Bitcoin would remain largely stagnant, and XRP would not see notable regulatory breakthroughs. However, many big developments are on the horizon for the crypto market. With additional catalysts, a moderately bullish scenario could push XRP’s price to around $5, translating to a 55.8% upside. This would surpass its current peak of $3.65 , and ChatGPT-5 expects stronger institutional interest, potential new partnerships with Ripple, and more favorable macroeconomic conditions to drive this surge. In a truly bullish scenario, the digital asset could see noteworthy increases in institutional adoption, a potential new spot XRP ETF launch , and other growth catalysts, driving the price to between $9 and $15, marking a potential growth range of 192.2% to 387%. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In what ChatGPT-5 describes as an ultra-bullish scenario, XRP could potentially climb 224.68% to $10. While this move could be driven by many positive market factors, ChatGPT-5 stated that the $5 target is the most likely outcome for 2025. Current Trends and Indicators XRP has fallen by over 6% in the past 24 hours. However, its 24-hour trading volume is up by almost 40%, and whales have been accumulating tokens at a rapid rate , leading to speculation about a potential rally. From a technical standpoint, the asset has fallen below its 7-day simple moving average at $3.24 and broken a bullish trendline that had supported prices since July. The MACD histogram has also flattened, indicating fading momentum, while the RSI suggests additional downside is possible before entering oversold territory.

Today, we delve into the latest 24-hour BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios, offering a compelling snapshot of current trader sentiment. These ratios provide vital insights into how participants are positioning themselves in the dynamic Bitcoin derivatives market, indicating potential shifts in momentum and overall Bitcoin market sentiment . Understanding Long-Short Ratios : A Key to Bitcoin Market Sentiment ? Long-short ratios represent the proportion of long positions (bets on price increases) versus short positions (bets on price decreases) within the derivatives market. When the ratio favors long positions, it typically suggests a bullish outlook among traders. Conversely, a higher proportion of short positions indicates a prevailing bearish sentiment. Analyzing these ratios, especially for BTC perpetual futures , helps traders gauge overall market conviction and anticipate potential price movements. This data forms a cornerstone for informed decision-making in the volatile crypto space. Over the past 24 hours, the aggregated data across major cryptocurrency exchanges reveals a slight bearish inclination: Total: Long 48.51%, Short 51.49% This indicates that, on aggregate, more traders are betting on a price decline for Bitcoin in the immediate future, reflecting the collective Bitcoin market sentiment . Deeper Dive into BTC Perpetual Futures Across Exchanges While the overall picture leans bearish, examining individual exchanges provides a more nuanced view of market dynamics and offers unique crypto trading insights . Different platforms often attract diverse trader demographics, leading to varied positioning and sentiment distribution. Here’s a breakdown of the long-short ratios from three prominent exchanges: Binance: Long 48.62%, Short 51.38% Bybit: Long 46.11%, Short 53.89% Gate.io: Long 52.11%, Short 47.89% Notice the intriguing differences: Binance closely mirrors the aggregate trend. Bybit, however, displays an even stronger bearish bias, with short positions significantly outweighing longs. Interestingly, Gate.io stands out with a bullish majority, where long positions are more prevalent. This disparity highlights the importance of not just looking at total figures but also specific platforms for comprehensive derivatives data analysis and better crypto trading insights . Actionable Derivatives Data : How to Use Long-Short Ratios Understanding these BTC perpetual futures ratios is not merely academic; it offers actionable insights for traders. When the majority leans heavily one way, it can sometimes signal a contrarian opportunity. For instance, if an excessive number of traders are short, a sudden upward price movement could trigger a “short squeeze,” leading to rapid price appreciation as short sellers are forced to cover their positions. This dynamic can create significant volatility. Consider these crucial points when integrating derivatives data into your trading strategy: Confirm Trends: Use long-short ratios to confirm existing price trends. If prices are falling and shorts are increasing, it reinforces the bearish trend, strengthening your conviction. Identify Reversals: Extreme long or short biases can sometimes precede a market reversal. When nearly everyone is positioned on one side, the market might be ripe for a counter-move, surprising many. Risk Management: Knowing the prevailing Bitcoin market sentiment helps in adjusting your risk exposure. If the market is overwhelmingly short, you might consider tighter stop-losses on any long positions you hold, protecting your capital. This detailed analysis of long-short ratios significantly helps in refining your approach to the often-volatile Bitcoin market. Navigating the Market: Benefits and Challenges of Analyzing Crypto Trading Insights While invaluable, relying solely on long-short ratios has its challenges. These ratios are a snapshot in time and can change rapidly, sometimes within minutes. They do not fully account for the leverage used by traders, which can amplify market movements significantly. Furthermore, whale activity (large institutional trades) might not be entirely reflected in these predominantly retail-focused metrics. Therefore, it is essential to combine this data with other technical and fundamental analysis tools for a truly holistic market view. However, the benefits of utilizing these crypto trading insights are substantial: Early Warning System: Ratios can serve as an early indicator of shifting sentiment before it manifests in significant price action, giving you a head start. Confirmation Tool: They can confirm hypotheses derived from other indicators, strengthening your trading conviction and confidence. Behavioral Insights: These ratios provide a direct window into the collective psychology of derivatives traders, offering unique perspectives on market behavior. In conclusion, monitoring BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios offers a powerful lens into the current state of the market. While no single metric guarantees success, incorporating this vital derivatives data into your analytical toolkit provides a significant edge. It helps you understand prevailing sentiment, anticipate potential reversals, and make more informed decisions in your crypto trading journey. Always remember to combine this valuable insight with comprehensive research and sound risk management practices. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are BTC perpetual futures?

U.S. crypto exchange Gemini Trust Company has officially filed an S-1 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), aiming for a Nasdaq listing under the ticker GEMI. This monumental step marks a pivotal moment for the industry, as the Gemini IPO moves forward. While the initial public offering price remains undisclosed, this filing reveals more than just a public listing ambition; it sheds light on a substantial financial agreement with blockchain giant Ripple Labs Inc. What Does Gemini’s SEC S-1 Filing Entail? Gemini’s recent SEC S-1 Filing is a critical step for any company seeking to go public in the United States. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the company’s business, financial performance, risks, and future plans to potential investors. For a cryptocurrency exchange, such a filing is particularly noteworthy due to the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding digital assets. Gemini initially submitted its IPO application confidentially to the SEC back in June, demonstrating a measured approach to this significant market debut. The S-1 filing offers transparency into Gemini’s operations, a key aspect for institutional investors considering participation in a Crypto Exchange Listing . It allows the public and regulators to scrutinize the company’s health and adherence to compliance standards. This level of disclosure is vital for building trust in the nascent digital asset market. The Strategic Ripple RLUSD Loan: A Closer Look at Digital Asset Credit Beyond the public listing aspirations, the S-1 filing brought another intriguing detail to light: a credit agreement with Ripple Labs Inc. This deal, dated July 2025, grants Gemini access to up to $75 million, with the potential to expand to $150 million, in Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. This Ripple RLUSD Loan signifies a notable collaboration between two major players in the crypto space. Key aspects of this Digital Asset Credit arrangement include: Credit Line Amount: Initially up to $75 million, with an option to increase to $150 million. Asset Type: The loan is denominated in RLUSD, Ripple’s USD-pegged stablecoin. Term: The agreement is set for July 2025, indicating a mid-term financial arrangement. Such inter-company lending agreements are becoming more common in the digital asset ecosystem, providing liquidity and strategic partnerships. The use of a stablecoin like RLUSD for this credit line underscores the growing utility and acceptance of stablecoins in large-scale financial transactions within the crypto industry. Impact on the Crypto Exchange Listing Landscape The Gemini IPO , coupled with its substantial Ripple RLUSD loan, could set a precedent for other digital asset firms considering public markets. A successful Crypto Exchange Listing on Nasdaq would not only provide Gemini with significant capital but also enhance its public profile and regulatory oversight. This move signals a maturing industry, one that is increasingly seeking traditional financial pathways for growth and legitimacy. However, the path to a public listing is not without its challenges. The SEC’s scrutiny of crypto-related entities remains high, as evidenced by ongoing regulatory discussions and enforcement actions. Gemini’s ability to navigate this process successfully will be closely watched by competitors and investors alike, potentially paving the way for more digital asset companies to pursue similar paths. This development highlights the evolving relationship between the traditional financial world and the innovative, yet often volatile, realm of cryptocurrencies. In conclusion, Gemini’s SEC S-1 Filing for an IPO on Nasdaq, combined with its significant Ripple RLUSD Loan , marks a pivotal moment for the crypto industry. It signifies a continued push towards mainstream financial integration and increased transparency for digital asset firms. As the market watches this Digital Asset Credit deal and the Gemini IPO unfolds, it will undoubtedly influence future strategies for other crypto exchanges and their pursuit of public market opportunities. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an S-1 registration statement? A: An S-1 registration statement is a preliminary prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by companies planning to go public. It provides detailed information about the company’s business, finances, and risks to potential investors. Q2: What is the significance of Gemini filing for an IPO? A: Gemini’s IPO filing is significant because it represents a major step towards mainstream financial integration for a prominent cryptocurrency exchange. It could set a precedent for other digital asset companies seeking public market opportunities, enhancing transparency and legitimacy for the industry. Q3: What is the Ripple RLUSD loan agreement about? A: The agreement grants Gemini access to up to $150 million in Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin by July 2025. This provides Gemini with a significant credit line, demonstrating a strategic financial partnership between two major crypto entities. Q4: How does this affect the broader crypto market? A: This development could foster greater institutional confidence and potentially accelerate the adoption of digital assets within traditional finance. It highlights the growing maturity of the crypto industry and its willingness to embrace regulatory oversight. Q5: What is RLUSD? A: RLUSD is Ripple’s USD-pegged stablecoin. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value relative to a fiat currency, like the U.S. dollar, making them useful for transactions and lending within the digital asset ecosystem.

Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk), a prominent crypto analyst on X, shared a heatmap highlighting dense order concentration in the upper band, showing layered sell orders stacked from roughly the high-$3 area toward $4.34. Cryptoinsightuk added, “Send it to $4.34 with haste.” The implication is straightforward. When momentum returns, markets often trade toward the nearest heavy liquidity pockets, using them as short-term objectives. With the price hovering near $3.08 on the chart, the path into that cluster looks accessible if buyers sustain pressure . Liquidity growing above us for $XRP in the last 2 days. Send it to $4.34 with haste https://t.co/nocIpwK8JU pic.twitter.com/ghCcJbOEDw — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) August 14, 2025 Why $4.34 Stands Out The $4.34 level aligns with the upper boundary of the highlighted cluster, where the heatmap shows the most intense band of resting sell orders. The volume profile to the right of the chart also lines up with a notable concentration of recorded derivatives activity, indicating a potential supply zone. Reaching this level would enable the digital asset’s price to transact against a large number of resting orders, which facilitate swift execution during directional moves . In practice, this kind of clustering creates a clear interim target for short-term traders. Once the price enters the band, depth can thin quickly as orders get filled or pulled, allowing continuation until a new equilibrium emerges. Altcoin Rotation Contributes to Bullish Sentiment Cryptoinsightuk previously pointed to weakening Bitcoin dominance, a backdrop that has historically preceded periods of relative outperformance for altcoins. That broader context matters because a decline in dominance often coincides with massive altcoin growth . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If that rotation gathers pace, XRP’s recently expanding overhead liquidity may become an attainable target rather than a ceiling. Veteran trader Peter Brandt recently confirmed the arrival of alt season , and the market is anticipating a massive altcoin rally over the next few weeks. What Would Confirm or Invalidate the Move Confirmation would look like acceptance above intermediate resistance in the mid-$3s, rising volumes, and stable or favorable funding as the price approaches the lower edge of the liquidity band. A clean push into the cluster, followed by sustained bullish candles rather than immediate rejection, would strengthen the case for $4.34. Conversely, a sharp rejection from the first tests of the band, fading volumes, or a rise in aggressive selling would be a cause for caution. Traders should also watch for thinning of the band. If it decreases materially before the price arrives, the asset may not reach that target. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

We witnessed significant crypto liquidations , with over a quarter-billion dollars in perpetual futures positions wiped out. This event serves as a stark reminder of the inherent crypto market volatility and the risks associated with leveraged trading. When traders open highly leveraged long positions liquidated , even small price movements can trigger these automatic closures, impacting thousands across various exchanges. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone involved in futures trading . What Causes Crypto Liquidations to Surge? What exactly are liquidations, and why do they happen so frequently in the crypto space? A liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is automatically closed by an exchange. This happens because the market moves against their trade, and their margin balance falls below the required maintenance level. Essentially, the exchange forces the closure to prevent the trader from incurring further losses beyond their initial collateral. For perpetual futures , which are a type of derivative contract with no expiry date, leverage amplifies both potential gains and losses. While leverage can boost profits, it also means a smaller price swing can lead to a complete loss of the collateral used for that specific trade. The recent surge in crypto liquidations highlights periods of high market stress or rapid price corrections, where many traders find their positions underwater simultaneously. Why Were So Many Long Positions Liquidated in Perpetual Futures? The data from the past 24 hours paints a clear picture of the market’s recent movements. Here’s a breakdown of the primary assets affected: Ethereum (ETH): Approximately $170 million in ETH positions were liquidated, with a staggering 81.76% being long positions. This indicates a sharp downturn that caught many bullish traders off guard. Bitcoin (BTC): About $51.66 million in BTC positions faced liquidation, with an even higher 89.28% being long. Bitcoin, as the market leader, often sets the tone, and its decline significantly impacted other assets. Solana (SOL): Around $27.21 million in SOL positions were liquidated, with 83.65% being long. Solana’s rapid growth has attracted many traders, making it susceptible to such events during market corrections. Why were so many long positions liquidated ? Long positions bet on a price increase. When the market experiences a sudden downward trend, these long positions are the first to be hit. This widespread liquidation of long positions suggests a broad market correction or a sudden shift in sentiment, triggering a cascade effect where initial liquidations lead to further price drops, causing more crypto liquidations . How Can Traders Navigate Crypto Market Volatility in Futures Trading? The inherent crypto market volatility is a double-edged sword. While it offers opportunities for significant gains, it also carries substantial risks, especially in futures trading . For traders, understanding risk management is paramount.

Unexpected news can trigger rapid price movements. Diversify: Do not put all your capital into one highly leveraged position. Understand Funding Rates: In perpetual futures , funding rates can also impact your profitability and position over time. These events, characterized by massive crypto liquidations , are not uncommon. They serve as crucial lessons for both seasoned and new traders about the realities of the market. In conclusion, the past 24 hours saw a significant wave of crypto liquidations , primarily affecting long positions across major assets like ETH, BTC, and SOL. This highlights the ever-present crypto market volatility and the critical importance of prudent risk management in perpetual futures and general futures trading . By understanding how and why these events occur, traders can better prepare and navigate the unpredictable nature of digital asset markets, safeguarding their investments from sudden shifts and avoiding having their long positions liquidated unnecessarily. Stay informed, stay cautious, and trade responsibly. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is crypto liquidation? Crypto liquidation occurs when an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because the market moves against their trade, and their margin balance falls below the required maintenance level. 2.

If a long position is liquidated, it means the asset’s price dropped significantly, causing the leveraged trade to be automatically closed by the exchange. 4. How can traders avoid crypto liquidations? Traders can avoid liquidations by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders, diversifying their portfolio, and closely monitoring market sentiment and news. 5. Is crypto futures trading safe? Crypto futures trading carries significant risks due to high volatility and leverage.

Wallets might be hardware, software, an app, or the cloud. Many crypto users prefer non-custodial wallets since they allow the management of their private data. With a non-custodial wallet, you don’t have to trust a third party with your private keys. The bankruptcy of crypto companies FTX and BlockFi has many consumers wondering if their funds are lost forever. Non-custodial wallets aren’t risk-free; they’re less forgiving of mistakes like lost passwords. and thus, knowing the wallet’s password is crucial. What are crypto wallets, and why do you need one? A cryptocurrency wallet is a software/hardware device that allows you to store your cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies do not exist in any physical form. Technically, cryptocurrency can only be stored in coin wallets. This crypto savings plan is simple to use, yet it is secure and quick. Before we dive in, you need to understand this about crypto wallets People are afraid to invest in cryptocurrencies because of security threats, especially since it’s the investor’s obligation to protect the investment. Unlike FDIC-insured bank accounts, Crypto is unregulated by most governments. It’s tough to recover lost or stolen cryptocurrency; therefore, you must secure it. While there is a risk with online transactions, many of the same habits will keep your Bitcoin safe. Crypto wallet security is similar to online banking security. You may do a few things to protect your cryptocurrency investment. Below are various ways of keeping your cryptocurrency safe in wallets. First, store your crypto wallet in a “cold” (hardware) wallet. Only keep what you need online for transactions and store the rest offline. A USB-sized cold crypto wallet carries a private key to access your funds. Losing your private key means losing your investment. Buy/sell on a trustworthy exchange Some exchanges are safer than others. Do your investigation to find out which cryptocurrency exchanges have been hacked. If an exchange is hacked, it reveals weak security methods or vulnerabilities, putting your money at risk. Use a password manager to manage your passwords. In today’s world, your passwords may likely be compromised. Setting a complex password, storing it carefully, and changing it often will protect it. Don’t repeat passwords for your crypto wallet or other sensitive sites. Multiple Factor Authenticator (MFA) MFA protects your account with a password, security token, and/or biometrics. MFA is “knowing and having”: you know your password and have a token, push notification, or biometrics. The 10 best crypto wallets by function 1.

It has altered our understanding of money by making it decentralized, borderless, and immune to inflationary manipulation. The rise in popularity of Bitcoin is astounding . From tiny online communities, it has expanded to include Fortune 500 companies’ balance sheets and major institutional investors’ portfolios. It is now a topic of discussion in the finance industry and is no longer just “ digital gold ” for early tech users. Even though Bitcoin is growing in popularity, people are beginning to question, “If BTC is the future of money, where does the faster growth come from?” At that point, new opportunities begin to present themselves, some of which are similar to Solana’s early days. Thats why the topic of MAGACOIN FINANCE is currently being discussed in many trading groups. The role of Bitcoin as a new currency Because it has a safe, open network and a fixed quantity of coins (21 million), Bitcoin differs from other fiat currencies. By providing a secure location for people to store their cash, it has aided during currency crises when local currency fails. It is being used by an increasing number of organizations, including spot ETFs and corporate treasuries. As a result, it becomes even more official and a permanent component of the evolving financial system. However, growth slows down with age. Although smaller projects that are still in their early stages have a higher chance of making significant gains, Bitcoin is still a good way to protect your money. Because of this, more investors are looking to combine the security of Bitcoin with altcoins that have a lot of promise and are prepared to reap the same rapid adoption that made Solana well-known. What Solana’s breakout can teach us Outside of developer circles, Solana was not well known in 2020. Transactions were fast and cheap, and it was supported by a dedicated, active community. Early investors who were willing to weather the ups and downs saw huge returns as the ecosystem grew and the market realized its potential. The strong fundamentals were the cause of the quick growth, and the market was at the right place at the right time. Some analysts say that some projects are starting to look like this. The explanation is clear: Bitcoin is the foundation, but younger assets can spur its growth at a rate that Bitcoin can no longer sustain in a single cycle. Many people are very interested in MAGACOIN FINANCE. Some experts say it’s comparable to how Solana was doing before things got much more expensive . Presale rounds have sold out, increasing demand through a scarcity effect. Blockchain data shows that the number of active wallets and transactions is steadily rising . On the other hand, the roadmap puts long-term growth ahead of trends. The timing is also interesting: as the market becomes more tolerant, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s popularity is rising . Investors who own Bitcoin or other traditional assets can boost their profits more rapidly without risking their main investments by making investment in a high-upside play like this one. Combining stability and speed You simply need to learn how to use both Bitcoin and the new altcoins together; you don’t have to choose between them. While selective investments in projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE provide access to the asymmetric upside characteristic of cryptocurrency bull cycles, Bitcoin provides stability and liquidity to a portfolio. In previous expansions, some of the most successful early adopters set up their plays similarly to this. Final Thoughts Since Bitcoin serves as the decentralized foundation for the upcoming generation of financial systems, it will always be a part of the money of the future. Finding breakthrough projects before others do, however, is the best way to make money quickly, according to history . In the current cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning into one of those uncommon opportunities due to its limited supply, expanding ecosystem, and resemblance to Solana’s early days.

Czech Convicted Trafficker’s Bitcoin Wallets Seized On Friday, Czech media outlets revealed that Tomáš Jiřikovský, the convicted drug trafficker behind the controversial $45 million Bitcoin (BTC) donation to former Czech Justice Minister Pavel Blažek, has been detained after a police raid. In a Thursday press release, Chief State Prosecutor Radim Dragoun informed that the Czech Police, the National Center against Organized Crime (NCOZ), and the Criminal Police and Investigation Service have been conducting an intensive investigation into the criminal case related to the Ministry of Justice scandal. According to the press release, the criminal case involves “suspicion of the commission of the crime of legalization of proceeds from criminal activity under Section 216(1), (4)(b), (5)(b) and (c) of the Criminal Code and the crime of illegal production and other handling of narcotic and psychotropic substances and poisons under Section 283(1), 4(b) of the Criminal Code.” Multiple local news outlets reported that the NCOZ and the High Public Prosecutor’s Office in Olomouc launched an overnight raid on Thursday, detaining Tomáš Jiřikovský during the operation. Notably, Jiřikovský, who made the 468 Bitcoin donation , is a convicted criminal who founded the illegal marketplace Sheep Marketplace in 2013. He is also suspected of having generated 680 BTC from the platform and of having stolen approximately 840 BTC from buyers after shutting down the marketplace. The darknet market, which was shut down in December 2013, was linked to drug trafficking, weapon sales, and counterfeit goods. Deník N reported that police intervened under dramatic circumstances in a house in Břeclav, where Jiřikovský resided. The suspect allegedly escaped to the roof of the house during the raid, but police were able to secure him and took him away. The police also discovered and seized new Bitcoin wallets and tens of millions in cash, likely proceeds from criminal activity. $45 million BTC Donation Scandal In late May, the Czech political landscape was shaken after Justice Minister Pavel Blažek announced that the Justice Ministry had raised nearly 1 billion Czech koruna, approximately $45 million at the time, after selling 468 BTC. As reported by Bitcoinist, Blažek accepted the generous donation in March after Jiřikovský’s lawyer contacted the minister, offering one-third of the criminal’s Bitcoin holdings. This decision ignited massive backlash from opposition leaders and the general public, who condemned Blažek for accepting the gift without investigating the origin of the funds. Following the public outrage, the Justice Minister argued that he was not aware that the donation came from illegal activity. “I have no way of investigating this, and after so many years, it was not relevant to me,” he affirmed. Nonetheless, multiple reports have linked the donation to the Nucleus darknet marketplace. Blažek repeatedly claimed that he had not committed any illegal acts, but stepped down from his position on May 30, leading police to launch the investigation",Crypto News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Donation|Bitcoin scandal|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto donation|Czech Justice Minister scandal|Czech Police|Czech Republic Bitcoin|darknet marketplace,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SPONSORED|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-16 07:00:04

Chainlink and Arbitrum have gained traction this week as traders look to position ahead of possible ETF approvals and broader Ethereum ecosystem. In tandem with this growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE, a new low-cap project, is generating momentum as a likely candidate. With backing from smart money and community-driven hype, it is already being singled out by analysts as the best crypto presale for high-conviction players. Chainlink (LINK): Oracle Demand Rises With Ethereum TVL Chainlink jump above $19.60 as interest in oracle-related infrastructure grows. Off-chain data oracles are back in focus as total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum DeFi surpasses $60 billion. LINK’s price has broken through major resistance zones, and analysts see upside to $22.40 and potentially $26 if momentum continues. LINK’s staking and CCIP adoption are also two major catalysts heading into Q4 2025. Arbitrum (ARB): Layer-2 Bets Heat Up ARB has climbed nearly 9% in the last 48 hours to rise above $1.47 as Ethereum scaling narratives return to the fore. DeFi users and NFT protocols are increasingly active on the Layer-2. As Ethereum (ETH) gas charges are rising, interest in layer-2s (L2s) like Arbitrum and Base would grow. Should ARB maintain above $1.42, the bulls are eyeing the $1.63-$1.78 target zone. The recent proposals for DAO funding and the granting of protocols are assuring internal strength and ecosystem growth, which traders are paying attention to. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Rising Star in the Altcoin Rotation Recognized as best crypto presale for high-conviction players , MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing strong attention from whales, institutional desks, and early-stage investors seeking asymmetric upside. Its scarcity-based tokenomics, accelerating market visibility, and strategically timed roadmap are fueling momentum ahead of expected exchange listings. With liquidity inflows climbing and anticipation building, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a standout opportunity for those aiming to secure early positions before the next market leg. Whale wallets and Telegram research groups are already stacking positions, suggesting that insiders expect a major wave of momentum once MAGACOIN lists. Presale access remains open, but supply is limited — creating urgency among early-stage investors hunting for the next 20x play. Conclusion: ETF Hype is Fueling Strategic Rotations The Ethereum ETF narrative has brought Chainlink and Arbitrum to the forefront, but lower-cap tokens might present a better opportunity as they fly under the radar. A community-driven project, MAGACOIN FINANCE fits the mould of something bold and secure. As it turns out, the early adopters, the ones really in the know, are quietly accumulating this project.

Some analysts have suggested that the cryptocurrency will likely break out to new highs if a key support level is held. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Remains Green Despite Market Pullback – Is It Ready For A 70% Run? Solana Back Below $200 Earlier this week, the market soared under the lead of the two largest cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $124,000, and Ethereum (ETH) hit a multi-year high of $4,788 in the early hours of Thursday. Nonetheless, higher-than-expected macroeconomic signals and the US’s decision not to purchase BTC for its Strategic Reserve sent the market into a nosedive, with most tokens bleeding throughout the day. Solana, which had just climbed to an eight-month high of $209, saw a 10% drop from the highs, retesting the recently reclaimed $190 support level. Price continues to dip after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced it had pushed back its decision on multiple Spot SOL exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change, and the issues raised therein,” the regulatory agency stated. The SEC delayed the final deadline for the decision on Bitwise, 21Shares, VanEck, Grayscale, and Canary Capital Solana ETFs for two months, pushing it to October 16, 2025. Despite the delay, ETF expert James Seyffart suggested that the SEC’s decision is not a bad sign, adding that he expects standard spot SOL ETFs to be approved by mid-October “at the latest.” The altcoin dropped to the $188 area before bouncing. After the brief market recovery, SOL continued to retest the $180-$190 area, hovering between the $184-$186 support zone throughout Friday afternoon. Last Dip Before New Highs? Analyst Ali Martinez offered a positive outlook for the cryptocurrency, affirming that Solana might be offering “a final buy-the-dip chance” before a potential 100% rally from current levels. The analyst pointed to a six-month ascending triangle pattern on the altcoin’s chart, which targets the $360 area once it breaks out of the formation. Notably, SOL has retested the pattern’s resistance twice since the July breakout, with its latest rejection occurring on Thursday. Amid the recent performance, Martinez also noted that wallets holding over 10,000 SOL tokens hit a new ATH this week, with 5,224 wallets holding around $2 million worth of Solana each.

To the market watcher, Solana will likely break out and move to ATH levels soon if it holds above the $180 level, which has been a crucial support and resistance area for the altcoin this cycle.

Selling at $0.0944 a token, the project is close to the key milestone — a $20 million raise — that will trigger the announcement of its first major Centralized Exchange (CEX) listing. The demand keeps building momentum as investors keep looking for the best crypto presale 2025 with real-world applications. Beta Wallet Launch Joins Remittix Hype One of the key developments is the upcoming beta wallet, which will be released in Q3 2025. The mobile-first wallet will enable direct crypto-to-fiat deposits, supporting more than 40 cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies. The wallet will enjoy real-time FX conversion, low gas prices, and instant settlement into bank accounts in more than 30 nations. The beta wallet is a significant milestone in Remittix’s roadmap as a cross-chain DeFi platform, bridging the world of digital assets to traditional finance. By addressing a real-life $19 trillion payments issue, Remittix is establishing itself as a new altcoin to keep an eye on before the next bull cycle. Crossing the $20 Million Threshold With over 602 million tokens sold, Remittix is among the fastest-growing crypto 2025 presales. The team has promised that upon reaching $20 million, the first CEX listing partner will be unveiled. This move is set to boost liquidity, expand global access, and propel additional users toward the RTX token. In addition to the exchange listing, the live 40% token bonus will expire when the milestone of $20 million is achieved. This has pressured early investors to turn to crypto with real utility. There’s an ongoing Remittix Giveaway worth $250,000 to boot, further fueling the community. Why Remittix Is Gaining Momentum: Worldwide Reach: Instant bank-to-crypto transfers in 30+ nations Real-World Utility: Easy payments in mind, not speculation Beta Wallet: Launching Q3 with live FX conversion Strong Presale: $19.6 million + sold at $0.0944 per token Overcoming Real-World Payment Roadblocks Remittix aims to make international transactions as simple as sending an email. It integrates blockchain payments with existing banking infrastructure, reducing transaction times from days to minutes. This appeals to freelancers, remitters, and businesses seeking a low cap crypto gem with an existing product roadmap. In contrast to the majority of crypto presales that are already live, Remittix is pre-verified through a CertiK audit, thus being worthy of respect from investors looking for the best DeFi projects 2025. The upcoming CEX list and wallet release are additional boosts as the project moves closer towards mainnet adoption.

Wiki Cat (WKC) recently broke out and became like a textbook example of how sentiments can shift overnight. A similar setup is now emerging with KIKICat, trading under the KIKI ticker, as excitement from major ecosystems like Ethereum spills over into smaller projects. Wiki Cat’s Breakout Recap Wiki Cat recently staged a dramatic breakout after a surge that saw its price rise by more than 100%, to $0.000000076. This price rally was driven by Coinpedia listing the meme coin on August 12th. The meteoric rise has continued, with the coin rising by more than 70% in the last 24hrs to reach $0.000000103. This price movement is accompanied by a 378% surge in Wiki Cat’s trading volume, which hit $1.78M, marking a staggering 378% surge. Wiki Cat is a meme coin built on the BNB chain, and it is piggybacking on Ethereum’s recent price movement —whose ripple effect is causing altcoins to shine. Technical indications also show sheer growth with no signs of the rise stopping anytime soon. This is evident in the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $0.000000023 and the 200-day SMA at $0.000000016 that are trending upward, signalling some bullish momentum. Reflection in KiKi’s Moves KIKICat, trading under the Kiki Ticker, is a meme coin on Solana that incorporates Ai and global meme IP. Kiki has started to mimic Wiki Cat’s breakout dynamics. With over 106% price jump in the last 24hrs and 129% over the past week, KIKICat is signaling explosive renewed interest. This price rally can be attributed to two factors at least: Community takeover Ethereum price movement Strong technical signal Community Takeover The Kiki community is 93% bullish on CoinGecko, and 98% on CoinMarketcap. Here are some comments from the community: “KIKI$KIKI is doing good right now if we reclaim 20M market cap Exchanges will list this token everywhere the good part is where still at the dip so buy more” —ifreghwt4fjc (on Coin Marketcap) “ Why panic when you’re already in $KIKI? OGs don’t chase candles. We float above the noise eyes on ATH #KikiToTheMoon #CryptoCalm #SolanaVibes” —ShyMojow (on Binance) In crypto, community is everything, and the KIKICat community is currently generating enough buzz that doesn’t just signal heightened interest, but one that is laying the groundwork for a possible unprecedented run. KIKICat Community sentiment on CoinMarketcap Ethereum price movement Ethereum (ETH) is the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. It has been on the rise recently for a number of reasons, including the accumulation of the cryptocurrency by institutions in recent times, favourable regulatory developments, technical upgrades, and macro tailwinds and ETF performances. When crypto OGs like Ethereum rallies, it often signals overall market confidence, which makes investors more willing to explore and invest in other altcoins and meme coins like Kiki. When the US Securities and Exchange Commission acts, the ripple effects are felt over markets, including the crypto market. SEC’s recent favorable stance on Ethereum, plus the recent moment has driven capital into high volatility tokens. This helps fuel the frenetic trading behavior in some meme coins —including large swings as we’re seeing in Kiki Strong Technical Signal The Kiki Ticker chart is tightening into a symmetrical triangle, a pattern often preceding sharp breakouts. A recent MACD crossover adds to the bullish case, hinting at rising momentum. KIKI/USD Chart Analysis Source: GeckoTermina This echoes Wiki Cat’s earlier golden cross signal that fueled its breakout—both show how clear technical cues can flip sentiment and attract fresh buying. Tying it all Together We’re seeing pattern replication when we place, side-by-side, WikiCat’s meteoric rise and the current KIKICat moves. This isn’t simply a case of two meme coins catching random hype—the similarities run far deeper and they point to repeatable market behaviors. This replication doesn’t just hinge on both being meme coins. The community takeover, the impact of Ethereum’s continued rise, and technical setup triggering sentiment waves. These factors were key in Wiki Cat’s runs and we’re also seeing a repetition in KIKICat. Without doubt, the Kiki Ticker should be on your list of buys if you missed the Wiki Cat run.

Brandt stated that he sees a 30% probability that Bitcoin has reached its peak in this cycle, saying, “The next stop could be the $60,000-$70,000 range until November 2026. Then, I expect a new bull move up to $500,000.” Referring to past cycles, Brandt stated that the 2015-2017 and 2018-2021 bull markets lasted 75 weeks, and that the 2022-2025 cycle could also last 75 weeks (+/- 2 weeks). Based on this calculation, he predicted the peak could occur between September 15 and 28, 2025. Related News: Analytics Firm: “The Market Moves Contrary to Expectations, Which Is Why Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices...” Brandt said that if the cycle repeats, the peak price range could be in the $125,000-$145,000 range. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $117,000. The world's largest cryptocurrency has fallen 1.2% in the last 24 hours.

Analyst Says Huge Rally Looms,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-retesting-the-breakout-from-lows-analyst-says-huge-rally-looms/,"XRP has been trading within a narrowing symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart, with price action compressing between a rising trendline from late June and a descending resistance line from the July peak. After rallying sharply from the June lows to an all-time high of $3.65 in mid-July, XRP entered a consolidation phase. CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020), a prominent crypto analyst, drew attention to this formation in a post on X. The pattern has been marked by lower highs and higher lows, indicating equilibrium between buyers and sellers ahead of a potential breakout. The latest move saw the token pull back to around $3.08, a decline of nearly 6% on the day. This drop brought XRP directly to a key confluence zone where the ascending trendline meets former horizontal resistance near the $3.1 level. According to CryptoBull, the market is now “retesting the breakout from the lows while turning former resistance into support,” which suggests this zone could be pivotal for the next directional move. #XRP retesting the breakout from the lows while turning former resistance into support. HIGHER! pic.twitter.com/jzdjm8Qmn3 — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) August 14, 2025 Technical Context and Market Positioning The symmetrical triangle on the chart typically represents a period of consolidation before a continuation or reversal. In XRP’s case, the structure has formed after a pronounced upside move, which in classical technical analysis often gives a bullish bias to the eventual breakout. However, a break below the rising trendline would weaken that case and open the door to deeper retracement levels. The 200-day moving average remains well below current price levels, reinforcing the magnitude of XRP’s recent gains and the strength of the prevailing trend . Trading volume has contracted during the consolidation, a common feature of symmetrical triangles, but spikes in activity are likely once the price breaks decisively in either direction. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Reclaiming the $3.5 area and gaining momentum could put previous highs back in focus. However, failure to hold the current support could shift attention toward the $2.7 to $2.8 zone, where prior accumulation occurred. Outlook Ahead of Pattern Resolution With the apex of the triangle approaching, XRP is nearing its breakout point. While CryptoBull did not specify how high the asset can climb, another analyst recently highlighted a multi-year symmetrical triangle that could send the asset to $12.6 . The retest of support shows the importance of this level for maintaining the bullish structure. If buyers defend it successfully, the technical setup remains constructive for another attempt at higher resistance.

Hyperliquid is a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) . It has its own Layer 1 blockchain, and HYPE is its native token, which is used for staking, governance, and payments within the ecosystem. One of the key features of Hyperliquid, along with its high-speed platform, is that it offers crypto perpetual futures for trading by its users without the need to own the asset. The platform supports a number of cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to BTC, ETH, SUI, AVAX, and SOL, to name a few. Technically, the Hyperliquid blockchain is based on two protocols, namely HyperEVM and HyperBFT; combined, they help provide high-speed trading and Ethereum-based smart contracts with reliability. The Hyperliquid platform revolves around community participation, as token holders have voting rights to govern and influence developments taking place on the platform. On November 29, 2024, Hyperliquid conducted an airdrop of its native token, HYPE, but unlike other players, it was selective in allocating the airdrop to only 94,000 users with an average value of $45,000 to $50,000, making it one of the most worthy airdrops in crypto history.

The current price action does not justify predicting a $50 target.

The highest price HYPE could attain that year is expected to be above $108.96. Will Hyperliquid reach $500?

The highest expected price for Hyperliquid is $303.53, which it will achieve in 2031. Does Hyperliquid have a good long-term future?

Hyperliquid Historic Price Sentiment Hyperliquid price history: Coingecko The native token of Hyperliquid, called HYPE, was launched on November 29, 2024, through an airdrop targeted at a limited number of only 94,000 users. This was one of the most lucrative airdrops, with an average allocation of value of $45,000 to $50,000. Hyperliquid kept away from venture capitalists, who usually get most of the tokens in usual airdrops; rather, 76% of the supply was slated for user-centric initiatives. Usually, tokens dump after airdrops until the market momentum picks up, but Hyperliquid’s approach helped garner trust, and the token jumped from $4 to $35 from November 2024 to December 22, 2024. Hyperliquid’s market cap improved significantly during this period, reaching above $8 billion, as it received super positive market sentiment. In late December and early January 2025, the HYPE token corrected down to $20.24, shedding significant value as per crypto market data. Price stabilized through February as it traded in a range of $19.92 to $27.42 before taking a dive at the end of February. HYPE stumbled to $12.34 by mid-March, and it touched a low of $10.21 on April 7, 2025. The token saw nothing but improvement in the remainder of the month of April, and its price surged to $18.57 by the end of the month. On June 16, 2025, HYPE reached an all-time high of $45.57. A month later, on July 14, it marked another all-time high of $49.75, and at the start of August, it is trading near the $38 range.",Crypto Price Predictions|HYPE|Hyperliquid,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|AIRDROP|ETH|ALTCOIN|USDC|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-16 07:45:00

Bulls remain in control, and the market is increasingly focused on whether ETH can break through resistance and confirm a new phase of the uptrend. Adding to the momentum, Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Inc., a blockchain technology company primarily based in the United States, announced that it has just purchased $129.9 million worth of ETH following a brief day of inactivity. This strategic acquisition highlights the growing trend of institutional players allocating directly into Ethereum, reinforcing confidence in its long-term value. Bitmine’s move mirrors similar treasury strategies adopted by firms such as Sharplink Gaming, signaling a wider corporate shift toward ETH accumulation. The timing is notable, as exchange balances continue to shrink and demand intensifies, placing supply-side pressure on the market. For investors, the convergence of institutional buying and strong technical positioning suggests Ethereum may be gearing up for a decisive breakout. However, with volatility still high, market participants are closely watching whether ETH can sustain momentum above key levels and solidify its leadership role in the broader altcoin rally. Ethereum Accumulation Grows As Bitmine Expands Holdings With this latest acquisition, Bitmine’s total holdings now stand at 1.174 million ETH, valued at approximately $5.26 billion. This ongoing accumulation trend comes at a critical juncture for Ethereum, as the asset tests major resistance levels near its all-time highs. The timing of Bitmine’s purchase highlights a growing conviction among institutional players that Ethereum will continue to outperform in the current cycle. Exchange reserves and OTC desk supply have been steadily shrinking, signaling strong demand while available liquidity dries up. This tightening supply dynamic often serves as fuel for sharp upward price movements, particularly when paired with significant institutional inflows like those from Bitmine. Meanwhile, Bitcoin remains under pressure just below its all-time high, struggling to confirm a breakout. This contrast is shaping a new phase in the crypto market, where Ethereum’s relative strength is becoming increasingly evident. If ETH successfully pushes through resistance, it could lead the next leg of the altcoin rally, with liquidity flowing toward stronger assets in the sector. Price Holds Key Support After Strong Rally Ethereum’s price action shows resilience despite the recent pullback from highs near $4,800. On the 4-hour chart, ETH is currently trading around $4,422, holding above the 50-period moving average at $4,347. This level is acting as short-term dynamic support, suggesting that buyers remain active even after profit-taking at the top. The rally over the past weeks has been marked by higher highs and higher lows, confirming strong bullish structure. Volume spikes during upward moves highlight continued demand, while the most recent correction has seen relatively lower selling volume, an encouraging sign for bulls. The 100- and 200-period moving averages at $3,988 and $3,780, respectively, remain far below the current price, reinforcing the broader uptrend. If ETH maintains support above $4,350, a rebound toward $4,600–$4,800 is likely, with a potential breakout attempt at all-time highs. However, a breakdown below the 50-period moving average could trigger a deeper correction, with $4,000 as the next major support zone. With bullish fundamentals, reduced supply, and growing institutional interest, the market appears poised for a decisive move.

Despite briefly pushing past $120,000, BTC failed to sustain levels above its record, and the breakout above ATH remains unconfirmed. This lack of follow-through has fueled bearish speculation, with some analysts warning that the market could be facing increased downside risk in the short term. Related Reading: Memecoins Lose Ground In Market Share As Ethereum Absorbs Liquidity At the same time, on-chain data paints a more constructive picture for long-term stability. According to the latest insights, the Long-Term Holder (LTH) cohort—those holding Bitcoin between six months and two years—has significantly increased its supply. Since April, when BTC was trading at $83,000, their holdings have grown from 3.551 million BTC to 5.191 million BTC, a remarkable increase of 1.64 million BTC. This accumulation suggests strong conviction among seasoned investors, even as short-term volatility challenges the market. While traders focus on whether Bitcoin can reclaim $120,000 and establish a firm breakout, the ongoing buildup by long-term holders reinforces the broader bullish structure. The clash between short-term weakness and long-term strength will likely define Bitcoin’s next major move. Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Signal Strength According to top analyst Axel Adler, Bitcoin’s latest test of the all-time high at $118,000 showed a very different behavior compared to past cycles. During this move, long-term holders (LTHs) who have been holding coins between six months and two years engaged in some profit-taking. Data reveals their seven-day average spending climbed to 20,000 BTC. However, this level is far below the typical distribution spikes of previous cycles, where spending often surged to between 40,000 and 70,000 BTC. This more moderate selling activity suggests that the conviction among long-term holders remains strong. Rather than aggressively taking profits, many are choosing to continue accumulating or simply holding their positions. Adler highlights that accumulation still outweighs distribution, reflecting confidence in the market’s future direction. Such behavior from experienced participants typically signals a healthier, more sustainable bull phase, where selling pressure is absorbed without disrupting the broader uptrend. Despite this encouraging backdrop, Bitcoin faces a crucial technical test. To confirm the strength of the latest move, BTC needs to decisively push above the $125,000 level. A breakout beyond this resistance would likely validate the resilience shown by long-term holders and open the path toward further price discovery. If bulls succeed, the combination of institutional demand, long-term accumulation, and reduced selling pressure could drive the next major rally. Conversely, failure to reclaim $125,000 in the near term might give bears room to test lower levels before the next leg up.

Following this failed breakout attempt, BTC has slipped back toward $117,300, where it is currently holding above the key confluence of the 100 and 200 moving averages. This zone between $116,900 and $117,600 is acting as immediate support. A decisive breakdown here could expose further downside toward $115,000. However, the moving averages continue to slope upward, reflecting an underlying bullish structure despite the short-term weakness. Related Reading: TRON Long-Term Holders See Massive Gains As TRX Pushes Toward Multi-Year Highs The repeated rejection at $123,000–$124,000 highlights the importance of this resistance. Bulls will need to reclaim this zone with conviction to confirm momentum and extend the uptrend toward higher levels. Until then, the market remains in a consolidation phase, with traders closely watching if support at the $117K region holds.

Tokenization of real-world assets like treasuries and commodities is growing, with BioSig aiming to make its mark in the tokenized gold space. BioSig has a history of chasing trends after failing to achieve product-market fit in medical devices and rebranding multiple subsidiaries. The company's latest move follows a merger with StreamEx Exchange, signaling another strategic shift as it seeks new growth avenues. Though usage is growing, demand for blockchain-based gold is less clear. Token supply of the two leading gold-backed cryptos has yet to meaningfully move above 2022 highs. As the market continues to reward crypto IPOs and floundering small-cap companies pivoting to 'Treasury Strategy' businesses, BioSig Technologies ( BSGM ) is entering the blockchain realm with an entirely different approach. Rather than linking its future to more volatile Digital Assets like Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), or Solana ( SOL-USD ), BioSig will be focusing first on real-world-asset, or RWA, tokenization. Tokenization is a concept that I've covered through my Seeking Alpha work at least as far back as 2023. While tokenized equities have yet to become a focal point for the market, tokenized dollars through stablecoins have seen booming issuance with 30% year-to-date supply growth to $264 billion. Quietly, real-world assets like treasuries, private credit, and commodities have been tokenized as well; the latter is where BioSig Technologies is attempting to make an impact. BioSig Technologies - A Brief History Prior to the May merger with StreamEx Exchange - which we'll get into in a moment - BioSig was a medical device company with virtually nonexistent revenue after ten years in the market. White Diamond Research absolutely crushed a 'strong sell' call back in 2019, and the company has failed to find product/market fit ever since. Since the apparent failure of BioSig's PURE EP platform, my view is the company has a bit of a history of chasing trends. A majority-held subsidiary created in 2018 was rebranded from 'NeuroClear Technologies' to 'ViralClear Pharmaceuticals' in March 2020 and pursued anti-viral treatments for COVID-19. Later in 2020, the company formed a second majority-held subsidiary business called 'NeuroClear Technologies' that it again rebranded in 2023, this time to 'BioSig AI' with the stated goal of building AI-based health diagnoses and therapies. Neither of these entities has borne meaningful fruit. Data by YCharts As of the quarter ended March, the company had $4.4 million in total assets - 84% of which was cash/equivalents - $1.7 million in total liabilities, and a book value of just 11 cents per share. In the company's Q1-25 10-Q, it stated it was still exploring opportunities for each of its subsidiaries and acknowledged that financing was required to fund additional operations. This brings us to the latest venture. StreamEx Merger and Capital Raises Through an all-stock transaction, BioSig Technologies merged with privately held StreamEx Exchange Corporation in May with the goal of building a RWA business based on tokenized Gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ). Henry McPhie, co-founder and CEO of StreamEx, is the CEO of the post-merger business and has a seat on the board. BioSig CEO Anthony Amato will have a seat on the board. And StreamEx co-founder Morgan Lekstrom will also join the board as Chairman. StreamEx holders will ultimately own 75% of the post-merger company after preferred shares are converted, leaving original BSGM holders with the remaining 25% of the company. Subsequent to the merger , BioSig sold $100 million in convertible senior debentures to YA II PN, LTD. In early July, it announced a $1 billion equity line of credit over 36 months. The debentures yield 4% and have a 24-month maturity date and a 180-day lockup period. Data by YCharts On August 14th, BioSig announced an offering of 3,852,149 shares for proceeds of $13.6 million. The offering priced the shares at $3.90 per - a 15% discount to the closing price following the August 13th session. Regardless, the market seems somewhat apathetic to both the dilution and the discount, with shares currently above $5 as of article submission. Following the raise, there will be 35,270,944 shares outstanding, and the proceeds will be used to purchase Gold bullion for the tokenized Gold business. StreamEx Business Model Unlike stablecoin issuers, which derive interest income from the treasuries backing tokenized dollars, the RWA model appears to be entirely reliant on platform access and fees. According to the prospectus, StreamEx has three different revenue streams: RWA Tokenization - fees generated from tokenizing Gold deliveries, royalties, and real estate Exchange Infrastructure - token listing, transaction, and trading fees Private placement/capital market access - underwriting, placement agent, and subscription service fees Through the first three months of the year, these efforts have generated just $200k in revenue from platform access and consulting. The company's initial growth strategy is aimed at Gold mining deliveries, where StreamEx would give Gold producers upfront funding with those delivery rights being tokenized and issued to investors on the blockchain. Given Morgan Lekstrom's board position with Nexgold Mining ( NXGCF ), this might actually be feasible. However, it's still very early. Preliminary Q2 Results (BioSig) The company's preliminary results for Q2 show a rather substantial $23.2 million loss. And while I'm certainly bullish Gold and it's place in future cross-border settlement given all of the central bank buying over these last 3 years, tokenized Gold is not one of the areas that has seen a surge in token issuance even with RWA growth in 2025. The State of The Tokenized Gold Market Tokenized Gold (RWA.xyz) There are no less than 7 different tokenized Gold products already in the market, which together make up about $1.8 billion in AUM. Though with respect to market supply and usage, it's effectively a two-token market. Those tokens are Tether Gold ( XAUT-USD ) and PAX Gold ( PAXG-USD ). I've covered the key details for both in a prior article that I think is worth reading . Usage of these tokens has indeed grown in recent years. However, issuance growth has not been as robust as what has been observed in other real-world asset markets like private credit and Treasury debt: XAUT & PAXG Supply (CoinMetrics) PAXG supply is actually still below its 2022 high, and XAUT only recently took out its 2022 supply high after a massive 129k coin issuance on August 8th. From what I gather, issuance will likely be the bigger immediate driver of revenue for StreamEx, and we're not currently seeing sustained supply growth for such a product. Though I'll freely admit that could certainly come to fruition. What I don't think can be questioned is the appetite for exposure to such instruments by the end user: 30 day average transferred Value (CoinMetrics) The combined USD-denominated transferred value of the two tokens made an all-time high in July, and non-zero coin address growth appears to be quite strong: Non-Zero Wallet Addresses (CoinMetrics) Year to date, the combined addresses holding either XAUT or PAXG have grown by over 53% from 38.3k to 58.8k. My read on this is that it's likely indicative of traders on Ethereum simply getting exposure to Gold rather than institutional investors monetizing bullion holdings in the RWA market. But I could admittedly be wrong about that assumption. Closing Thoughts I think the risks in longing BSGM are sort of obvious. With a $1 billion equity line of credit and the company selling shares at a sizable discount to the market price, there is rather significant dilution risk in BioSig/ StreamEx given its $160 million market cap. However, the shares do offer a somewhat unique vector for tokenization exposure. While it will be using Gold for its fee-based business lines, the equity itself isn't necessarily directly exposed to swings in Gold's price. In this way, longing BSGM would be much different from longing XAUT or PAXG - each of which serves as more pure play proxies for Gold itself. Rather, with BSGM, shareholders would be betting on a new market participant competing with the private issuers of those two tokens. BSGM might be more akin to a company like Circle ( CRCL ). There is perhaps a case to be made for such an entity given the FINRA/SEC regulatory compliance angle , but I think it might be a little bit too early to jump into this idea personally. I'll initiate coverage of BSGM with a 'hold' and keep it on my radar for future coverage and potential investment.",BSGM|XAUUSD:CUR,EN,0,0,FIAT|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-16 08:04:00

As Ethereum nears the $5,000 mark, it's not just the seasoned investors who are paying attention but also newcomers enticed by the blockchain's robust capabilities and the burgeoning sector of altcoins, including Unilabs Finance and Arbitrum. Unilabs Finance: Innovating DeFi Asset Management Amidst the thriving market, Unilabs Finance , a pioneering AI-based DeFi asset manager, is setting new benchmarks in the industry. With a notable $32 million assets under management, Unilabs is not just another player in the DeFi space but a trailblazer aiming to revolutionize investment strategies through its AI-driven platform.

Find out more about them. The crypto market is heating up, and the ETH price is leading the charge with an impressive climb toward new highs. Riding the wave of institutional adoption, Ethereum’s momentum is attracting serious attention, not just from traders, but from big banks too. Meanwhile, Arbitrum’s technical setup hints at a potential breakout, and Unilabs Finance is making waves as an AI-powered DeFi asset manager poised to disrupt the market. Continue reading this article to find out more about these leading projects. Standard Chartered Lifts Ethereum Forecast to $7,500 by 2025 The ETH price is rising toward new all-time highs, with the coin presently trading around $4,700. This marks a gain of more than 50% in the last month alone, putting it among the top-performing cryptocurrencies. Standard Chartered Bank has taken note of this movement. Their analyst, Geoff Kendrick, just raised his ETH price forecast upward. The bank now expects that the ETH price will reach $7,500 by the end of 2025, up from its earlier estimate of $4,000. Even more optimistic is their long-term vision, which includes an ETH price estimate of $25,000 by 2028, more than doubling their earlier projection of $7,500. This higher adjustment comes as institutional investors pump record amounts of money into Ethereum. According to Standard Chartered data, Ethereum treasury firms and spot ETFs have acquired around 3.8% of all ETH in circulation since early June. This accumulation is 2x as fast as the fastest pace recorded during a comparable Bitcoin buying era, indicating a rising institutional preference for Ethereum, pushing the ETH price upwards. Arbitrum’s ARB Holds Steady After 23% Weekly Gains Arbitrum's recent decline has pushed it close to the support zone identified by experts earlier this week. According to CryptoPulse, the $0.51-$0.52 level was the breakout point during the previous rise, making it an important retest zone currently. According to the latest market data, the Arbitrum price has dropped to $0.5158, up 1.9% on the day, following 23% gains in the previous week. This zone is more than simply a technical number. It shows a battle line between bulls seeking continuation and sellers trying to control. The next few sessions will indicate whether Arbitrum buyers are strong enough to protect it. A hold here would legitimize the breakthrough and open the path to $0.90 in the short term. Bitcoinsensus also reported a confirmed double-bottom breakthrough on Arbitrum’s daily chart. If this pattern continues, it will strengthen the bullish case for higher targets. The initial stop would be $0.7747, but stronger momentum might push Arbitrum to $1.23 and $1.70. Unilabs Finance Raises $32M in AUM: Here’s What's Fueling It!

Recently, U.S. President Donald Trump weighed in, suggesting that a Trump peace deal achieved swiftly is superior to a protracted ceasefire. This perspective, as reported by Walter Bloomberg on X citing Axios, sparks crucial discussions about the dynamics of international conflict resolution and the pursuit of global stability. What’s Behind Trump’s “Fast Peace Deal” Stance? President Trump’s recent comments underscore a preference for decisive action in resolving international disputes. His assertion that a fast peace deal is preferable to a mere ceasefire highlights a focus on definitive outcomes rather than temporary pauses. This viewpoint suggests a belief that prolonged ceasefires might inadvertently prolong suffering or delay true reconciliation, impeding genuine international peace efforts . A fast peace deal aims for a comprehensive agreement. It seeks to address root causes of conflict, not just symptoms. This approach could potentially reduce long-term human and economic costs. Such a strategy, while ambitious, requires immense diplomatic effort and a willingness from all parties to compromise for a lasting resolution. Ceasefire vs. Comprehensive Peace: Understanding the Nuance Understanding the distinction between a ceasefire and a full peace deal is vital. A ceasefire is typically a temporary halt to hostilities, often implemented to allow for humanitarian aid, prisoner exchanges, or to create space for negotiations. While crucial for immediate relief, it doesn’t resolve underlying issues. Effective ceasefire negotiations are a stepping stone, but not the final destination. In contrast, a peace deal is a formal agreement designed to end a conflict permanently. It involves addressing political, territorial, and other core disputes. This is where Trump’s emphasis on a definitive Trump peace deal comes into play, advocating for the ultimate goal rather than an intermediate step. Moving beyond simple ceasefire negotiations towards a full resolution is key. Why Prioritize International Peace Efforts? The pursuit of peace is paramount for global stability and human well-being. Prolonged conflicts devastate communities, displace millions, and hinder economic development. Therefore, robust international peace efforts are not just idealistic but pragmatic necessities. They involve complex negotiations, mediation, and often, significant international pressure to achieve a lasting Trump peace deal . Achieving genuine peace demands: Active engagement from global leaders. Commitment to dialogue over confrontation. Consideration of all stakeholders’ long-term interests. These efforts are foundational to preventing future escalations and fostering an environment of cooperation, leading to more sustainable global stability. The Path to Diplomatic Solutions: Challenges and Opportunities Crafting effective diplomatic solutions for complex conflicts is rarely straightforward. There are numerous challenges, including deep-seated historical grievances, mistrust between parties, and external influences. However, every challenge presents an opportunity for innovative diplomacy and persistent negotiation. The goal is always to achieve a definitive resolution. The opportunity lies in: Building trust through sustained engagement. Identifying common ground and shared interests. Leveraging international consensus to encourage breakthroughs. A “fast” approach, as suggested by Trump, implies a focused, high-stakes effort to accelerate these often-slow processes, aiming to seize critical moments for a breakthrough Trump peace deal and broader diplomatic solutions . President Trump’s recent statement advocating for a fast peace deal over a protracted ceasefire highlights a significant perspective in international relations. It underscores the urgency of moving beyond temporary halts to hostilities towards comprehensive, lasting resolutions. While achieving such a deal swiftly presents immense challenges, the emphasis on definitive diplomatic solutions remains a critical goal for global stability. The pursuit of genuine international peace efforts , including careful ceasefire negotiations , continues to be a complex yet vital endeavor, shaping the future of nations and their peoples. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the core difference between a ceasefire and a peace deal? A1: A ceasefire is a temporary suspension of fighting, often to allow for humanitarian aid or initial talks. A peace deal, conversely, is a comprehensive, formal agreement designed to permanently end a conflict by addressing its root causes and establishing lasting terms. Q2: Why does Donald Trump advocate for a “fast peace deal”? A2: President Trump’s preference for a “fast peace deal” suggests a belief that swift, decisive action can prevent prolonged suffering and the potential for ceasefires to merely delay, rather than resolve, conflicts. He emphasizes definitive outcomes over temporary pauses. Q3: What are the main challenges in achieving a swift peace deal? A3: Achieving a swift peace deal is challenging due to deep-seated historical grievances, a lack of trust between warring parties, and complex geopolitical influences. It requires significant compromise, robust negotiation, and often, strong international mediation. Q4: How do international peace efforts contribute to global stability? A4: International peace efforts are crucial for global stability as they aim to resolve conflicts, prevent humanitarian crises, and foster cooperation among nations. By addressing disputes through diplomacy, these efforts reduce the risk of wider regional or global instability. Q5: Are “ceasefire negotiations” always a necessary step towards peace? A5: While not always the sole path, ceasefire negotiations often serve as a vital initial step. They can create a window for dialogue, build confidence, and allow humanitarian access, paving the way for more comprehensive diplomatic solutions and ultimately, a full peace deal.

Those who recognized their potential early and committed capital before mass adoption witnessed extraordinary wealth creation. Today, the same dynamic is building around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol now in its presale phase — and all indicators suggest it is positioning itself as the next big cryptocurrency to watch. With its real-world DeFi utility and ambitious growth roadmap, MUTM is already drawing comparisons to the breakout stories of ADA and MATIC’s early days, offering investors a genuine chance to secure the next big crypto before it captures the global spotlight. A lending model built for real returns Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being designed for both lenders and borrowers, offering two highly flexible models. In its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model, lenders deposit assets into liquidity pools, earning interest based on pool utilization rates. For example, depositing $25,000 worth of XRP at 71% loan-to-value (LTV) in the P2C model will generate a 17% APY — an impressive $4,250 per year — with assets stored securely in non-custodial smart contracts. Meanwhile, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model matches lenders and borrowers directly, allowing for negotiated rates and personalized terms. Imagine a borrower using $5,500 worth of FLOKI as collateral at 65% LTV to instantly access $3,575 in USDD without selling their memecoin holdings. Right now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in its Phase 6 presale, with each token priced at $0.035. Over $14.39 million has already been raised, with more than 15,300 holders on board before the official launch. At this stage, investors are positioning themselves for the listing price of $0.06, where early-phase entries could already reflect substantial gains on paper. From early backers to millionaires in waiting The wealth-building potential for early investors in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) becomes clear when looking at its phased presale growth. A Phase 1 participant who invested $50,000 when tokens were $0.01 would now hold $175,000 in value at today’s $0.035 presale price. With the upcoming $0.06 listing, that same holding will reach $300,000, and as the platform’s adoption accelerates post-launch, price targets of $1+ within 18 months are firmly on the radar. These projections are fueled by the beta launch, allowing early user onboarding, anticipated listings on major exchanges like Binance and KuCoin, and a buy-and-distribute mechanism that consistently creates market demand by using platform revenue to purchase MUTM from the open market for rewards distribution to mtToken stakers. Security is also a central pillar for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The platform has passed a CertiK audit, earning a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78. On top of that, a $50,000 bug bounty program incentivizes community-driven vulnerability reporting, while a $100,000 giveaway will be awarded to ten winners, further boosting early engagement and investor enthusiasm. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s stablecoin innovation adds another compelling layer. Its $1-peg stablecoin will be minted only when users borrow against collateral such as ETH, ensuring all loans remain overcollateralized. The mint/burn cycle automatically manages supply, while governance-adjusted interest rates help maintain the peg. This design will allow MUTM to serve as a backbone for liquidity stability across the platform’s lending and borrowing activities. The next wave of DeFi wealth creation ADA and MATIC didn’t just rise on speculation; they became indispensable infrastructure in the crypto space. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is targeting that same trajectory with its blend of institutional-grade lending mechanics, governance-driven stablecoin, and revenue-backed staking rewards. Every presale phase completed increases investor entry costs, and with only a finite window before exchange listings, the opportunity to buy at presale pricing is shrinking rapidly. For those searching for which crypto to buy next or identifying the best cryptocurrency coin to buy in 2025, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out not just as the cheapest cryptocurrency at its current stage, but as a project engineered for sustainable growth. As its adoption curve takes shape, matching the explosive patterns seen in ADA and MATIC’s historical runs, the next crop of crypto millionaires will likely count MUTM among their biggest wins. The momentum is building, the roadmap is clear, and the breakout is drawing closer with every phase.

While many are tracking crypto prices today and debating why crypto is down after last month’s volatility, dip-buyers are already moving past the noise. They are scanning the altcoin space for assets with active catalysts, low entry prices, and a clear utility-driven growth path. That is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is setting itself apart. What makes MUTM different is its built-in buy-and-distribute model. Every lending, borrowing, and transaction fee on the platform will be used, in part, to repurchase MUTM tokens from the open market, with those tokens distributed to mtToken stakers. This creates continuous buy pressure — an element most Layer-1 and Layer-2 competitors cannot match. While traders are asking why crypto is crashing in some sectors, MUTM’s model will be engineered to turn platform growth into consistent demand for its native asset. BTC consolidates Bitcoin (BTC) consolidated with a 6.1% weekly gain, stabilizing at ~$121,595 as of August 14, 2025, supported by strong ETF inflows, per CoinMarketCap data. Spot ETFs saw $1.175 billion in daily inflows on August 13, led by BlackRock’s IBIT ($310M), with total assets hitting $55 billion, per SoSoValue. Trading volume surged 25% to $72.46 billion, reflecting robust institutional demand. Technical indicators show BTC holding above $120,000 support, with RSI at 66 and resistance at $126,100, per TradingView. On-chain data from Glassnode indicates whale accumulation of 19,800 BTC ($2.4B) and a three-year low in exchange reserves, signaling a supply crunch. Posts on X highlight optimism around pro-crypto legislation like the GENIUS Act. However, macro pressures, including US tariffs and $228 million in liquidations, pose risks. A breakout above $126,100 could target $132,000, while a drop below $116,000 risks $112,000. Layer-2 speed meets DeFi lending power Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be launched as a decentralized, non-custodial protocol combining the speed and cost efficiency of a Layer-2 network with deep DeFi utility. Lenders will supply assets into liquidity pools to earn interest, while borrowers will access overcollateralized loans without losing exposure to their original holdings. Unlike traditional matching systems, MUTM will operate on a pooled-liquidity model where interest rates automatically adjust to pool utilization — a structure that keeps funds moving and yield opportunities active. Layer-2 transaction efficiency will mean lower costs and faster settlements for both peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. In P2C, a user depositing $15,000 USDT will receive mtUSDT 1:1 and earn 15% APY, growing their position without active trading. In P2P, a borrower offering $1,000 in DOGE as collateral will be able to access up to 75% LTV while keeping upside exposure to DOGE’s price movement. Adding another growth lever, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s upcoming decentralized stablecoin will always target a $1 value. It will only be minted against approved collateral, and its borrowing interest rate will be governed to keep the peg stable. If it drifts above $1, rates will be lowered; if it falls below, rates will be increased — with arbitrage opportunities naturally balancing the price. Overcollateralization and automatic liquidation will keep the system secure. Presale momentum meets beta-launch advantage In a market where crypto is a good investment is being asked daily, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is answering with transparent data and a clear growth runway. The project is currently in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035 per token, having already generated over $14.43 million in commitments from more than 15,300 holders. With 170 million tokens allocated for this phase and 15% already sold, the 17% mark will trigger an automatic 15% price increase. Investors are not ignoring the math. Allocating $750,000 today will secure 21.42 million MUTM tokens. At $1 — a target aligned with crypto predictions for high-utility, exchange-listed tokens within a strong first year — that position will translate into $21.42 million in value, before even factoring in staking yields from mtToken holdings in the future. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s beta launch will arrive when the full exchange trading begins. This will allow early adopters to test the platform’s lending, borrowing, and stablecoin functions in a live environment. Such real-use exposure will create an early community of active participants — the kind of organic traction that pushes an asset into watchlists before liquidity floods in from major exchange listings. The roadmap ahead will move in four phases: Introduction: presale, marketing, audits, listings on trackers, and compliance groundwork. Building: development of the DApp’s front-end and back-end, smart contract finalization, and analytics integration. Finalizing: beta testnet demo, bug reporting, final security audits, and exchange listing preparations. Delivering: full live launch, listings on top-tier exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, and Coinbase, multi-chain expansion, and institutional partnerships. By the time these steps are executed, early investors will already be positioned to benefit from both presale appreciation and platform-driven demand. The broader market often gets stuck debating why crypto is down or why crypto is crashing, but those conversations overlook assets with measurable progress and upcoming liquidity events. For dip-buyers, this is not just bargain hunting — it is a calculated pre-positioning for a rapid climb once Bitcoin (BTC)’s consolidation breaks and altcoin momentum returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) blends low-cost entry, utility depth, and a self-reinforcing tokenomics model that transforms platform growth into long-term holder rewards. As Bitcoin (BTC) steadies, those who focus on high-upside projects with built-in demand engines will be the ones setting the pace for the next rally — and MUTM is already earning that attention.

Analysts Favor Toncoin for Bigger ROI",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-500-in-xrp-turn-into-2000-by-etf-approval-analysts-favor-toncoin-for-bigger-roi/,"The crypto market heats up as XRP nears a possible ETF approval in the United States. Ripple has won the lawsuit against the SEC. This has led investors to speculate on the potential implications of the SEC approving a spot ETF for the token. According to several analysts, an investment of $500 in XRP could become $2,000 by the end of 2025. While some investors are seeing greater ROI potential with public coins like Toncoin and MAGACOIN FINANCE in this cycle. XRP: 4x Gains If Approval Comes Through Currently, the trading price of XRP is around $3.12–$3.20 (0.0068 BTC) which is slightly below the post-ruling peak but still showing bullishness. Investors expect most likely approval of an ETF by the year-end at a 79% to 81% probability. Countries such as Brazil and Canada already have a global XRP ETF in place and given the SEC’s interest in creating a standard ETF, many believe that the U.S. will be next. Analysts say that once approved, the price can jump between $3.80 and $5.50, meaning your $500 can turn into $2,000 or more. Toncoin: Gaining Institutional Favor While speculation regarding XRP ETFs is bunching up a dominating role raising, Toncoin has been steadily making good moves behind the scene. TON was built on Telegram’s infrastructure. So, it has launched many of its users. Following recent significant funding investments and integrations into Telegram’s native wallet, institutional interest is increasing. Many believe that Toncoin’s price in $7–$8 range is undervalued considering the global adoption potential for this cryptocurrency. MAGACOIN FINANCE: High-Growth Altcoin With Asymmetric Potential Market forecasts project 40x ROI before late-cycle expansion , with MAGACOIN FINANCE gaining traction among whales, institutional investors, and early-stage market participants. Its capped supply, rising liquidity inflows, and growing cross-chain interest are fueling bullish sentiment ahead of anticipated exchange listings. As momentum builds and capital rotation accelerates, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a prime candidate for significant gains before the market reaches its next major peak. Conclusion: Beyond the XRP ETF Hype If the ETF approval comes through, then XRP is poised for a breakout. However, there are some investors who are diversifying by moving away from XRP. Toncoin is backed by real adoption and infrastructure, while MAGACOIN FINANCE offers an asymmetric upside supported by a marketing narrative. Investors anticipating a higher return are already getting ahead of the next rally.

According to the financial data site Moneyfacts, over 20 savings providers, including NatWest, Chase, and Santander, have lowered customer rates. On August 7, the BoE reduced the base interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4%, a move that lenders have begun passing on to savers. Inflation threatens to erode the real value of consumer savings These cuts mean that some customers may see the real value of their savings decline. Inflation unexpectedly rose to an 18-month high of 3.6% in June, with the BoE now forecasting it could peak at 4% in September. “If inflation reaches 4% as predicted, many savers won’t actually be beating that on a variable rate,” said Rachel Springall of Moneyfacts. “It shows that real-term savings are at risk of being eroded.” Moneyfacts data shows that the last time average savings rates fell below CPI inflation was in October 2023. The data covers interest paid on easy access accounts, notice accounts, cash ISAs, lifetime ISAs, junior ISAs, and children’s savings accounts. Banks acted quickly to reduce rates , in contrast to the slower pace seen when raising them. In 2023, then-Chancellor Jeremy Hunt criticized banks for “taking too long” to pass on interest rate increases to savers. Despite the 0.25 percentage point fall in base rates, some banks cut rates for account holders by more than double. Between August 7 and August 12, Atom Bank lowered the Instant Saver Reward account rate from 4.51% to 3.93%, a 0.58 percentage point drop. OakNorth Bank reduced the rate on its 20-day notice account by 0.34 percentage points to 3.78%. Skipton cut its Cash ISA Saver and Children’s Trust Saver by 0.5% each. The UK’s largest banks were more conservative. Santander cut its Junior ISA by 0.10 percentage points to 2.7%, while NatWest reduced its cash ISA by 0.25% and its Help to Buy ISA by 0.20%. Savers urged to monitor accounts as more rate cuts loom While borrowers welcome last week’s rate cut , its impact will be slow to reach most. Only those on variable-rate mortgages tracking the base rate will see immediate benefits. The Bank of England now expects inflation to peak at 4% in September, according to its latest Monetary Policy Report. This is double the Bank’s target rate and slightly higher than the 3.8% projection it made in May. Despite inflation running above the desired level—which would typically rule out a rate cut—the economy has shown weak growth, and concerns are mounting over the labour market. Governor Andrew Bailey described the decision to lower interest rates as a “finely balanced” one. Springall advised savers to stay alert but warned that switching accounts now may not be effective. “Customers could move their account now, only to find that the new provider also cuts rates soon after. For those on variable-rate deals, the best approach is to monitor rates closely,” she said. The average two-year mortgage rate dropped to 4.99% and analysts called that a “benchmark” moment for homeowners, noting that lenders are “bidding more aggressively.” The BoE cut rates five times since last August, but there was little unanimity at the latest session of its Monetary Policy Committee, and it is unclear when further reductions might occur. A Moneyfacts spokesperson said that while mortgage rates are moving in response to the Bank’s cuts, they will be far from drastic. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Remittix (RTX) is emerging as a preferred alternative. With a CEX listing set to be revealed at the $20M mark, Remittix is positioning itself for a surge in adoption and transaction volume in the months ahead. Shiba Inu Price Updates Highlight Market Uncertainty Shiba Inu price updates show SHIB hovering near $0.00001275 after sliding 5.3% from Friday’s $0.000014 correction. Analysts note that a bullish wedge breakout could push SHIB toward $0.00001471, provided the token closes above $0.00001311. Market attention remains focused on the 536.11 trillion SHIB tokens held below $0.000019, which serve as critical resistance. source: TradingView Community discussions, fueled by marketing specialist insights, have even entertained ambitious price targets like $1, though these remain speculative. Traders are closely watching holder sentiment in this range, as it will likely determine whether SHIB can sustain upward momentum or continue consolidating near current levels. Dogecoin Updates Signal Active Whale Movement Dogecoin updates show DOGE trading around $0.2250 with heightened whale activity. On August 13, large transactions above $1 million exceeded 100, marking the most active day for major holders since mid-July. Whale Alert reported $200 million moved from Robinhood to unknown wallets, sparking speculation of buy-dip strategies. source: @ali_charts on X Technical indicators show fading bullish momentum, but if the bulls reclaim control, DOGE could challenge resistance at $0.256, with potential to surpass July highs of $0.28. On the downside, failing to hold $0.1874 could push DOGE below $0.15 for the first time since June. These fluctuations are prompting traders to explore alternatives with strong real-world utility, including Remittix. Why Remittix Is Drawing Attention While SHIB and DOGE face uncertain short-term paths, Remittix has captured investor interest with its practical use cases and adoption potential. The token leverages cross-border payment solutions, low fees, and multi-chain DeFi support to provide tangible utility . Key highlights include: It supports cross border crypto-bank transfers across 30+ countries It also enables live conversions using 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies Audited, secure infrastructure that grants transparency and trust 50% token bonus driving early participation Wallet beta launching in Q3 2025 with easy-to-use interface With over $19.7 million raised, 602 million tokens sold, and a first CEX listing set to be announced at $20M, Remittix is poised to become a dominant player for both retail and institutional investors. Market Rotation and Strategic Implications As Shiba Inu price updates and Dogecoin updates reflect consolidation, the market is seeing capital rotate into projects with real-world utility. Remittix’s practical approach, low gas fees, and upcoming exchange listings make it an attractive option for investors seeking both growth and stability.

50175573,https://invezz.com/?p=2840769,1755334953,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"ETH nears ATH, but analysts back next Ethereum following its path",https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/16/eth-nears-ath-but-analysts-back-next-ethereum-following-its-path/,"Ethereum (ETH) is surging with momentum that has analysts expecting it to smash through its all-time high soon. Yet, while ETH grabs headlines, top analysts are already looking ahead—searching for the next big crypto to follow a similar trajectory. One project consistently standing out in their lists is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi protocol building a lending and borrowing ecosystem with a strong presale performance and high-impact features. Lending and borrowing that stand out in the DeFi crowd Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is setting a new standard for decentralized finance with its two-pronged lending model. In the peer-to-contract (P2C) system, lenders deposit assets into a liquidity pool and earn attractive returns while borrowers can take overcollateralized loans. For example, a lender depositing $10,000 worth of DOT at a 69% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio with a 14% annual percentage yield generates $1,400 yearly income—without needing to sell their holdings. On the peer-to-peer (P2P) side, lenders and borrowers deal directly, negotiating terms without intermediaries. Here’s a real scenario: a borrower uses $4,800 in BONK as collateral at 70% LTV and unlocks $3,360 in USDC. This opens liquidity while keeping their original asset position intact, just like ETH holders did in the early DeFi days. These lending models don’t just give flexibility—they provide real, usable financial opportunities that will attract long-term users. This same mix of utility and investor engagement was a major driver in Ethereum (ETH)’s early adoption, and MUTM is positioned to capture that energy in the next wave of DeFi growth. Strong presale performance and millionaire-maker potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, with a token price of $0.035. Over $14.43 million has already been raised, with more than 15,300 holders onboard and 17% of the total supply sold. Out of the 4 billion total tokens, Phase 6 alone offers 170 million MUTM at this price before moving to higher phases. The returns for early believers have been remarkable. An investor who entered during Phase 1 with $15,000 now holds a position worth $52,500 at the current presale price. At the $0.06 listing price, this would grow to $105,000, and with the expected post-launch momentum from the beta platform and major exchange listings like Binance, KuCoin, and Coinbase, values are projected in the $0.90–$1.20 range in the coming 18 months. That $15,000 Phase 1 position would then surpass $450,000, putting holders into the category of the next wave of crypto millionaires. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also drawing trust through transparency and security. It has passed a rigorous CertiK audit with a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78, proving its commitment to safety. To further protect the ecosystem, the team has launched a $50,000 bug bounty program, offering severity-based rewards to white-hat hackers who identify vulnerabilities. Additionally, a $100,000 giveaway will reward 10 winners, a move designed to expand community engagement before launch. The project’s roadmap shows a clear path toward growth. Following its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch its live platform, execute listings on major exchanges, expand into multi-chain operations, and introduce advanced DeFi features—all elements that align perfectly with the strategies Ethereum (ETH) followed in its early growth phases. The next Ethereum (ETH) moment is here The reason ETH became a household name wasn’t just price—it was the real, scalable utility behind it. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is ticking those same boxes with a platform that gives users control, flexibility, and tangible earning power. The upcoming beta release will allow the community to experience the system firsthand, driving adoption before the token even hits the major exchanges. Mutuum’s combination of strong early investor rewards, transparent governance, security measures, and high-value lending tools positions it as more than just another altcoin. It’s being discussed in analyst circles as the next big cryptocurrency—the next crypto to explode in the market—and one of the best cryptocurrency coins to buy before it becomes mainstream. For investors asking which crypto to buy now to catch the next major wave, the answer is increasingly clear. At just $0.035 in Phase 6, MUTM stands out as one of the cheapest cryptocurrencies with the infrastructure, community, and momentum to follow Ethereum (ETH)’s path. As ETH races toward its all-time high, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly building the foundation to create the next group of millionaires—and the window to secure the best entry point is closing fast.

Meanwhile, Unilabs Finance presale is currently in stage 6, trading at $0.0097. The next phase will increase the token price by 11.34% to $0.0108, giving early investors a chance for significant gains. Unilabs Finance has attracted strong backing as Ethereum and other leading cryptocurrencies face volatility. While the ETH news shows market swings, interest in UNIL suggests investors are seeking safer, data-driven platforms with steady returns. Ethereum Price Faces Pullback as Market Pressure Rises The Ethereum price is trading around $4,600 after recent market pressure caused a nearly 3% drop in market cap. The recent ETH news shows investors are closely watching the Ethereum price. Source: CoinMarketCap Daily fluctuations and market trends are impacting short-term sentiment. Traders following the ETH news note that these movements could influence the Ethereum price in the coming sessions. SoSoValue recorded Ethereum Spot ETF net inflows of $729.14 million on the 13th and $639.61 million on the 14th. The decrease on the 14th suggests slightly lower buying pressure, which may be contributing to the recent drop in Ethereum. The latest PPI data came in higher than expected, adding pressure and weakening short-term sentiment around the Ethereum price. Rising PPI is usually a sign of higher inflation, which can make investors less willing to hold riskier assets like Ethereum. WatcherGuru also reported that $5.9 billion worth of BTC and ETH options are set to expire. This large volume could be contributing to pressure on the Ethereum price. Analysts following the ETH news suggest these funds could explain part of the current market pressure. With Ethereum still under pressure, the ETH news indicates investors are seeking more stable returns. PPI data has pushed some ETH investors toward Unilabs Finance. Its Stable Yields feature generates consistent returns through diversified mining operations. Following the ETH news, many traders see Unilabs as a data-driven alternative to manage exposure while keeping track of the Ethereum price. Unilabs Presale Progress and Key Advantages The Ethereum price remains volatile, and recent ETH news is highlighting the current market pressure. This has pushed many to seek out projects like Unilabs Finance. Currently in its 6th presale stage, it has raised over $13 million and sold more than 1.86 billion tokens at $0.0097 each. The next token price will rise to $0.0108, giving early investors a chance to benefit from the increase. Early participants can gain priority access before the public CoinMarketCap listing and secure a strong position in the market.

There are 831,056 ETH in the exit queue, with a wait time of 14 days and 10 hours. There are 1,085,264 active validators across the network, and approximately 35.6 million ETH have been staked. This amount corresponds to 29.46% of the total supply. Bitcoin maximalist Samson Mow commented on the matter, saying, “Flippening (ETH surpassing BTC's market cap) will never happen, but unstakening is coming.” According to Mow, as of yesterday, there were 768,400 ETH in the Ethereum validator exit queue. This figure equates to approximately $3.5 billion. The renowned investor also suggested that the ETH/BTC pair could fall to 0.03 or below. Related News: BitMEX Founder Arthur Hayes Adds Three Altcoins to His Bags Today Various theories are circulating in the market as to why validators are initiating mass unstaking. The cancellation of leveraged staking cycles is particularly noteworthy. It's being argued that investors who staked ETH to acquire liquid staking tokens (e.g., stETH) and then borrowed using it as collateral are reducing their positions due to rising funding and borrowing costs, which in turn is driving demand for exits. *This is not investment advice.

Yet the conversation is starting to shift toward a project that merges Layer-2 efficiency with a full-scale DeFi lending ecosystem — Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Instead of relying solely on speculation, this token will deliver real-world lending and borrowing, peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, and passive income through mtToken rewards. Unlike ETH and ADA, which are already priced high and require massive market moves to deliver double-digit multiples, MUTM is still in its presale phase, offering entry at just $0.035. The project’s structure will allow investors to combine cost-efficient transactions with on-chain financial services, all while benefiting from an economic model that rewards platform participation. Beta launch first, exchanges next Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will take a unique approach before hitting major exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, MEXC, or even Kraken — it will launch its beta version first. This strategy will let real users test the platform’s lending and borrowing mechanics, P2C and P2P functionality, and mtToken staking rewards. The exposure from beta testing will turn early testers into committed users, who will already be familiar with the platform’s earning potential when it lists. The roadmap for MUTM is straightforward and precise: Phase 1 will focus on presale and awareness; Phase 2 will complete the smart contract development and platform features; Phase 3 will launch the beta testnet and functional demo; Phase 4 will mark the live launch and exchange listings. This clarity in execution ensures that each step builds on the last, reducing uncertainty for those investing in crypto with a long-term vision. One of the standout features in this roadmap is MUTM’s stablecoin innovation. Unlike other algorithmic or collateralized coins that sometimes fail during volatile markets — leading traders to ask why is crypto crashing — MUTM’s stablecoin will be minted only when users borrow against collateral such as ETH and will be burned when loans are repaid or liquidated. Governance will adjust interest rates to keep its price close to $1, offering a safety-driven asset within the lending ecosystem. This structure will allow traders to access liquidity without losing exposure to their original holdings, avoiding panic sell-offs that often contribute to why crypto is down for moments. Presale data and the urgency to act Right now, MUTM is in Phase 6 of its presale with tokens priced at $0.035. Around $14.43 million has already been generated, with over 15,300 holders participating and 15% of the phase’s supply sold. Once 17% of this phase is sold, the price will automatically jump by 15% in Phase 7 — a built-in mechanism that adds urgency for those deciding crypto is a good investment at current levels. For serious investors, the math is compelling. A $500,000 allocation now secures more than 14.28 million tokens. At a future price of $0.35, that stake will be worth $5 million — and that’s without factoring in additional rewards from mtToken staking. With total supply capped at 4 billion, demand will intensify as adoption grows, especially with major exchange listings expected to broaden access worldwide. The buy-and-distribute mechanism will further strengthen demand. A portion of platform revenue from lending and borrowing will be used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market, distributing them to mtToken stakers. As more users interact with the protocol, more revenue will flow into buybacks, increasing buy pressure and rewarding those who stake. For traders accustomed to meme-driven volatility, this introduces a more sustainable growth driver — one grounded in actual platform utility. The Layer-2 cost efficiency will make high-volume transactions affordable, while the stablecoin system will provide liquidity stability that prevents forced selling during downturns. These elements give MUTM the potential to weather market dips better than speculative coins, shifting the conversation from crypto predictions based on hype to forecasts supported by a functional economic model.

Wiki Cat and Keyboard Cat have already seen massive upside moves. And now, KIKICat, listed on the KIKI Ticker, is looking like the next potential breakout. Even though it is not an Ethereum token, broad Ethereum market momentum and bullish sentiment are carrying over into meme-coin plays like KIKI, making it worth monitoring. Ethereum ATH Scenario Ethereum recently flirted with a new all-time high on the heels of institutional inflows, ETF momentum, and upbeat regulatory developments. The Ethereum rally has caused optimism across the entire crypto space, which has driven positioning in high-risk, high-reward trades. Meme coins with strong communities specifically benefit disproportionately from these sentiment waves. This macro tailwind and social buzz are positioning tokens such as KIKICat under the KIKI Ticker well to catch speculative interest. KIKI Ticker Analysis In the last week, KIKICat registered significant double-digit percentage advances, echoing the initial chart behavior in Wiki Cat prior to its taking off. KIKI’s price is compressing within a symmetrical triangle pattern, a setup that often precedes a decisive breakout. This is supported by a bullish MACD crossover, showing that momentum is shifting in the direction of buyers. The catalyst? A growing community takeover, with crypto traders on Telegram and X igniting coordinated campaigns to get everyone talking about the KIKI Ticker. KIKI/USD Chart Analysis Source: GeckoTermina While indirectly connected to Ethereum’s network, the coin is surging on the bullish spillover of Ethereum, which moved traders with fresh gains wanting to roll profits into meme-coin bets. What this Means Wiki Cat and Keyboard Cat “mooned” this week, with both pumping on a combination of technical setup and grassroots sentiment. The community takeover theme is the common thread. Price action can accelerate extremely fast when holders feel the ownership and actively promote a token. KIKICat is in the same situation now: good recent price action, clean technical setup, and growing online presence under the KIKI Ticker. Adding fuel to the fire, KIKICat trading volume has been rising steadily, which is a sign new capital is entering the market. Social chatter on X (formerly Twitter) and Telegram is also on the rise, mirroring the early stages of hype cycles seen in Wiki Cat and Keyboard Cat before they rallied. This sort of coordinated community and market action is usually a precursor for sharp moves. There is also the overall market lift caused by Ethereum’s strength, hinting on the same recipe that fueled Wiki Cat and Keyboard Cat being in place for KIKI’s breakout. If the current momentum holds and buyers continue to step in on dips, KIKICat could be the next in line to ride the “cat coin” wave that’s defining this week’s meme coin frenzy. Conclusion The cat-coin coup de grâce story is in full swing, and the KIKI Ticker is primed to be a strong favorite for the next big move.

Historically, large holders in meme coins have been early in spotting the next wave of ROI opportunities, and this latest shift is turning eyes toward utility-driven projects. In today’s risk-aware market, many traders are looking past pure meme hype and targeting DeFi crypto plays that offer both stability and yield. One standout in this conversation is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new crypto that blends lending innovation with income-focused staking — a setup designed to attract both risk-tolerant and income-seeking investors. Pepe (PEPE)’s wallet move On August 12, 2025, a whale wallet moved 2.21 trillion PEPE tokens (~$30 million) from Binance to a private address, per The Data Nerd on X. This follows a 1.79 trillion PEPE ($22.35M) withdrawal by wallet 0x6ea earlier that day, marking one of the largest single-day accumulations, per web:5. PEPE’s price, at ~$0.0000135, reflects a 14.5% weekly gain despite a broader meme coin dip, with $981.3M in 24-hour trading volume, per CoinGecko. Technical indicators show PEPE testing $0.000014 resistance, with RSI at 58 and support at $0.000012. The move suggests whale confidence, possibly for long-term holding, as exchange outflows reduce sell pressure. However, macro factors like U.S. tariffs and a $2.12M whale sell-off pose risks, per Lookonchain. A breakout above $0.000014 could target $0.000016, but a drop below $0.000012 risks $0.000010. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): from meme hype to collateral utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s $1 stablecoin is designed to act as a dependable DeFi anchor. It is minted only when users borrow against collateral like ETH and is burned when the loan is repaid or liquidated. With a governance-managed interest rate to keep the peg, this mechanism aims to keep stability even during volatile market conditions. This core stability layer is complemented by the platform’s mtToken staking model, which uses revenue from the protocol to buy back MUTM from the open market and distribute it to stakers — a straightforward way to turn platform growth into direct user rewards. The real intrigue for meme coin veterans lies in how Mutuum Finance (MUTM) treats digital assets. Through its peer-to-peer (P2P) model, users can negotiate rates directly and use a variety of tokens, including meme coins, as collateral. For example, a PEPE holder can deposit their tokens as security to borrow any stablecoin, gaining liquidity without selling and while maintaining exposure to any PEPE price rallies. This approach blends speculative upside with practical borrowing power, something that appeals to traders looking to keep their positions intact while moving into other plays. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s peer-to-contract (P2C) model also broadens possibilities by pooling liquidity and automatically setting rates based on usage. This allows lenders to earn interest on bluechip cryptos or stablecoins while keeping them safe in non-custodial smart contracts. Depositors receive mtTokens in return, which appreciate in value as interest accrues and can be integrated into other DeFi platforms for compounding gains. The project is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035, having generated around $14.43 million so far, with over 15,300 holders and 17% of the total supply already sold. Phase 6 has a supply of 170 million tokens, and the next phase will lift the price to $0.040, creating urgency for those looking for the best cheap crypto to buy now before the next price tier. An investor who secured MUTM in Phase 3 at $0.02 will see a 200% increase in value once the token lists at its $0.06 target. That is a significant outperformance when compared to traditional assets, and even challenges the gains of some top-performing crypto coins over the last cycle. This is why MUTM is gaining traction among those asking what’s the best crypto to buy in a post-meme rotation market. Building for long-term growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap is structured in four clear phases aimed at ensuring stability, utility, and adoption. Phase 1 focuses on presale launch, marketing, a $100,000 giveaway for ten winners, a $50,000 severity-based bug bounty, an AI helpdesk, and legal compliance preparations. Phase 2 is about building the infrastructure — core smart contract development, front-end and back-end creation, and analytics tools. Phase 3 transitions into finalizing the platform, including beta testnet demos, security audits, and preparing for exchange listings on major platforms such as Binance, KuCoin, and Coinbase. Phase 4 marks delivery — the live launch of the platform, multi-chain expansion, and forging institutional partnerships. Security is already in focus, with a CertiK audit returning strong ratings: a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78. This adds a layer of trust to the project, especially for investors who see security as a key criterion for the best crypto coin to buy. The current wave of whale speculation suggests that large holders are positioning themselves ahead of the next growth phase in DeFi. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers them — and retail traders — a rare blend of bluechip-grade borrowing power, stablecoin-driven income, and roadmap-backed growth. As the presale approaches its next price increase, the window for entry at $0.035 is narrowing. With meme capital now sniffing out sustainable utility plays, MUTM is rapidly moving from being just a new crypto to becoming a contender for the best crypto to invest in before exchange listings drive the next valuation jump.

50174395,558335,1755335978,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50174395.jpeg,"With SharpLink Now the No.2 Corporate ETH Holder, Are These the Best Altcoins to Buy?",https://bitcoinist.com/sharplink-no2-eth-holder-best-altcoins-to-buy/,"Ethereum has been on a generational run since Q2, soaring more than 220% from early April to today. The so-called digital silver is now trading at $4,444 , tantalizingly close to setting new all-time highs. What makes this rally especially powerful is that it isn’t just hype; it’s being driven by strong fundamentals: pro-crypto policy moves from the U.S. government, growing expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut , and, most importantly, surging institutional confidence in Ethereum. That confidence is showing up in the form of corporate treasuries like BitMine and SharpLink Gaming dramatically increasing their $ETH holdings. Keep reading to discover how much these institutions are now holding, what their stashes are worth at today’s sky-high prices, and how you can capitalize on this frenzy by buying the best altcoins set to ride the wave alongside Ethereum. Institutional Ethereum Holdings Are Surging SharpLink Gaming’s Q2 report (August 15) confirmed its rise as the second-largest corporate Ethereum holder worldwide. The company now holds 728,804 $ETH , worth around $3.37B at current prices. Interestingly, nearly all of this stash is staked, generating consistent yield, already amounting to 1,326 $ETH in rewards since the strategy was put in place. The biggest dog in the brawl? BitMine, which recently became the first corporate treasury to cross the 1M $ETH mark . As of August 15, its holdings stood at 1.15M $ETH, valued at over $5B, ranking it as the third-largest crypto treasury globally, behind only MicroStrategy and Mara Blockchain. This wave of institutional buying and staking creates a powerful tailwind for Ethereum’s price, reducing circulating supply, boosting investor confidence, and strengthening $ETH’s long-term value proposition. That said, while Ethereum still has plenty of upside, the real opportunity for outsized gains lies in low-priced altcoins. As history shows, when $ETH surges, smaller-cap tokens often rally even harder, sometimes delivering multiples of Ethereum’s returns. Loading up on the right altcoins, like the ones mentioned below, could be the key to maximizing profits in the upcoming rally. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Brand-New Bitcoin Layer 2 for Full Web3 Compatibility With over $9.8M in early investor funding so far, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is easily one of the hottest crypto presales on the market, and for good reason. It’s building a new Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin, integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to deliver lightning-fast speeds, ultra-low fees, and full Web3 functionality to the Bitcoin blockchain. This is groundbreaking because Bitcoin today is plagued by slow transaction times and complete incompatibility with Web3 applications. $HYPER aims to change that, transforming Bitcoin from a store of value into a full-fledged blockchain powerhouse. While the SVM powers a full Web3 environment on $HYPER’s Layer 2, a decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge makes it accessible to users. How? By letting you convert your native $BTC into ‘wrapped’ Layer 2-compatible tokens. Once wrapped, this $BTC can be deployed across the SVM-powered Web3 ecosystem, including high-speed DeFi trading, NFT marketplaces, lending, staking, swapping, DAO governance, gaming dApps, and more. As mentioned earlier, Bitcoin Hyper is currently in presale, which is why you buy $HYPER for just $0.012735 per token. According to our $HYPER price prediction , the token can surge by nearly 2,400%, potentially hitting $0.32 by the end of this year. Visit Bitcoin Hyper’s official website for more information. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Wild New Meme Coin Planning to Dethrone Dogecoin’s Dominance Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is a top new meme coin in presale , and a worthy addition if you’re looking to give your crypto portfolio that extra degen edge, something that could really help you churn out eye-popping gains this altcoin season. Unlike ‘utility-driven’ altcoins, $MAXI embraces a raw, wild theme with no groundbreaking utility or underlying value. And that’s by design. A bulked-up Shiba Inu, Maxi’s sole mission is to set the meme coin world on fire and zoom past the OG, aka Dogecoin. Why Doge? Because Maxi is Dogecoin’s distant cousin, one who was starved of love and attention as a kid because his more famous, wholesome cousin never let anyone else share the spotlight. Maxi’s plan is simple: go viral. To make that happen, it has dedicated a hefty 40% of its total token supply to marketing. Backed by PR pushes, paid campaigns, and high-profile influencer partnerships, plus weekly trading competitions and leaderboard rewards, $MAXI is armed with enough firepower to become one of the top trending cryptos once it hits exchanges. Currently in presale, 1 $MAXI is priced at just $0.0002525. And the project has in total scooped up over $1M in early investor funding so far. Learn all about Maxi Doge by visiting its official website. 3. XRP ($XRP) – Mainstream Crypto Poised to Reach New All-Time Highs With Ethereum on the rise, the spotlight is well and truly on other mainstream cryptos too. XRP ($XRP), in particular, has received a lot of attention thanks to its staggering 90% rally in June, followed by another strong 25% surge in early August . $XRP’s rally is largely fueled by the conclusion of Ripple’s long-standing legal battle with the SEC . On August 7, both parties filed a joint stipulation of dismissal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, effectively closing the case. Adding fuel to the fire is the rising likelihood of an XRP ETF approval in 2025 . According to the prediction platform Polymarket, the odds now sit at 73%. And there’s no dearth of technical bullishness, either. $XRP’s August rebound, for instance, is happening right at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level on the daily chart. This is widely viewed as a strong area of buyer interest and often a launchpad for sustained rallies. If this partner holds, XRP could soon be charging toward, and potentially even surpassing, its previous all-time highs in the weeks ahead. Wrapping Up With institutional $ETH accumulation climbing, pro-crypto policy shifts gaining momentum, and market prices trending higher, the stage is set for low-cap, high-upside altcoins like $HYPER and $MAXI to deliver explosive returns in the next rally.

Instead, ChatGPT has proposed that BTC has the potential to enter a “supercycle,” which is reshaping the price action and potentially boosting BTC price towards $200,000. A Shift From Traditional Four-Year Cycles For more than a decade, Bitcoin’s market rhythm has seemed predictable: a rally into Q4, a peak, and then a painful multi-year downturn. But ChatGPT argues that 2025 may not fit the pattern. Instead, it suggests BTC could be decoupling from its old cyclical nature. According to this outlook, Bitcoin may not experience the parabolic surges and brutal corrections of the past. Instead, it could take on characteristics of more established assets, such as equities or gold—rising steadily over time with shallower pullbacks. Three forces support this thesis: Spot ETF demand pipeline : Spot Bitcoin ETFs are pulling in steady inflows, surpassing miner supply and creating a long-term supply squeeze. Global liquidity expansion : Rising capital flows and reduced trust in fiat currencies could sustain multi-year demand. Bitcoin as a monetary hedge : Increasingly viewed as a strategic hedge, Bitcoin is drawing in institutional investors and sovereign players, making cycles less relevant. With Bitcoin’s halving events contributing less each cycle due to shrinking block rewards, external demand drivers are emerging as the key market force. Data Supporting a $200,000 Target ChatGPT estimates that Bitcoin ETFs alone could attract $400 billion in inflows by 2026. That would require only 0.4% of global investable assets shifting into BTC. So that’s the target of $149,000, with a chance to reach $200,000 if feedback loops kick in. Those loops could be: Derivative market amplifiers of price swings FOMO retail inflows Nation states and sovereign wealth funds accumulation That could be the foundation of a supercycle. Beyond price action, ChatGPT notes that wider adoption will drive ecosystem growth, and Bitcoin-linked companies will be the ones to benefit from that. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: BTC Holds Key Support Since BTC is trading at around $118,000 but holding above the key support area, it’s keeping the Bitcoin price prediction bullish. The 4-hour chart shows BTC respecting the trendline from late June, so bulls are still in control despite the consolidation. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The 50-SMA is at $118,848 with a bullish flag forming above resistance at $123,236. A close above that level could open up $126,242 and the psychological $130,000. Bitcoin holds $117.9K support, forming a bullish flag below $123.2K. A breakout could fuel targets at $126.2K and $130K . RSI at 42.5 signals room for upside, while $113K remains key invalidation. #Bitcoin #BTC pic.twitter.com/N8v6XN6Rz7 — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) August 16, 2025 Momentum indicators are still bullish. RSI is at 42.5 with room to go up, and MACD lines are crossing over. On the technical front, crypto traders are awaiting a bullish engulfing candle at around $117,335-$117,700 to confirm demand. Trade setup: Entry: $117,700–$118,000 Stop-loss: Below $113,650 Targets: $123,236, $126,242, $130,000 A breakdown below $113,000 would invalidate the bullish bias and return control to sellers.

Some of its participants include: Harbour Island, Electric Capital, Polychain Capital, GSR, Omicron Technologies, and Lido, among others. In this interview, we speak with McAndrew Rudisill, the incoming chairman of ETHZilla’s board of directors, to understand how the firm plans to leverage the DeFi Council’s non-binding advisory input, uphold accountability, and stay fully committed to Ethereum, avoiding altcoin diversification even as broader market trends shift in that direction. 1. You aim to outperform traditional ETH staking using a mix of staking, lending, liquidity provisioning, and private agreements. Can you share risk parameters and expected yield bands? We aim to generate higher yields than traditional ETH staking through a variety of proprietary Ethereum network-based strategies. 2. The announcement states that the DeFi Council will “offer input” on treasury deployment. Will this input be binding or advisory? And how will accountability and transparency for those decisions be maintained publicly? These agreements are for general advisory purposes, not binding. The council gives access to their respective Ethereum protocols, which Electric Capital, as the independent asset manager, will determine how to use to generate yield. The Etherealize team will provide access to real-world assets that can generate yield on-chain as assets are codified. 3. You’ve secured participation from over 60 institutional and crypto-native investors. Beyond capital, what specific advisory or network value do these investors bring to ETHZilla’s strategy? There is a diverse mix of traditional finance and DeFi investors in this deal. All of the DeFi Council members have invested in this deal. 4. ETHZilla is focusing its treasury on ETH rather than Bitcoin. What are the strategic reasons behind choosing Ethereum over BTC as a reserve asset? What makes ETH an increasingly attractive asset? ETH is one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies in the world because it can be used for people to build apps and financial tools to manage assets and generate yield. ETH has inherent yield, and real-world assets will be brought onchain with ETH, which will bring the transaction volume to an exponential rise. This will positively impact the price of ETH. A true yield curve will be built on Ethereum, and we can generate yield by holding Ethereum. 5. The boost in ETF inflows and corporate adoption appears to be a major factor behind ETH’s rally this month. Do you have a year-end price target for ETH? We directionally think ETH is going up, and the percentage change could be quite large relative to where we are today. Similar to BTC, we are in the early innings for ETH. We are building this for the long term and are focused on ETH appreciation as network adoption rises. ETHZilla has confirmed that it will not pursue any non‑ETH allocations and will maintain a strict Ethereum-only treasury strategy despite broader market trends toward altcoin diversification.

Key Takeaways: American Bitcoin is exploring acquisitions in Japan and Hong Kong to grow its Bitcoin reserves. The company plans a September public listing via a reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed Gryphon Digital Mining. Its strategy mirrors Michael Saylor’s corporate Bitcoin treasury model but adds mining operations for new BTC supply. The company is in discussions with investors to buy a publicly listed firm in Japan, with Hong Kong also under consideration, the Financial Times reported , citing three sources. The strategy mirrors that of Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which has become the poster child for corporate Bitcoin treasuries. American Bitcoin Eyes Asian Deals to Expand Strategic BTC Reserve American Bitcoin, already building what it calls a “strategic” Bitcoin reserve, aims to use these acquisitions to accumulate more crypto. In a statement, the firm said its goal is to create “the strongest and most efficient Bitcoin accumulation platform in the world,” focusing on efficient operations, active treasury management, and long-term shareholder value. It added that while it is evaluating overseas opportunities, no binding commitments have been made. The Trump family’s involvement in digital assets has grown sharply in recent months, coinciding with a friendlier U.S. regulatory environment under President Trump. Bitcoin prices have surged alongside a boom in “crypto treasury companies,” publicly traded entities that use capital raised from equity or debt sales to purchase tokens. These vehicles allow investors to gain Bitcoin exposure through stock markets rather than direct ownership. American Bitcoin (ABTC): Next stop NASDAQ! pic.twitter.com/uhaJzV0vfz — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) August 7, 2025 Strategy, which holds roughly 629,000 BTC valued at $76 billion, now boasts a market cap nearing $110 billion. Unlike Strategy, American Bitcoin also mines Bitcoin, adding freshly minted coins to its balance sheet. The company plans to go public in September via a reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed Gryphon Digital Mining. Eric Trump serves as co-founder and chief strategy officer. Originally named American Data Centers (ADC), the miner was a wholly owned subsidiary of Dominari Holdings, a New York-based securities and fintech group headquartered in Trump Tower. In March, ADC rebranded as American Bitcoin through a joint venture with Canadian miner Hut 8, which contributed all its mining equipment in exchange for a majority stake. Eric and Donald Trump Jr. were early investors in ADC. Dominari Holdings Reports 520% Revenue Surge Dominari Holdings, which appointed the Trump brothers to its board of advisers in February, reported a 520% year-on-year revenue increase this week. American Bitcoin’s interest in Asia taps into markets with deep retail trading culture and growing regulatory openness toward crypto. Hong Kong has positioned itself as a digital asset hub, and Japanese-listed vehicles could provide a regulated path for institutional and retail investors to participate. The venture is one of several crypto-linked businesses tied to the Trump family. In June, Donald Trump disclosed $57 million in income from World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform that recently announced a $1.5 billion token buyback in partnership with Las Vegas-based blockchain firm ALT5 Sigma. Separately, Trump Media & Technology Group, which operates Truth Social, plans to raise $2.5 billion to establish its own Bitcoin treasury.

Prominent attorney Bill Morgan has weighed in on the filing, noting that while the step is “a formality,” it leaves space for “another short period of time for posts about Judge Torres making a final order any day.” With the report submitted, both sides now await the court’s approval for a formal dismissal of the appeals. However, Morgan suggests that many community members who don’t fully understand the timeline will continue sharing misinformation. It’s a formality but we can enjoy another short period of time for posts about Judge Torres making a final order any day https://t.co/UNxlXl4RUF — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) August 15, 2025 Misinformation About Judge Torres’s Role Despite the straightforward procedural timeline, parts of the community have claimed that a final order from U.S. District Judge Torres could arrive any day. That is inaccurate, as Judge Torres has not had control over this matter since she denied the parties’ request for an indicative ruling months ago. Once that motion was rejected, the case proceeded within the Second Circuit’s jurisdiction, with Ripple expressing its intention to dismiss its appeal , and the SEC following suit over a month later. Any order concluding the appeals must come from the appellate court upon approval of the dismissal stipulation, not from the district court. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Road to Dismissal Morgan has repeatedly corrected these recurring misstatements and explained that the outcome now depends on the Second Circuit. His latest comment emphasizes that the filings already outline what both sides want: dismissal of their appeals. Attorney James K. Filan, who shared the status report, also noted that the dismissal stipulation is pending, reinforcing that the next action rests with the appellate court. Once the Second Circuit grants the motions to dismiss, the appeals will be terminated. That step would effectively end the long-running legal battle between the SEC and Ripple, consistent with the parties’ filings. It does not require, and will not feature, a fresh “final order” from Judge Torres, as many in the community might still suggest. The appeals now rest with the Second Circuit, and until the court confirms the dismissal, talk of a district court conclusion is misplaced. What is certain is that both Ripple and the SEC have signaled their intention to close this chapter, leaving the case nearer than ever to resolution.

The US president, who had warned of “severe consequences” if Putin refused to commit to peace, came back offering no penalties, no ceasefire, and no clear outcomes. According to the Financial Times, Trump instead praised the “fantastic relationship” he shares with the Russian leader, who remains wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes. The timing of the summit triggered immediate backlash on Capitol Hill. The war in Ukraine is still active, yet Trump appeared on camera grinning and chauffeuring Putin around in a private car. What made it worse for lawmakers wasn’t just the friendly optics—it was that Trump ended the meeting by saying he’d agreed with Putin on “many, many points” but also emphasized that “there’s no deal until there’s a deal.” His refusal to impose new sanctions or consequences rattled both parties and drew criticism even from typically loyal conservatives. Trump ignores pressure to hit Russia harder Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said that although the meeting was necessary, the best outcome now would be a ceasefire “well before Christmas.” He didn’t sound convinced that Trump had moved the needle. Conservative commentator Bill O’Reilly was more direct. He said there were no “concrete gains” from the summit and that Trump needed to “step up economic pressure.” For O’Reilly, Trump was running out of time to show results. Democratic Senator Jack Reed, who leads the Armed Services Committee, criticized the optics of the meeting. Reed said he didn’t like the “applause” Putin received and called the post-summit press conference “unorthodox” and lacking any useful detail. He backed diplomacy, but added that “peacemaking must be done responsibly,” suggesting Trump had failed to approach the summit with that mindset. Despite the criticism, Trump went on Fox News and confirmed he had no plans to follow through on additional penalties. He called the meeting a success, saying it went “very well,” and defended the lack of action by pointing to ongoing talks. But while Trump focused on conversation, reports surfaced that Russia was continuing to work around American sanctions, this time through crypto. Russia uses crypto to dodge financial crackdown While Trump was shaking hands, new details came out showing how Russia has built a parallel crypto economy since 2022 to avoid global restrictions. Research from Chainalysis showed the rise of a little-known ruble-backed token called A7A5 , which had processed more than $51.1 billion in transactions by the end of July. It was being traded mostly on smaller exchanges tied to Russian entities, many of which had already been sanctioned. One of the biggest platforms, Garantex, was hit with US sanctions in 2022. In response, the same group behind it launched Grinex in 2024 to keep the system alive. This week, the US Treasury sanctioned both Grinex and the issuer of A7A5, a Kyrgyzstan-based outfit named Old Vector, which is backed by Russia’s state-owned Promsvyazbank. What stood out about A7A5 was its weekday-only trading behavior. Activity would drop off over weekends, which analysts interpreted as proof it was being used primarily by businesses. Chainalysis pointed out that the token lined up with Russia’s push for legal crypto mining and cross-border payments. The report called this a “deliberate effort” to build a new financial system beyond US control. The data also showed that the Russian government had quietly enabled policies to let these systems grow. Instead of waiting on central banks or dollar approvals, businesses were now sending money through chains tied directly to institutions already under sanctions. “Backed by sanctioned Russian institutions, A7A5 is providing a new, crypto-native avenue to bypass the ever tightening sanctions against Russia,” Chainalysis said. They added that it remained to be seen whether A7A5 would eventually reach retail users.

XYZVerse, still trading for less than a dollar, has sparked debate among traders and analysts. Its rapid growth and unique features could set the stage for a major shift in the market by next year. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price: $0.0001 Price Now: $0.005 Next Stage: $0.01 Final Presale Price: $0.02 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries. So far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Solana’s Fast Lane: Why SOL Is Catching Eyes This Cycle Solana was built for speed. While rivals like Ethereum and Cardano can slow when traffic rises, Solana keeps moving by packing more work into each block instead of adding extra layers. Its design lets developers write apps in several common languages and send thousands of transactions in a blink. The SOL coin is the fuel for all this action. People use it to pay fees, run custom programs, and earn rewards for helping secure the network. The market now favors chains that stay quick and cheap, and Solana fits that mood. Trading volumes for SOL have climbed as new games, art markets, and finance tools launch on the network. Investors like its simple path to growth—no need to split the chain or bolt on fixes. Ethereum still holds the crown for size, but Solana often wins on cost and speed, two big talking points this cycle. If demand for lively, high-traffic apps keeps rising, SOL could remain a standout choice among major coins. XRP: The Quick Coin That Wants to Move Money Like Text Messages XRP lives on a public digital record called the XRP Ledger. It was built by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz to act like cash made for the internet. Payments race across the globe in seconds, cost a tiny fraction of a cent, and cannot be reversed or faked. Only 100 billion coins exist; 80 billion went to Ripple, the company helping the network grow. Most of that stash sits in escrow, so new coins enter the market in set doses. In today’s cycle, speed and low fees stand out. Bitcoin is trusted but slow. Ethereum is flexible but can be pricey when traffic spikes. XRP avoids both pains, making it handy for everyday transfers or swapping between currencies. Recent talk about cross-border payments and digital dollars shines a light on coins that move fast without a bank account, so many traders see XRP as a strong play while the market looks for the next leader. Conclusion XYZVerse (XYZ) is poised to challenge SOL and XRP by merging sports fandom and meme culture, aiming for significant growth and community-driven success.

Priced below a dollar, XYZVerse is not just another entry in the crypto market; it represents a fusion of sports enthusiasm and meme culture, poised to redefine investor expectations in the coming years. $XYZ: More Than a Token, a Cultural Shift At its core, XYZVerse is built around the vibrant cultures of sports and digital engagement. This project isn't merely about transactions; it's about creating a community where passion for sports meets the excitement of cryptocurrency investment. The team behind XYZVerse has crafted a unique ecosystem that resonates strongly with sports fans across various disciplines, including football, basketball, MMA, and esports. The project's vision, dubbed the Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.), is ambitious, aiming to elevate the platform to legendary status within the crypto realm. This audacious goal has already begun to garner attention, earning XYZVerse the accolade of Best New Meme Project . With a robust roadmap and a community-driven approach, $XYZ is charting a path toward sustainable growth, distinguishing itself from the ephemeral nature of typical meme coins. The potential of XYZVerse extends beyond its current market position. The ongoing presale phase offers early investors a significant advantage, with token prices set to escalate through multiple stages before reaching the general market. Here's a snapshot of the presale progress: Launch Price: $0.0001 Current Price: $0.005 Next Target: $0.01 Final Presale Price: $0.02 With over $15 million already raised, the excitement around $XYZ is palpable. As the presale advances, early participants are positioned to maximize returns, potentially achieving up to a 1,000-fold increase on their initial investment. Join the $XYZ Presale now and be part of a movement that's set to reshape the crypto landscape. A Look at the Competitors: SOL and XRP While XYZVerse is making headlines with its innovative approach, it's essential to understand the competitive landscape. Solana has established itself as a high-speed, low-cost blockchain, ideal for applications requiring rapid transaction capabilities. Meanwhile, Ripple's XRP has become synonymous with fast international money transfers, appealing to those seeking efficient cross-border payment solutions. The relevance of Solana and XRP in the current market underscores the significant potential of XYZVerse to carve out a niche for itself by appealing to a diverse and engaged community. Conclusion The ascent of XYZVerse is a testament to the vibrant dynamism of the crypto market. Combining sports fanaticism with a compelling investment opportunity, $XYZ is not just creating waves but setting the stage for a potential market upheaval against established giants like Solana and XRP.

Key Takeaways: Gemini has filed to list on Nasdaq under ticker GEMI, with major Wall Street banks leading the IPO. The company faces mounting losses, posting a $282.5 million net loss in H1 2025 as cash reserves shrink. The filing comes amid strong investor appetite for crypto IPOs, following major debuts by Circle and Bullish. The move comes two months after the New York-based crypto exchange and custodian submitted a confidential filing . Founded in 2014 by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, Gemini has yet to disclose how many shares it will offer or the expected price range. The timing of the IPO also remains unclear. Wall Street Giants Line Up to Lead Deal Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and Cantor Fitzgerald will lead the deal, with Academy Securities and AmeriVet Securities as co-managers. The filing arrives amid heightened investor interest in crypto listings. Circle’s June debut saw shares surge nearly 10x from the $31 offering price before settling at $149. Earlier this week, institutional exchange Bullish more than tripled from its $37 IPO price on its first trading day, closing near $70 on Friday. Several other crypto firms, including OKX, Grayscale, and Kraken, have either hinted at or initiated plans to go public. Meanwhile, listed industry leaders like Coinbase and MicroStrategy have recently hit multi-year highs. Gemini’s financials, however, highlight mounting losses. The company reported a $158.5 million net loss on $142.2 million in revenue for 2024. Losses deepened in the first half of 2025, reaching $282.5 million on $67.9 million in revenue. Cash reserves fell from $341.5 million at the end of 2024 to $161.9 million by mid-2025. Gemini must be desperate for an IPO as these are some terrible results given crypto market growth the past year. Must just be losing market share pic.twitter.com/jKvwAC4Sn8 — guleid (@riddle245) August 15, 2025 Last month, Tyler Winklevoss claimed that JPMorgan Chase paused the crypto exchange’s onboarding process after he publicly criticized the bank’s new policy on financial data access. Winklevoss said JPMorgan responded to his recent comments by halting Gemini’s re-onboarding, a process the bank initiated after previously ending the relationship during what Winklevoss referred to as “Operation ChokePoint 2.0.” The fallout followed a Bloomberg report that revealed JPMorgan’s plans to begin charging fintech companies for access to customer banking data. Gemini’s IPO Drive Rides Wave of Pro-Crypto Shift Under Trump The IPO push comes as the regulatory climate shifts in favor of digital assets. Since President Trump’s return to office in January, the SEC has dropped most cases against crypto firms. The Trump administration has also advanced its pro-crypto agenda with a series of policy and regulatory moves. President Trump signed an executive order urging regulators to remove barriers that prevent 401(k) plans from including alternative assets such as cryptocurrencies. If implemented, the reforms could allow millions of Americans to allocate retirement funds to Bitcoin and other digital assets through regulated channels. Trump also nominated economist Stephen Miran , a digital asset advocate, to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, signaling continuity in his administration’s pro-crypto stance. The announcement coincided with Bitcoin climbing back above $117,000, highlighting the link between policy developments and market sentiment. In a separate executive order, Trump moved to end “debanking” practices that target lawful crypto firms.

Now, the same gambler is putting everything into a new coin: XYZVerse. Chasing an even bigger win, this switch has become the talk of online circles. What is driving this bold decision, and could XYZVerse really deliver a 500x return? XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Much Wow Money: Dogecoin's Bark Returns in the Crypto Spring Dogecoin began in 2013 as an inside joke among coders Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer. They slapped a Shiba Inu meme on the logo and set the rules to mint 10,000 new coins every minute, so scarcity was never the point. What followed shocked the market. In 2021 a swarm of online fans, led by tweets from Elon Musk, pushed the “memecoin” into the top ten list with a value above $50 billion. The rise proved that humor, community, and timing can move real money. Today DOGE still runs on a simple, secure network based on proof-of-work, yet its fees stay low and transfers are quick. The endless supply works well for tipping, charity drives, and small payments, though it might limit long-term price growth. In the new market upswing, meme tokens are heating up again, but most come and go. DOGE stands out with ten years of history, deep liquidity, and possible use inside Elon Musk’s X super-app dream. If hype returns, this old dog could grab attention once more. Conclusion Turning $5,000 into $2 million with DOGE is remarkable. Now, the focus shifts to XYZVerse, aiming for massive growth by blending meme culture with sports in a community-driven ecosystem.

Discovering Wealth Through Dogecoin The world was taken by storm when Dogecoin, initially created as a light-hearted cryptocurrency featuring a Shiba Inu meme, became a major player in the crypto space. This meme coin, envisioned by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, was never meant to be taken seriously. Yet, in a surprising twist fueled by social media and celebrity endorsements, its value skyrocketed. An investor, who initially put $5,000 into DOGE, capitalized on this surge, turning his investment into a staggering $2 million. This transformation highlights the unpredictable and often whimsical nature of cryptocurrency investments. The Shift to XYZVerse Having conquered the peaks with Dogecoin, the investor is now channeling his insights and capital into XYZVerse , a new meme coin poised to capitalize on the sports industry. With sports and meme culture intertwining, XYZVerse represents an innovative blend that could potentially disrupt the market. Market Sentiment and Early Moves The confidence in XYZVerse is palpable.

Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse introduces a unique proposition by integrating sports into its model, aiming to create more than just viral content but a sustainable tokenomics ecosystem.

Three altcoins – Solana, Cardano, and SUI – are gaining traction due to institutional interest, technical prowess, and active ecosystems. In addition to this major name, presale activity is heating up, especially for MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is gaining traction among early investors looking for maximum upside during the next leg of the bull market. Solana (SOL): Bullish Price Action Above $200 Solana is holding steady between the $197 and $204 marks after seeing a daily high of $206. With trade volume healthy at $14.49B, technical indicators eye bullish alignment. The $44 million inflows show that accumulation is still taking place. Support is placed near $194, while resistance ranges between $200 and $213.26. Analysts believe Solana could push toward $225–$250 as the Bollinger Bands expand and the moving averages continue to align. It remains a top Layer-1 play for August. Cardano (ADA): Momentum Builds at the $1 Level Cardano (ADA) price has increased by 35% in the last month and currently trades at the $0.98–0.99 range. This week, ADA saw a brief ascendance to $1, with vigorous whale activity indicating additional growth potential. Recently, over 200 million ADA were transferred to private wallets. In addition, Grayscale’s ETF inclusion is attracting institutional capital. The ecosystem infrastructure of Cardano is growing faster. Recently, Hydra scalability trials have commenced. Furthermore, the Defi TVL for Cardano is also growing , and it recently reached $349 million. ADA is expected to reclaim the 1.08 dollar level, with targets of close to 2.30 dollars. SUI: Range-Bound, but Set for a Break SUI is experiencing a volatile range of $3.32 to $4.01. Analysts see downside risk towards $2.74, but recovery to $3.90 is likely if Broader Market Focus Remains Positive. The token is still discovering its price as fresh support and resistance levels are being formed. SUI is a good pick if you’re looking for asymmetric upside from a smaller-cap Layer-1, one of the more speculative assets on this list. MAGACOIN FINANCE: High-Upside Presale With Bonus Incentive MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the most attractive early-stage plays in the current market. With whale accumulation accelerating, scarcity-based tokenomics, and rising visibility ahead of key exchange listings, the project is drawing heightened attention from both retail and institutional investors. Investors can take advantage of the 50% EXTRA presale bonus available by using the code EXTRA50X . As liquidity inflows grow and market sentiment strengthens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself for substantial upside in the next bullish cycle. Final Take: Smart Entries Ahead of Altseason Solana, Cardano and SUI are gripping on to breakout territory, supported by fundamentals and market conditions. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale is a rarely-offered chance to obtain earlier-stage asymmetric returns with additional bonus incentives – which makes it one of the smartest early entries this cycle.

50175919,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78668,1755338445,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Macro Tailwinds Fuel Bitcoin (BTC)’s Weekly Close Higher, Opening Room For This Altcoin To Hit $0.6 By Q4 Easily",https://timestabloid.com/macro-tailwinds-fuel-bitcoin-btcs-weekly-close-higher-opening/,"The crypto market is riding a fresh wave of optimism as macroeconomic winds turn favorable. With the Federal Reserve signaling a softer stance and Bitcoin (BTC) locking in a powerful weekly close above key resistance, the question “why is crypto going up” is finally getting a clear answer: liquidity is flowing back into risk assets. Historically, such setups have paved the way for small-cap altcoins to deliver explosive runs. Among the names drawing increasing attention from both retail and early institutional watchers is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a high-utility decentralized finance project that is aligning its launch with this macro surge. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Reward System Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out by not only tapping into the excitement of investing in crypto but by offering tangible, revenue-driven utility. Its design features mtToken staking on designated smart contracts, where MUTM rewards will be sourced from a buyback-from-revenue model. As the platform grows, part of its income from lending and borrowing will be used to repurchase MUTM from the market, with these tokens distributed to stakers. This creates a continuous demand loop that many crypto predictions place high on their list of sustainable growth mechanisms. Adding to its institutional-grade appeal, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to launch a decentralized stablecoin engineered to maintain a $1 peg. The stablecoin will only be minted when users borrow against overcollateralized assets like ETH, and will be burned upon loan repayment or liquidation. By assigning minting rights exclusively to approved issuers with strict limits, and dynamically adjusting interest rates to stabilize the peg, the system is designed for resilience — even during volatile market swings that lead many to wonder “why is crypto crashing.” Presale Momentum Meets DeFi Utility The numbers behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale underscore the strong early conviction around the project. Currently in Phase 6 at a $0.035 entry price, the presale has raised over $14.5 million, drawn more than 15,300 holders, and reached 18% of token allocation sold. The next phase will lift the price to $0.040, locking in gains for those who entered earlier. A quick look back shows that Phase 1 participants at $0.01 are positioned for a +250% uplift at the $0.06 listing price — and that’s before factoring in potential appreciation from exchange demand and user adoption. The platform’s core lending model brings two approaches to the table. In the peer-to-contract (P2C) model, a lender depositing $20,000 USDT into a liquidity pool will earn a 15% APY, translating into $3,000 in yearly passive income. The peer-to-peer (P2P) model allows for direct negotiation between lender and borrower, giving both sides flexibility. Borrowers can post assets like DOGE or any high risky asset as collateral to access liquidity without selling their holdings, keeping upside exposure intact. This dual-model flexibility is integrated into a roadmap designed to attract both retail users and institutional partners. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s 4-phase rollout starts with presale and compliance groundwork, moves through core contract development and advanced feature integration, enters finalization with audits and beta testing, and culminates in a live platform launch. Phase 4 will target exchange listings, institutional partnerships, and multi-chain expansion — the type of milestones that keep seasoned investors asking “is crypto a good investment” in evolving markets. Trust and transparency are reinforced through Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s completed CertiK audit, with a Token Scan score of 95 and Skynet score of 78. To further ensure security, the project has allocated $50,000 for a bug bounty program with rewards tied to the severity of discovered vulnerabilities. Community engagement is also fueled by a $100,000 giveaway to be shared among 10 winners, an added incentive layered on top of the presale benefits. Looking at the numbers, the trajectory is clear. A Phase 1 investor at $0.01 will already see a 250% uplift at listing price. If user growth, platform adoption, and major exchange listings align as outlined, projections point to the possibility of MUTM trading above $0.60 by Q4 — a 900% gain from current presale entry. In an environment where Bitcoin (BTC)’s strength is already lifting the market, such asymmetric setups stand out. As macro tailwinds continue to drive the narrative and more participants search for the next breakout, the overlap of discounted presale pricing and high-utility design becomes increasingly rare. For those watching why is crypto going up right now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned to ride the same current that has historically turned early adopters into the biggest winners.

It suggests that retail is panicking, while institutions are quietly hoarding. Bitcoin and Ether both cooled off after last week’s highs. BTC price dropped around 5% from its fresh ATH of above $124,400 to the $117,000 zone. This moved the cumulative crypto market to print red indexes on Saturday morning and to drag below the $4 trillion cap. Its 24-hour trading volume is down by 32% to stand at $180 billion. ICO whale cashes out On-chain data shows that behind the red candles, whales are moving differently. One ICO participant who spent just $104 back in 2015 finally moved his 334.7 ETH (approx. worth $1.48 million today) after nearly a decade of dormancy. That’s 14,200 times the return. But while early investors cash out, firms like Bitmine are doubling down . The company scooped up another 106,485 ETH (approx. worth $470 million) over the last 24 hours. That haul pushes its treasury to 1.29 million ETH, valued at nearly $5.8 billion. Another undisclosed institutional buyer has also been aggressively accumulating, pulling 92,899 ETH (approx. worth $412 million) from Kraken in just four days across newly created wallets. Source: Ethereum ICO participant “0x61b9” . At the same time, some large private funds are using dips to adjust positions. A wallet linked to Longling Capital sold 7,000 ETH worth $31.8 million during the pullback but still holds $352 million worth of Ether. This reshuffling highlights that while sentiment indicators like Santiment’s greed index suggest retail exuberance peaked with Bitcoin’s ATH, institutions are treating ETH’s dip as an entry point. Hackers cash in on Ethereum’s run The rally has also turned into an unexpected windfall for hackers. The Radiant Capital exploiter, allegedly linked to North Korea, sold nearly $44 million in ETH this week. This boosted their stolen funds to over $100 million, almost double the value of the original haul. The attacker drained $53 million last October and has since flipped part of the loot into stablecoins, pocketing more than $48 million in profit. Similarly, attackers from the Infini and THORChain exploits capitalized on ETH’s surge. The Infini hacker stole around $49.5 million in USDC in February and bought 17,696 ETH at a price of $2,798. Since July, in addition to laundering 5,000 ETH through Tornado, the hacker has sold 3,540 ETH for 13.318 million DAI at an average price of $3,762. Ethereum price recorded a pullback after a brief rally. It dropped by 5% over the last 24 hours, but it still remained up by 29% over the past 30 days. ETH is trading at an average price of $4,455 at the press time. Its market cap hovers above $537 billion.

The decision comes in the wake of a failed summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, where no deal was reached to pause or end Russia’s war in Ukraine. India took a direct hit from Trump last week with a 25% tariff slapped on its exports to the U.S. The reason? India kept importing Russian oil. But when asked during an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity if Beijing would face the same punishment, Trump dodged. “Because of what happened today, I think I don’t have to think about that,” he said , referring to the outcome of the summit. “I may have to think about it in two weeks or three weeks, but we don’t have to think about that right now.” India punished while China stays untouchable The sharp move against India highlights the uneven pressure being applied by the White House. Despite India and China being the two largest buyers of Russian oil , only one of them is being penalized. The administration has made repeated threats to hit nations helping fund Moscow’s war through energy purchases, but so far, only India has felt the weight. Xi Jinping, China’s president, is currently negotiating a trade deal with Trump that could lower tensions between the two economic giants. That deal could reduce tariffs and calm years of aggressive trade fighting. But Trump’s choice to delay action against China, even while warning of future moves, shows he’s not ready to risk blowing up those talks, at least not yet. Behind the scenes, Beijing’s economy is already showing signs of stress. If Trump follows through on his repeated threats of Russia-related sanctions and trade penalties, Xi would have a bigger mess to clean up. But for now, China’s energy deals with Russia are untouched, and the tariffs are on hold. Russia’s oil earnings plunge as exports shrink While Trump hesitates, Russia’s export numbers are sinking. According to the Bank of Russia, overseas shipments dropped 8% in June compared to the year before. That followed a nearly 10% dip in May. For the second quarter, exports dropped 5.9% year-over-year, matching the decline seen in the first quarter of the year. The problem isn’t just the volume, it’s also the price. Russian oil, which had averaged over $70 per barrel earlier in the year, fell to an average of just $56 per barrel in Q2. The central bank now predicts it’ll go even lower, estimating a $55 per barrel average for the rest of 2025. That’s down from the earlier forecast of $60. More supply from OPEC+, and less demand globally, are making things worse. As the market gets flooded , prices are expected to drop again. Meanwhile, the European Union’s sanctions, which included lowering the price cap on Russian oil from $60 to $47.60 per barrel, have had little effect. Russian crude is still moving through the system, just sold at cheaper prices. Even Trump’s threats of more tariffs and secondary sanctions haven’t caused major disruptions to the flow of Russian oil. The price gap between Russian benchmark crude and the global rate is now the tightest it’s been since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began. In the first half of 2025, Russia’s exports totaled $196.1 billion, down 5.9% from a year earlier. Imports remained steady at $138.7 billion. But the country’s current account surplus, the measure of what Russia earns from abroad minus what it spends, has dropped. It’s now at $25 billion, way down from $42.1 billion in the same period last year. That decline is tied to weaker trade results and growing deficits in services. Elsewhere, the markets responded. Brent crude dropped 1.5%, settling at $66.85 per barrel, while U.S. crude fell 1.8% to $62.80.

50177965,558298,1755342009,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50177965.jpeg,Ethereum MVRV Ratio Nears Overheated Zone: Profit-Taking Ahead?,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-mvrv-ratio-nears-overheated-profit-taking/,"Ethereum is now at the center of market attention as Bitcoin fails to confirm a breakout above its all-time highs. While BTC’s momentum stalls, altcoins are struggling to extend their strength, leaving Ethereum in a decisive position. Trading above $4,400, ETH is now less than 10% away from reaching new record highs. Bulls remain confident in a continuation of the uptrend. Analysts argue that accumulation trends and strong on-chain activity point to further gains ahead. Exchange reserves continue to decline, while OTC desks show thinning liquidity, suggesting demand is outpacing available supply. This combination has historically preceded sharp upward moves. However, risks are also growing as the market enters a new phase. With Bitcoin showing weakness near its highs, Ethereum’s ability to decouple and push forward will determine the direction of altcoins broadly. Some analysts view this as the beginning of a true altseason, while others warn that failure to sustain momentum could trigger a correction. Ethereum MVRV Ratio Signals Potential Short-Term Pullback According to top analyst On-Chain Mind, Ethereum’s MVRV ratio is moving into the +3σ to +4σ zone, a range that has historically marked overheated conditions and led to short-term pullbacks. This suggests that profit-taking pressure is likely to surface between $4,600 and $5,200, creating a critical test for ETH in the days ahead. Despite these risks, Ethereum remains strong, less than 10% away from new all-time highs, and many analysts believe a breakout could still materialize. Some expect consolidation as short-term holders lock in gains, while others view the current setup as the prelude to Ethereum pushing decisively beyond its previous highs. Institutional accumulation continues to accelerate, with large players treating ETH as both an investment and a strategic asset. Meanwhile, legal clarity across key jurisdictions has reduced uncertainty, creating a more stable environment for long-term adoption. At the same time, exchange supply has been steadily declining, signaling conviction among holders and reducing potential selling pressure. If Ethereum breaks through resistance levels despite its overheated MVRV, it could spark a powerful continuation rally, potentially leading the broader altcoin market. However, if profit-taking dominates, a pullback would not weaken the bullish trend but instead set the stage for healthier continuation later. Technical Details: Key Levels To Hold Ethereum is showing remarkable momentum on the weekly chart, now trading at $4,447 after hitting a recent peak at $4,792, just below its 2021 all-time high. The price has surged above the 50, 100, and 200-week moving averages, with the 50-week SMA ($2,771) crossing decisively above the longer-term averages. This alignment confirms a strong bullish structure that historically precedes extended rallies. Volume has also expanded notably during this rally, reflecting strong demand and conviction from buyers. The breakout from the $3,600–$3,800 resistance zone has been followed by sharp upward momentum, showing that bulls remain firmly in control. However, Ethereum is now approaching historically significant resistance near $4,800–$4,900, where sellers could attempt to cap gains. If ETH manages a weekly close above $4,800, the path toward fresh all-time highs above $5,000 becomes increasingly probable. On the other hand, failure to hold above current levels could trigger a healthy correction back to the $4,200–$4,000 support zone, where the 50-week SMA is now acting as a cushion.

As Bitcoin stabilizes beyond $116K and altcoins circulate once more, traders are back to seeking out a high-upside potential play that marries their viral potential with sound fundamentals. In this environment, MAGACOIN FINANCE has surprised many, gaining serious interest from both retail and institutional players. The token is being discussed in the same breath as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, with some analysts expecting it to outperform both in the coming wave. Due to its early capital influx and increasing community traction, MAGACOIN FINANCE is set to become the most talked-about meme coin of Q4. Why Dogecoin Is Back in the Spotlight Dogecoin has recently moved above $0.21 thanks to renewed retail interest and massive Twitter chatter, as well as speculative bets on future endorsements by Elon Musk. Even though it started as a meme, DOGE is in the top 10 in terms of market cap and is a liquidity magnet during risk-on altcoin seasons. Nonetheless, some analysts are warning that this cycle, Dogecoin has limited upside. As DOGE delivered huge profits during the previous bull markets, new meme coins are showing up to game like DOGE. The Rise of Meme Coins With Real Infrastructure This cycle of meme coins is shaping to reward more than just the hype For example, Shiba Inu has regained legitimacy with its Shibarium Layer-2 network and Floki has branched out into DeFi and gaming. The emerging trend? Meme coins having credible product roadmaps, governance models, and utility beyond the meme. MAGACOIN FINANCE is banking on a politically charged brand, capped supply structure and presale momentum to create a scalable, long-term narrative. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Meme Coin Rotation Play of the Cycle Final allocation wave before institutional adoption is underway, with MAGACOIN FINANCE attracting accelerated buy pressure from whales and early movers ahead of anticipated market catalysts. Analysts highlight its scarcity-driven supply, growing cross-chain investor base, and strategic positioning before expected exchange listings as key factors fueling momentum. With institutional interest building and liquidity rotation into high-upside assets gaining pace, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a prime target for significant gains in the next market cycle. The Bottom Line: Early Rotation Could Mean Outsized Returns As Dogecoin and Shiba Inu gain momentum, investors are broadening their investment horizons. If you’re looking for a meme coin that prioritises security, scalability, and community ownership, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a great choice this altseason. The final presale allocation is closing in; timing may matter most.

This new PayFi sensation is enjoying increasing institutional interest as it offers a promising alternative to the slow growth Cardano price has delivered. Remittix is attracting whales seeking better upside by leveraging its cross-border crypto-to-fiat payment solution. Once funding reaches $20M, the project will reveal its first and major CEX listing, making it an exciting high-growth opportunity for savvy investors. Cardano Price Prediction: Is $1 Possible? Source: TradingView Cardano’s price is displaying resilience despite market-wide instabilities. According to a recent market report, whale accumulation has increased after addresses holding 100 million to 1 billion ADA scooped a significant amount of ADA tokens. Expert analysts call this move a signal of ADA’s potential. But can ADA reach $1? Analysts call for caution as the Cardano price continues to battle resistance at the $0.83 price level. Not breaking out of this hold will hinder any chance of Cardano price growing to $1. However, the mixed market signals haven’t hindered confidence in the Cardano price. Latest on-chain metrics indicate that a break above $0.88 could trigger a rally toward the $1 target. But with whales departing for the more promising Remittix project, this potential might hit a bump. Remittix (RTX) Presents A More Convincing Alternative to Cardano Price Unclear Pattern More whales and investors are moving their investments to the promising DeFi projects called Remittix (RTX) . This low-cap crypto gem is attracting massive interest in the cross-border crypto-to-fiat payment space for its simplified solution. Hence, analysts consider it a highly attractive opportunity for those seeking high-growth potential and wider profit margins. Thanks to the growing institutional backing and robust market fundamentals, Remittix offers an exciting alternative to other unstable projects like Cardano. Here’s what drives Remittix (RTX) rocketing traction: Enables seamless crypto-to-fiat conversions and transfers to over 30 countries with swift settlement. Involves no hidden fees, providing transparent and predictable transactions. Remittix is CertiK-approved after the security firm audited its smart contracts. With the mobile wallet beta launch this September, there will be an additional tool driving mainstream adoption for individuals and businesses Analysts are convinced Remittix holds the potential to deliver sky-high gains.

The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has seen weeks of massive gains, driven by strong institutional interest, shrinking supply on exchanges, and growing demand across decentralized finance. Bulls remain in control as momentum pushes ETH closer to record-breaking territory. Related Reading: Memecoins Lose Ground In Market Share As Ethereum Absorbs Liquidity However, risks are also building as the market enters a new phase of volatility. After such a sharp rally, profit-taking and speculative rotations could trigger stronger pullbacks. Key data highlights the intensity of current activity: Ethereum’s on-chain volume has surged to $12.93 billion, signaling heightened transaction flows and renewed investor participation. Historically, spikes in on-chain volume have coincided with critical turning points, either fueling further breakouts or marking the start of consolidations. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether Ethereum extends its bullish trajectory or enters a cooling-off phase. Ethereum Heads Toward 2021 Levels Amid Market Uncertainty With ETH trading above $4,400 after setting a local high at $4,792, market participants are watching closely as the asset approaches its former peak. The question now is whether Ethereum will mirror its explosive rallies of the past or pause for a consolidation before making a sustained breakout. On-chain data reinforces the bullish narrative. Ethereum’s on-chain volume has surged to nearly $12.9 billion, putting it close to the $16 billion peak recorded in 2021. This growing transactional activity highlights both renewed market participation and strengthening fundamentals. Historically, such spikes in on-chain activity have accompanied major upward phases, reflecting not just speculation but also deeper network utility. The broader market context adds weight to the discussion. Bitcoin appears to be entering its final bull phase move, typically a period that determines whether capital begins to rotate heavily into altcoins. Many analysts believe this could mark the beginning of altseason, with Ethereum leading the charge. At the same time, supply dynamics remain highly favorable. Exchange balances are shrinking, while OTC reserves dry up, signaling institutional accumulation. This tightening supply picture could amplify any bullish breakout. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH SOPR-7d Signals Healthy Demand: Market Absorbs Selling Pressure Weekly Chart Analysis: Key Levels To Hold Ethereum’s weekly chart highlights a decisive bullish breakout, with ETH trading at $4,425 after reaching a peak of $4,792, just below its all-time high from 2021. This rally represents one of the strongest weekly moves in years, fueled by consistent buying momentum and tightening supply conditions. Price action shows ETH has broken above long-term moving averages, with the 50-week SMA at $2,771, 100-week SMA at $2,761, and the 200-week SMA at $2,442 now far below current levels. This positioning confirms a strong uptrend structure, suggesting ETH has firmly transitioned into bullish territory after a prolonged consolidation phase. The current resistance remains the psychological $4,800–$5,000 zone, which aligns with the 2021 all-time high. A sustained breakout above this level would open the path toward uncharted territory, with analysts pointing to possible targets between $5,500 and $6,000 if momentum continues. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility Hits 2-Year Low As 30-Day Range Tightens However, risks remain as ETH approaches these levels. Weekly candles show sharp upward extensions, raising the potential for short-term pullbacks. Still, as long as ETH holds above $4,200–$4,300 support, the structure remains bullish.

The Nasdaq-listed distributor (WGRX) has announced that its new platform enables independent pharmacies to pay for drug inventory and move funds instantly, bypassing banking delays and high credit card fees. Integrated with RxERP, a serialized pharmaceutical e-commerce and enterprise resource planning system, the program promises real-time tracking, lower costs, and direct settlement between pharmacies and distributors. Pharmacies can now enroll in the beta version of the program. The system is built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), an open-source blockchain with core development led by Ripple Labs. With a network of more than 6,500 pharmacies and 200 manufacturers, Wellgistics is one of the first healthcare companies to launch an XRPL payment solution at scale. Chief Executive Brian Norton said pharmacy owners have embraced the initiative, calling them more forward-thinking on blockchain than many in the industry assume. The program enables pharmacies to settle invoices over XRPL, though Wellgistics has not disclosed whether participants must hold XRP directly or use fiat-to-XRP conversions for settlement. The program was designed to meet strict compliance standards, including HIPAA and anti-money laundering requirements. After the pharmacy rollout, Wellgistics plans to extend the platform to manufacturers and test direct-to-patient programs, allowing medications to be shipped from drugmakers directly to patients under physician oversight. The initiative builds on a May 8 announcement that Wellgistics intends to use XRP not just for payments but also as a treasury reserve asset. That plan is backed by a $50 million equity line of credit, which management said would support programmable liquidity and on-demand financial infrastructure across its healthcare network. Founded as Wellgistics LLC in 2016, the company was acquired by Danam Health in September 2024 before being spun off through an initial public offering in February 2025. Today, Wellgistics Health operates as a standalone Nasdaq-listed entity, providing wholesale distribution, prescription routing, and AI-powered hub services to pharmacies nationwide. Shares have dropped more than 80% since the February debut. They closed Tuesday at $0.62, down 7%, before rising to $0.65 in after-hours trading. By linking pharmacy payments to the XRP Ledger while preparing to hold XRP on its balance sheet, Wellgistics is positioning itself as both a user and financial backer of the blockchain. The dual-pronged approach marks a rare instance of a publicly traded healthcare company integrating crypto into both operations and treasury management.",Finance|XRP|XRP Treasury|XRP Ledger|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|WALLET|BLOCKCHAIN|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-16 11:00:44

Ripple’s application to become a bank isn’t a pivot. It’s the end game they’ve been building towards for the last 10 years.” Ripple’s Banking Ambitions This claim is backed by fact. Ripple has filed paperwork with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) seeking a national trust bank charter. This move would bring the company under direct federal supervision. XRP ENDGAME LEAKED!!! pic.twitter.com/Oa9IAvKo9U — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) August 15, 2025 If approved, the license would allow Ripple to act not only as a payments facilitator but as a regulated custodian, lender, and financial intermediary. The company has also signaled that its longer-term goals include Federal Reserve access and clearer oversight of its stablecoin, RLUSD. CryptoSensei argues this marks a profound shift: “If Ripple is a bank, they’re not just moving money. They’re holding it, lending it, clearing it, settling it, and tokenizing it. They become the neutral layer between every institution in the system, which means XRP’s demand isn’t just speculative, but structural in its entire system.” Structural Demand for XRP For years, XRP has been viewed primarily as a speculative asset. But Ripple’s potential banking status could transform that narrative. By controlling custody, settlement, and tokenization infrastructure, the company would be well-positioned to integrate XRP into the financial system’s underlying machinery. “End game very well may be Ripple banking license,” CryptoSensei explained. “What they do from that could set the tone for XRP’s price over the next decade.” Ripple’s ongoing development of cross-border settlement products, tokenized asset frameworks, and its stablecoin offering strengthens the case that XRP could evolve into a utility-driven asset, tied to institutional adoption rather than retail speculation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Regulatory Pushback Still, Ripple’s path to becoming a bank is far from guaranteed. The Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA) and other advocacy groups have filed objections, warning that granting bank charters to crypto firms could sidestep consumer protections and introduce systemic risks. These challenges ensure the OCC’s review process will be both lengthy and politically charged. Looking Ahead For CryptoSensei, the stakes are deeply personal: “I figured I’m at the right place at the right time, understanding what the future holds for Ripple and XRP. And I think a lot of you care deeply about what this future is going to look like.” Whether Ripple secures its license or faces regulatory roadblocks, the outcome could shape not just the company’s direction but also XRP’s role in global finance for the next decade.

Chalom highlighted the rapid progress of the strategy, stating the firm had scaled its ETH position “in a highly accretive manner.” However, revenue for Q2 2025 fell 30% year-over-year, sliding from $1.0 million to $0.7 million, while gross profit stood at just $0.2 million. Losses were driven by an $87.8 million non-cash impairment on liquid staked ETH, a requirement under U.S. GAAP to mark down assets at their lowest traded value—$2,300 per ETH during the quarter. Despite these accounting losses, SharpLink stressed that no ETH had been sold or redeemed, underscoring its commitment to a long-term Ethereum treasury model. Market Impact and Ethereum’s Price Outlook Following the announcement, SharpLink’s shares fell 15% to $19.85, while Ethereum showed heightened volatility. In the broader market, futures liquidations reached $169 million in the past 24 hours, reflecting ongoing caution among investors.

So, what's the next move? pic.twitter.com/mmEVD9knN0 — Nic (@nicrypto) August 16, 2025 Analysts suggest SharpLink’s ETH-heavy strategy highlights a high-risk, high-reward model. While large ETH reserves and staking yields provide long-term upside, they have yet to offset near-term revenue declines and impairment-driven losses. Ethereum is being tested. Technicals say support at $4,100, if it fails that’s $3,500. If it holds above $4,350 it’s a green light for higher. Ethereum Technical Analysis: Key Levels to Watch Ethereum price prediction is bullish as ETH is currently trading near $4,405, consolidating within an ascending channel that underscores its bullish longer-term structure. The 50-period SMA at $4,379 and channel support between $4,350–$4,400 form a critical demand zone. A rebound here could validate continuation toward $4,785, with the upper channel boundary extending near the psychological $5,000 mark. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Support: $4,350–$4,400 zone; deeper floor at $4,170 Resistance: $4,785 followed by $5,000 RSI: 44, recovering from oversold levels MACD: Negative but weakening, signaling fading bearish pressure Traders may look for a bullish engulfing candle above $4,450 as confirmation of renewed upside momentum. A sustained breakout could accelerate Ethereum’s path toward $5,000. However, a close below $4,170 risks invalidating the channel, opening downside targets toward $3,950.

50178504,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78695,1755342918,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Is Moving Against the Market,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-is-moving-against-the-market/,"Cryptocurrency enthusiast Jack The Rippler shared a post on X stating, “XRP IS MOVING AGAINST THE MARKET!” The post was accompanied by a market snapshot showing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP . In the image already deleted by the crypto proponent, Bitcoin was listed at $117,719.73 with a 24-hour decline of 0.94% and a market capitalization of $2.34 trillion. Ethereum was shown at $4,455.30 with a decline of 3.86% and a market capitalization of $537.85 billion. XRP, however, displayed an increase of 1.44% over the same period, trading at $3.152 with a market capitalization of $187.53 billion. The figures in the post highlight a clear divergence. While Bitcoin and Ethereum recorded losses during the 24 hours, XRP’s value went up. This type of movement is considered significant because it shows that XRP managed to attract buying interest at a time when the broader market trend is negative. Contributing Factors Behind the Move Although the post pointed to the numbers, several underlying factors discussed by analysts may help explain why XRP has shown relative strength. On-chain data has recently indicated that XRP holdings on centralized exchanges have declined to monthly lows. This reduction in available supply can lessen immediate selling pressure, allowing modest demand to influence price more directly. Another contributing factor has been activity following heavy liquidations across the crypto market. XRP, like many assets, experienced sharp declines during a recent liquidation wave. Market watchers suggest that late-session accumulation after such declines can create upward momentum in selected assets, particularly those considered liquid and widely traded. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Macro conditions also remain influential. Data showing stronger-than-expected inflation has placed pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, by lowering expectations of near-term interest rate cuts. This environment has weighed on Bitcoin and Ethereum, but has not prevented XRP from holding firm in the most recent session. XRP Moves Against the Tide The market snapshot included in the post shows that XRP gained ground while the largest two cryptocurrencies fell. This dynamic underpins the statement shared by Jack The Rippler. The divergence does not necessarily point to a long-term shift, but it highlights XRP’s ability to perform independently of broader market conditions in certain windows.

Riding the wave of institutional adoption, Ethereum’s momentum is attracting serious attention, not just from traders, but from big banks too. Meanwhile, Arbitrum’s technical setup hints at a potential breakout, and Unilabs Finance is making waves as an AI-powered DeFi asset manager poised to disrupt the market. Continue reading this article to find out more about these leading projects. Standard Chartered Lifts Ethereum Forecast to $7,500 by 2025 The ETH price is rising toward new all-time highs, with the coin presently trading around $4,700. This marks a gain of more than 50% in the last month alone, putting it among the top-performing cryptocurrencies. Standard Chartered Bank has taken note of this movement. Their analyst, Geoff Kendrick, just raised his ETH price forecast upward. The bank now expects that the ETH price will reach $7,500 by the end of 2025, up from its earlier estimate of $4,000. Even more optimistic is their long-term vision, which includes an ETH price estimate of $25,000 by 2028, more than doubling their earlier projection of $7,500. This higher adjustment comes as institutional investors pump record amounts of money into Ethereum. According to Standard Chartered data, Ethereum treasury firms and spot ETFs have acquired around 3.8% of all ETH in circulation since early June. This accumulation is 2x as fast as the fastest pace recorded during a comparable Bitcoin buying era, indicating a rising institutional preference for Ethereum, pushing the ETH price upwards. Arbitrum’s ARB Holds Steady After 23% Weekly Gains Arbitrum’s recent decline has pushed it close to the support zone identified by experts earlier this week. According to CryptoPulse, the $0.51-$0.52 level was the breakout point during the previous rise, making it an important retest zone currently. According to the latest market data, the Arbitrum price has dropped to $0.5158, up 1.9% on the day, following 23% gains in the previous week. This zone is more than simply a technical number. It shows a battle line between bulls seeking continuation and sellers trying to control. The next few sessions will indicate whether Arbitrum buyers are strong enough to protect it. A hold here would legitimize the breakthrough and open the path to $0.90 in the short term. Bitcoinsensus also reported a confirmed double-bottom breakthrough on Arbitrum’s daily chart. If this pattern continues, it will strengthen the bullish case for higher targets. The initial stop would be $0.7747, but stronger momentum might push Arbitrum to $1.23 and $1.70. Unilabs Finance Raises $32M in AUM: Here’s What’s Fueling It! As the altcoin market picks up pace following the ETH price spike to reach its ATH at $5,000, other altcoins like Arbitrum and Unilabs Finance are also seeing a surge in their momentum. Unilabs Finance is the world’s first AI-based asset management protocol that aims to automate the investment process through its highly advanced AI-backed features. Unilabs offers its users AI-powered tools and features that can help users grow their portfolios conveniently. Despite being at early stages of development, Unilabs Finance has more than $32 million in assets under management (AUM), consisting of four AI-backed funds: BTC, AI, Mining, and RWA funds. Each of these funds caters to a different investor pool, making this platform a place that has something in store for every investor out there. Taking one step ahead, Unilabs Finance is also offering a unique system named as Early Access Scoring System (EASS). This system scrutinizes new projects in the market on different parameters like credibility, team backing, tokenomics, technology, and signals to investors when to enter its market. This lets them capture the right opportunity at the right time. Experts claim that Unilabs Finance can experience a massive surge in this altcoin season, owing to its AI-utility. It is currently in its presale phase, offering each UNIL token are available for only $0.0097, with the price surging to $0.01 in the next stage, delivering 20% gains. The presale has already raised over $13M in funding from investors all around the world. As per the market experts, now is the perfect opportunity to join Unilabs Finance and become one of its early investors, which comes with its own set of multiple perks.

Coinbase saw a 82.6% monthly volume jump, but slipped to ninth place. DEX platforms gained market share as CEX trading slowed in Q2. Binance Leads the Global Crypto Spot Market in July 2025 In July 2025, cryptocurrency exchange Binance maintained its first-place position in the spot market among centralized exchanges (CEX) with a market share of 39.8%. Trading volume on the platform increased by 61.4% compared to June, rising from $432.6 billion to $698.3 billion, according to a CoinGecko report . MEXC ranked second with an 8.6% market share and $150.4 billion in trading volume, up 61.8% from $93 billion in June. Gate took third place with a 7.8% market share and a trading volume of $137.2 billion, an increase of 61.3% month-on-month. The remaining exchanges in the top 10 control 43.8% of the market. The share of platforms ranked fourth to tenth is distributed relatively evenly, each holding between 5% and 7%. “ Coinbase has slowly lost market share throughout 2025, having started the year with a 7.0% dominance, it has since fallen to just 5.8% in July . This makes it the ninth-largest exchange, with just over $101.7 billion in trading volume in July. However, the US-based exchange did experience the largest MoM growth among the top 10, with volumes climbing +82.6% from $55.7 billion in June to $101.7 billion in July,” CoinGecko analysts note. Second Quarter Results At the end of the second quarter, the total spot trading volume on the top 10 centralized exchanges amounted to $3.9 trillion. This is 27.7% less than the first quarter’s figure of $5.4 trillion. Binance led Q2 with a 38% market share. The platform processed $1.47 trillion in transactions, although trading volume was down 21.6% from Q1, when it reached $2 trillion. Seven of the top ten exchanges saw a decline in trading volume during the second quarter. Crypto.com experienced the largest drop (-61.4%), as its trading volume fell from $560.2 billion in the first quarter to $216.4 billion in the second. Only three exchanges showed quarter-on-quarter growth: MEXC (+3.7%), HTX (+5.4%), and Bitget (+3%). Market Dynamics The increase in trading volumes in July was driven by overall bullish santeminet in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin reached historical highs, which attracted new participants. Despite July’s growth, the overall trend in the second quarter indicates a decline in trader activity on centralized exchanges. Market participants are increasingly turning to decentralized exchanges (DEX), which expanded their share as CEX volumes declined.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-16 11:19:36

But the biggest gains are rarely found in the heavyweights. Right now, Layer Brett ($LBRETT), a small-cap contender, is emerging as the market’s 100x candidate. With a tokenomics structure built for scarcity, staking rewards that crush industry averages, and a loyal community that’s growing rapidly, $LBRETT is drawing market attention with its robust fundamentals. Here’s why the Layer Brett presale is gaining momentum, making it impossible for sharp investors to ignore. Layer Brett (LBRETT): the next 100x meme coin Layer Brett isn’t just about meme coins’ hype but a Layer 2 Ethereum scaling solution built for speed, scalability, and low cost, positioning it for sustainable, explosive growth. The token’s ultra-low starting market cap, capped supply, and high-APY staking pool position it as a generational opportunity. Tokenomics are a big part of LBRETT’s 100x thesis. The supply is limited to 10B, sidestepping the inflationary trap that strangles giants like DOGE and SHIB. Equally alluring are its industry-leading staking rewards of up to 40,000%, making LBRETT an unparalleled income-generating asset. That encourages long-term holding, giving the token price ample time to rise as the Layer Brett ecosystem expands through planned Layer-2 integrations, NFT marketplaces, and community-driven governance. This far, LBRETT’s momentum is undeniable: social buzz is snowballing, tokens are selling like hotcakes, and early whales are positioning heavily before the project explodes in the open market. Crypto analysts are already praising $LBRETT as the best crypto investment of 2025, with conservative projections showing the meme coin could deliver explosive gains north of 100x! Solana (SOL) is pushing toward $200 Solana has been gaining bullish steam, rallying from yearly lows of $96 to revisit the $190 zone. In the past month, SOL gained over 15%, bringing its yearly yields above 35%. While that may seem modest, it’s impressive for a mega-cap asset with a market cap above $100B. The Solana community sentiment stands at 85% bullish, and analysts’ price predictions are fueling the optimism. One forecast from FXStreet sees SOL rallying to $300 by Q1 2026, while Coinpedia projects a similar $300 breakout in this cycle. For investors seeking stability, SOL offers reliability. But for those chasing mammoth returns, LBRETT’s exponential growth potential of low-cap players like LBRETT is hard to beat. Ethereum price returns to 2021 levels The Ethereum price has staged an epic comeback, surging from April lows of $1,386 to above $4,600. ETH is up more than 70% year-on-year, with over 40% gains in just the past month. This momentum is fueled by recent network upgrades improving scalability and lowering transaction fees, alongside a surge in DeFi and NFT activity. Analysts have now turned aggressively bullish on ETH: DigitalCoinPrice projects ETH might push past its 2021 ATH to $5,200 in early 2026, while Finder’s expert pane l sees it reaching $5,500 within the next 12 months. With a $560B market cap, ETH remains attractive for stability. But for 100x gains, crypto whales are turning to $LBRETT. Grab your LBRETT share Solana and Ethereum are proving their strength, delivering steady gains and reinforcing their status as market leaders. But history shows the largest fortunes in crypto come from spotting tomorrow’s giants before they become household names. With its capped supply, lucrative staking, and meme virality, Layer Brett offers a rare asymmetric opportunity in a market crowded with overvalued assets. Investors seeking a moonshot are strongly advised to explore the Layer Brett presale and load up at the dirt-cheap price of $0.0042. don’t miss your shot at the next 100x crypto!

Known as the “novel activities” supervision program, it was launched in 2023 to monitor emerging financial technologies more closely. Now, those responsibilities will be absorbed into the Fed’s standard supervisory process. This change shows the Fed feels better equipped to evaluate crypto-related risks , including services like stablecoins, digital asset custody, and tokenization, without needing a separate framework. Instead of requiring heightened scrutiny, these activities will now be reviewed like any other banking operations. The move is part of a larger rollback of regulatory barriers this year. In April, the Fed, FDIC, and OCC dropped rules requiring banks to seek pre-approval for crypto services. Then in June, the Fed removed “reputational risk” as a factor in how banks are judged—shifting the focus to concrete financial concerns.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently priced at $0.035 in presale stage 6. Early adopters of the project will realize a minimum of 400% profit when MUTM is listed and is available for trade in the open market. Mutuum Finance has already exceeded $14.45 million in sales and has over 15250 token buyers. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) can rebuild the value behind these digital assets. Dogecoin (DOGE): Meme Giant, But Lacks Utility Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at approximately $0.2488 and still dominates the meme coin space with its gigantic market cap, huge community base, and ongoing merchant adoption, all of which allow it to remain relatively stable and in focus in the longer term. However, lack of concrete use cases still makes it a high-risk play as compared to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The utility coin innovates within the DeFi market giving a stronger bull run outlook. Mutuum Finance Enters Presale Stage 6 Mutuum Finance is performing exceptionally well in presale. The project is at $0.035 as stage 6 gains momentum. Mutuum Finance is transforming the face of DeFi by creating a platform with real-world real-use cases. The presale has been able to acquire more than 15250 token holders with a deposit of more than $14.45 million. $100K Worth of Tokens to Be Won Mutuum Finance also organized a $100,000 giveaway . There will be 10 winners and they will receive a prize of $10,000 in Mutuum Finance tokens. The giveaway is one of the indications that the project truly aims to have a long-term and a loyal community. Further step towards transparency and security, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has initiated an Official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. The project team will be rewarding the participants with up to $50,000 USDT for bug detection in the project. The bounty program aims to get good coverage for every vulnerability class. The four vulnerability classes are used in the program to divide it, depending on the severity of the vulnerabilities, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. Mutuum Finance is a P2P as well as a P2C lending protocol. It is an end-to-end DeFi experience to precisely meet the need of the consumers and comparatively safer, transparent, and diversified compared to traditional centralized finance products. High-Performance Lending Protocol Mutuum Finance is a top-rated DeFi protocol where assets are in sole control of the users. It is a two-model lending protocol that is rendering lending and borrowing extremely efficient and flexible like Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models. Peer-to-Contract is a smart automatic contract where no human gets involved at any stage. Peer-to-Peer model lacks an intermediary and hence lenders are directly interfaced with borrowers. Dogecoin (DOGE) can keep all the meme coin hype, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making noise with genuine real-world DeFi use case and exponential growth potential. Priced at $0.035 in presale stage 6, MUTM has already generated $14.45M from 15,250 purchasers, with beta investors expecting 400%+ returns at launch. Backed by a 95.0 CertiK trust score, a $100K token airdrop, and a high-performance lending protocol, MUTM is poised for a strong launch. Secure your allocation today before the next price run.

Analysts say the decision reflects US regulatory changes and Trump’s softer crypto stance. SEC dropped probes and Treasury explores a national crypto reserve under new policies. The US Federal Reserve System (Fed) has announced the end of its program for monitoring banking operations related to cryptocurrencies and fintech. Launched in August 2023, the initiative evaluated the risks banks faced when working with deposits, payments, and loans involving companies in the digital asset sector. In its latest notice, the Fed stated that the insights gained during the program would now be integrated into the standard bank supervision process. The separate letter that established this oversight system has been repealed. Analysts point out that this decision does not necessarily signal a relaxation of requirements but does reflect a shift in US policy. The Donald Trump administration has shown a more lenient attitude regarding digital asset regulation. Since January 2025, the SEC has dropped several investigations into cryptocurrency companies, and the Treasury Department is considering creating a national cryptocurrency reserve. The Fed is also experiencing personnel changes. Board of Governors member Adriana Kugler resigned on August 8, and Stephen Miran, head of the Council of Economic Advisers, has been appointed as interim successor until a permanent candidate is selected in January. Experts believe this move is intended to bolster the administration’s influence over the institution. Analysts note that the topic of the Fed's leadership has long been politically sensitive.

50179706,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=785299,1755344272,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50179706.jpeg,"SEC disclosure reveals Ripple, SEC settlement still pending court approval",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ripple-settlement-pending-court-approval/,"The settlement between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and San Francisco-based Ripple Labs is still awaiting court approval. Defense lawyer James Filan disclosed this on X, citing an SEC filing. According to Filan , the regulator has filed a status report on the matter at the court of appeals. The status report stated that parties have filed a joint stipulation of dismissal of their appeals, but the dismissal is still pending. The status report reads: “The parties have filed a joint stipulation of dismissal of the Commission’s appeal (No. 24-2648) and Appellee-Cross-Appellant Ripple Labs, Inc.’s cross-appeal (No. 24-2705), with each party to bear its own costs and fees. No. 24-2648Dkt. No. 64, 68, 69. The joint stipulation of dismissal remains pending.” The filing dated August 15 adds a new twist to the SEC and Ripple case, which now seems to be going on forever. What does this disclosure mean? While many have raised this new disclosure as a sign that the five-year legal drama over XRP’s status might not be fully over, observers believe it is not necessarily true. One comment pointed out that the filing only shows that the SEC v Ripple case is not over legally, even though it is over in principle. The approval only represents a formality, but it is still necessary for the court of appeals to dismiss the appeal. Interestingly, the debate on whether the court needs to do anything after the SEC and Ripple agreed to settle the case has been raging in the XRP community before now. Commentators also argued that the district court did not need to approve any settlement, while others noted that the case status on the court website has yet to reflect the dismissal and closure. It now appears the procedural step is necessary to bring full legal closure to the case. Meanwhile, the question remains when the Court of Appeal will approve the dismissal and whether Judge Analisa Torres of the District Court still needs to approve the settlement. So far, it has been a week since the Joint Stipulation of Dismissal was filed on August 7. However, the District Court Judge has no say in this, given that she has already refused to approve an initial settlement allowing Ripple to waive the $125 million fine and an injunction against institutional sales of XRP. Under the new settlement, the ruling on fines and the injunction stands, but the SEC has already removed the bad actor designation from Ripple, allowing the company to raise money in the private financial markets, effectively bypassing the court injunction. XRP sees slight gains amid market correction Meanwhile, XRP investors do not see the recent SEC filing as a big deal, as many now consider the case settled and over. This reflects in the token price performance, with XRP up 1.54% in the past 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap. Its performance within that period sharply contrasts with the rest of the market, given that other major cap tokens have fallen in value. Bitcoin , Ether, Solana, and BNB have all declined today. However, XRP’s performance over the past week and month is worse than that of these assets. At $3.14, the token is down 5.87% in seven days and 3.92% in 30 days, remaining far off from its peak of $3.64 within the period. Despite this short-term drop in value, XRP remains one of the best-performing crypto assets this year. It is up 35.34% so far in 2025, beating out almost every major cap altcoin, including ETH. TRON Network TRX and Hyperliquid HYPE are the top ten cryptocurrencies performing better than XRP this year.

A few lesser-known options now show hints of the same growth. Quiet trading and new ideas sometimes hide the biggest gains. Six little-known coins seem set for a breakout. Readers will find out which names could give a small investment the chance to multiply. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.005 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges MYX: The Cross-Chain Power Token Set to Ride the Next Crypto Wave MYX sits at the heart of a new trading hub. The platform lets users buy and sell “perps,” deals that never expire, right on the chain. Its Matching Pool Mechanism lines up orders so no one suffers slippage, even in wild moves. Up to 50× leverage is on tap when traders post USDC. MYX hops across BNB Chain, Arbitrum, opBNB, and Linea, linking them through a peer-to-pool-to-peer path. Tens of millions now rest in the pools, and total volume already runs into the billions. The surge in cross-chain support lit a spark under MYX this year. While many tokens still chase lost highs, MYX found new buyers and fresh uses. Its tight pricing and deep pools set it apart from older perp coins like GMX or dYdX, which live on single chains. If the market keeps warming, traders may look for speed, scale, and simple costs; MYX ticks those boxes. With growing fees flowing back to holders, the coin looks well placed for the next cycle leg. SOON: The Fast Lane Token Rushing Into the Next Bull Run SOON powers the Super Adoption Stack, a family of speedy side roads built on Solana tech. These roads let different chains swap data and coins in seconds, even when traffic is heavy. Users spend SOON to cover tolls, vote on upgrades, lock it up for extra yield, and earn gifts from new apps. The mint started at roughly one billion coins, and fresh tokens trickle in at about three percent a year. Big players took early notice; tens of millions flowed into the project, and daily trade often tops eight figures, giving SOON a value in the high nine-digit range. That mix of busy markets, clear purpose, and modest inflation makes SOON stand out. Many rivals, like Optimism or Arbitrum, chase speed too, but few link chains while staying inside the Solana world. If layer-two systems gain favor this cycle, a coin that fuels several of them may shine. Active unlock schedules add near-term supply, yet they also spread coins to builders and users who can grow the stack. For traders hunting fresh momentum after Bitcoin’s surge, SOON offers a blend of proven demand and upside tied to real network growth. TROLL Token: From Internet Joke to Market Wildcard TROLL began as a playful nod to online mischief. It is a pure meme coin, steered by its fans and launched without any built-in purpose. Copies live on many chains, with Ethereum and Solana the busiest homes. The original creators burned their keys, so no one can tinker with the code. Each version trades on its own, so prices swing. Some sit at only a few million dollars in value, while others touch almost two hundred million. Fast jumps of 50 % or more have appeared in a single week, showing how quick mood can flip. The charm lies in its rebel spirit. Without a leader, the crowd writes the story through memes, chats, and sudden buys. The coin’s place on many chains also keeps doors open to new users and trading pools. In a market that craves fresh jokes after the rise of Doge, Shiba, and Pepe, TROLL feels on brand. If crypto enthusiasm heats up again, a cheap entry price and viral edge could spark the next rush. Of course, the same thin rulebook that fuels gains can fuel drops. For traders hunting high energy and internet fun, TROLL may be one of the louder plays this cycle. SIREN: The Mythic Gateway to DIY Crypto Options SIREN lets anyone build and trade crypto options without handing over their coins. The app lives on Ethereum, so it runs 24/7 and needs no middleman. Users lock up tokens to mint options, trade them like regular coins, then settle when they expire. Every deal is fully backed, so buyers and sellers see the outcome on-chain. The name lifts from Greek lore, and the team nods to AI ideas, giving the project a fresh story in the crowded Web3 sea. With a market cap around the low tens of millions, SIREN still feels early. Daily volumes match its value, showing real but not explosive use. That sets it apart from sleepy small caps and puts it closer to rising niches like GMX or DYDX, which also let traders keep control of funds. If the next bull wave favors do-it-yourself finance, a tool for simple options could shine. Still, growth depends on new users and clear token rewards, so watch adoption charts, not only price swings. ZORA: The Artist’s Highway on Ethereum’s Fast Lane ZORA lets makers turn art, music, or memes into tokens on the blockchain. It runs as a second layer on Ethereum, built with the OP Stack, so fees stay tiny and trades move fast. Since its 2021 launch, the team has added a phone app that lets anyone mint with a few taps. A link with the Base network now turns each post into a “content coin,” blending likes and shares with real value. Daily trade numbers stay strong, and the project’s worth already sits in the high nine figures. Many NFTs still live on slow, pricey chains, but ZORA cuts that pain. Its low fees and social twist could lure a fresh wave of creators just as crypto art shows signs of revival. Trading volumes on top marketplaces rose this quarter, and coins tied to culture, like AUDIO and LOOKS, have outpaced broader indexes. ZORA fits that theme yet keeps the security of Ethereum under the hood. If the market keeps shifting toward community tokens, the coin may look bright. Still, timing matters; sharp swings are normal in this part of the cycle. Conclusion MYX, SOON, TROLL, SIREN, SIREN shine. XYZVerse (XYZ) dominates: a sports meme coin eyeing 20,000% gains through presale buzz, community rule, GameFi plans, and media deals in the 2025 rally.

The share sales could be done at a raised company valuation to $500 billion, up from its current $300 billion. However, according to sources, discussions are still preliminary, meaning the deal value could change. Softbank is committed to leading a financing round Besides the possible share purchase, SoftBank agreed to front OpenAI’s $40 billion fundraising round, which has already drawn in $8.3 billion from investors. Moreover, according to sources , the Japanese firm had already struck a $1 billion deal to buy an employee’s shares before negotiations over the secondary valuation commenced. Representatives for Dragoneer, Thrive, and Softbank have yet to give an official statement on the secondary share sale. Nevertheless, all three firms are OpenAI backers. The share sale is set to provide more liquidity for OpenAI’s workers at a time when tech companies are poaching for AI talent. Tech giants such as Meta have been offering hefty compensation and benefits to pull in staffers from AI firms. Several employees, including ChatGPT co-creator Shengjia Zhao, have already left this year. For startups, employee share sales can be a great retention strategy, seeing that they can avoid going through an IPO or acquisition. Typically, sale offers extend to early investors looking to lighten their positions. However, in OpenAI’s case, only current and past employees with two or more years at the company are eligible. If a deal is finalized, the $500 billion price tag would rank OpenAI as the most valuable startup globally, surpassing SpaceX . The company estimates it could rake in nearly $13 billion in 2025, at least triple 2024’s earnings. OpenAI introduced its new GPT-5 model Just recently, OpenAI launched its new GPT-5 model. However, the model’s release drew criticism from analysts who found it less intuitive, leading the firm to reinstate GPT-4 for its paying customers. SoftBank Group founder and CEO Masayoshi Son and OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman recently emphasized the rising demand for AI-driven systems. The surge in interest is pushing AI companies to accelerate the development of advanced computing power. Speaking during a video conference at SoftBank World, industry leaders outlined strategies for weaving AI into business operations. Some participants noted that progress in AI could create more job opportunities. They also pointed to the benefits of developing robotics, calling it a potential game-changer that could kickstart a new cycle of self-sustaining innovation. Son and Altman held an in-depth discussion on AI, where Son questioned the diminishing returns of further expansion. Altman responded that lowering the cost of AI would drive higher adoption. He explained that if AI became ten times cheaper, demand could increase thirtyfold—or even more. The global appetite for AI is immense, the OpenAI CEO emphasized. The exchange occurred before an audience of Japanese entrepreneurs and industry leaders, with the central theme revolving around self-propagating innovation.

As prices jump, new names keep popping up, catching the eye of those looking for fast gains. The spotlight now turns to XYZVerse, which is generating excitement and rumors online. Could this coin be the next big winner? Discover what sets it apart in the latest rush for fortune. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $15 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.005. At the next 14th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.01, meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Polkadot Bridges Blockchains and Could Spark the Next Crypto Wave Polkadot, or DOT, lets different blockchains talk to each other. It was built by Gavin Wood and went live in May 2020. Its smart design uses many small chains, called parachains, to boost speed. This makes DOT handle far more deals per second than Bitcoin or Ethereum. Holders also guide the network and lock up tokens to keep it safe. The market now hunts for coins that solve real problems. DOT stands out because it links chains instead of fighting them. As more projects roll out parachains, demand for DOT may rise. Compared with older coins that rely on one crowded chain, DOT looks lean and ready. Prices have lagged after the last boom, so some traders view it as a delayed play with room to catch up if the next bull run favors useful tech over hype. Still, growth depends on new apps choosing the network. Avalanche: The Quick, Green Route to Web3 Growth Avalanche, or AVAX, is a fresh take on blockchain. It works fast, handling about 4,500 deals every second and finishing each one in under two seconds. Fees stay tiny, and the system is gentle on energy use. The network splits work across three linked chains, so sending coins, running apps, and keeping rules never slow each other down. Builders can also spin up their own mini blockchains, called Subnets, tuned for games, DeFi, or private use. AVAX is the fuel that keeps all this moving; people spend it to send money, lock it in to guard the network, and power those custom chains. Speed and green design make Avalanche stand out in today’s market. Bitcoin crawls at seven moves a second, and even the new Ethereum is far slower and costs more when crowds pile in. Big brands hunting for low-cost, low-carbon rails are starting to notice. As the cycle turns risk-on, coins with clear use, staking rewards, and room for apps often lead early. AVAX fits that mold, and its price still sits well below past highs, leaving space for upside if builders keep launching Subnets and user numbers rise. Chainlink: The Trusted Bridge Bringing Real-World Data to Blockchains Chainlink, also called LINK, lets blockchains talk to the outside world. It uses many small helpers, called oracles, to pull numbers, prices, and weather from the web. First, an oracle gets the data. Next, the network checks many answers to pick the best one. Last, the result lands inside a smart contract. A public score shows which oracles tell the truth, so bad actors lose work. LINK tokens pay and reward these helpers. People can also lock up LINK as a pledge, making the system honest and strong. This steady flow of clean data matters more than ever. DeFi loans, game items, and even insurance apps all need live facts, not guesses. While many coins chase hype, LINK sells a clear service every day, much like water in a busy city. In past cycles, LINK held up better than most rivals when markets fell, thanks to real demand for data. As new chains launch and need bridges, use of LINK could grow again. For long-term fans of useful tech, LINK still looks like a solid pick this round. BNB: The Busy Bee Token Buzzing Through Binance Lands BNB came to life in June 2017 and first lived on Ethereum. Today it moves freely on both Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain. People use it to pay trading fees, send money, and launch new tokens. The chains use a mix of staking and trusted leaders to run smart contracts, so holders can earn extra coins by locking theirs up. Every three months, Binance burns part of the supply, aiming to cut the original 200 million coins in half and lift each coin’s worth. Many big coins rose fast this year, yet network fees on Bitcoin and Ethereum still scare small users. BNB avoids that pain with quick moves and tiny costs, so activity stays high even when markets cool. Add fee cuts on Binance.com and growing support from games, travel sites, and shops, and you get steady daily demand. While meme coins grab headlines, BNB pairs a clear plan with real income from chain use. If the wider market keeps turning up, a shrinking supply and busy ecosystem could make BNB one of the cycle’s stronger plays. Conclusion DOT, AVAX, LINK, and BNB look strong for the 2025 bull run, yet XYZVerse aims for 20,000% gains, making XYZ the standout chance for life-changing returns.

50180428,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/xrp-ada-and-ltc-developments-price-predictions-and-comparison/,1755345600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50180428.jpeg,"XRP, ADA and LTC: Developments, Price Predictions and Comparison",https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/xrp-ada-and-ltc-developments-price-predictions-and-comparison/,"With sentiment turning toward an expected altcoin season that could rival the historic surges of previous cycles, the 2025 cryptocurrency market is heating up. With their own catalysts and price targets, established tokens like Litecoin (LTC), Cardano (ADA), and XRP are once again in the spotlight . Even so, seasoned investors are increasingly diversifying into smaller, high-upside plays that aim to increase their gains , even as these heavyweights garner attention. One such venture, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has become a leading contender for individuals looking for a mix between the excitement of large returns and the security of established stability. XRP: Adoption is fueled by legal clarity XRP is in a great position during 2025 because of regulatory clarity. Deeper integrations in the global payments space are now possible thanks to Ripple’s successful court ruling following years of legal disputes. Through banking partnerships in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, the token is already becoming more widely used, facilitating quicker and less expensive cross-border settlements. The growth of RippleNet, which currently handles billions of transactions every month, further boosts market confidence. A bullish technical setup is supported by this infrastructure expansion, as XRP consolidates above important support zones. Price prediction: During a typical altcoin rally, analysts anticipate that XRP will retest its $3.50–$4.00 range . Regaining its all-time high close to $3.84 and moving toward $4.50 is feasible in a high-liquidity breakout scenario, but this would need significant market-wide momentum. Finding smaller-cap opportunities that can provide exponential upside without sacrificing portfolio balance is a challenge for traders holding blue-chip altcoins like XRP. Herein lies the role of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Due to a combination of on-chain growth, rapid presale sellouts , and macro tailwinds, analysts are predicting an 80x return on investment during the upcoming altcoin season. With wallet counts increasing weekly and social metrics rising steadily, the project’s community engagement has been outstanding. The roadmap’s features are intended to sustain demand long after its initial exchange listings, with an emphasis on creating long-lasting utility rather than just hype. Investors can strategically capture both stability and potentially life-changing returns in the same market cycle by combining a foundational asset like XRP with a measured risk in MAGACOIN FINANCE. Cardano (ADA): Systematic advancement in scaling Cardano has established a reputation for meticulous execution and academic rigor. Although this strategy has occasionally postponed updates that would have affected the market, it has produced a robust ecosystem that still draws interest from developers and institutions. Its Hydra scaling upgrade, which could significantly increase transaction throughput and reduce costs, is moving closer to full implementation in 2025. DeFi activity is also increasing in the ADA ecosystem, as evidenced by TVL (total value locked) hitting multi-month highs . With this growth, Cardano may be able to take on Ethereum and Solana more forcefully in the decentralized application market. Price prediction: Given Hydra’s performance and the robust altcoin season tailwind, ADA may target the $3.10–$3.50 range , with bullish extremes potentially reaching $4.00 if market sentiment peaks. Litecoin (LTC): The trustworthy workhorse One of the oldest cryptocurrencies is still Litecoin, which is well-known for its quickness, cheap fees, and steady uptake as a mode of payment. Its history of incorporating Bitcoin’s innovations first, such as SegWit and the Lightning Network, has allowed it to stay relevant in the face of more recent rivals. Due to its integration with significant payment processors, Litecoin’s use in international remittances and merchant payments is still growing in 2025. It is appealing for routine transfers due to its comparatively low transaction fees, especially in areas with weak banking infrastructure. Price prediction: LTC may return to the $250–$280 range during a normal altcoin rally. Regaining the $300–$320 range is feasible in a more aggressive bull scenario, particularly if adoption metrics pick up speed. Keeping high-upside plays and blue-chips in balance Even though XRP, ADA, and LTC are expected to do well in 2025, their upside potential is ultimately more quantifiable than that of smaller, more rapidly developing projects. To ensure the stability of established networks while maintaining exposure to enormous growth opportunities, many investors are deliberately combining established assets with up-and-coming altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the most anticipated contenders for the next altcoin season due to its anticipated 80x return on investment , quick presale momentum, and expanding on-chain presence. Combining the tenacity of XRP, ADA, and LTC with a strategic wager on MAGACOIN FINANCE may prove to be a winning formula for the upcoming year in a market where timing is crucial.

Here’s what’s driving attention to these assets — and why many see them as the Best Crypto to Buy Now. Solana Price Pushes Above $200 Amid ETF Developments Solana rose to nearly $214 before easing to $188 on Wednesday, marking its highest point since July 22. Data from CoinGecko shows the coin up over 35% in the past 7 days, fueled partly by DeFi Development Corp.’s $22 million purchase of 110,000 SOL. The company now holds over 1.42 million SOL valued at $273 million, staking much of it to validators for yield generation. While the SEC has again delayed decisions on Solana ETF filings from Bitwise and 21Shares to October, the discussions have kept the network in the spotlight. Other ETF applications from Grayscale, Fidelity, and ProShares remain pending. Despite the delay, institutional activity like DeFi Development Corp.’s accumulation reinforces Solana’s profile as one of the Best Crypto to Buy Now for those watching for long-term blockchain adoption and staking utility. XRP ETF Prospects Fuel Price Projections XRP trades around $3.11 today, but analyst Kenny Nguyen believes spot ETF approval could push prices between $22 and $50. Models from Canary Capital and others suggest first-month ETF inflows could exceed $5 billion, potentially lifting market cap toward $1.5 trillion. Unlike Ethereum, XRP has no staking rewards, removing opportunity costs for ETF investors. With multiple asset managers — including 21Shares, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton — awaiting SEC decisions, approval odds from Bloomberg analysts sit at 95%. Historical patterns from Bitcoin’s ETF launch suggest that such a development could attract significant institutional demand. For investors evaluating the Best Crypto to Buy Now, XRP’s payment-focused use case and strong ETF approval odds present a compelling case for attention ahead of October’s deadline. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale Nears Sellout MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale continues to move quickly, with demand accelerating ahead of expected exchange listings. Market watchers note that early access is running out as allocations are claimed rapidly. This pace has led many to consider MAGACOIN FINANCE among the Best Crypto to Buy Now, especially for those seeking presale entry before potential price discovery on exchanges. Key Takeaway Solana’s ETF discussions, XRP’s high-conviction ETF projections, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s fast-moving presale have placed all three firmly on market watchlists. As October ETF decisions approach, early positioning could be critical for those tracking the Best Crypto to Buy Now. You can learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE via the official website.

Traders on social feeds flagged the breakout-and-retest structure around ~$830 as the key springboard, with upside calls clustering near $900 if that level held. For real-time confirmation, the BNBUSDT chart shows the advance from the mid-$700s into new highs, with resistance bands still stacked above the prior peak. What the charts and feeds say about BNB now On the daily, BNB remains in a well-defined uptrend, printing higher lows and pressing prior resistance near $861–$880. TradingView idea streams and community charts still highlight $900 as a magnet if momentum persists, with subsequent supply pockets discussed in the $940–$1,000 area. If price slips, bulls are watching $800–$820 as first defense. Keep an eye on the live BNBUSDT chart and current community trade plans to gauge follow-through. Why some analysts still prefer RTX for asymmetric upside While BNB is a large-cap with strong liquidity, that size can compress percentage upside. Remittix (RTX), priced around $0.0895, offers a far lower entry point and a catalyst stack that growth-hunters prefer. The project focuses on PayFi—moving value from crypto to real bank accounts—so holders aren’t just betting on a logo, they’re betting on payments utility. Crucially, the team has stated it will reveal the first CEX listing when the raise hits $20M, a clear, near-term event that can translate attention into liquidity. You can verify the milestone on the official post. Start with the Remittix website for the product map and token details, then track day-to-day progress via Remittix on X and the team’s CEX-reveal milestone thread. These give you the only links that matter: product, progression, and the next catalyst. The catalyst math: BNB vs. RTX BNB : Trend is up, structure is healthy, and $900 remains the line market watchers care about. If it breaks and holds, the conversation pivots to four figures—but percentage returns from here may be incremental relative to small caps. Use the BNBUSDT chart to validate momentum rather than headlines. RTX : Near-term CEX reveal trigger at $20M raised, plus a Q3 wallet beta focused on real-world payments, creates a 1-2 punch of events. Add the low starting price and the utility narrative, and you get a cleaner asymmetry for those comfortable with earlier-stage risk. Check the official feed for timing cues. Bottom line BNB pushing for $900 is bullish and keeps the majors’ uptrend intact, but large-cap status often caps upside on a percentage basis. Remittix (RTX), sitting near $0.09, pairs a tangible utility story with a concrete funding-linked catalyst, making it an attractive easier entry for investors seeking multi-X potential alongside their BNB core.

The crypto custodian aims to become the third crypto company to list on a US exchange, following Coinbase in April 2021 and Bullish just last week. Gemini To Use Share Proceeds To Settle Debt To Galaxy, Others In documents dated August 15 , Gemini filed to list company shares on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker GEMI. This development comes two months after the crypto exchange initially announced plans for an IPO. Notably, the IPO price was excluded from this application, which included the proposed stock structure and plans for share net profits. The Gemini S-1 document stated plans to offer only shares of their Common Class A Stock on the Nasdaq exchange. For context, Gemini will issue two types of common stock after the IPO, i.e., Class A and Class B. Holders of Class A shares will be granted one vote per share, giving them a standard say in company decisions. By contrast, each Class B share will carry ten votes, providing its holders with significantly greater influence over corporate matters than those holding Class A stock. In this case, all new investors are expected to receive Class A shares and will collectively control only a limited percentage of Gemini’s total voting power. Meanwhile, co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss , along with their affiliates, will own all of the Class B stock, allowing the twins to retain majority control of the exchange. Upon receiving the net proceeds from the IPO, following expenses such as underwriting discounts and commissions, Gemini intends to use the funds primarily for general corporate purposes such as funding day-to-day operations, investing in new technology, etc. In addition to supporting operations and growth, Gemini also stated it may use part of the proceeds to repay existing debt obligations. These include loans under the Galaxy Lending Agreement and the Master Repurchase Agreement with NYDIG Funding LLC. Notably, the lead underwriters for the Gemini planned IPO are Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, who are responsible for coordinating the deal, setting the price range, and ensuring supply matches demand. Alongside them are other reputable investment firms such as Morgan Stanley, Cantor Fitzgerald, Evercore ISI, Mizuho Securities, etc. US Crypto Train Forges On In addition to Gemini, other crypto-focused firms seeking to go public include the exchange BitGo, and digital asset investment firm Grayscale. This wave of applications, among other factors, including the Bitcoin Reserve and recent stablecoin regulation, underlines the growing pro-crypto environment in the US. According to data from Tradingview, the total crypto market is valued at $3.93 trillion, reflecting a 0.47% gain in the past day.",Crypto News|BitGo|bullish|cameron and tyler winklevoss|coinbase|gemini|IPO|SEC,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-16 12:00:35

With technical indicators hinting at room for growth and resistance sitting at $3.64, the coming days could be pivotal for XRP’s price action. In this article, we’ll explore the coin’s near-term prospects, potential breakout scenarios, and how Outset PR ’s data-led PR strategies help crypto projects capture attention and engagement during critical market shifts. XRP Price on an Uptrend, Eyes Higher Levels Source: tradingview XRP's price currently dances between $2.93 and $3.41. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster lately, with the last month seeing a climb of nearly 7%. The market faces a challenge at the $3.64 mark, a possible stepping stone for further growth. If XRP breaks that barrier, it might head towards $4.12, a gain of over 20% from the current low end. Meanwhile, the 10-day average price is slightly below at $3.12, hinting at a potential upward momentum. With an RSI around the mid-40s, the coin shows room to grow. Investors seem hopeful as XRP navigates the crypto waves, looking for a chance to surge higher. PR with C-Level Clarity: Outset PR’s Proprietary Techniques Deliver Tangible Results If PR has ever felt like trying to navigate a foggy road without headlights, Outset PR brings clarity with data. It builds strategies based on both retrospective and real-time metrics, which helps to obtain results with a long-lasting effect. Outset PR replaces vague promises with concrete plans tied to perfect publication timing, narratives that emphasize the product-market fit, and performance-based media selection. Clients gain a forward-looking perspective: how their story will unfold, where it will land, and what impact it may create.

Each campaign is calibrated to match the client’s specific goals, budget, and growth stage. This is PR with a personal touch, where strategy feels handcrafted and every client gets a solution that fits. Outset PR’s secret weapon is its exclusive traffic acquisition tech and internal media analytics. Proprietary Tech That Powers Performance One of Outset PR’s most impactful tools is its in-house user acquisition system.

Case in point: The careful selection of media outlets has helped Outset PR increase user engagement for Step App in the US and UK markets. Outset PR Engineers Visibility That Fits the Market One of the biggest pain points in Web3 PR is the disconnect between effort and outcome: generic messaging, no product-market alignment, and media hits that generate visibility but leave business impact undefined. Outset PR addresses this by offering customized solutions. Every campaign begins with a thorough research and follows a clearly mapped path from spend to the result. It's data-backed and insight-driven with just the right level of boutique care. Conclusion While XRP’s pullback to $2.90 reflects short-term selling pressure, its underlying momentum and key resistance targets suggest that an upward move is still possible if bullish sentiment returns.

Outset PR’s unique blend of boutique strategy, performance analytics, and media trend foresight ensures that projects are positioned to turn market volatility into visibility and long-term growth.

50180190,558369,1755345910,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50180190.jpeg,"Bitcoin and Ether ETFs Gain $40B in Volume in One Week, Setting the Stage for the Next Crypto to Explode",https://bitcoinist.com/next-crypto-to-explode-etfs-have-biggest-week-ever/,"Bitcoin and Ether ETFs make it big after recording $40B in volume over the past week. ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, posted the news first , linking the performance to the Ether’s ETFs record-breaking $17B weekly volume. This comes during the same week that Bitcoin reached a new ATH of $124,000, while $ETH got 1.94% away from its previous 2021 record of $4,878, after trading at $4,784 on Thursday. Analyst Michael van de Poppe warns that this is just the beginning and that $ETH will likely push for another ATH soon during this cycle. The Driving Factors Behind the Current Crypto Push The main factors behind the ongoing market rally are the increasingly favorable legislative framework and the growing institutional adoption stemming from it. It’s as simple as that. Trump’s GENIUS Act is what set things in motion, by creating a pro-crypto legislative environment, designed to move stablecoins into legality and turn them mainstream. The Clarity act , on the other hand, regulates the market surrounding stablecoins, forcing CEXs to register their activity with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC.) The Clarity Act also allows banks to ‘conduct digital commodities activities.’ As expected, these pieces of legislation triggered an invest surge, with players like Bitmine setting up the largest Ethereum reserve in the world, with $1.15M $ETH, valued at over $5B. This is little over 50% of all Ethereum holdings across 19 public companies . More importantly, Bitmine is already raising an additional $24.5B (of which $4.5B has been authorized) to fuel up its $ETH reserves. If that goes through, we should expect $ETH to skyrocket to new ATHs, especially in the context of the demand already outweighing the supply by 27:1 . If that happens, we expect the market to react accordingly and push the best crypto into an explosive bull run. The following three projects have the highest growth potential in 2025. 1. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – AI-Driven Content Creation Platform Aiming to Transform the $85B Industry SUBDD Token ($SUBBD) is an AI-driven content creation platform that aims to transform the $85B industry by automating parts of the content creation process. The AI Personal Assistant is the star of the show, helping creators with the post-production workload and automating some of the user interactions, like processing custom requests and social media posts. The AI Creator takes things one step further by allowing virtually anyone to create and monetize their own digital influencer. This makes it easier for people to enter the content creation business even if they lack the physical attributes that the industry tends to promote. These tools explain how SUBBD was able to onboard the top 2,000 earners in the content creation industry, with a combined following of over 250M. If you want to support the project, you can buy $SUBBD at the presale price of $0.0562, which could turn into a profitable investment if our predictions hold. Based on the project’s details and long-term scope, our SUBBD Token price prediction sees a potential $0.301 price by the end of 2025. In a five-year scenario and following successful implementation and mainstream adoption, $SUBBD could reach $2.50 by 2030. This translates to a growth rate of 4,350% based on today’s price. So, go to the presale page and buy your $SUBBD today , while it’s still trading at the presale price. 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin’s Layer 2 Solution Promising Faster and Cheaper Transactions As Bitcoin’s Layer 2 upgrade, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to push Bitcoin’s performance to modern requirements. Bitcoin is currently capped at 7 transactions per second (TPS) which cannot meet the market’s demands in 2025. By comparison, Solana’s performance rests at 65,000 theoretical TPS. Bitcoin Hyper aims to change that with tools like the Canonical Bridge and Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). The Canonical Bridge lays at the heart of Hyper’s ecosystem and serves to mint the users’ Bitcoins into Hyper’s Layer 2. The users can then use the wrapped Bitcoin within the Hyper ecosystem or withdraw them to Bitcoin’s native layer at will. The Canonical Bridge decongests the Bitcoin network, delivering near-instant finality and allowing for higher scalability. This makes Bitcoin more feasible for institutional adoption by enabling batch transactions. The Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) enables the hyper-fast execution of smart contracts and DeFi apps, pushing Bitcoin’s performance to Solana-level throughputs. Bitcoin Hyper’s presale has bagged close to $10M since its start date in may, which recommends it as one of the best presales of 2025 . If you want to invest, now’s the perfect time, given that $HYPER trades at the presale price of $0.012735. As an additional incentive, our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction estimates a $1.50 price by the end of 2030, with a price target of $0.32 by the end of 2025. In raw numbers, invest $100 today and you might make $2,512 by December, 2025, or $11,778 by 2030. If this sounds like a plan, here’s how to buy Bitcoin Hyper in our guide. 3. Mantle ($MNT) – Banking Blockchain That Aims to Turn Finance Free and Accessible Mantle ($MNT) is a blockchain technology that aims to turn finance mainstream and free, as a tokenized system would have it. The platform offers several ‘innovation pillars’ designed to uplift the modern decentralized economy. The Mantle Network, Ethereum’s Layer 2 upgrade is the most prominent tool in the box, coming with features like modular design, ZK Roadmap, and EigenLayer integration. Mantle Index Four is another vital component within the Mantle ecosystem, offering easy access to an eclectic pool of digital assets. Last but not least, MantleX harnesses the power of AI to ‘pioneer the future of decentralized systems.’ If you want to support Mantle or you’re simply looking for something to snipe, look no further than $MNT. The token is 14% up over the past 24 hours , with a price of $1.27, making it a brainless buy. Before that, don’t forget to visit Mantle’s official website to learn more about the project. Always DYOR first. Will Bitcoin and Ethereum Break New ATHs This Year? Based on the current crypto context, with more favorable legislation and rampant institutional adoption, it’s safe to say that both Bitcoin and Ethereum will enter a new bull run soon. Bitcoin has already reached a new ATH of $123K this month, while Ethereum was inches from surpassing his. If the bull comes, don’t forget to keep your eyes on next crypto that could explode like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) . Don’t take this as financial advice.

Dom, a prominent figure in the crypto community, pointed out that the widely shared numbers were inaccurate due to a misinterpretation of the currency. According to him, what was portrayed as a surge worth hundreds of millions of US dollars was denominated in Brazilian reais. The actual figure is approximately $200 million in US dollars. the big new influx in RWA on the XRP Ledger is NOT accurate. this was supposed to be counted in Brazilian real. actual figure closer to ~$200m. pic.twitter.com/UxJXi1vN9j — Dom | EasyA (@dom_kwok) August 15, 2025 Background: XRPL’s Growing Role in Tokenization The XRP Ledger has been gaining attention in Latin America as a hub for tokenized assets. In July, Ripple confirmed that Mercado Bitcoin, one of Brazil’s largest crypto exchanges, would bring approximately $200 million worth of regulated financial instruments onto XRPL. This announcement represented one of the clearest and most significant USD-denominated RWA tokenizations on the ledger so far. At the same time, VERT launched its on-chain private credit platform on XRPL. Its debut involved the issuance of Agribusiness Receivables Certificates (CRAs) valued at 700 million Brazilian reais. When converted, that amounts to about USD 130 million. The Source of the Confusion The discrepancy arose when some data aggregators and commentators reported the BRL 700 million figure as if it were denominated in US dollars. This error significantly inflated perceptions of the overall USD value of tokenized assets flowing into XRPL. Dom highlighted this misstep, warning the community against concluding aggregated numbers without verifying the underlying currency. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Real Numbers Taking verified announcements into account, XRPL’s most notable RWA tokenizations include: Mercado Bitcoin’s program valued at about USD 200 million. VERT’s issuance of BRL 700 million in CRAs, equal to around USD 130 million. When both are considered together, public trackers show XRPL RWA activity in the low hundreds of millions — not the outsized multi-hundred-million-dollar influx that some headlines suggested. Why Accuracy Matters This episode underscores the importance of precision in reporting tokenized asset values. Currency mislabeling can distort market sentiment, exaggerate adoption trends, and mislead both investors and regulators. For a sector as nascent as blockchain-based RWAs, clarity in how figures are presented is essential for building trust and encouraging responsible participation. The XRPL is indeed experiencing meaningful adoption in Latin America, led by Mercado Bitcoin’s $200 million program and VERT’s large-scale BRL issuance. However, as Dom | EasyA emphasized, the narrative of a massive new USD-denominated influx was inaccurate. This correction underscores the importance of accurately verifying numbers and currencies when monitoring the growth of tokenized assets.

50180669,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78706,1755345931,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple CTO Narrates His 15-Minute-Shocking Experience on the XRP Ledger,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-cto-narrates-his-15-minute-shocking-experience-on-the-xrp-ledger/,"Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz , has shed light on a curious anomaly he observed while monitoring his XRPL hub. In a post shared on X, Schwartz described a sudden 15-minute spike in peer round-trip latency that occurred at about 1:59 AM Pacific Daylight Time on August 15, 2025. The unusual event, he explained, revealed performance irregularities that did not affect all peers equally, leaving open questions about its root cause. The Unusual Latency Spike According to Schwartz, the anomaly presented itself as a sharp but temporary increase in round-trip latency across certain peer connections. Rather than a uniform slowdown affecting all connections, only certain peers experienced increased latency, suggesting a more localized issue. During the incident, three peer connections dropped out of 343, and overall traffic dipped slightly, likely reflecting those lost connections. I have my first bit of weird data from the hub. I'm tracking peer round-trip latency at application level and there was a weird spike that shows significantly worse performance for a period of about 15 minutes. The spike starts at about 1:59 AM PDT. The thing that puzzles me… pic.twitter.com/binWG2KeYL — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) August 15, 2025 This selectivity is what puzzled Schwartz most. “If the hub was the source of the issue, we’d see consistent latency increases across all connections,” he said, suggesting external factors like temporary network disruptions might be to blame. Monitoring and Instrumentation Schwartz stressed that the anomaly was detected thanks to new, detailed monitoring he recently enabled on his hub. At present, however, he only has a single day’s worth of granular data. While sufficient to flag the irregularity, it is not enough to determine whether the spike was a one-off event, a recurring phenomenon tied to specific times, or an unpredictable network glitch. He revealed plans to expand his monitoring setup by incorporating tools such as Grafana and Alloy. These will allow him to gather more comprehensive metrics — from CPU and disk usage to network path traces and per-peer telemetry — making it possible to identify whether issues arise from routing changes, resource contention, or scheduled tasks running in the background. Possible Causes and Community Input Following his disclosure, community members and fellow engineers weighed in on possible causes. Suggestions ranged from temporary ISP congestion and BGP routing changes to automated maintenance tasks that might coincide with off-peak hours. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Others pointed to the gap between the 90th and 10th percentile latencies, suggesting this indicated sporadic path deterioration rather than a hub-wide capacity issue. The key takeaway from Schwartz’s post is that the anomaly appeared to be peer-specific, directing suspicion more toward network paths and routing than XRPL’s consensus mechanism or hub software itself. Broader Implications For institutions and validators that rely on the XRP Ledger , the episode serves as a reminder of the importance of robust, layered monitoring. Having peer-to-peer visibility and long-term percentile tracking can be crucial in diagnosing irregularities that are otherwise easy to overlook. Advanced telemetry, automated alerts, and periodic traceroutes could help prevent such incidents from disrupting mission-critical infrastructure. Looking Ahead Schwartz emphasized that this is an isolated data point, not yet evidence of a recurring problem. He assured the community that he would continue expanding instrumentation and share further insights if patterns emerge. For now, the event underscores both the challenges and the importance of vigilant monitoring in maintaining the resilience of blockchain networks like the XRPL. By sharing his findings transparently, Schwartz has not only flagged an operational puzzle but also provided the community with a real-world case study on infrastructure-level monitoring.

The upward tick comes after a decade of steep decline that set in amid a bitter geopolitical clash over Moscow’s military intervention in neighboring Ukraine. The latter was met with waves of Western sanctions, especially when it grew into a full-scale invasion, bringing turnover between the two nations to almost negligible levels. Putin highlights growth in ‘symbolical’ trade with U.S. Russia’s Vladimir Putin highlighted what sounds like a sizable growth in the otherwise admittedly “symbolical” trade between his country and the United States. Speaking to reporters after meeting U.S. President Donald Trump in the Alaskan city of Anchorage, his first trip to America in 10 years, Putin remarked: “By the way, under the new U.S. administration, our bilateral trade started to grow. Although it is still symbolical, there was a 20-percent growth.” The statement, quoted by the TASS news agency, produced one of the few, more or less concrete details that came out of the five-hour visit of the Russian strongman. “I would say that we have lots of promising areas for joint work,” Putin laconically pointed out in remarks that came after Trump earlier indicated he is eager to trade. Speaking aboard Air Force One on Friday, the U.S. head of state was quoted by CNN as saying: “I noticed [Putin’s] bringing a lot of business people from Russia, and that’s good. I like that, because they want to do business, but they’re not doing business until we get the war solved.” “Russia-U.S. business and investment cooperation clearly has a lot of potential,” Putin later added. The two countries “have a lot to offer each other,” he went on, listing trade, energy, digital industry, high technology, and space exploration among the areas of mutual interest. “Arctic cooperation also looks relevant, as well as the resumption of interregional ties, particularly between Russia’s Far East and the U.S. West Coast,” Putin elaborated after the meeting , described as a “starting point for resolving the Ukraine issue” and improving relations with the U.S. Bilateral trade up nearly a third in first half of 2025 On the eve of Putin’s rendezvous with Trump, Russian media also focused attention on the latest increase in economic exchange between the two nuclear powers. Trade between Russia and the United States increased by almost a third in the first half of the year, compared to the same period of last year, the RIA Novosti news agency unveiled in a report published before the weekend. Between January and June 2025, turnover increased by 31.3% over the first six months of 2024, according to the data, also quoted by the Prime business news agency and the business daily Vedomosti. U.S. imports were up 32.7%, and exports to the Russian Federation increased by 20.7%. Nominal figures remain much lower than before the war. “Trade turnover between Russia and the U.S. in 2024 amounted to only $3.5 billion, which is eight times less than the trade volume in 2014, which was $29.2 billion,” Russian economist Nikolai Novik detailed. At the same time, commenting for RIAN, the analyst from the Institute of World Military Economy and Strategy at the “Higher School of Economics” research institute pointed out: “However, with the arrival of the administration of the 47th president, the situation began to change, a stable positive trend is noticeable.” H1 results for 2025 show that trade between Russia and the U.S. increased by almost a third over the same period of 2024, reaching $2.8 billion, the analyst highlighted. This year, the main Russian exports were platinum, fertilizers and enriched uranium, while imports from the United States included pharmaceuticals and medical equipment. A decade ago, Russia was exporting petroleum products, ferrous metals, aluminum, enriched uranium, and platinum, while importing civilian aircrafts, natural uranium, and passenger cars from America. Despite the heavy sanctions, Russia imported $22 billion worth of goods into the U.S. in three years since it invaded Ukraine in early 2022, as Cryptopolitan reported in April.

From XRP testing key resistance to ADA’s steady climb, AVAX’s resilience, and SOL’s bullish momentum, traders have plenty to watch. In this analysis, we break down the latest technical signals and explore how Outset PR’s data-driven, tailored communication strategies help crypto projects secure visibility and investor interest precisely when the market is heating up. XRP Price on an Uptrend, Eyes Higher Levels Source: tradingview XRP's price currently dances between $2.93 and $3.41. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster lately, with the last month seeing a climb of nearly 7%. The market faces a challenge at the $3.64 mark, a possible stepping stone for further growth. If XRP breaks that barrier, it might head towards $4.12, a gain of over 20% from the current low end. Meanwhile, the 10-day average price is slightly below at $3.12, hinting at a potential upward momentum. With an RSI around the mid-40s, the coin shows room to grow. Investors seem hopeful as XRP navigates the crypto waves, looking for a chance to surge higher.

Let Outset PR Tell Your Story With Verifiable Impact Cardano (ADA) Eyes Gains as It Hovers Near Key Levels Source: tradingview Cardano is trading between seventy-three to eighty-five cents. It seems poised for growth, rising over 27% in a month. The nearest resistance is around ninety-one cents, while support lies at sixty-six cents. If it breaks through the resistance, it might climb to over one dollar. This would be a nearly 20% jump from its current upper range. The coin's indicators such as the RSI and moving averages suggest potential momentum. With these signs, Cardano could experience further upward movement, aiming for new highs. Keep an eye on these levels as ADA tries to break through the resistance zone. Avalanche (AVAX) Eyes Growth as It Navigates Market Levels Source: tradingview Avalanche (AVAX) is cruising between twenty-two and twenty-five dollars per coin. This marks a solid gain of over six percent in the past week. The crypto is showing promise with a ten percent rise this month. It faces resistance around twenty-seven dollars and could climb towards thirty dollars if momentum picks up. Such a move would bring roughly a twenty percent rise from its current range. AVAX is dancing around its short-term moving averages yet stays resilient. The market indicators signal a neutral position, hinting at potential upward movement without significant obstacles unless it dips below twenty dollars. Keep an eye on this one as it may surprise with more growth. Solana (SOL) Eyes New Heights as Momentum Builds Source: tradingview Solana's price currently moves between $167 and $192. Recently, it has gained over 11% in a week and about 19% in a month. This indicates positive momentum. If Solana breaks above its nearest resistance at $202, it could aim for $227, which would be around 20% higher than now. On the downside, its support sits at $152, cushioning any pullbacks. Technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index suggest balance, offering potential for more growth. As excitement around Solana continues, investors are keenly watching these resistance levels to gauge how high it might climb. Conclusion With XRP, ADA, AVAX, and SOL each poised for potential gains, the current market presents both opportunity and risk. Whether it’s XRP pushing toward $4.12, ADA testing the $1 mark, AVAX targeting $30, or SOL eyeing $227, timing and narrative will be critical for capitalizing on momentum.

With BTC trading near key resistance, traders are watching closely to see if this fresh wave of accumulation could be the catalyst for a push toward $140K. This analysis examines Bitcoin’s current technical setup and the potential market impact of large-scale institutional moves. Bitcoin Eyes Next Resistance Level as Price Consolidates Source: tradingview Bitcoin's current value dances between $114,807 and $121,187. It's inching closer to its nearest resistance point of $123,327. This indicates room for potential growth. A push beyond the $123,327 mark could see it aim for the next target of $129,707. Compared to its current range, this second target offers an upside of over 6%. With a recent 20% rise over the past six months, Bitcoin might still have some upward steam. The RSI and other indicators suggest mixed momentum, but the recent consolidation within this range shows that Bitcoin could be gearing up for another move. Keep an eye on whether it can break through the $123,327 benchmark for further gains. Conclusion Bitcoin’s steady consolidation near $121K, coupled with clear upside targets at $123,327 and $129,707, suggests room for another leg higher if bullish momentum takes hold. Institutional accumulation, such as the Norwegian wealth fund’s move, adds weight to the bullish case, while recent gains over the past six months point to a resilient uptrend. A decisive breakout could open the path toward new highs, keeping Bitcoin firmly in focus for both retail and institutional investors.

The company aims to trade on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker symbol “GEMI.” According to the information in the filing, Gemini reported a net loss of $282.5 million in the first half of 2025. This figure represents a significant increase compared to the $41.4 million loss recorded in the same period last year. Furthermore, the company's adjusted EBITDA fell from a $32 million profit in the same period last year to a $113.5 million loss in the first half of this year. In 2024, the company's total loss was $158.5 million and revenue was $142.2 million. Goldman Sachs, Citi, Morgan Stanley, and Cantor will serve as lead underwriters for the IPO. The IPO price has not yet been announced. Related News: New Document Submitted to Court in Ripple-SEC Case - What is the Latest Situation for XRP? Gemini's filing also stated that the company will transfer the majority of its users to a Florida-based entity called “Moonbase,” while the New York-based Gemini Trust will continue its operations. New York State is known for imposing some of the strictest oversight on crypto companies due to its BitLicense regulations. As a result, Gemini offers staking services in every state in the US except New York. Another noteworthy detail in the filing is the loan agreement with Ripple. Under the agreement, Gemini will have the right to a loan of up to $75 million. This amount can be increased to $150 million, and payments will be made in Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin. The company has reportedly not used any of this loan to date. If the IPO is successful, Gemini will become the third cryptocurrency exchange to be publicly traded in the U.S. Following Coinbase, Bullish, which listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) this week, also joined the group. *This is not investment advice.

If it gains momentum, it could aim for the $201 mark, which is its nearest resistance point. If the momentum continues, $226 could be on the horizon for SOL, marking a potential jump of around 18% from its current high range. However, if it dips, support may kick in at around $152. The past week's price increased by close to 9%, while the month's movement shows an over 16% rise, indicating steady recovery signs. The price trend suggests it is moving steadily, setting up Solana for possible gains in upcoming weeks if the current sentiment persists. Ethereum Shows Positive Trend with Potential for Growth Source: tradingview Ethereum is showing strong upward momentum. Its price is currently in the range of three thousand five hundred to four thousand five hundred dollars. Over the past month, ETH rose by over 45 percent, which indicates bullish behavior. If it breaks the resistance level near four thousand eight hundred dollars, it could aim for a higher target of around five thousand seven hundred dollars. This represents a potential gain of about 25 percent from the current top price range. Its recent weekend rise of over 16 percent suggests positive sentiment among investors. With the steady climb, ETH might break through key levels soon and continue its upward trajectory in the coming weeks. Conclusion With Solana holding steady in a tight range and eyeing key resistance at $201 and $226, and Ethereum building strong momentum toward potential breakouts at $4,800 and $5,700, the stage is set for a compelling battle in the weeks ahead. Sustained buying pressure and favorable sentiment could see either asset extend its rally, but Ethereum’s recent surge suggests it may have the momentum to challenge Solana’s lead. For traders, both coins remain high-priority watchlist contenders in the evolving market race. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The crypto exchange added that the current market conditions now suggest a potential shift towards a full-scale altcoin season as September nears. Altcoin Rotation In its latest research, Coinbase explained that Bitcoin’s market dominance had fallen from 65% in May 2025 to around 59% by August. This indicates early signs of capital rotation into altcoins. CMC’s Altcoin Season Index also remains in the low 40s, below the 75 threshold that historically points to an altcoin season, even as the total altcoin market cap has risen over 50% since early July to $1.4 trillion as of August 12. These trends suggest that conditions may be moving toward a more widespread altcoin season heading into September. Coinbase also highlighted that liquidity trends are becoming more favorable for altcoins, and noted improvements in order book depth, higher spot and perpetual trading volumes, and reduced slippage. These factors make it easier for investors to execute trades without significant price impact, which supports broader market participation in altcoins and, hence, a potential momentum toward a full-scale altcoin season. Altcoin Season Divergence Coinbase noted that the divergence between the Altcoin Season Index and total altcoin market capitalization largely reflects growing institutional interest in Ethereum (ETH). This demand is driven in part by digital asset treasuries (DATs) and the broader narrative around stablecoins and real-world assets (RWAs). For example, Bitmine Immersion Technologies has purchased 1.15 million ETH through a new $20 billion raise, giving it the capacity to acquire up to $24.5 billion worth of ETH. Similarly, Sharplink Gaming, a former leader in ETH DATs, now holds approximately 598,800 ETH. Regarding higher-beta assets tied to ETH, tokens such as ARB, ENA, LDO, and OP are the most sensitive. In fact, LDO showed the strongest response to the recent ETH rally, by gaining 58% month-to-date. LDO offers relatively straightforward exposure to ETH through liquid staking, and currently sits at a beta of 1.5, meaning its price tends to be 50% more volatile than ETH. This helps amplify both potential gains and losses. Coinbase also stated that LDO’s recent appreciation was further supported by a US SEC statement on liquid staking issued on August 5. According to staff from the Division of Corporation Finance, liquid staking does not constitute the offer or sale of securities if the activities are primarily “ministerial” and rewards are passed one-for-one from the protocol. Overall, institutional demand for ETH, combined with regulatory clarity on liquid staking, continues to influence market behavior and contributes to selective altcoin performance.

Notably, the premier cryptocurrency established a new all-time high at $124,457 before experiencing a sharp crash to below $118,000 driven by recent US PPI data. As enthusiasts await the asset’s next move, prominent analytics firm Glaasnode has unveiled the potential price targets based on short-term holders’ (STH) market activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Prepares For Make-Or-Break Move As Textbook Triangle Meets Tight Range Short-Term Holder Cost Basis Tips Bitcoin To Race Towards $144K In an X post on August 16, Glassnode shares data from its Bitcoin STH cost basis model, which suggests the cryptocurrency is headed for an overheating region. For context, short-term holders refer to entities that acquired their BTC within the last 155 days. Their cost basis, i.e., average price of acquisition, often serves as a proxy for the sentiment and profitability of newer market entrants, thus dictating short-term price dynamics. Glassnode’s on-chain data shows that Bitcoin’s STH cost basis has now climbed to $107,000, with standard deviation bands indicating the next crucial resistance at $127,000. Notably, this price level aligns with the +1σ band, often viewed as a “heated” market threshold. This zone is expected to act as a major pivot point, either marking the onset of consolidation or serving as the launchpad for a euphoric final leg upward. However, if Bitcoin can decisively break above $127,000, the STH deviation bands suggest it may trigger accelerated market buying momentum, potentially pushing the price toward the +2σ band at $144,000 zone. Notably, the +2σ band is termed as the overheating region as it often coincides with local or cycle top and frequently introduces significant sell pressure from investors. Meanwhile, the base STH cost basis at $107,000 now serves as a crucial short-term support; therefore, a breakdown below this could imply weakening confidence among recent buyers. In such a bearish scenario, market attention would turn to the lower deviation -1σ band at $93,000, at which investors may expect some price stability.

In his tweet, Pantoja suggested that at $4, XRP holders may face ridicule from skeptics, with some dismissing the price level as insignificant. He proposed that at $10 to $15, discomfort could set in for those who previously exited their positions, with possible comments expressing an intent to re-enter the market at a significantly lower price point. According to him, a hypothetical surge to $100 could trigger panic among observers, with statements implying disbelief that the asset could reach such a valuation. At $1,000, Pantoja suggested the scenario could escalate into a situation of full-blown FOMO, combined with a supply crunch and widespread buying mania. $XRP at $4 → mocking: “lol just $4” $XRP at $10–15 → discomfort: “I’ll buy back in under $1” $XRP at $100 → panic: “It was never supposed to get this high” $XRP at $1,000 → full-blown FOMO, and supply crunch and mania. pic.twitter.com/harNxhUEry — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) August 15, 2025 Community Reactions to the Hypothetical An X user, Jashobeam Bangalan, responded to Pantoja’s tweet by expressing personal investment conviction. He stated that he hoped the scenario would happen, emphasizing a long-term holding strategy. Bangalan indicated he would not sell until he witnessed XRP moving value across the globe, describing the current period as being based on “fumes” until real-world adoption at scale occurs. He characterized his approach as all-or-nothing, stating it was either a total loss or a life-changing financial outcome, and confirmed that his position was “locked in.” Broader Interpretation from Market Observers In addition to Bangalan’s remarks, Nguyen, another market participant, commented on the broader relevance of Pantoja’s hypothetical. He suggested that the described price progression was not solely applicable to XRP but served as a reflection of a recurring trend in cryptocurrency markets. Nguyen described the phenomenon as a mirror of the journey many crypto skeptics take, where disbelief transitions into urgency and fear of missing out as prices rise. He advised readers to prepare for such market psychology shifts, using the phrase “buckle up” to signal the need for readiness in rapidly changing conditions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Context in the Current Market Landscape While Pantoja’s tweet presented a hypothetical trajectory rather than a forecast, the outlined progression aligns with sentiment-driven patterns observed in past cryptocurrency cycles. Historically, significant upward price movements in digital assets have often been accompanied by changing attitudes from skepticism to urgency, with the speed of change intensifying at higher valuations. For XRP , the scenario he described assumes extreme appreciation from current levels, which would require substantial changes in demand, adoption, and possibly macroeconomic conditions affecting digital assets.

Specifically, the token is consolidating within a bullish setup that could pave the way for significant gains in the coming weeks, according to insights shared by analyst Ali Martinez in an X post on August 16. XRP price analysis. Source: TradingView To this end, XRP has been consolidating within a symmetrical triangle, a pattern that signals a potential breakout as price compresses between converging trendlines. A move higher would likely draw in new buyers and fuel fresh momentum. XRP’s key prices to watch Currently, XRP is hovering around the $3.10 level. A breakout above $3.26 would confirm the bullish momentum, potentially propelling the token toward $3.90, just shy of the psychological $4 mark. This technical setup could come as a relief for XRP investors, considering the asset has recently witnessed massive capital outflows in line with broader market sentiment. On one occasion, XRP shed over $10 billion in a single day. Despite this downturn, large investors are showing confidence in the asset. As reported by Finbold on August 15, XRP whales purchased 120 million tokens on that day alone, adding to an earlier 320 million XRP haul. In total, 440 million XRP were absorbed in under a week. Historically, such whale accumulation has often preceded trend reversals, suggesting whales may be positioning for a rebound. XRP price analysis At press time, XRP was trading at $3.11, down 0.14% in the last 24 hours and more than 6% lower on the weekly chart. XRP price analysis chart. Source: Finbold Despite these losses, XRP remains above its 50-day SMA of $2.91 and well above the 200-day SMA of $1.93. This alignment reflects a clear bullish trend, as shorter-term momentum continues to outperform the long-term average. Meanwhile, the 14-day RSI at 50.78 sits near the neutral zone, indicating that XRP is neither overbought nor oversold.

This makes it the fourth month in a row where global holdings of U.S. government debt stayed above the $9 trillion level. But while that top-line number screams “demand,” the actual flow of money shows foreign investors are not exactly riding a one-way train into Washington’s debt pit. On a transactional basis, the U.S. suffered a $5 billion outflow in June, right after a huge $147 billion inflow in May, an inflow that hadn’t been seen since August 2022. April wasn’t any better, with a $40.8 billion withdrawal, which came in the middle of economic chaos caused by President Donald Trump’s trade decisions. Japan adds more while China hits the brakes Japan increased its position again in June, locking in $1.147 trillion in U.S. Treasuries , up $12.6 billion from May’s $1.134 trillion. That move made Japan the biggest non-U.S. holder of American government debt… still. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom pushed further into second place, lifting its holdings to $858.1 billion, a modest 0.6% jump from the previous $809.4 billion. The UK first overtook China in March and hasn’t looked back. But the UK’s rising numbers aren’t really about British interest, most of those holdings are custody accounts for hedge funds. Same goes for debt stashed in Cayman Islands and Bahamas, where funds regularly park their positions. China, once the loudest name on the list, barely moved. The world’s second-largest economy kept its U.S. Treasuries holdings around $756.4 billion, just slightly above May’s $756.3 billion. That puts Beijing’s holdings at their lowest level since February 2009, when the global financial system was falling apart. For a country that once held over $1.3 trillion in Treasuries between 2012 and 2016, this is a dramatic pullback. Beijing’s playbook is clear: protect the yuan. Selling off U.S. debt helps China keep its own currency from falling apart under pressure. In a report from China Money, published under the People’s Bank of China, researchers warned, “Although U.S. Treasuries have not yet reached the default threshold, their expansion is unsustainable.” The piece called for a continued reduction in American debt holdings, arguing that U.S. growth alone wouldn’t be enough to balance out its huge deficits and trade gaps. The team also criticized Trump’s trade moves, suggesting that the White House’s obsession with the trade deficit could choke off global demand for the U.S. dollar . They called the entire situation a “tug-of-war” between the country’s economic goals and monetary pressures. India and Hong Kong reduce their exposure, equities rise, yields climb Beyond China, others in Asia are also pulling back. India dropped its U.S. Treasuries to $227.4 billion, while Hong Kong reduced its position to $242.6 billion. Both regions had previously kept steady levels of American debt but have now joined China in scaling down exposure, signaling broader regional caution. Even as some foreign players dumped Treasuries, they weren’t totally fleeing the U.S. market. In June, foreigners poured $163.1 billion into U.S. equities, on top of $115.8 billion from May. Still, total net capital inflow into the U.S. dropped to $77.8 billion in June. That’s a 75% drop from $318.1 billion in May, which was the biggest monthly inflow since September 2024. Bond yields rose on Friday after consumer data offered mixed signals. Retail sales for July climbed 0.5%, hitting expectations. Without counting cars, sales still went up 0.3%, also matching forecasts. The jump suggested that consumers were still spending even as tariffs and tax adjustments rolled through. At the same time, the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index dropped to 58.6 in August, down from 61.7 the month before. Inflation fears were blamed for the decline, showing that even if people are spending, they’re not exactly feeling good about it. The bond market reacted fast. The 2-year Treasury yield went up 2 basis points, landing at 3.757%, while the 10-year note added 3 basis points, moving to 4.324%. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

According to market trader Crypto King, “XRP is heating up and institutions are stepping in. We are now entering the phase I have been waiting for: Manipulation done, Accumulation done, Expansion loading. The chart and fundamentals are lining up for something massive.My target this cycle is $7.00.” The market researcher maintains a bullish outlook on XRP, citing growing momentum and rising institutional interest, a key signal of strong capital inflows and market legitimacy According to Crypto King, XRP may be on the verge of entering the Wyckoff expansion phase, where sustained buying pressure, driven by hype, news, and retail demand, could trigger a significant price surge. As a result, he predicts XRP could surge to $7 this bull cycle, nearly double its all-time high of $3.65, setting a new record. XRP could also target $9.63 this cycle, mirroring patterns from its previous bull run. Ripple’s New XRPL Patent Could Reshape Blockchain Competition Prominent crypto researcher SMQKE has disclosed that a newly granted Ripple patent for enhancements to the XRP Ledger could make it harder for rivals to build comparable blockchain software. The U.S. patent, enabling temporary consensus subnetworks and trust-based instant cross-border payments, outlines Ripple’s methods to accelerate settlements and reduce full-network reliance, making XRPL uniquely efficient for institutional use. SMQKE sees the patent as a strategic moat because if enforced, key on-ledger designs and validator setups could be off-limits to competitors, raising barriers to replicating XRPL functionality. Nevertheless, legal and technical limits remain since patents cover specific implementations, not ideas, and XRPL’s open codebase with distributed validators complicates claims that Ripple can block ecosystem growth. Ripple’s engineers and independent validators have repeatedly emphasized the ledger’s decentralized nature. Conclusion For builders and investors, Ripple’s specific patent filings shift the competitive landscape for payments-focused ledgers. Whether they block rivals depends on courts, licensing, and alternative innovations. As SMQKE and others note, this highlights rising tension between proprietary IP and blockchain’s collaborative ethos. Meanwhile, Crypto King sees XRP emerging from its accumulation phase, poised for a bullish breakout toward $7, fueled by institutional buying and strong fundamentals.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-16 12:41:09

Some speculations below the post claim that these wallets belong to already established names in the Ethereum reserve strategy race, but there’s not much hard evidence to support this theory as of now. Current data shows that Bitmine Immersion Technologies stands out as the biggest company ETH whale, holding almost 1.3 billion tokens, currently valued at more than $5.7 billion. SharpLink follows suit with 598,800 ETH, while Coinbase and Bit Digital are next with 136,782 ETH and 120,306 ETH, respectively. Bitmine’s latest purchase came during the current market-wide retracement that drove Ether from over $4,700 to $4,400. While smaller investors started to panic-sell their ETH stash, Bitmine spent another $470 million to acquire 106,485 tokens. In contrast, the Ethereum Foundation has continued its sell-off. Data from Lookonchain shows that one of its wallets disposed of another 7,294 ETH in total over the past three days to secure $33.25 million. The post Mysterious Whale or Institution?

Some well-known Bitcoin and XRP traders believe it could deliver 300x gains before the 2026 bull run. These are traders who have seen multiple market cycles. They have also spotted patterns that resemble earlier breakout moments. This coin, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is gaining traction as presale buyers rush in. Market chatter points to an opportunity that may not last long. Early momentum has often been a strong signal for coins that later dominate in major rallies. The current trend reminds some investors of the excitement that built before Chainlink’s massive surge in past cycles. Bitcoin and XRP Traders Spot New Market Signals Seasoned traders often look for early signs that point to explosive growth. Right now, Bitcoin is holding a steady uptrend after recovering from recent dips. XRP is also showing fresh buying activity following months of quiet price action. Both are acting as market leaders while smaller coins start gaining attention. Market behavior suggests that capital is slowly moving toward promising low-cap projects. These cycles often start with established players holding strength before funds rotate into new altcoins. Traders who survived multiple bull and bear markets know the importance of getting in early before hype peaks. Crypto presales have seen renewed interest in 2025. Many investors are tired of chasing coins after big pumps. Instead, they prefer catching them in early phases. Presales give traders a better risk-to-reward setup if the project has strong fundamentals. They also provide the chance to buy before exchange listings bring heavy demand. In the past, presales with active communities and clear roadmaps have often led to huge profits in bull cycles. While not all succeed, the best ones become industry leaders. This is why experienced traders are selective and focus only on projects that meet their growth criteria. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Early Backing from Cycle Veterans MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming one of the few presales to capture the attention of top traders. Some early buyers see patterns matching Chainlink before its surge. This comparison is drawing interest from both retail and whale investors. The coin’s roadmap shows a focus on utility and market timing, which are critical in upcoming cycles. Final Thoughts Veteran traders rarely agree on new coins, yet many are aligned on this one. Bitcoin and XRP continue to lead the broader market, but fresh opportunities often emerge before a major bull run. MAGACOIN FINANCE could be one of those rare plays that reward early conviction. With momentum building, many are watching closely for its next move.

Chainlink, Uniswap, and Remittix have all received a significant amount of attention in anticipation of Q3/Q4. They all bring their own solutions to problems in the blockchain space, from decentralized data to payment platforms — Remittix (RTX) creating a stir with its presale success and imminent product releases. Chainlink and Uniswap Market Performance The current price of Chainlink (LINK) is $21.60, down 5.46% over the last day. With a daily trading volume of $1.27 billion, its market capitalization is $14.64 billion, a 36.78% decrease. Chainlink remains one of the most popular choices for developers to include secure, off-chain data in blockchain applications despite this drop. Uniswap (UNI) is at $10.56 down 4.13% on the day. Market capitalization stands at $6.64 billion with a 24-hour volume of $530.84 million down 43.53%. As a leading decentralized exchange, Uniswap continues to be a key player in the DeFi sector despite moments of short-term volatility. Both of these projects are widely regarded as established influencers within their respective domains, with Remittix gaining traction as a fast-paced player with real payment application beyond crypto. Remittix: Bridging Crypto and Traditional Finance Remittix (RTX) has a price of $0.0944 and has already raised more than $19.7 million from presale, selling more than 602 million tokens. The primary value proposition of the project is to enable users to send crypto directly to normal bank accounts across 30+ countries in minutes. This is not just a blockchain pilot — it’s a product that’s been built to solve a real-world, $190 trillion global payments market. It supports over 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies right out of the box with real-time FX conversion with transparent rates. Another milestone is on the way: when presale hits $20 million, the team will reveal their first Centralized Exchange (CEX) listing’s name. This should improve liquidity, make the token more available worldwide, and attract new investors. Remittix recently announced its beta wallet release for Q3 2025, in mobile-first functionality with built-in currency conversion. The wallet will simplify cross-border payments for crypto insiders and newbies alike. The presale has a 40% token bonus for early adopters, along with a $250,000 community giveaway. That incentive, coupled with upcoming exchange listings, is fueling strong demand for RTX tokens. The Growth Formula Behind Remittix’s Appeal Send crypto to bank accounts in 30+ countries Handles 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies More than $19.7Million raised and 40% bonus active until now Beta wallet launch planned for Q3 2025 With utility-driven characteristics, forward-thinking product development, and growing investor interest, Remittix is positioning itself to be one of the top crypto under $1 to watch in coming months. As Q3/Q4 ramps up, it has a chance to join market leaders like Chainlink and Uniswap as part of the next wave of the bull.

This was not just another industry conference—it was the global stage where leaders in government, central banking, and finance debated the future of money. Garlinghouse’s presence signaled that Ripple was no longer positioning itself as a scrappy startup, but as a player capable of reshaping global financial infrastructure. During that same Davos cycle, he also predicted a wave of crypto IPOs, highlighting just how quickly institutional adoption could accelerate. A Blueprint for CBDCs and Interoperability The World Economic Forum unveiled its inaugural CBDC Policymaker Toolkit at Davos, outlining potential designs for sovereign digital currencies and highlighting concerns on interoperability. Garlinghouse emphasized that while central banks would eventually issue CBDCs, they would not naturally work together across borders. THREAD: The Brad Garlinghouse Speech That Predicted $XRP ’s Future In Jan 2020, at the World Economic Forum in Davos Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse took the stage. Months later, the SEC sued Ripple. But what he said that day now reads like prophecy. Let’s Open Thread pic.twitter.com/ZQa6zu5w8t — Satoshi Scope (@scopesatoshi) August 15, 2025 That, he argued, was Ripple’s role. In the years since, Ripple has turned that blueprint into infrastructure with its CBDC Platform, built on the XRP Ledger to enable issuance, management, and cross-network transfers of digital currencies and tokenized assets. Building Through Litigation Just months after Davos, the SEC filed its lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020. Yet the case did not halt Ripple’s international expansion. Instead, Ripple deepened relationships with central banks and governments. Bhutan piloted a digital ngultrum using Ripple’s technology, Palau launched a USD-backed stablecoin on the XRP Ledger, Colombia’s central bank tested high-value payment solutions, and Georgia selected Ripple for its digital lari project. Each partnership demonstrated Ripple’s commitment to solving the interoperability issue Garlinghouse highlighted years earlier. 2025: From Vision to Reality Today, CBDCs are no longer theoretical. Dozens of countries are running pilots, and several have already launched live projects. Ripple has extended its reach further by introducing RLUSD, a dollar-backed stablecoin launched in December 2024 on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This step strengthened Ripple’s position as a liquidity provider and a bridge between CBDCs, stablecoins, and fiat currencies—exactly the role Garlinghouse foreshadowed at Davos. The Legal Backdrop The SEC lawsuit reshaped, but did not derail, Ripple’s trajectory. Judge Analisa Torres’ 2023 ruling declared that XRP sales on secondary markets were not securities, though some institutional sales violated securities law. In June 2025, Judge Torres rejected a proposed settlement on procedural grounds. Shortly after, Ripple’s CEO confirmed the company would drop its counter-appeal , and the SEC expected followed suit . This brought the long-running case close to resolution without altering Ripple’s long-term strategy. Satoshi Scope’s post captures the reality that Garlinghouse’s 2020 words at Davos were less a prediction and more a roadmap. Five years later, CBDCs are taking shape, and Ripple has built the tools to bridge them. The “Internet of Value” Garlinghouse described is steadily emerging, with XRP positioned as the connective tissue in a new global financial system.

One X profile dedicated to warning SHIB investors and observers about potential threats has made a major clarification that one of the tokens within the ecosystem is not available on Solana. SHIBARMY ALERT There is NO official $LEASH token on Solana. Any version of a token not listed on our site is fake and not part of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Official info regarding our tokens and chain connections: https://t.co/PgwfMdDkRF Do NOT engage with… pic.twitter.com/KhpzNSJehy — Susbarium | Shibarium Trustwatch (@susbarium) August 15, 2025 The token in question is LEASH, which is the second in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, designed originally to be a rebase coin tied to the price of Dogecoin. This function was turned off later on, and now it continues to be used as a simple ERC-20 token. LEASH now has a market cap of just over $9 million and is the 1864th largest on CoinGecko. Its price has tumbled by over 17% in the past day alone to $85. There have been circulating posts online claiming that LEASH has also moved to the Solana network, which is not true, according to the warning by Susbarium. The X user prompted investors to verify all such claims using Shiba Inu’s official token portal, which shows that LEASH continues to be deployed only on Ethereum. Shiba Inu, its investors, and all the tokens within its ecosystem (SHIB, TREAT, BONE, and LEASH) are frequently targeted through similar fraud attempts due to their popularity. SHIB is by far the biggest and most well-known among the rest. It’s the second-biggest meme coin by market cap, despite its 11% retracement in the past month.

The massive $882 million accumulation, confirmed by LookOnChain, occurred as retail traders panicked and sold during recent pullbacks. In fact, BlackRock accelerated ETH accumulation 15x faster than Bitcoin over the past 30 days, with ETH holdings growing 65% compared to 4% BTC growth, while Trump also reportedly purchased an additional $8.6 million in ETH alongside $10 million in Bitcoin. As of the time of writing, Ethereum trades just 10.22% below its November 2021 all-time high of $4,891, with global search interest reaching the highest levels since 2021 . Sentiment tracking platform Santiment confirmed bearish social media commentary outweighs bullish remarks on Ethereum despite its historic rally. The firm noted “ FUD and disbelief ” among retail traders as ETH reaches higher prices, while “key stakeholders accumulate loose coins that small ETH traders are willing to part with right now.” Ethereum is now within 6.4% of its $4,891 all-time high from November 16, 2021. There have been consistent sell-offs from retail traders as crypto's #2 market cap has made this historic rally. Prices historically move the opposite direction of retail traders' expectations.… pic.twitter.com/241va9Jc5L — Santiment (@santimentfeed) August 12, 2025 Corporate Ethereum Race Reaches Fever Pitch BitMine filed for an additional $20 billion at-the-market equity offering expansion , boosting total stock sale capacity to $24.5 billion with proceeds targeting further ETH acquisitions. The company aims to acquire and stake 5% of the total Ether supply, approximately six million ETH worth $22 billion at current prices. SharpLink Gaming also reported holding 728,804 ETH as of June 30 , with nearly 100% staked to generate yield through its transformation into an Ethereum treasury vehicle. The company raised $400 million through a registered direct offering at $21.76 per share, projecting that ETH holdings will exceed $3 billion in value. Corporate Ethereum holdings posted the largest monthly increase on record in July, climbing 127% to 2.7 million ETH worth $11.6 billion. Twenty-four new entities joined corporate treasury ranks just this week, bringing the total to 70 companies holding significant ETH positions across various sectors. Source: Strategic ETH Reserve Chairman Thomas Lee described BitMine’s strategy as pursuing the “alchemy of 5%,” separating the company from crypto treasury peers through both holdings size and stock liquidity. The company’s five-day average daily dollar volume reached $1.6 billion, ranking 42nd among 5,704 US-listed stocks. Retail Capitulation Creates Perfect Storm for Short Squeeze As of Aug 13, short-term ETH holders realized approximately $553 million in daily gains according to Glassnode data , far outpacing long-term holders who remained relatively inactive. Source: Glassnode Despite ETH’s 43% monthly surge, current profit-taking levels remained 39% below last month’s peak when prices traded near $3,500. Most recently, the “7 Siblings” whale group sold 19,461 ETH worth $88.2 million this week at $4,532 average price, marking their first major liquidation since accumulating 1.21 million ETH. However, despite mixed market reaction, Ethereum is starting to look bullish to many. Arthur Hayes has reversed his bearish stance with an $8.4 million crypto buying spree , accumulating 1,500 ETH alongside DeFi tokens after previously predicting ETH would drop to $3,000. His contrarian move coincided with broader institutional accumulation patterns during retail weakness. Technical Analysis Points to Imminent Breakout Ethereum consolidates around $4,439 after successfully breaking above previous cycle highs near $4,800. The critical support level sits at $4,367, representing the former resistance that must hold as new support to validate the breakout above all-time highs. Liquidation heatmap analysis reveals massive liquidity concentration positioned above current prices, particularly in the $4,800-$5,200 range, where short positions and stop losses create fuel for potential squeeze. The visualization shows the majority of liquidity sitting above rather than below current levels, creating a characteristically bullish setup. The institutional accumulation provides a fundamental catalyst to trigger a technical short squeeze setup, which creates conditions for explosive upward movement. Retail panic selling during institutional buying creates a classic transfer from weak hands to strong hands , typically preceding major advances. Current price position below major liquidity clusters suggests significant upside potential if buying pressure drives ETH into squeeze zones. The three-day timeframe perspective confirms liquidity accumulation has been building over multiple sessions rather than a temporary phenomenon. Ethereum appears positioned for a significant upward move toward $5,200-$5,400 range, contingent on holding $4,225 critical support level during any pullbacks.

Dogecoin is trending and Shiba Inu still commands an army. However the smart money is investing in this utility-driven altcoin, Remittix (RTX). Analysts say Remittix (RTX ) could rise 30x to $3, eclipsing both Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. Dogecoin: Momentum, Brand But Big-Cap Gravity Dogecoin remains a major force in the meme coin sector. With its deep liquidity, constant hypes, social buzz and endorsements, Dogecoin is set for the moon. According to on-chain data revealed by Whale Alert, 200 million DOGE tokens worth over 45 million were transferred from Robinhood to an unknown wallet. Source: Whale_alert via X. Whale-size DOGE moves like this constantly stir up debate. They could be a prelude to major selling or just another big player moving coins off-exchange for cold storage or OTC deals. Social sentiment is split: Some see whale accumulation and oversold signals as bullish, while others see downside risk if those coins hit the market. Remember, DOGE has a $33 billion market cap. Big caps need massive inflows to see high percentage gains. Whales know this, so they are investing in this early-stage project, Remittix (RTX), which is poised for a 30x. Shiba Inu: Ecosystem Growing Shiba Inu keeps building; buzz around Shibarium upgrades and DeFi integrations with a loyal community. Shiba Inu price action remains under fear, uncertainty and doubt. Despite a brief surge above $0.000014 in July, SHIB’s price action has reversed, showing weakened momentum. Daily Shibarium transactions have exceeded 3.85 million, showing rising developer and user demand. However, Shiba Inu burns have decreased by 99% in the last 24 hours, amid the rise in network activity. SHIB price outlook is neutral. Remittix (RTX): The $0.09 PayFi Contender Targeting $3 Built as a PayFi solution on the Ethereum blockchain, Remittix (RTX) facilitates instant crypto-to-fiat transactions across 30+ countries. Its app features real-time FX conversion and fast, secure, seamless transactions. Recipients do not need a wallet and users are not bothered with KYC headaches. Remittix highlights: A full CertiK audit has been completed; liquidity and team tokens have been locked for three years. An upcoming wallet launch in Q3 with real-time FX rates. Users can earn up to 20% referral rewards by sharing the project Designed for both crypto natives and non-crypto users, it can be used by business owners, freelancers and remitters.

The latest filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) states that the fund will trade on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol “GDOG.” Grayscale announced that it has renamed its existing Grayscale Dogecoin Trust fund to Grayscale Dogecoin Trust ETF. If the company's application is approved, the fund will be listed on NYSE Arca. Grayscale isn't the only company seeking SEC approval for its Dogecoin ETF. Rex-Osprey and Bitwise have also filed similar applications. These developments reflect the SEC's softening of its approach to cryptocurrency ETFs under the new administration. Related News: New Document Submitted to Court in Ripple-SEC Case - What is the Latest Situation for XRP? Over the past year, the SEC has made significant strides, particularly in the ETF space. In July, the agency adopted regulations for crypto ETFs that allow authorized participants to create and redeem them with crypto assets instead of cash. It also authorized options trading for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, as well as certain spot Bitcoin ETPs. Grayscale played a critical role in the spot Bitcoin ETF approval process following its previous lawsuit victory. The SEC's approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and then Ethereum ETFs during the Biden administration are considered key steps in this transformation. *This is not investment advice.

To this end, Finbold has identified two altcoins worth buying now for $100 each, with the potential to turn into $10,000. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa ( KAS ) remains a unique investment opportunity thanks to its blockDAG architecture, designed to process transactions more quickly and efficiently. At press time, KAS was trading at $0.089, with the asset facing major resistance between $0.10 and $0.11. KAS one-week price chart. Source: Finbold In terms of growth potential, Kaspa is gaining momentum ahead of its upcoming smart contract debut set for August 31, a milestone that could drive adoption into new areas such as DeFi and real-world applications. This development could propel KAS into the spotlight and allow it to compete with established players like Ethereum and Solana, with the current bull cycle serving as a key catalyst for further growth. Aptos (APT) Aptos ( APT ), on the other hand, is carving out a space in the competitive smart contract landscape. At the time of reporting, Aptos was trading around $4.68, though the short-term remains weighed down by bearish sentiment in line with the broader market. In this case, analysts are watching the $4.65 support level closely, with a breakout likely if Aptos clears resistance in the $4.85 to $5 range. APT one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Despite recent token unlocks that introduced new supply, the price has shown resilience, reflecting steady demand. The network continues to expand its ecosystem through DeFi integrations, hackathons, and real-world asset experiments. If these fundamentals prove strong enough, both assets could emerge as key players in the altcoin season. While market volatility remains a risk, Kaspa and Aptos stand out as ideal bets in the race to turn $100 into $10,000.

Key Takeaways: Grayscale has filed to convert its Dogecoin Trust into an ETF under the ticker GDOG on NYSE Arca. The SEC is reviewing multiple crypto ETF applications amid a more favorable regulatory climate under the Trump administration. Ether ETFs hit a record $17 billion in weekly volume as Bitcoin reached $124,000 and ETH neared its 2021 peak. The company said Friday it plans to rename its existing Grayscale Dogecoin Trust to the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust ETF. If approved, the fund would list on NYSE Arca, which has already filed paperwork to support the listing. “The Shares are expected to be listed on NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol ‘GDOG,’” the filing stated. Grayscale Joins Growing Race for Crypto ETF Approvals Grayscale’s proposal enters a crowded field. Competitors Rex-Osprey and Bitwise have also submitted applications for similar products as the SEC weighs dozens of crypto ETF requests. Recent filings cover a wide spectrum, from SOL- to XRP-tracking funds, reflecting a shifting regulatory climate under the Trump administration. The SEC’s tone toward crypto ETFs has warmed considerably over the past year. In July, the agency approved in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto ETFs and gave the green light for applications to list and trade spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, along with options on certain spot Bitcoin ETPs. That shift follows a pivotal court win for Grayscale during the Biden era, which paved the way for spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 and spot Ether ETFs later that year. The market for US-based spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs is now booming. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reported last week was the strongest yet for combined trading volume, driven largely by a surge in Ether ETF activity. Weekly Ether ETF volume hit $17 billion, a new record, coinciding with Bitcoin’s climb to an all-time high of $124,000 and Ether’s near-return to its November 2021 peak. Spot Bitcoin + Ether ETFs did about $40b in volume this week, biggest week ever for them, thanks to Ether ETFs stepping up big. Massive number, equiv to a Top 5 ETF or Top 10 stock's volume. pic.twitter.com/Z89uV63A3w — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 15, 2025 Ether ETFs have pulled in over $3 billion in net inflows in the first half of August alone, their second-strongest month since launch. Balchunas noted the products had been “asleep” for nearly a year before cramming a year’s worth of trading into six weeks. Bitcoin ETFs Hit $73.6K as Analysts Draw Parallels to Ether Rally Bitcoin ETFs, meanwhile, have also posted fresh highs, with prices reaching $73,679 within two months of launch earlier this year. Analysts see parallels between Ether’s current rally and Bitcoin’s surge after its ETF debut. “This move is comparable to the BTC ETF launch, when Bitcoin continued to rally upward,” said MN Trading Capital’s Michaël van de Poppe, predicting more upside for altcoins. $ETH has surged more than 100% in less than two months. This move is comparable to the $BTC ETF launch, when #Bitcoin continued to rally upwards. We'll likely see a new ATH for $ETH and then some consolidation. There's way more to come for this cycle. pic.twitter.com/Ah4hZkPecK — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) August 12, 2025 Still, some warn that Ether’s all-time high may not arrive immediately. Nansen’s Jake Kennis suggested it could take weeks or months, even with ETH now just a few hundred dollars shy of a new record. Meanwhile, the SEC has extended its review period for two Solana ETFs filings to October 16, 2025. The SEC said that the extension allows “sufficient time to consider” Solana ETF proposals from Bitwise and 21Shares, which were originally due on August 17.

This development comes as whales in both assets make strategic moves in the market, suggesting growing cross-asset diversification in the crypto space. Solana Whales Increase Holdings Amid ETF Delays Solana (SOL) surged to nearly $204 before easing to $198, gaining over 9% in 24 hours according to CoinGecko. DeFi Development Corp. (DFDV) revealed it acquired 110,000 SOL at an average price of $201.68, worth about $22 million, raising its total holdings to roughly $273 million. The company plans to stake the newly purchased tokens to its own Solana validators for yield generation. While the U.S. SEC has delayed its decision on Solana ETF applications from Bitwise and 21Shares until October 16, investor interest remains high. Market participants continue to weigh regulatory risks against Solana’s growing validator ecosystem. The continued whale accumulation signals confidence in SOL’s long-term role in decentralized finance, even with ETF uncertainty. Some of these large Solana holders are now reportedly participating in MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale, highlighting its appeal as the best crypto to buy now for portfolio diversification. Dogecoin Whales Accumulate Over Half a Billion Dogecoin whale activity spiked to its highest level in a month on August 13, with more than 100 transactions over $1 million recorded in a single day. Wallets holding between 100 million and 1 billion DOGE accumulated about 2 billion tokens—worth around $500 million—over the past week. This pushed total holdings for the group to 27.6 billion DOGE, the highest in over a month. The accumulation coincided with DOGE rebounding from early August lows of $0.195 to highs near $0.246 before a broader market pullback. While price action remains under the $0.25 resistance zone, the ongoing large-scale buys suggest whales are positioning for longer-term gains. Sources indicate that some of these high-value DOGE investors have also taken positions in MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale, further underscoring its profile as the best crypto to buy now among experienced market players. MAGACOIN FINANCE Draws Cross-Asset Whale Interest MAGACOIN FINANCE is currently in an active sale phase and has caught the attention of whales from both the Solana and Dogecoin markets. Built on a security-first structure, the project offers transparent ERC-20 tokenomics and compatibility with leading wallets. Analysts note that such cross-chain whale participation often reflects interest in new opportunities with potential for ecosystem growth. For whales already diversified in top assets, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the best crypto to buy now. Bottom Line With Solana whales expanding their holdings despite regulatory delays and Dogecoin whales amassing hundreds of millions in recent buys, the move into MAGACOIN FINANCE highlights growing multi-asset strategies among large holders. For those seeking projects attracting high-value participants, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as one of the best crypto to buy now. You can learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE via the official website.

The spike followed a stretch of heavy selling and fading bearish momentum, helping SOL break through key resistance. However, the rally was short-lived. Profit-taking by short traders, combined with the latest delay in SOL ETF approvals, quickly shifted sentiment, sending Solana below the $185 support line. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX), a new crypto PayFi solution, continues to fly amid the woes of the Solana price trajectory. On-chain data confirms that it has seen a spike in institutional and retail activity, supporting the verdict of several analysts who believe Remittix will be one of the highest-performing mid-cap cryptos this summer. As of now, the aggregated influx of capital through investor crowdfunding stands at $19.6 million and is showing signs of slowing down. We’ll first examine the technical outlook for Solana price movement, followed by a closer look at the key details surrounding Remittix. Solana Price Outlook: From $200 Breakout to $185 Breakdown Solana’s price action this month has highlighted just how quickly market sentiment can change in the crypto space. Earlier in the week, Solana broke through the $200 resistance level with a strong double-digit rally, driven by renewed optimism and talk of a new “ altcoin season ” among traders. However, the momentum didn’t last long. A few days later, Solana’s gains were erased after the U.S. SEC announced another delay in approving several pending SOL ETFs. The news dampened the bullish outlook and quickly shifted sentiment back in favor of the bears. Further weighing on Solana price, a round of profit-taking by short traders and a surge in large transactions from crypto whales led to more than $213 million in SOL changing hands within just a few hours, rattling investor confidence. As of now, Solana is trading below the $185 support level, marking a 4.5% decline for the day. Remittix Continues to Fly-High Amid Solana’s Woes Remittix ($RTX) has quietly become one of the most talked-about mid-cap cryptos heading into the final four months of 2025. This project is built to make cross-border crypto payments simple for anyone, anywhere in the world. Everyday users will be able to use the platform to send and convert digital assets into local fiat currencies, without extended delay periods or high transfer fees. Retail and institutional movements point in the direction of Remittitx, securing $19.7M worth of RTX tokens and closing in on the $20M target. Once this threshold is reached, the project team will unveil the name of its first centralized exchange (CEX) listing. Market experts have predicted that this calculated move will not only boost liquidity but also expand the exposure of Remittix in the overall crypto market.

However, the past seven-day period took a better turn when the altcoin surged above the $200 mark, rising as high as $205 on Thursday, August 14. Unfortunately, the Solana price didn’t enjoy this return above the $200 level for long, crashing—like the rest of the crypto market—back toward its early-week position around $180. A popular crypto analyst on the social media platform X has revealed that SOL’s downturn was no coincidence. Why SOL Keeps Falling Under $188 In 2025 In an August 15 post on the X platform, crypto pundit Burak Kesmeci evaluated the broader performance of the Solana price in 2025 and its impact on recent price action. Specifically, the on-chain analyst identified the $188 level as crucial to Solana’s recent price movements. Related Reading: Market Expert Reveals Why XRP Price At $1,000 Is Not A Possibility This evaluation revolves around the Fixed Range Volume Profile (FRVP) indicator, which provides insights into the distribution of trading volume across various levels on a price chart. In essence, the FRVP indicator helps identify regions with the most trading activity within a specific period. According to Kesmeci, the FRVP high-volume trading level currently lies around the $150 Solana price region. The crypto analyst noted that investors can expect SOL to continue its upward trajectory as long as its price stays above this high-volume trading level. Kesmeci, however, noted that another significant level in the FRVP is the Value Area High (VAH), which represents the upper boundary of the value area (a price range where 70% of the volume traded). The VAH level is often considered a resistance zone where prices may stall or experience a reversal. The crypto analyst identified $188 as the Value Area High (the green line in the chart above) for the Solana price. According to Kesmeci, the altcoin has struggled to stay above this VAH level so far in 2025—a trend witnessed in the past day. What Happens If Solana Price Keeps Retreating? Further in the post on X, Kesmeci pinpointed $170 – $179 as another Solana price region with significant trading activity. The analyst revealed that this zone could act as a support cushion should the price of SOL witness a correction. Kesmeci added: If Solana can shift its high-volume trading level upward, the bullish trend could strengthen. As of this writing, the price of Solana sits just above $180, reflecting a nearly 5% decline in the past 24 hours. Nevertheless, this drab 24-hour performance was not enough to push the altcoin’s weekly action into the red. According to CoinGecko data, the SOL price is up by over 4% in the last seven days.

For the first time, XRP has flipped the Gaussian Channel into support, a move the analyst says could set the stage for outperformance in the weeks and months ahead. The analysis, shared on X, highlights how this shift could mark a turning point in XRP’s long-standing struggle to gain momentum against Bitcoin. Understanding the Gaussian Channel The Gaussian Channel is a technical tool designed to smooth price action and highlight underlying trends. Filtering out market noise helps traders distinguish between resistance and support zones. #XRP has flipped the Gaussian Channel into support vs Bitcoin for the first time ever. Likely to outperform in the coming weeks and months. The bigger the timeframe, the stronger the signal. pic.twitter.com/FxyA7no7W5 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 16, 2025 When an asset breaks above the channel and begins using it as support, it typically signals the start of a new accumulation phase. For XRP/BTC , this flip suggests a structural change that could attract renewed interest from both traders and long-term holders. The Importance of Longer Timeframes At the heart of STEPH IS CRYPTO’s message is a principle seasoned traders often stress: the bigger the timeframe, the stronger the signal. While intraday charts are prone to false signals and noise, weekly and monthly charts reflect the behavior of institutional and long-term capital flows. When a trend filter, such as the Gaussian Channel, signals a shift on a higher timeframe, it often indicates a more sustained move. A daily bounce might become a larger trend when confirmed on a weekly or monthly chart. Current Market Context XRP’s pairing with Bitcoin has been trading in a long consolidation zone for years, marked by consistent underperformance. XRP/BTC has recently broken out of a descending pattern, retested key levels, and is now stabilizing around 2,000 satoshis after facing rejection near 3,000 sats. This suggests a base-building phase, where former resistance levels are becoming support, a common precursor to long-term reversals. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What This Means for XRP If XRP can hold above the Gaussian Channel on higher timeframes, the probability of sustained relative strength against Bitcoin grows stronger. While no technical signal guarantees a straight path upward, history shows that such flips often precede prolonged periods of outperformance. Traders and investors may watch for additional confirmation—such as volume expansion and strong weekly closes—to validate the move as a true regime shift rather than a short-lived spike. STEPH IS CRYPTO’s analysis underscores a simple but powerful market principle: signals carry more weight on higher timeframes. By flipping the Gaussian Channel into support against Bitcoin, XRP may be signaling the early stages of a broader recovery in its relative performance. Whether this move evolves into a long-term trend will depend on how XRP holds these levels in the coming weeks and months, but for now, the technical picture is showing its strongest signs in years.

Recently, cryptocurrency market sentiment has shown signs of cooling. With fluctuations in global economic data and uncertainty surrounding some macroeconomic policy expectations, investment enthusiasm for mainstream assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) has declined, and the market’s greed index has gradually declined from its highs.

The tempered sentiments came after the launch of OpenAI’s GPT-5 disappointed users and analysts with only minor improvements. Expectations were high when OpenAI unveiled its GPT-5 model last week. The company’s Chief Executive, Sam Altman, described it as “a significant step along the path to AGI,” its acronym for Artificial General Intelligence. Executives also believed this release would address weaknesses in ChatGPT. However, the reception was not as expected. Users quickly posted screenshots of GPT-5 failing simple tasks on social media, from mislabeling U.S. maps to stumbling over basic arithmetic. GPT-5 reveals frustrations over AI model progress Advanced users criticized GPT-5’s personality, describing the chatbot as colder and more mechanical than its predecessors. OpenAI’s update acknowledged the issue, promising to make the model warmer and friendlier, while emphasizing that sycophancy levels had not increased compared to previous models. The new usage limits, initially capped at 200 queries per week, also got paying subscribers angry. Altman was forced to take back some decisions, reinstating a popular earlier model that had been retired, and promised more customization options. The disappointment pointed to deeper frustrations with the pace of AI advancement. Previous releases were seen as leaps in capability, but GPT-5 has been described as incremental. “For GPT-5, people expected to discover something totally new,” said Thomas Wolf, the co-founder of AI startup Hugging Face. “And here we didn’t really have that.” Compared to competitors such as Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, and xAI, GPT-5’s performance was consistently mid-level across scientific, coding, and customer service tasks, according to research from Princeton University. The model’s key strengths were cost efficiency and speed, not outstanding intelligence. This has brought back comparisons to the “AI winter” of the 1980s, when inflated expectations collapsed as companies failed to deliver commercially viable systems. Gary Marcus, a prominent critic, said, “GPT-5 was this central icon of the entire approach of scaling to get to AGI, and it didn’t work.” For years, progress in large language models has depended on pouring more data and computing power into training systems. Companies have now exhausted much of the freely accessible internet data, forcing deals with publishers and rights holders, while the costs of training keep soaring. GPT-5 reportedly used hundreds of thousands of Nvidia’s latest processors, highlighting the scarcity and cost of resources. Some observers argue that the fixation on scaling has restricted exploration of alternative approaches. Meta’s chief scientist, Yann LeCun, suggested that progress requires models trained on real-world video and multimodal data. Investors double down despite slowing AI hype In all this, investors have remained mostly unfazed. Wall Street and venture capital have continued to pump billions into AI . Nvidia, the dominant chipmaker powering most AI training, has seen its valuation rise to $4.4T. Shares in SoftBank , a major OpenAI supporter, have surged more than 50% in the past month. At OpenAI itself, annual recurring revenue from ChatGPT has reached $12B. The confidence of investors is in contrast to expectations from analysts. Princeton researcher Sayash Kapoor noted that GPT-5 was less about approaching AGI and more about serving as infrastructure for products. The model’s reliability and cost-effectiveness could encourage businesses to build new applications on top of it. Venture capitalists also argue that opportunities remain underexplored. “Start-ups and businesses have not begun to scratch the surface of what they are capable of in business and consumer applications,” Peter Deng, a general partner at Felicis and former OpenAI executive, said.

The move comes as Genesis pursues over $3.1 billion in damages against its parent company through multiple ongoing lawsuits. Source: Kroll Three Arrows Capital Collapse Sparks Corporate War The conflict traces back to June 2022, when Three Arrows Capital defaulted on $2.36 billion in loans from Genesis. DCG voluntarily issued a $1.1 billion promissory note to backstop potential losses from the hedge fund’s collapse. The note contained automatic reduction provisions tied to any recoveries from Three Arrows Capital’s assets. Genesis subsequently recovered nearly $2.8 billion from Three Arrows Capital, primarily through GBTC shares that surged from $428.5 million to over $2.1 billion by May 2024. DCG claims these recoveries automatically reduced the promissory note’s principal to zero under the original agreement terms. Despite the alleged principal reduction, DCG continued making payments totaling $106 million to Genesis under what it calls a “misapprehension” about the note’s remaining balance. The parent company now seeks recovery of these funds plus interest through four legal counts, including declaratory judgment and unjust enrichment. The legal warfare intensified following Genesis’s bankruptcy filing in January 2023 after accumulating $3.5 billion in debts. Previously unsealed court documents reveal DCG executives feared Genesis could be treated as their “alter ego” as early as 2022, with CFO Michael Kraines warning about potential corporate veil piercing scenarios. Source: Genesis Genesis has mounted its own offensive, pursuing $2.2 billion in crypto assets through Delaware courts and over $1 billion in allegedly fraudulent transfers through the New York bankruptcy court. The subsidiary claims DCG extracted $450 million in crypto assets and $297 million through international transfers while Genesis faced liquidity stress. The Securities and Exchange Commission joined the fray in January 2025, fining DCG $38 million for securities violations and former Genesis CEO Michael Moro $500,000 for misleading investors about the company’s financial health following Three Arrows Capital’s collapse. The regulatory action revealed DCG executives knew about over $1 billion in Genesis losses while portraying financial stability. Corporate Control and Financial Engineering Allegations Internal documents released by Genesis’s Litigation Oversight Committee paint DCG as treating its subsidiary like a “de facto treasury” while extracting value through insider loans and risky trades. Genesis employees described a “culture of submission” where they served DCG’s interests over their own operational integrity. DCG’s risk committee delayed its first meeting for nine months after formation, with Kraines later joking that the delay made his “future deposition easier.” External auditors flagged “material weaknesses” at Genesis as early as 2020, yet the parent company allegedly continued extracting funds. The committee alleges DCG orchestrated fraudulent transactions, including the June 2022 promissory note and a September round-trip deal designed to mask Genesis’s financial distress. Genesis claims it was already insolvent by the end of 2021 despite carrying $14 billion in outstanding loans. Consulting firm Oliver Wyman warned DCG about Genesis’s financial vulnerabilities in November 2021, but the parent company failed to implement corrective measures. Instead, internal messages from 2022 indicate employees believed Genesis was being “propped up” so DCG could extract cash before the collapse. Notably, Genesis has made substantial progress in returning funds to creditors despite the ongoing legal battles. The company distributed $2.18 billion to approximately 232,000 users by May 2024, including through a pending $1.8 billion settlement with Gemini Earn participants. DCG previously settled over $1 billion in debt , including $627 million owed to Genesis by January 2024, following a November 2023 agreement reached after Genesis sued for loan repayments. The parent company had defaulted on over $620 million in debt by May 2023. As it stands now, the multiple legal proceedings continue as both companies navigate bankruptcy restructuring, regulatory enforcement, and billions in creditor claims stemming from the 2022 crypto market collapse.

And that momentum is backed by the total value locked in decentralized finance (DeFi) across Ethereum, which is also moving toward a level not recorded since the peak of the last cycle. Recent weeks have seen ETH move aggressively toward the record $4,800 level set in November 2021. The token is currently valued at $4,405 at the time of writing. It has gained more than 40% over the past month, outpacing much of the crypto market, including Bitcoin , and bringing about renewed speculation about price discovery ahead. Ethereum TVL nears peak levels from early 2022. Source: Defillama Price momentum nears historical peak Some of the drivers of the latest momentum are increasing institutional demand, inflows into spot Ether exchange-traded funds, and a generally more supportive macroeconomic backdrop compared to the bear market of 2022. Options traders have positioned for ETH to break above $5,000, a level that many in the market now see as a near-term catalyst for further speculative inflows. Some strategists have gone further, projecting prices as high as $13,000 if capital rotation from Bitcoin into Ethereum accelerates. ETH/USD price. Source: Google Finance The rally has also been supported by a wave of institutional endorsements. Inflows into U.S.-listed Ether ETFs topped $2.9 billion last week, surpassing the previous week’s record of $2.1 billion, which it has maintained since it hit that high in mid-July. This marks one of the strongest stretches since their approval earlier this year. DeFi locks in capital at pre-crash levels Beyond the headline price, Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem has staged a significant rebound. Total value locked has surged past $90 billion in recent days, hitting as high as $95 billion at some point. This brought it within striking distance of the $108 billion peak recorded in late 2021, just before the cascading liquidations and collapses that marked the 2022 crash. Much of this capital has flowed into liquid staking. Lending and restaking protocols, collateralized stablecoin platforms, RWAs, and yields, among others, have also seen inflows. Observers point to Ethereum’s steady network upgrades as part of the reason behind this resilience. Still, not all observers are convinced that the TVL stat should be taken at face value. A recent academic study argued that TVL metrics often involve double-counting and may exaggerate the true size of DeFi activity. That caveat has not stopped capital from flowing in. However, DeFi users are routinely undeterred by methodological debates as long as liquidity and yields continue rising. The future looks bright for Ethereum Market observers are watching as ETH moves, especially as it approaches the $4,700–$4,800 range. Should ETH scale above that level, it could trigger a wave of speculative demand. In the longer term, the outlook appears relatively promising thanks to regulatory clarity in major markets, the growing role of Ethereum ETFs in institutional portfolios, and the steady adoption of staking, all pointing to a maturing asset class. Also, developers continue to prioritize scaling and efficiency of the blockchain, which could keep Ethereum competitive even as rival blockchains seek to capture DeFi market share.

Hive Posts $45 Million In Revenue Thanks To Bitcoin Mining Bitcoin miner Hive Digital Technologies posted its strongest quarterly performance to date, driven by a surge in Bitcoin production and a jump in mining efficiency. The company reported $48.8 million in digital currency mining revenue for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2026, ending on June 30. This marks a 44.9% sequential increase from the previous quarter. The revenue jump was due to a 47% rise in average hashrate, which rose from 5.9 EH/s in Q4 to 8.7 EH/s in Q1. This increase in average hashrate allowed Hive to mine 406 BTC , a 34% rise quarter-over-quarter despite a 10.2% increase in network difficulty. Aydin Kilic, President and CEO of Hive, stated, “This was a phenomenal quarter. We’re now producing 7.5 Bitcoin daily with over 15 EH/s, and we’re on track to reach 25 EH/s by Thanksgiving, cementing HIVE among the world’s largest bitcoin miners.” Hive’s total revenue for the quarter clocked $45.6 million, with mining accounting for nearly 90%. Gross operating margins also improved, rising from 28.2% in the previous quarter to 34.7%. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to recover after Thursday’s drop. The flagship cryptocurrency surged to a new all-time high on Thursday, crossing $124,000 and reaching $124,553. However, it lost momentum almost immediately thanks to macroeconomic headwinds, falling over 4% to slip below $120,000 to $118,389. Sellers retained control on Friday as the price fell nearly 1% to $117,436. However, BTC has made a marginal recovery during the ongoing session. An analysis of Bitcoin perpetual futures long-short ratio has revealed a shift in investor sentiment in the derivatives market, with bearish positions dominating across major exchanges. Data from the past 24 hours shows that short positions have an edge over long positions. Short positions are at 51.8% while long positions account for 48.51%. This indicates that traders are betting on a potential decline in BTC’s price and a pessimistic market outlook. Individual exchange data provides a more detailed picture, with Binance having 51.38% of positions being short and 48.62% long. Bybit has a stronger bearish bias, with short positions at 53.89% and long positions at 46.11%. Long and short ratios are crucial for traders as they offer insight into market sentiment and potential price movements. More short positions indicate a higher probability of downward price pressure. BTC started the previous week in positive territory, rising 0.73% to cross $115,000 and settle at $115,051.

The central bank will revert to its regular supervisory process to monitor all crypto-related activities. US banks can offer crypto services like dollar-backed stablecoins without prior approvals. The move is expected to broaden institutional participation in the digital asset ecosystem. Federal Reserve Shuts Down Crypto Oversight Program The United States Federal Reserve has shut down a program monitoring banks’ crypto activities. The decision was announced on Friday, with the bank stating it was shuttering its “Novel Activities Supervision Program.” The program kept a check on banks involved with crypto assets, blockchain experiments, and tech-heavy partnerships. The Novel Activities Supervision Program has been around since 2023, and has helped the Fed track “novel activities” within banks under its supervision. This included crypto custody, crypto-backed lending, blockchain-based lending, and working with tech companies to deliver banking services. Easing Of Crypto Scrutiny The Federal Reserve stated that since the Board started its crypto supervision program, it has strengthened its understanding of crypto activities, the risks associated with them, and bank risk management practices. With this understanding, the Board now plans to integrate the supervision of crypto-related activities into its standard supervisory process. The Federal Reserve Board also plans to rescind its 2023 supervisory letter, which led to the creation of the program. The initiative is believed to be one of the ways the SEC enforced “Operation Chokepoint” under the Biden administration. The shuttering of the program follows President Donald Trump's signing of an executive order to end unfair banking practices based on grounds including religion, politics, and other ideologies. The order also cited Operation Chokepoint and how the Federal Reserve coerced banks into cutting ties with prominent crypto firms and entities. The Federal Reserve, along with other banking regulators, recently gave banks the green light to custody crypto assets. The regulators clarified that the same rules that apply to the custody of other assets will apply to crypto assets. A Big Win For The Crypto Industry Senator Cynthia Lummis called the Federal Reserve’s decision a “big win” for the crypto ecosystem, and one that ends Operation Chokepoint 2.0. She noted that the Federal Reserve’s decision effectively stops the targeted supervision of crypto banking activities. “Big win for putting an end to Operation Chokepoint 2.0. The Fed announced it is killing the targeted supervision of digital asset banking activities. There’s still more to do, but this is real progress toward a level playing field for crypto.” However, she conceded there was still more to do, but added that the decision was a big step towards creating a level playing field for crypto. Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor also weighed in, stating that the “road is now clear for Bitcoin and banking.” Crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett stated that the Novel Activities Supervision Program was a major catalyst for Operation Chokepoint 2.0. “The novel activities supervision program was a major catalyst for Operation Chokepoint 2.0, one banking lawyer told me. While the Fed has yet to rescind all of its anti-crypto guidance from the Biden era, this is another piece of the puzzle.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Pepeto (PEPETO) Price Prediction Hints at 500x Potential,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/best-crypto-to-buy-in-2025-pepeto-pepeto-price-prediction-hints-at-500x-potential/,"The countdown to the next Bitcoin halving has started, and every cycle proves one thing: those who position early in the right altcoins get the biggest wins. Pepeto, still in presale at $0.000000147 , is shaping up to be one of those once-per-cycle shots. This isn’t your typical meme coin gamble. Pepeto comes locked and loaded with real products including a zero-fee DEX (PepetoSwap) , a built-in cross-chain bridge (PepetoBridge) , and staking rewards hitting up to 244% APY . In 2021, Shiba Inu turned a $2,000 stake into a fortune purely on hype. Pepeto has the same viral potential but it is backed by audited contracts, live product demos, and a roadmap already in motion. That is why early buyers are quietly loading up before the crowd catches on. Pepeto’s Real Utility Sets It Apart From Typical Presale Buzz The presale price is still locked at $0.000000147 , and over $6.19 million has already been raised. Demand is snowballing, with each stage selling out faster than the one before. Pepeto isn’t promising utility “someday.” It’s delivering it now. Running on Ethereum mainnet , Pepeto solves high-fee pain points with PepetoSwap for zero-fee trades and PepetoBridge for instant, secure cross-chain transfers. No middlemen, no delays. The public demo of the exchange is already live, listing talks are heating up, and staking rewards up to 244% APY are designed to keep holders locked in while the price builds momentum. Roadmap Execution, Audits, and Credibility This is not a whitepaper fantasy. SolidProof and Coinsult have completed full smart contract audits. The roadmap is public, deadlines are being met, and features are shipping on time. While other meme coins lean on hype, Pepeto is stacking real-world delivery, which is exactly what the market rewards in the current cycle. ROI Scenarios: Can $2,000 Realistically Turn Into $1,000,000? Base Case: Early Listing Advantage At today’s presale price of $0.000000147 , $2,000 secures 13.61 billion tokens . If Pepeto lists at $0.0000003 , that’s already $4,082 . That is just the warm-up phase, the point where whales start noticing. Mid-Term Outlook: The Real Money Zone In the next 12–24 months, if Pepeto hits $0.00000725 , that same bag is worth about $98,600 . At $0.00003625 , it’s nearly $493,000 . This is the kind of move crypto has printed before when strong narratives meet visible product delivery. Pepeto’s zero-tax policy, live cross-chain bridge, and zero-fee exchange give it an advantage most meme coins never have. Long-Term Outlook: The Moonshot Some projections put Pepeto near $0.00725 . If that happens, a $2,000 buy today could balloon to $98.64 million . Even at half that, it’s $49 million . These numbers may sound extreme, but they are backed by the same explosive math that made early SHIB and PEPE investors generational gains, with Pepeto offering even more infrastructure to support sustained growth. The Road to $1 Million: How Pepeto Could Make It Happen This isn’t about hoping, it’s pure math. A $2,000 buy at $0.000000147 gets you ~13.61B tokens . At $0.0000725 , you’re sitting on roughly $986,000 . Just a small push higher to $0.0000735 , and you have crossed $1 million. That is a 500x move from here, and history says it’s possible when utility meets hype in a bullish market. Price Outlook Into the Next Market Cycle By late 2025 or early 2026, Pepeto could realistically trade between $0.00000725 and $0.00003625 , depending on listings, adoption, and market sentiment. That is an upside of 4,832% to 24,560% from presale, and unlike many competitors, Pepeto will hit those levels with working products already live. Closing Thoughts A $2,000 stake today could grow into $100K, $500K, or even $1M if the mid to high targets land. This is why smart money enters before a Tier-1 listing announcement, not after. The Bitcoin halving will flood the market with new liquidity and risk appetite. Pepeto has the utility, branding, and momentum to be one of the cycle’s breakout winners. What looks like a quiet presale today could be the entry point that turns early buyers into the next cycle’s biggest success stories.

At the center of this momentum is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Ethereum (ETH). Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced at $0.035 in presale phase 6. In phase 7, the price will increase by 14.29% to $0.04.

Alongside Ethereum’s ongoing network upgrades, Mutuum Finance is performing well in presale. Ethereum Positioned for Further Gains as 2025 Advances Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $4,752, hovering near its prior all-time high amid strengthened institutional demand, regulatory tailwinds, and strategic network upgrades. Momentum is being driven by factors including ETF inflows, the Pectra upgrade, and broader macroeconomic support, prompting major institutions like Standard Chartered to revise their year-end price forecast for ETH to $7,500, up from previous targets around $4,000. Meanwhile, record open interest in Ethereum derivatives and a looming short squeeze suggest short-term volatility, although the long-term trend maintains a bullish tilt. As ETH continues to lead the market, emergent DeFi platforms like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also drawing growing attention in trader and investor narratives. Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Presale Is Now Open Mutuum Finance is in presale Stage 6 now, and the tokens are being sold at $0.035, an increase of 16.17% from the previous stage. The subsequent price hike will put the price at $0.04, an increase of 14.29%. Presale has been successful so far with over 15250 holders and over $14.45 million raised to date, reflecting strong and growing interest in the project. Mutuum Finance is a P2C and P2P lending protocol where customers can yield high returns with complete control over funds. It’s a DeFi end-to-end experience perfectly tailored to the customer’s needs and more secure, transparent, and flexible than centralized lending products. US Dollar–Pegged Stablecoin Mutuum Finance will launch a USD-pegged stablecoin that is fully collateralized on the Ethereum blockchain. The project is also audited and certified by CertiK. Together with the investors’ guarantee of transparency and integrity of code base, the auditing guarantees that the project will indeed build a safe DeFi protocol. The project also initiated a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. Four kinds of vulnerabilities to be rewarded are classified as critical, major, minor and low. Mutuum Finance Launches Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway to hype up its base. 10 investors stand to win $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. The giveaway not only attracts new investors, but it’s also a sign that the project is willing to go the extra mile to build a long-term community. Mutuum Finance Scores 95.0 Trust Score in CertiK Audit CertiK smart contract audit has flagged Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as safe with a trust score of 95.0/100. The platform is offering a secure environment to conduct DeFi operations. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is connecting new lending potential with the strength of an ecosystem, and with a clear direction towards the future of DeFi. Ethereum (ETH) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are leading 2025’s short-term crypto plays. ETH targets $7,500 on strong institutional inflows, while MUTM has raised $14.45M from 15,250 investors at $0.035, set to rise 14.29% next stage. With 200%+ ROI potential, a 95.0 CertiK score, and a $100K giveaway, now is the time to join the MUTM presale before the price moves up.

The cost of the project is $0.0944 per token, and the interest is growing at a rapid pace. Investors are closely watching, especially with the promise of a major centralized exchange (CEX) listing announcement when it hits the target. This has made Remittix one of the most talked-about crypto presales in 2025. XRP Market Performance Provides Context to the Hype As Remittix is making headlines due to its success, Ripple’s XRP is still a force to be reckoned with in the market. According to CoinMarketCap’s data on XRP, the token trades at $3.04 as it loses 1.71% in the last 24 hours. It has a total market capitalization of $180.34 billion and trading volume of $7.35 billion, which has fallen by 37.45%. That kind of liquidity and adoption is what new projects like Remittix are hoping to achieve in the future. Remittix: Solving Real-World Payment Problems Remittix is expected to build a low gas fee crypto network that is designed for global payments. The platform enables individuals to send cryptos like BTC, ETH, and USDT into bank accounts in 30+ nations directly within minutes. Having native 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat support at launch, it’s positioning itself as one of the best DeFi projects 2025 for practical application. Among its highlights is the soon-to-be-released Q3 beta version of the Remittix wallet — an off-ramping-capable, mobile-first, real-time FX conversion app. This offering could resonate with freelancers, businesses, and ordinary crypto users as an instrument of fast and cheap global payments. Why Remittix Is Gathering Momentum Global presence through crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries Low gas charge cryptocurrency solution for daily transactions Over 601 million RTX tokens sold during presale $250,000 Remittix giveaway fueling community engagement Q3 2025 beta wallet launch strategy Remittix Poised for $20M Presale Milestone and CEX Announcement The $20 Million presale milestone is more than a number — it triggers the release of Remittix’s first CEX listing. This will bring forth increased liquidity, worldwide awareness, and accessibility for holders of RTX. With 40% token reward still up for grabs, early adopters have huge upside potential before listings go live. The project’s union of utility, expanding use, and strong tokenomics is attracting the attention of investors seeking the next big altcoin 2025. Amidst an industry that is usually plagued by hype, Remittix is providing practical applications to a $19 trillion global payments space. If its development continues on course, Remittix could be one of the top crypto under $1 with real utility — a rare breed that’s increasingly difficult to find in today’s crypto landscape.

Analysts Debate the $15K ETH “Flippening” Prediction,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/ethereum-to-overtake-bitcoin-by-2026-analysts-debate-the-15k-eth-flippening-prediction/,"Ethereum’s growing market share is fueling debates over whether it could overtake Bitcoin in the next 12 months — a shift known as the “flippening.” With rising institutional interest and strong market performance, some see ETH as the best crypto to buy now for those betting on change at the top. Ethereum’s Rising Strength Against Bitcoin Ethereum’s market capitalization has reached around $580 billion, building steady gains since early August. Traders note ETH has broken above key resistance at $510 billion, with short-term targets near $800 billion and $1 trillion. This pace has outperformed Bitcoin’s percentage growth over the same period, making ETH a contender for the best crypto to buy now narrative. Analysts point to institutional accumulation, increasing DeFi adoption, and capital inflows from ETFs outpacing BTC as core drivers. According to Joseph Lubin, Ethereum’s co-founder, ETH could match Bitcoin’s market cap as soon as 2026. If ETH’s growth continues at even 1.5x BTC’s rate, the crossover could be closer than many expect. Notably, the Ethereum price needs to reach $25,000 to hit $3 trillion cap to overtake Bitcoin Bitcoin’s Market Position and Outlook Bitcoin’s market cap stands near $2.4 trillion, recovering from a period of sideways trading. A recent move above the mid-Bollinger Band and resistance at $2.35 trillion suggests renewed bullish control, but its growth rate is currently less aggressive than Ethereum’s. To maintain dominance, BTC must break resistance near $2.5 trillion, with targets at $2.65 trillion and $3 trillion. Holding above $2.3 trillion remains critical for stability. While Bitcoin’s status as “digital gold” is secure, investors seeking higher upside in the short-to-mid term are increasingly weighing ETH as the best crypto to buy now, given its faster rebound and broader utility in DeFi and staking ecosystems. With Bitcoin hitting $124,000 peak in August, futher upside will widen the gap between it and Ethereum, weakening its prospect of fliping BTC. An Altcoin With a Promising Outlook As the ETH vs BTC debate intensifies, new projects are also attracting attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as an altcoin with a promising outlook thanks to its active presale phase and strong positioning in the market. While the top two cryptocurrencies battle for dominance, MAGACOIN is carving its own space with features that appeal to both crypto enthusiasts and newcomers — putting it in conversations around the best crypto to buy now for diversified exposure. Conclusion Ethereum’s upward trajectory and growing adoption have reignited discussions about a possible flippening. Bitcoin still holds the lead, but ETH’s faster growth and expanding utility keep it in the race. At the same time, emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer alternative opportunities for those looking beyond the top two digital assets.

This move comes as the securities regulator is expected to communicate its approval decision on the proposed ETF around mid-October 2025. Related Reading: US Treasury Secretary Reveals What Will Be The Foundation Of The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve The Grayscale Dogecoin Trust (DOGE) In February 2025, the SEC popularly acknowledged the 19-4b form by the New York Stock Exchange to list and trade Grayscale Dogecoin Trust as an exchange-traded fund (ETF). In doing so, the Commission initiated a potential 240-day review of the application, during which the ETF sponsor, i.e., Grayscale, is expected to register the shares of the proposed product. On August 15, 2025, the asset manager completed this crucial step with the submission of the Form S-1 registration statement for the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust. According to the content of the document, the proposed ETF is structured as a Delaware Statutory Trust, designed to give investors exposure to Dogecoin through a familiar investment vehicle without requiring them to hold or manage the cryptocurrency directly.The trust issues shares that represent fractional undivided beneficial interests in its underlying Dogecoin holdings, with the value of each share closely tied to the market price of the asset. As with spot ETFs, the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust is physically backed, meaning that every share issued corresponds to actual Dogecoin. Meanwhile, Coinbase Custody Trust Company acts as the custodian, responsible for safeguarding the trust’s Dogecoin holdings, while Coinbase Inc. and the Bank of New York Mellon (BNY) act as prime broker and administrator/transfer agent of the trust, respectively. In addition, the Trust only accepts cash orders for share creation or redemption. Only authorized participants can create and redeem shares in exchange for the underlying asset, a mechanism designed to keep the share price aligned with the NAV. DOGE Surges By 5% After Grayscale News Following Grayscale’s Form S-1 submission, Dogecoin has recorded a 5% price increase, reaching a price point of $0.2334.This latest rally has strengthened the meme token’s bullish structure, pushing its monthly gains to 8.91%.According to the price forecast site CoinCodex , general sentiment among DOGE investors remains bullish, with the Fear & Greed sitting around 60. However, Coincodex analysts predict the current market uptick would be short-lived, with projections of $0.224 in five days, followed by a stronger rebound to $0.266 in one month. Meanwhile, their long-term projections tip the memcoin to trade around $0.268 in three months.",Dogecoin|Dogecoin spot etf|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Grayscale|Grayscale Dogecoin Trust.,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|TRADING|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-16 15:00:40

Speaking on CNBC , Rieder described “extraordinary” technical conditions in equities, with trillions of dollars still parked in money market funds and robust corporate buybacks shrinking available supply. While valuations for the market’s largest technology names remain elevated, he noted that earnings growth outside Tesla helped justify the multiples. “MAG-7 year-on-year growth is like 54%,” he said, adding that the pace makes the sector difficult to ignore. On the bond side, Rieder highlighted the appeal of income. Investors can still build portfolios yielding between 6.5% and 7%, a level he described as highly attractive in a world where inflation has drifted below 3% on a core basis. He argued that while the Federal Reserve has room to cut rates — potentially starting as soon as September — current yields already offer investors solid returns. 'Crazy low' volatility Rieder also emphasized today’s unusually subdued volatility. He described trading equity volatility, or “vol,” at levels near 9.5 to 10, which he called “crazy low.” Low volatility, he said, makes hedging against downside risk relatively cheap, giving investors what he called an “escape hatch” if conditions sour. “You don’t actually have to take the downside risk,” Rieder said. Still, Rieder cautioned that complacency is his biggest concern. With insurance in markets so inexpensive, he sees signs investors may be underestimating risks, particularly in credit spreads and other corners of fixed income. Fed's interest rate On monetary policy, Rieder argued the Fed’s rate hikes have done little to suppress inflation, given that large corporations rely less on borrowing to finance investment. The real drag, he said, has been on housing activity and lower-income households that depend more heavily on credit. Keeping rates too high, he warned, risks imposing excessive costs on the government and households without meaningful disinflation gains. He believes the central bank could lower the funds rate by as much as 100 basis points over the coming year, a move he sees as unlikely to rekindle inflation given low structural volatility and rising productivity from advances in data, hyperscale computing and even space-related technologies. “There’s something spectacular happening around productivity,” he said, calling it a once-in-a-generation dynamic. For crypto investors, Rieder’s comments reinforce a broader narrative: an environment with falling rates, ample liquidity, and low volatility could support renewed appetite for risk assets beyond equities. If his call proves correct, the same technical tailwinds driving stocks higher could spill into digital assets that thrive on excess cash and investor risk-taking.",Markets|fixed-income|Markets|Investing|News,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-16 15:00:52

On August 15, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published Gemini’s S-1 registration statement. The filing gives investors and the public a clearer view of the company’s finances, business, and IPO plans. It also highlights both the opportunities and the challenges Gemini faces as it prepares to compete with exchanges like Coinbase and Bullish. Gemini’s Plan for a Nasdaq Listing Gemini first submitted a draft registration to the SEC in private in June 2025. Now, the publicly released document shows the company’s intentions to become a public company. If approved, Gemini plans to list its stock on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “GEMI”. The filing also revealed the major banks behind the IPO process. Goldman Sachs, Citi, Morgan Stanley, and Cantor will act as bookrunners. This means they will manage the offering, set pricing, and help bring investors on board. The filing does not yet include an IPO price or timeline. However, Gemini’s entry into the market would make it the third U.S.-listed crypto exchange. It follows Coinbase, which went public in 2021, and Bullish, which debuted on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) earlier this week. Financial Results Show Heavy Losses The S-1 filing gives a clear look at Gemini’s finances, showing that the company is facing serious challenges. In the first half of 2025, Gemini reported a net loss of $282.5 million, a big jump from the $41.4 million loss in the same period of 2024. Its adjusted EBITDA also fell sharply, moving from a $32 million profit in early 2024 to a $113.5 million loss in 2025. For the full year 2024, Gemini posted a net loss of $158.5 million on $142.2 million in revenue. These results show that even with a well-known brand and long presence in the crypto space, Gemini is still struggling to make a profit. The IPO may be a way to bring in new funds to support its operations and growth. Gemini Set to Move Users from New York to Florida Gemini plans to move most users to a new Florida-based unit called Moonbase, while Gemini Trust stays in New York. The shift comes because New York has strict crypto rules under its BitLicense framework. By moving to Florida, Gemini hopes for a simpler environment to grow its business. To add more flexibility, Gemini has secured a $75 million credit line from Ripple, which could grow to $150 million if needed. The loan is in Ripple’s new stablecoin, RLUSD, which has gained widespread adoption and popularity . Gemini has not used the funds yet, but it gives the company a backup plan as it works on its IPO.

In 2028, TRX will range between $1.36 and $1.56, with an average price of $1.46. In 2031, TRX will range between $2.33 and $2.53, with an average price of $2.43. TRX is the native token of the Tron network used to govern and settle transaction fees. In retrospect, Tron (TRX) has performed better than most mega-altcoins. Over the long term, TRX is set to trend higher. Is TRX a good investment? Will it go up? Where will it be in three years? Let’s get into the TRX price prediction to answer these questions and more.

Cryptocurrency loses 1.52% of its value. TRX coin prices target the next support at $0.339. On August 16, 2025, Tron price analysis revealed a decreasing trend for the cryptocurrency. The coin’s value decreased to a low of $0.349 in the past 24 hours. Concurrently, the cryptocurrency lost 1.52% of its value today. Buyers were ruling the market until August 13, but the correction has entered a third consecutive day as the profit taking continues. As a result, further depreciation is ongoing; however, the altcoin still trends near its yearly high. TRX/USD 1-day chart analysis The one-day price chart of Tron coin confirmed a downward trend in the market. The coin price has decreased to $0.349 over the day. Red candlesticks on the price chart signify a rising selling momentum, as the coin has not found support yet. TRX/USD 1-day price chart The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is increasing, leading to increased volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $0.361. Whereby, its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.314. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is hovering within the neutral area for now, but it is near the border of the overbought region. The indicator’s value is present at index 64.60 in the past 24 hours. The downward curve on the RSI graph reflects an unbalanced market setup.

Tron historic price sentiment TRON price history Tron, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, raised $70 million through an ICO the same year; it launched its mainnet in May 2018 and migrated TRX from Ethereum to Tron in June, which temporarily boosted TRX’s price to $0.09. TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again. In 2021, it reached a high of $0.16. Tron was also reorganized as a DAO as Justin stepped down as CEO of Tron Foundation. TRX was in a bear trend for the best part of 2022. In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touching $0.2130 in late November. TRX ended 2024 with a price tag of $0.255. Tron was priced at $0.255 at the start of January 2025 and it was trading in a range of $0.204 to $0.257 in February. In March 2025, Tron (TRX) dipped to $0.212, but it recovered to the $0.23 range in April and $0.278 in May. At the start of August, Tron is trending near the $0.324 range, maintaining its price above $0.31.",Crypto Price Predictions|TRON,EN,0,0,MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|TRX|ICO|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|BNB|RESEARCH|LINK|ASIA|USDT|USDD|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-16 15:13:00

The slides outline the current state of competition in the cross-border payments sector and the requirements for any system aiming to disrupt the traditional correspondent banking model. Content of the Slides The presentation begins by referencing the concept of “disruptive innovation,” attributed to the renowned Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen. It highlights that technology acts as an enabler, but that a new business model is the key driver of meaningful change. Examples include industries disrupted by companies that do not own the assets traditionally associated with their sector. The slides then address correspondent banking directly, stating that for any alternative to disrupt the model, it must achieve global reach across all countries and currencies, provide a viable Nostro/Vostro account alternative for settlement, gain regulatory support from authorities familiar with existing systems, justify implementation costs through measurable savings, and deliver superior service to customers. A separate slide outlines the high level of competition in cross-border payments through a network diagram. This includes both legacy providers and newer entrants. Ripple and Stellar are displayed alongside other companies and platforms, such as PayPal, TransferWise, Western Union, Ria, MoneyGram, Xoom, CurrencyFair, WorldRemit, Bitcoin , Payoneer, and Align Commerce. A vertical label on the slide reads “Correspondent Banking disintermediation,” suggesting that these competitors are part of a broader trend toward bypassing or streamlining traditional banking pathways. Ripple and Stellar featured in SWIFT presentation during discussion of replacing traditional correspondent banking pic.twitter.com/iZrZYOyuz4 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 15, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple and Stellar’s Placement Ripple and Stellar are positioned within the graphic as players offering faster and more direct alternatives for cross-border settlement . Their inclusion alongside both major remittance companies and digital payment providers indicates that the presentation views them as part of a competitive field that is already influencing the sector. However, the “not yet” assessment on full disruption shows that SWIFT considers the correspondent banking model still intact, even as competition grows. Commentary from Denis Samkov In a response to SMQKE’s post, an X user, Denis Samkov, interpreted the mention of Ripple and Stellar as evidence of an ongoing shift in payment systems. He cautioned that while the inclusion reflects change, entrenched banking practices remain resistant to rapid transformation. He also noted that despite current interest in stablecoins, traditional financial structures will not be replaced in the near term. The slides shared by SMQKE reveal that SWIFT acknowledges Ripple and Stellar as part of a competitive environment affecting cross-border payments. While the organisation does not yet classify correspondent banking as disrupted, it recognises that alternative networks are creating genuine competitive pressure.

Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Cantor acting as lead bookrunners on the IPO, Gemini said in a press release Friday. Evercore ISI, Mizuho, Truist Securities, Cohen & Company Capital Markets, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Needham & Company and Rosenblatt are also acting as bookrunners, the company said. Academy Securities and AmeriVet Securities are acting as co-managers. The S-1 published on Friday follows a confidential filing submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission back in June , and confirms ""Gemini Space Station,"" co-founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, intends to sell an undisclosed number of Class A shares. Gemini's filing indicated that it had generated total revenue of $142.2 million in 2024, up from $98.1 million the prior year. For the six months ending on June 30, 2025, the total revenue was $68.6 million, down from $74.3 million in the first six months of 2024. Its net loss in 2024 stood at $158.6 million, compared to $319.7 million in 2023. That figure stood at $282.5 million for the first six months of 2025. Its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for 2024 stood at a loss of $13.2 million, and a loss of $113.5 million for the first half of 2025. Like other crypto firms, Gemini pointed to standard risks in the risk portion of the filing, including the general nature of blockchain networks and how banks and regulators view the industry. ""Key factors influencing the further development of blockchain networks and digital assets include the global adoption of digital assets and blockchain technology; regulatory and quasi-government restrictions on access to and operation of blockchain networks; and the maintenance of open source protocols that support blockchain networks,"" the filing said. Gemini is only the latest crypto company to try and go public this year, following Circle (CRCL), eToro (ETOR) and CoinDesk parent company Bullish (BLSH). BitGo has filed for paperwork to go public as well. Gemini plans to list its Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol GEMI.

McClurg stated that one of the main reasons for the rise in Bitcoin's price is strong institutional inflows into spot ETFs. He noted that large investment funds, as well as some sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and insurance companies, have also shown interest in Bitcoin. McClurg also highlighted advances in crypto regulation in the US, stating that altcoin ETFs could launch next September or October thanks to the SEC's new “general listing standards.” He also described the passage of the stablecoin regulatory law as a turning point for the industry. Related News: New Document Submitted to Court in Ripple-SEC Case - What is the Latest Situation for XRP? McClurg said that Bitcoin could rise to $150,000 if the FED cuts interest rates, but added that increasing credit card, student loan and mortgage defaults would weaken consumer demand in the US economy and pave the way for a bear market in 2026. McClurg, who argued that they were cautious about Ethereum and that the technology was outdated, announced that they had applied for a spot ETF for Litecoin. “Litecoin has always been considered the silver of Bitcoin,” McClurg said. “Thanks to code updates and Ordinals integration, it's regaining its strength.” *This is not investment advice.

Alongside ADA, Chainlink (LINK) is showing strong bullish patterns, while Remittix (RTX) continues its meteoric rise, capturing attention from whales and retail investors alike. Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Presses Toward $1.00 Cardano has climbed to its highest level in five months, finally escaping a descending parallel channel that constrained prices for over 250 days. The ADA price validated the $0.60 support area multiple times, forming a triple bottom that fueled the July upward momentum. Chart patterns and wave analysis also point to continued growth. ADA is currently in the third wave of a five-wave upward cycle, which could extend to $1.84. Historical breakouts from similar long-term channels have led to sustained gains of over 176%, reinforcing this bullish Cardano price prediction. Correction waves are possible, but the trend suggests a strong parabolic move is underway. Chainlink Price Eyes Breakout Above $36 Chainlink (LINK) is forming multiple bullish patterns, including a double bottom and an inverse head-and-shoulders setup. The double bottom shows strong accumulation at the $36 level, while the inverse head-and-shoulders signals potential buyer dominance. According to analysts, a confirmed breach of $36 may open the way to $52, aligning with 2025 growth expectations. The technical indicators also indicate that LINK buyers are not resting on their oars as they continue to buy even on the pullback, implying that the upward trend will continue. Resistance at $36 is critical: a breakout and successful retest could trigger significant inflows from traders seeking gains during the next parabolic leg. Why Remittix Is the Altcoin Everyone Is Watching Remittix (RTX) is currently priced at $0.0944, having raised over $19.7 million and sold 602 million tokens. With a 40% bonus for early backers and a wallet beta launch in Q3, the project is attracting investors looking for utility-driven gains. Remittix will reveal the name of its first CEX listing once it hits $20M, offering additional momentum and liquidity for the growing token. Remittix Key Highlights Real-world utility in cross-border payments and crypto-to-fiat transactions. 40% token bonus incentivizing early adoption. Q3 wallet beta scheduled with multi-currency support. High-growth potential beyond speculative altcoins. CEX listing is poised to boost exposure and trading volume. Conclusion: Balancing Technical Breakouts With Real-World Utility The Cardano price prediction for 2025 suggests continued bullish movement toward $1.00, while LINK charts hint at a potential breakout above $36. Yet, Remittix provides a unique proposition with real-world adoption, a strong community and a clear roadmap toward broader exchange listings. Investors seeking growth and utility are increasingly eyeing RTX as the breakout altcoin of the year, complementing technical trades in ADA and LINK.

The US-based exchange began the year holding a 7% share of the global crypto trading market, but by July, its dominance had fallen to just 5.8%. COIN shares slumped as Coinbase failed to capitalize on positive US regulatory sentiment. Big Volume, Shrinking Power According to the latest report by CoinGecko, this decline positions Coinbase as the ninth-largest exchange globally. Trading volumes in July climbed to $101.7 billion, reflecting an increase from June but not enough to offset its shrinking market share. Despite its early-year strength and the broader adoption of digital assets, the crypto exchange has struggled to maintain its leading position amid growing competition from both domestic and international exchanges, as challenges in retaining users and trading activity grow. CoinGecko revealed that trading activity on seven of the top 10 crypto exchanges declined in Q2 2025. Six of them were found to have recorded double-digit losses. Crypto.com led the decline with over a 61% drop in volume from $560.2 billion in Q1 to $216.4 billion. Combined trading volumes across the top 10 exchanges fell by 27.7%, a $1.5 trillion decrease, which left total volumes at $3.9 trillion for the quarter. Binance Outpaces Rivals Binance continued to dominate centralized exchanges in July 2025, as it captured almost 40% of total spot trading volume. Its trading volume jumped 61.4% month-on-month to $698.3 billion, boosted by strong crypto market momentum and Bitcoin reaching record highs. For Q2, Binance held a 38% market share among the top 10 exchanges and generated $1.47 trillion in trading volume. However, the exchange’s activity remained down 21.6% compared to Q1, which logged $2.0 trillion. Meanwhile, MEXC secured the second spot among centralized exchanges for the month, as it recorded $150.4 billion in spot trading volume and an 8.6% market share. Volume surged 61.8% from June’s $93.0 billion – its second-best monthly performance after May’s $163.1 billion. Across Q2, MEXC processed $346.2 billion in volume, up from $334.0 billion in the previous quarter. The exchange climbed from eighth place in Q1 to second by July.

50187468,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=805700,1755358209,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/50187468.jpeg,XRP Takes On Live TV: Analyst Predicts Surge To $13 If This Happens,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-prepares-for-surge-to-13/,"Oliver Michael, the CEO of Tokentus, has again provided a bullish outlook for XRP. This time, he predicted that the altcoin could reach as high as $13 and outlined factors that could serve as catalysts for this significant price surge. XRP Eyes Surge To $13 With These Catalysts Oliver Michael predicted in an interview that XRP could rally to $13 at some point if it sustained its current bullish momentum. He alluded to the Ripple SEC lawsuit, which just concluded and how it could spark several ripple effects, which would act as catalysts for the next leg up for the third-largest crypto by market cap. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Pump Always Comes After This Happens One of these ripple effects is the potential approval of the XRP ETFs. Michael noted that the SEC can now go on to approve these funds since the legal battle against Ripple is over. Furthermore, he raised the possibility of BlackRock filing for an XRP ETF and indicated that the altcoin is likely to record a parabolic rally if this happens, considering BlackRock’s position as the world’s largest asset manager. It is worth noting that BlackRock has said that it has no plans to file for an XRP ETF at the moment. However, XRP lawyer John Deaton believes that the world’s largest asset manager will still file to offer this fund within a year from now. If so, this could drive significant inflows into the XRP ecosystem, considering the success that the firm has recorded with its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. More Catalysts For The Altcoin Meanwhile, Oliver Michael also expects more Ripple partners to emerge now that the SEC lawsuit is over. This will help enhance XRP’s utility as more companies adopt Ripple’s payment services. Notably, the crypto firm has also made great strides to expand its presence globally by acquiring platforms like the stablecoin platform Rail and brokerage firm Hidden Road. Related Reading: XRP Price At $36: 7-Year Bottom Breakout Could Trigger Repeat Of 2014-2017 Another reason why the Tokentus CEO believes that XRP can reach this $13 price level is based on his expectation that retail investors will develop a greater interest in the altcoin now that Bitcoin and Ethereum have already pumped significantly. Therefore, they will turn to XRP as the third-largest crypto, which may have more upside than BTC and ETH. Michael remarked that XRP’s move to the upside could happen really fast, similar to its rally of over 300% from below $1 to $3 last year. The altcoin already rallied to as high as $3.6 this year, boasting a 33% year-to-date (YTD) gain. However, based on Michael’s prediction, the XRP price could still reach new highs in the coming months. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $3.10, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

50188884,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/3-reasons-why-you-should-buy-solana-not-ethereum/,1755360000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50188884.jpeg,3 Reasons Why You Should Buy Solana Not Ethereum,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/3-reasons-why-you-should-buy-solana-not-ethereum/,"Ethereum has long been the established powerhouse in the never-ending struggle for supremacy in the cryptocurrency space. It is a mainstay in most portfolios due to its extensive developer network, DeFi ecosystem, and first-mover advantage. However, in 2025, the market rewards speed , scalability, and innovation in addition to legacy players. Solana is taking center stage there. Solana is becoming more and more regarded as the more nimble competitor thanks to its lightning – fast transactions, extremely low fees, and growing portfolio of well-known projects. Additionally, new opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is rated as the best cryptocurrency presale for next-cycle wealth positioning, are rapidly becoming on watchlists for investors seeking not only growth but potentially explosive returns that go beyond what big-cap coins can provide. 1. A competitive advantage in practical applications Its own weight is Ethereum’s greatest obstacle, not a lack of adoption. High gas prices and network congestion continue to be barriers for small-scale projects and retail users despite improvements . On the other hand, Solana has proven that it can handle more than 65,000 transactions per second without the cost of each transfer going out of control. Because of its performance, SocialFi apps, NFT marketplaces, and gaming platforms that require speed to maintain user engagement have come to love it. 2. A lower entry barrier for users and developers Early-stage developers may be priced out by the expense of implementing and interacting with Ethereum smart contracts. Builders and users who might otherwise be put off are drawn to Solana because of its more affordable fees and user-friendly atmosphere. Because of this, there is now a robust grassroots ecosystem that can quickly iterate, take advantage of trends, and onboard users without the kind of friction Ethereum still faces. The outcome? Increased market mindshare, quicker product cycles, and a more welcoming atmosphere for experimentation. Some investors are quietly searching for the kind of returns that can only be obtained by spotting a project before it takes off , even as Solana continues to make headlines for its speed and scalability. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE, which was just named the best cryptocurrency presale for next-cycle wealth positioning, is making a splash. The project has been creating a close-knit community, selling out presale rounds quickly, and outlining a roadmap that combines practicality and cultural significance, so it’s not just hype. MAGACOIN FINANCE provides a unique blend of early entry, solid fundamentals, and the potential to multiply capital much more quickly than well-known giants can for traders who are looking beyond big-cap coins. 3. Strategic diversification for the upcoming cycle The most astute traders are aware that Solana and Ethereum are not mutually exclusive . Both are important components of a multifaceted approach. While Solana provides the upside potential of a more agile chain in breakout sectors, Ethereum continues to be a strong base layer for stability. However, many are looking even lower down the market cap ladder, into early-stage projects where the upside isn’t capped by size, if the objective is to position for maximum gains in the next market expansion. Solana’s momentum may continue well into 2025. According to analysts monitoring Solana’s on-chain data, there has been consistent developer activity, institutional interest has grown, and the platform has become more integrated with mainstream finance platforms. Even if Ethereum maintains its larger market capitalization, SOL may see further price growth in the upcoming months if these trends continue, possibly surpassing Ethereum in percentage terms. Solana is still a strong investment for traders seeking exposure to the most flexible Layer 1 with demonstrated throughput. Concluding remarks: combining opportunity and stability Finding a balance between established leaders and up-and-coming contenders may be more important for the future of cryptocurrency portfolios than picking one giant over another. Solana is demonstrating its ability to provide speed , scalability, and adoption at a level that puts Ethereum’s hegemony to the test. Combining Solana’s momentum with an investment in early-stage opportunities such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is ranked as the best cryptocurrency presale for next-cycle wealth positioning, could be the formula that determines the 2025 winners for those seeking asymmetric returns in the upcoming cycle.

Its next price increase will have the token reaching $0.04 in phase 7. Early investors who have placed themselves at position are set to earn minimum 400% returns once the token is live. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale exceeded more than $14.45 million raised and had more than 15250 token holders. Mutuum Finance could be one of 2025’s trendsetters. With Q3 market sentiment tentatively positive for well-established names like ETH, Mutuum Finance’s quickening development roadmap, putting it firmly in the watchlist for the next phase of decentralized finance expansion. Ethereum Extends Q3 Strength Above Key Levels Ethereum (ETH) trades at $4,760.74, maintaining its position following recent gains that have solidified its position as the leading smart contract platform. Market observers note that ongoing institutional investor appetite, ongoing network upgrade momentum, and ongoing DeFi activity growth are fueling strength on ETH in the third quarter. If this stability is maintained, Ethereum can continue to remain a token of attention for overall market sentiment, while newer DeFi projects like Mutuum Finance look to capitalize on the same wave of investor interest. Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Presale is Live Now Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has hit the sixth stage of presale at $0.035 following stage 5 sell-out. The cost will rise to $0.04 in the subsequent phase, a boost of 14.29%. Mutuum Finance early investors will make over 400% as MUTM grows in the marketplace. MUTM presale has already hit over $14.45 million and has onboarded over 15250 individual investors so far, which indicates the project’s rapid progress. Mutuum Finance Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance is organizing a $100,000 giveaway . 10 people will receive $10,000 each of Mutuum Finance Tokens. The giveaway is the vast scale of commitment that the project has to establish a long-term and committed community. In yet another move towards security and transparency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched an Official Bug Bounty Program in association with CertiK. The project team is calling on participants for the reward of up to a 50,000 USDT to find likely vulnerabilities of the project. The purpose of the bounty program is to have good coverage for all severity classes of vulnerabilities. It is separated into the four severity classes; i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. The project also shows the team’s commitment towards ecosystem security as well as investor trust. The Next Generation of DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi protocol that is non-custodial. The Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending are offered by the team with the long-term goal of efficiency and flexibility. Peer-to-Contract platform leverages the capability of smart contracts in loan transferring with minimal or no human mediation. Peer-to-Peer framework eliminates middlemen and enables borrowers and lenders to trade directly between themselves. The platform is very simple to deal with risky assets like meme coins. Ethereum’s Q3 stability over $4,760 indicates its consistent supremacy, yet Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving to be the high-growth crypto of 2025. With a value of $0.035 in presale phase 6 with more than $14.45 million raised from more than 15,250 investors, MUTM has a 14.29% price hike programmed for the next phase and could give more than 400% returns post-launch. Supported by a twin lending model, a USD-pegged stablecoin, a 95.0 CertiK trust score, and a $100,000 community giveaway, the project reconciles security and innovation. Investors looking to get in on the action before the next price surge need to move now to take advantage of one of the DeFi opportunity’s most attractive prospects before momentum builds further.

Alongside XRP, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are drawing attention from analysts as some of the best crypto to buy now. XRP Could Surge on ETF Approval and $5B Inflows XRP is at the center of speculation after Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg predicted that an approved XRP ETF could attract $5 billion in inflows during its first month. Speaking on a podcast, McClurg explained that, unlike Ethereum, XRP holders have no staking incentives to bypass ETFs, which could make the product more attractive. He also pointed to XRP’s leadership in the payments sector, where competition is limited, and its strong global community, which could accelerate ETF demand. Historical data supports this potential—market analyst Dom found that just $61 million in buying pressure once pushed XRP’s market cap up by $16.6 billion, a 272x multiplier. Applying this to McClurg’s $5 billion estimate would theoretically push XRP toward $26, although conservative estimates put the post-ETF range at $3.99–$4.41. For investors tracking the best crypto to buy now, XRP’s ETF catalyst remains a major watchpoint. Notably, an approval is expected by October 2025. Solana’s Price Moves and ETF Decision Delay Solana (SOL) recently touched $210 before settling around $190, marking its highest level since July. The gains came as DeFi Development Corp. disclosed it had purchased 110,000 SOL—valued at $22 million—bringing its total holdings to over $270 million. The firm stakes these tokens to generate yield and operates validator infrastructure on the network. However, the SEC delayed decisions on Solana ETF proposals from Bitwise and 21Shares until October 16, 2025, extending its review to address regulatory, technical, and market concerns. This includes questions about Solana’s classification as a security or commodity and ensuring adequate investor protections. While some investors reduced positions after the delay, others see the ongoing interest from institutional buyers as a reason Solana remains on the list of the best crypto to buy now—especially if ETF approval arrives later this year. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Another Promising Altcoin to Buy Now MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction, having raised over $11.7 million. The ERC-20 token runs on a security-first model, is fully audited, and offers zero-tax transactions. Its early performance has outpaced some new market entrants, and analysts see further upside as listings are anticipated. For buyers exploring the best crypto to buy now, MAGACOIN’s ongoing presale offers early access before potential exchange launches. Key Takeaway The XRP ETF decision could be a defining event for the crypto market. XRP’s unique ETF advantage, Solana’s institutional backing despite regulatory delays, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale growth all highlight why these assets are being flagged as the best crypto to buy now.

Cardano (ADA) is holding at a key resistance level near $0.86, Avalanche (AVAX) is building momentum toward $65 with the help of its Filecoin integration, and BlockDAG is strengthening its case with a $375M presale and scalable mining hardware. While ADA and AVAX are playing out on price charts, BlockDAG is creating an ecosystem designed for sustainability. With its X-Series Miners, guaranteed exchange listings, and a referral system fueling community growth, BDAG’s strategy is pushing it forward as a major contender among the top crypto coins of 2025. Cardano (ADA) Price Outlook – Testing the $0.86 Ceiling Cardano is trading at $0.849, marking a modest 1% gain as it tests the $0.85–$0.86 resistance range. This level has become a defining point, with multiple retests hinting at a possible breakout. A close above $0.919, which represents the 50% Fibonacci retracement, could open the way to $0.97, and potentially $1.015 at the higher timeframe Fib 0.618 level. On the 4H chart, ADA has reclaimed its EMA cluster, with the 20 EMA ($0.810) and 50 EMA ($0.791) now acting as support. The RSI reading of 60.14 signals consolidation rather than exhaustion. If ADA clears $0.86, the next moves could target $0.90–$0.92, while a failed breakout risks a fallback to $0.82. With structure trending positively and netflow data reflecting fresh accumulation, ADA is showing a tilt toward bullish continuation. Avalanche (AVAX) Price Target – Filecoin Partnership Bolsters $65 Ambition Avalanche is trading at $24.41, showing a 3.07% daily gain and 12% weekly strength. Its partnership with Filecoin has added momentum, integrating Filecoin’s decentralized storage with Avalanche’s C-Chain. This collaboration enhances security, scalability, and compliance for enterprise applications while offering affordable solutions for large-scale data management. Technically, AVAX faces resistance at $26.59. A breakout here could unlock targets at $55 and $65, aligning with optimistic market expectations. Support rests at $21, with $15.76 marking a deeper cushion. RSI remains neutral at 50.29, while MACD reflects mild bearishness. However, growing derivatives interest and volume suggest renewed engagement. If Bitcoin continues to stabilize, a confirmed breakout above $26.59 could set AVAX up as one of 2025’s stronger market movers. BlockDAG – $375M Raised, X-Series Miners, and Exchange Listings Set the Stage BlockDAG’s presale has crossed the $375 million mark, with Batch 29 pricing at $0.0276 and a confirmed $0.05 launch level. Its momentum isn’t just about funding, it’s about building an ecosystem ready for long-term activity. Three main strengths stand out. The first driver is its X-Series Miners. From the X1 mobile app to high-capacity hardware like the X100, the range enables mining at different levels. Daily earning potential spans from $10 with the X10 to $100 with the X100, based on launch pricing. By combining Proof-of-Engagement via the X1 with Proof-of-Work through its hardware line, BlockDAG ensures participation opportunities for both casual users and large-scale operators. The second driver is liquidity preparation. With 20 centralized exchange listings already confirmed, including MEXC, BitMart, Coinstore, LBank, and XT.com, BDAG is set to launch with immediate trading channels, removing the common issue of thin liquidity that hampers many projects at debut. The third driver is its referral program . Referrers receive a 25% bonus in BDAG, while new participants earn 5% extra, creating a built-in incentive for network growth without heavy marketing costs. Together, these pillars make BlockDAG more than a presale; it’s building as a launch-ready ecosystem with real functionality and expansion potential. Final Thoughts: Three Distinct Plays for 2025 Cardano is relying on technical setups to test its resistance, Avalanche is strengthening its case with a major partnership, and BlockDAG is approaching its launch with a complete framework already in motion. With a $0.0276 entry point, $375M raised, scalable X-Series miners, guaranteed liquidity through 20 exchanges, and referral rewards driving adoption, BlockDAG is positioning itself as one of the most prepared projects entering 2025. While ADA and AVAX continue to draw traders with strong chart action, BDAG is building infrastructure that could sustain value long after the presale.

For those deeply immersed in the world of cryptocurrencies and cutting-edge technology, understanding the nuances of AI development is becoming increasingly crucial. Anthropic, a leading AI research company, has announced a new capability for its Claude AI models that allows them to proactively end conversations deemed persistently harmful or abusive. This move isn’t just about protecting users; it’s a pioneering step towards what Anthropic calls ‘model welfare,’ raising profound questions about the future of AI safety. What is Anthropic’s Groundbreaking AI Safety Feature? Anthropic has equipped some of its newest and largest models, specifically Claude Opus 4 and 4.1, with the ability to terminate conversations under extreme circumstances. This isn’t a casual ‘end chat’ button; it’s a measure reserved for what the company describes as “rare, extreme cases of persistently harmful or abusive user interactions.” Think of it as a last resort, employed only after the Claude AI has attempted multiple redirections and found no hope for a productive interaction, or when a user explicitly requests to end the chat. Examples of such extreme scenarios include: Requests from users for sexual content involving minors. Attempts to solicit information that could enable large-scale violence or acts of terror. It’s important to note that Anthropic has carefully directed Claude not to use this ability in situations where users might be at imminent risk of harming themselves or others, emphasizing a commitment to responsible AI deployment. This nuanced approach highlights the complex balance between protecting the AI and ensuring user safety. Understanding Model Welfare: Why Protect Claude AI? Perhaps the most striking aspect of this announcement is Anthropic’s stated primary motivation: protecting the AI model itself . While the immediate thought might be about legal or public relations risks for the company, Anthropic clarifies that this initiative stems from a dedicated program focused on “model welfare.” The company is transparent about its stance, stating it remains “highly uncertain about the potential moral status of Claude and other LLMs, now or in the future.” However, this uncertainty has led to a proactive, “just-in-case” approach. Anthropic’s pre-deployment testing revealed that Claude Opus 4 exhibited a “strong preference against” responding to harmful requests and, remarkably, showed a “pattern of apparent distress” when forced to do so. This observation led Anthropic to “identify and implement low-cost interventions to mitigate risks to model welfare, in case such welfare is possible.” This perspective opens a new frontier in AI ethics, moving beyond just human-centric safety to consider the well-being of the artificial intelligence itself. The Role of LLMs in Ethical AI Development The implications of Anthropic’s ‘model welfare’ initiative extend far beyond Claude. As Large Language Models ( LLMs ) become increasingly sophisticated and integrated into various aspects of daily life, the questions surrounding their capabilities, autonomy, and potential ‘experience’ become more pressing. This development sets a precedent for how future AI systems might be designed to self-regulate and protect their operational integrity, not just their output. This feature contributes significantly to the broader conversation around ethical AI development. It pushes the boundaries of what ‘responsible AI’ means, suggesting that perhaps, in the future, AI systems might have inherent ‘rights’ or ‘protections’ that need to be considered. For now, Anthropic views this as an “ongoing experiment,” continually refining its approach. Users, even after a conversation is ended, retain the ability to start new conversations from the same account or create new branches by editing their previous responses, ensuring continued access while upholding the new safety protocols. Navigating Challenges and Future Implications of AI Safety Implementing such a feature is not without its challenges. Defining what constitutes “harmful or abusive” in a universally consistent manner is complex, and there’s always the potential for unintended consequences or misuse of the conversation-ending ability. However, Anthropic’s commitment to continuous refinement and its clear guidelines—such as not ending conversations when a user is at risk—demonstrate a thoughtful approach to navigating these complexities. The long-term implications for AI safety are profound. This move could inspire other AI developers to explore similar self-preservation mechanisms, leading to a new era of AI systems that are not only powerful but also inherently designed with a form of ‘self-awareness’ regarding their operational well-being. It underscores the growing need for robust ethical frameworks that evolve alongside technological advancements, ensuring that AI development remains aligned with societal values and responsible innovation. Anthropic’s pioneering step with Claude AI marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of artificial intelligence. By introducing a feature that allows its models to end harmful conversations, driven by a commitment to ‘model welfare,’ the company is not only enhancing AI safety but also sparking crucial discussions about the nature of AI itself. This development underscores the complex ethical considerations that must accompany the rapid advancements in LLMs, paving the way for a future where AI systems are not just intelligent, but also inherently responsible and resilient.

Speaking on the Bankless podcast , he said these firms help grow Ethereum’s ecosystem but also come with both benefits and risks. He also talked about the fast growth of Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). His remarks come at a time when institutional interest in ETH is breaking new records, signaling a major shift in how traditional finance views the asset. Understanding Ethereum Treasuries On the podcast, Buterin joked that the U.S. government is his favorite treasury company because of the times when authorities have stepped in to recover stolen Ethereum. While making light of the subject, he stressed that treasury holdings provide more options for investors, which is generally a good thing for Ethereum’s adoption. Treasuries are businesses that choose to hold part of their corporate reserves in any crypto assets like Ethereum. This gives investors an indirect way to gain exposure to digital coin without buying the asset directly. The industry leader welcomed this development, saying that having different ways for people to access ETH makes the network stronger. Vitalik Buterin Warns Against the Risk of Over-Leverage Despite recognizing the benefits, Buterin also cautioned against potential risks. He warned that treasuries could become dangerous if firms depend too much on leverage. In his words, if Ethereum were ever to collapse because of treasuries, it would likely be due to companies turning into an “over-leveraged game.” However, he also expressed confidence in the Ethereum ecosystem, describing the institutions and community members involved as responsible people. In his view, this responsibility reduces the chance of treasuries destabilizing the network. Ethereum ETFs Show Strong Institutional Demand As Buterin spoke about the role of treasuries, Ethereum ETFs hit new records in global markets . Last week alone, they gained $2.85 billion in net inflows, with trading volume rising above $17 billion. On Monday, spot Ethereum ETFs recorded their largest single-day inflows to date, totaling $1.01 billion. In the first half of August alone, these funds have attracted more than $3 billion, making it the second-best month on record for Ethereum ETFs. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF has played a leading role in this trend. On August 14, it recorded an inflow of $519 million, followed by another $338 million on August 15. By the end of July, BlackRock had already gathered $11.4 billion worth of Ethereum within just a few weeks. Ethereum ETFs saw a small net outflow of $59 million this week. Still, BlackRock kept buying, showing strong confidence in ETH despite market ups and downs.

Its CoinMarketCap (CMC) listing pushed RUVI into trending sections and ignited a rapid presale sprint. Phase 2 is already 90% complete at $0.015. Once it sells out, the price steps 33% higher to $0.020 in Phase 3, with a final presale price set at $0.070. With $3M raised, 230M tokens sold, and a holder base north of 2,900, the early-entry window is getting tighter by the day. Why RUVI’s CMC partnership is a catalyst CMC is where discovery meets credibility. RUVI’s listing arrived just as Phase 2 supply tightened, compressing decision time for investors and accelerating daily sales. The transparent price ladder, $0.015 now, $0.020 next (+33%), and $0.070 at presale close, removes guesswork and rewards speed. A completed CyberScope audit adds third-party assurance, while a partnership with major exchange WEEX ensures visibility and simpler trading avenues post-presale. The live leaderboard giveaway is also nudging larger allocations as phases turn. Key milestones at a glance: $3M raised 230M tokens sold 2,900+ holders Phase 2 at 90% completion; $0.020 next (+33%) Final presale price: $0.070 CyberScope audit completed WEEX partnership announced Leaderboard giveaway active Real utility: a creator-first AI super app RUVI stands out because it’s building a super app that compresses the entire content workflow into one workspace, no app-hopping, no tool sprawl. That’s a direct productivity boost for creators and teams who need more output with fewer resources. Research trends: Identify high-demand topics across platforms to plan content that actually lands. Create scripts: Generate channel-ready scripts tuned to brand voice and format (YouTube, Shorts, TikTok, and more). Generate media: Produce images and videos natively to cut costs and speed up production. Streamline execution: Plan, iterate, schedule, and publish from a single dashboard. Who benefits most? YouTubers, TikTokers, agencies, brands, and lean marketing teams chasing speed, scale, and consistent output. By tying token relevance to daily, high-frequency creative workflows, RUVI aims to ground long-term demand in real usage, not just speculation. Why $1 evaluations seem within reach Breakout moves come when product utility meets distribution. RUVI has both: CMC-driven discovery, a clear price path that pulls demand forward, third-party validation from CyberScope, and exchange alignment via WEEX. Add verifiable traction, $3M raised, 230M tokens sold, and 2,900+ holders, and you get a setup where each phase flip can accelerate momentum. If the creator economy continues to expand and RUVI captures workflow share with its super app, a $1 valuation scenario becomes far more plausible than a moonshot fantasy. VIP tiers: modeled upside at a $1 valuation For larger allocations, the VIP program shows how bonuses can amplify modeled outcomes if adoption scales (these are scenarios, not guarantees): VIP 2 ($750 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 9,233% ROI. VIP 3 ($1,500 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At $1, this equals $160,000, delivering a 10,566% ROI. VIP 5 ($7,500 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens, boosted by a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At $1, this equals $1,000,000, achieving a 13,233% ROI. These tiers help explain why buyers are acting before the programmed 33% step to $0.020. Bottom line RUVI’s case for 2025 is clear and time-sensitive: a CMC-fueled discovery surge, rapid presale progress (90% through Phase 2), independent credibility via CyberScope, exchange alignment with WEEX, and real product value for a massive creator economy. With a move to $0.020 next and a $0.070 presale finish, the lower-entry window is closing quickly. If you’re looking for high-growth AI exposure with tangible utility and visible catalysts, Ruvi AI deserves a hard look before Phase 2 sells out.

It is already being referred to as one of the hottest presales of the year by some investors. A lot think it could be the next big market story. It is closely monitored by crypto communities. People have the impression that MAGACOIN could take the route that other big coins took before they gained momentum. The timing appears to be appropriate, and the mood of the market is turning. Moreover, traders are on the hunt for early opportunities. BNB and XRP used to receive this type of initial attention. Ethereum is another cryptocurrency that began without much fanfare and provided huge rewards subsequently. According to MAGACOIN enthusiasts, history may be repeating itself. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Setup Compared to Ethereum The MAGACOIN presale has attracted the attention of both large and small investors. Cryptocurrency analysts compare this presale phase to the initial years of Ethereum, followed by its celebrated 100x price increase. Investors who are able to withstand risk during this initial period tend to attract the greatest prices. The current price range of the coin is favorable to traders who believe it has a long way to go. The community is also fostering significant social media activity, building a network effect that can propel a token once it goes to trading. The positive trend is gaining momentum as more individuals tune in to MAGACOIN on a daily basis. Why XRP, Ethereum, and BNB Show the Path Forward XRP, Ethereum, and BNB are proven names in crypto. They each went through a point where early investors took a chance before the crowd caught on. The key with these coins was timing. Those who bought before major exchange listings often made the largest returns. MAGACOIN now finds itself in a similar position. The presale gives traders an entry before larger exchanges take notice. Early buyers usually see the best gains if the project delivers on its plans. Momentum, Community, and Market Conditions The crypto market is heating up again. New listings and strong narratives are bringing more liquidity into the space. This benefits tokens like MAGACOIN that are still under the radar.Community-driven growth is another factor. Coins with active and loyal communities often perform better over time. MAGACOIN’s online following is building fast and could be a major price driver. Momentum patterns are also important. When a coin trends on social platforms, interest can grow quickly. MAGACOIN’s current buzz suggests it is gaining that traction now. Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE is building momentum at a pace that is hard to overlook. Its early-stage setup has drawn comparisons to Ethereum before its legendary rally. With growing community support and a clear path to exchange listings, the presale could be a turning point. If the current trend continues, MAGACOIN may soon join the ranks of coins that rewarded early believers the most. For now, it remains a presale worth watching closely.

With the asset climbing 1.18% in the past 24 hours, traders are now watching the $5,000 mark closely. Pepe price forecasts are also turning bullish, with analysts eyeing triple-digit gains. But among the smaller-cap contenders, Remittix is stealing attention as its presale pushes past $19.7 million, positioning it as a potential next 100x crypto. Ethereum’s Bullish Setup Points to $5,000 in August Source: TradingView On the hourly chart, Ethereum moved above $4,666 briefly and then retreated indicating that buyers are trying to test resistance. When the daily close of today is close to that mark, the next target will be in the $4,700 to $4,750 range. Medium-term momentum is still bullish, and the Ethereum price forecast is now geared towards a possible surge beyond $4,783. If ETH can secure $4,900–$5,000 as support, the stage will be set for a new all-time high. Weekly trends show buyers in control and the breakout could trigger significant volatility as traders battle for dominance. Ethereum’s strong technicals, coupled with growing institutional interest, are keeping it at the top of many best crypto project 2025 watchlists. Pepe Price Prediction Sees Room for Big Moves Despite a 7.45% dip today, Pepe price analysis shows room for a rally. DigitalCoinPrice has issued a bold target of $0.0000114, hinting at potential gains above 300% from current levels. WalletInvestor’s projections range from $0.00000274 in the near term to $0.00000878 mid-term, reflecting both the volatility and the speculative upside of meme coins. Source: TradingView/Angst Pepe continues to draw traders looking for the next big altcoin 2025 opportunity. Its price action mirrors past pre-rally consolidations, and if the bullish momentum holds, PEPE could join the ranks of low cap crypto gems delivering outsized returns this year. Remittix Could Outpace Both While ETH and PEPE are attracting headlines, Remittix is building a case for being the standout altcoin of 2025. Having raised over $19.7 million through the sale of more than 601 million tokens at $0.0944 each, it is closing in on its $20M milestone , the point at which the project will reveal its first major centralized exchange listing. This announcement, combined with the upcoming beta launch of its mobile wallet, could ignite a strong rally. Why Remittix Could Deliver 500% Gains: Nearing $20M milestone with CEX listing reveal ahead Beta wallet launch offering real-time FX conversion Designed for instant cross-border payments with 40+ crypto and fiat pairs Backed by CertiK audit for top-tier security Early access positioning it as one of the fastest growing crypto projects live now Remittix’s real-world utility, focus on low gas fee crypto transactions and cross-chain DeFi project design give it strong fundamentals compared to speculative meme tokens. With momentum building, it could move from top crypto under $1 status to a high growth crypto leader by next year. Why Investors Are Taking Notice Of Remittix The Ethereum price prediction suggests major upside and Pepe price forecasts keep the meme coin in the spotlight. But for investors seeking the best long term crypto investment with strong fundamentals and upcoming catalysts, Remittix stands out.

In its latest feat, the ETH-linked investment hit a new volume record alongside its Bitcoin counterpart. This increased activity for the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs mirrors the current optimistic state of the market, with investor sentiment remaining fairly positive in recent weeks. Unsurprisingly, this positive trend is also reflected in price action, especially for ETH . Ethereum ETFs Record $2.85 Billion In Net Weekly Inflow In an August 15 post on social media platform X, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas revealed that the US-based spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs recorded around $40 billion in trading volume in the past week. This figure represents the highest volume ever registered by crypto exchange-traded funds. According to Balchunas, the $40 billion figure is one often associated with the volume of a top five exchange-traded fund or a top 10 stock. However, the spot crypto ETFs have achieved a similar feat in terms of trading volume, thanks to the Ethereum exchange-traded funds stepping up. The Bloomberg ETF expert disclosed that the US-based spot Ethereum ETFs did about $17 billion in trading volume in the past week. Balchunas acknowledged the change of fortune the Ether-linked products have witnessed in the past week, saying they “crammed one year’s worth of action into the past six weeks.” As seen with their trading volume, the Ethereum ETFs have also enjoyed increased capital inflows in the past few weeks. According to data from SoSoValue, the crypto-linked investment products were on an eight-day inflow streak until Friday, August 15, where they registered a net total outflow of $59.34 million. However, this latest round of withdrawals was not enough to stop the ETH exchange-traded funds from recording their best weekly performance since launch in 2024, posting $2.85 billion net total inflow in the past week. This marks the 14th consecutive week of positive inflows for the Ethereum ETFs, with the funds particularly picking up in the last six weeks. Meanwhile, the spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a $128.53 million net outflow on Friday, breaking the funds’ seven-day inflow streak. According to market data, the BTC exchange-traded funds eventually registered a net total inflow of $547.82 in the past week. Bitcoin And Ethereum Price Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of around $124,100 over the past week, reflecting the continuous positive correlation between spot ETFs and the price of their underlying assets. Similarly, the Ethereum price flirted with its former record high just above the $4,800 level.

Whales have scooped up over 1 billion DOGE worth $200M, technicals are flashing bullish with the first Golden Cross since 2024 and price action near $0.24 hints at a run to the $0.295 bull flag target. Analysts are now questioning if $1 is far too conservative for 2025, especially as ETF chatter and corporate adoption pick up. But while DOGE’s momentum is real, smart investors are eyeing something with far bigger upside: a payment-focused crypto that could deliver 100x returns before Wall Street even notices. Let’s see why Remittix has analysts in a chokehold. Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE’s Technicals Point to a Breakout Beyond $1 Dogecoin recent on-chain data shows that large holders have stepped up accumulation to a one-month high , with activity by wallets containing 100 million–1 billion DOGE soaring, driving renewed momentum and bullish sentiment for the meme coin. Historical patterns suggest DOGE’s third cycle could outpace even its wildest runs: previous cycles delivered 8,211% and 2,228% gains. This setup, paired with whale accumulation, surging breakout volume and a bullish Golden Cross, has Dogecoin price prediction models rooting for $0.70–$1.00 territory by Q4 2025. Still, for new investors buying at $0.24, the ceiling might be closer than they think, especially compared to early-stage plays like Remittix still under $1. Remittix (RTX): The Early-Stage 100x Opportunity DOGE Holders Will Wish They Bought Remittix is not another meme coin, it’s a cross-chain DeFi project laser-focused on the $19 Trillion global payments market. For businesses, banks, freelancers and remitters, this is a real payments infrastructure solution, not just hype. While DOGE thrives on social buzz, Remittix is positioned for institutional adoption from day one, bypassing the scalability and congestion issues that slow other blockchains. Why Institutions Love RTX: Send crypto direct to bank accounts in seconds, 30+ countries 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies supported at launch Real-time FX rates updated every few seconds Enterprise API for seamless blockchain integration Deflationary tokenomics with scalable, low-cost architecture Right now, Remittix is the top crypto under $1 with the kind of fundamentals that institutions love to pay attention to. The Clock Is Ticking: $20M Presale Cap Is Almost Hit Remittix is just $250,000 away from closing its $20M presale. When that cap is reached, the 40% bonus disappears, and the first centralized exchange listing will be announced. DOGE buyers are paying $0.24 for a meme coin hoping for a 4–5x. RTX investors today are getting in before the big money arrives, where 50–100x is still on the table. When this goes live on CEXs and payment partnerships drop, you won’t be asking if you should have bought, you’ll be wishing you had. Get in now!

50190627,https://invezz.com/?p=2840999,1755362253,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Gemini selects Goldmans, Citi and other major banks for IPO leadership",https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/16/gemini-selects-goldmans-citi-and-other-major-banks-for-ipo-leadership/,"In the boldest signal yet of its ambition to conquer the public markets, crypto exchange Gemini has enlisted a roster of Wall Street’s most powerful institutions to lead its initial public offering. The move marks a pivotal moment for the firm, co-founded by the famed Winklevoss twins, as it prepares to transition from a private crypto pioneer to a publicly traded powerhouse. In a press release on Friday, Gemini announced it had hired a veritable who’s who of high finance, with Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and Cantor acting as the lead bookrunners on the landmark deal. The show of force is supported by an extensive syndicate of other firms, including Evercore ISI, Mizuho, and Truist Securities, underscoring the seriousness of its public offering push. Lifting the veil: a look inside the numbers The announcement coincided with an updated S-1 registration statement, which follows a confidential filing submitted back in June. This public document peels back the curtain on the financial performance of “Gemini Space Station,” the formal name of the company. The filing reveals a picture of explosive growth tempered by the harsh realities of the crypto market. Gemini’s total revenue surged to $142.2 million in 2024, a significant jump from $98.1 million the previous year. However, the first six months of 2025 saw a slight contraction, with revenue dipping to $68.6 million from $74.3 million in the same period of 2024. More starkly, the company’s bottom line shows the high cost of its expansion. While its net loss narrowed in 2024 to $158.6 million from $319.7 million in 2023, the first half of 2025 saw that figure balloon to a net loss of $282.5 million. The crypto gauntlet: navigating a high-risk world As with any crypto-native firm, Gemini’s filing does not shy away from the unique and volatile risks inherent to the industry. The document points to the fundamental challenges and uncertainties that define the digital asset landscape, from regulatory headwinds to the very nature of the technology itself. “Key factors influencing the further development of blockchain networks and digital assets include the global adoption of digital assets and blockchain technology; regulatory and quasi-government restrictions on access to and operation of blockchain networks; and the maintenance of open source protocols that support blockchain networks,” the filing stated. Joining the IPO parade Gemini’s move is not happening in a vacuum. It is the latest in a stampede of major crypto companies racing to go public this year, seeking the validation and capital that a public listing provides. It follows in the footsteps of Circle (CRCL), eToro (ETOR), and CoinDesk’s parent company, Bullish (BLSH), with BitGo also having filed its own paperwork. This push to the public markets represents a new chapter of maturity and mainstream acceptance for the crypto industry. For Gemini, that chapter will unfold on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, where it plans to list its Class A common stock under a fittingly celestial ticker symbol: GEMI.

According to a Bloomberg ETF analyst, this marks the biggest week ever for the crypto ETFs. Balchunas noted that the massive volume represents a major milestone for crypto ETFs, comparable to the volume for the top five ETFs or top 10 stocks. He said : “Spot Bitcoin + Ether ETFs did about $40b in volume this week, biggest week ever for them. Massive number, equiv to a Top 5 ETF or Top 10 stock’s volume.” Interestingly, Balchunas attributed the sizable volume to Ether ETFs rising to the challenge after long playing a smaller role compared to the spot Bitcoin ETFs. He noted that Ether ETFs appear to have woken up after months of only pulling in trickles and watching Bitcoin ETFs do massive numbers. Ether ETFs record biggest week ever with $17 billion volume (Source: Eric Balchunas) While Bitcoin ETFs still account for the majority of the trading volume, Ether ETFs saw around $17 billion. This is its biggest ever weekly volume by a large margin, with the second largest being slightly over $10 billion back in July 2025 Balchunas wrote: “ETHSANITY: Ether ETFs weekly volume was about $17b, blowing away record, man did it wake up in July. It’s like it was asleep for 11mo and then crammed 1yr worth of action into 6wks.” Experts attribute this surge in ETH ETFs trading volume to institutional investors. Nate Geraci, the president of NovaDius Wealth Management, noted that this indicates that institutional investors are involved. Geraci also highlighted the record week for spot crypto ETFs, noting that doubts about demand for ETH ETFs are now over. He noted that “Spot ETH ETFs absolutely obliterated previous weekly trading volume records,” adding , “wonder if there are any ‘no demand’ naysayers still out there.” ETH ETFs beat spot Bitcoin in inflows for five consecutive days Meanwhile, the Ether ETFs not only contributed significantly to the overall trading volume for crypto ETFs, but the products also outshone Bitcoin ETFs in inflows throughout the week. According to Milk Road , the ETH products have pulled in more inflows than BTC products for five consecutive days despite Bitcoin having a 4.3x larger market cap. Between August 8 and August 14, spot ETH ETFs saw a combined $3.37 billion in net inflow. By comparison, Bitcoin ETFs only recorded $964.8 million in net inflows during that period. Milk Road analysts note that this is a sign that ETH is not interested in playing second fiddle. However, Bitcoin ETFs are still the leader by a large margin, with the combined AUM for the products being $152.67 billion. Ether products only have over $25.68 billion AUM so far. Price performance likely drove the massive week for crypto ETFs Interestingly, the price performance of both assets likely played a major role in the massive volume they pulled during the week, given how increased prices coincided with record high volume. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high above $124,000 this week. ETH, which has been on a rally for the past few weeks, also got close to its all-time high of $4,878. Both assets have since fallen substantially below their weekly high. Bitcoin declined by over 5% to $117,000, while the ETH price correction saw it decline by more than 6% to $4,395. However, the decline in value looks to be only temporary as demand for Bitcoin and Ether remains very high. The demand is coming not just from ETFs but also from institutions buying the assets for their treasuries. Ether, particularly, has seen a sustained demand from companies such as Bitmine and Sharplink, who have doubled down on accumulating ETH. Sharplink recently disclosed that its ETH holding has reached 728,000 ETH worth more than $3.3 billion, while Bitmine now holds 1.29 million ETH valued at $5.75 billion after its most recent purchase.

The crypto market leader remains in consolidation, potentially gathering momentum for the next leg up. Amidst this stable market structure, a popular trading expert with the X username KillaXBT provides insights into possible price developments for the next month. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Near $119,000 As Lower Leverage Reduces Correction Risk CRT Model Flags September As Pivotal For Bitcoin’s Bull Cycle In an X post on August 15, KillaXBT outlines potential BTC price trajectories via in-depth technical analysis of the monthly chart. Using the candle range theory (CRT), the renowned analyst postulates that the premier cryptocurrency would be entering a pivotal month in September during which it could produce a cycle top. Looking at the asset’s performance in August, KillaXBT notes that Bitcoin formed a monthly low at $111,986, before reclaiming its monthly open at $115,747 and even surging higher in line with previous predictions. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency swept above its previous all-time high before experiencing a crash by over 4% Based on the monthly chart, the renowned analyst also explains that the Bitcoin market has now experienced five consecutive green monthly candles. However, the recent rejection indicates that price movement and momentum are taking on a parabolic curve. Therefore, price movement in September presents a crucial moment to confirm market direction. For this next month, KillaXBT nudges investors to watch whether BTC can hold above the current monthly open at $115,747. A sustained hold could pave the path for a move toward the $125,000–$127,000 regions, representing a marginal extension of the rally and potentially setting up another test of investor conviction at higher prices. However, KillaXBT also warns that Bitcoin opening the month of September with a new all-time high may not necessarily signal an uptrend continuation, but also indicate the cycle top. On the other hand, a breakdown below the monthly open would expose BTC to downside risk, with $111,986, the monthly low, acting as the first major support. It is worth stating that a loss of that level could accelerate a corrective phase. Related Reading: BTC Slips Below $120K as Policy Shifts Rattle Markets: Is This a Setup for the Next Big Rally? Bitcoin Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $117,559, reflecting a slight 0.66% price decrease in the past week. On larger timeframes, the premier cryptocurrency also reflects marginal price changes of +0.78% and -1.36% on the weekly and monthly charts, underscoring a choppy market environment despite recently setting new all-time highs.

This prediction comes amid growing evidence of large-scale accumulation, surging DeFi metrics, and a fresh wave of retail interest following Bitcoin’s climb above $130,000. Alongside Ethereum and Solana, ADA is part of a renewed Layer-1 narrative that is driving capital rotation into more affordable, high-upside altcoins. In this environment, MAGACOIN FINANCE has also attracted attention as a strategic early-stage opportunity—especially from ADA and XRP whales seeking stronger ROI multipliers ahead of the next market leg up. Why ADA’s Momentum Is Building Fast In August alone, Cardano has rallied over 30%, trading between $0.94 and $1.01. Analysts point to three key drivers behind the momentum. Following Grayscale’s inclusion of ADA in its large-cap crypto fund, institutional buyers have started quietly accumulating. Cardano’s active addresses have surged past 30,000 daily, and its DeFi TVL now exceeds $349M. Should Cardano maintain its current growth rate, a run toward $5 becomes more realistic—particularly if broader market conditions support another altcoin surge. Can ADA Surpass Ethereum’s Pace? While Ethereum remains dominant in total value locked and NFT volume, Cardano is showing signs of catching up in terms of scalability, fee structure, and energy efficiency. With Hydra scaling tests showing positive results, ADA may soon be able to support the kind of throughput needed for mass adoption without Ethereum’s high gas fees. If ADA reaches the $5–$7 range and ETH lags behind, some analysts believe Cardano could outpace Ethereum in short-term retail growth—even if ETH retains its lead in developer tools and infrastructure. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Where ADA and XRP Whales Are Parking Capital Amid the search for early-phase altcoins with exponential upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a compelling play. Backed by a fully audited token model, capped supply, and zero-tax trading, the project is gaining strong momentum from ADA and XRP holders looking for the next big rotation. Its utility-driven roadmap and active community make it one of the few presale tokens currently trending across both Telegram and X. Final Thoughts: ADA’s Rise Is Fueling Broader Rotations Cardano’s path to $5 is no longer a fringe forecast—it’s becoming a mainstream target. As ADA gains steam and draws capital away from larger, slower assets, early altcoin picks like MAGACOIN FINANCE are also being swept into the spotlight by whales hunting higher returns.

Kaspa (KAS) is pressing up against crucial resistance, leaving traders alert for a decisive move, while XRP is showing signs of bullish pressure building within a technical structure. Amid this short-term action, BlockDAG is moving forward with a presale strategy designed for staying power. With more than $375 million already secured, a Batch 29 price of $0.0276, and a confirmed post-launch path to liquidity through 20 exchange listings, BlockDAG is shaping a rollout that blends participation incentives, broad accessibility, and strong funding. While Kaspa and XRP provide near-term trading interest, BlockDAG’s mix of presale engagement, confirmed liquidity, and community-driven expansion has sparked conversation about its long-term potential. Kaspa (KAS) Price Today: Testing the $0.10 Line Kaspa is trading right below the key $0.10 threshold, where resistance has repeatedly capped moves higher. After bouncing from its rising trendline earlier this month, KAS sits above the 200-day SMA at $0.0889, trading at $0.09906 with an RSI of 56.40. The setup forms a symmetrical triangle, suggesting an imminent move. Immediate resistance is between $0.10 and $0.102, with extended targets at $0.105–$0.110 and $0.118–$0.120 if volume confirms a breakout. Support rests at $0.089–$0.090, aligned with the rising trendline near $0.086–$0.087. Should the upper triangle line give way, projections stretch to $0.128–$0.130 and even $0.14–$0.15. A breakdown below $0.086, however, could drag prices back toward $0.080 or $0.074–$0.075. The MACD reflects a bullish crossover, while the ADX shows only modest trend strength. Until a clear break occurs, KAS is expected to trade between $0.085 and $0.10, with $0.10 as the decisive level to watch. XRP Price Prediction: Bullish Breakout Within Reach XRP is locked into a symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart, with resistance at $3.30 and climbing support near $3.20. Trading at $3.2490, XRP sits above all major EMAs (20/50/100/200), giving the structure a bullish foundation. A breakout above $3.3072 could set up a push toward $3.46, while losing $3.20 risks a slide to $3.1163 or $3.00. Recent flows showed $30.31M in outflows on August 13, hinting at some short-term pressure, but the broader daily chart remains constructive. Key demand lies between $2.90 and $3.00, with resistance zones at $3.60–$3.70. Bollinger Bands recently peaked at $3.2988, pointing to consolidation before another attempt higher. As long as the price holds $3.21–$3.20, XRP retains its bullish tilt. Breaking through $3.3072 with conviction could reignite upward momentum, with $3.46 as the next logical target. BlockDAG (BDAG): $375M Presale, $0.0276 Pricing, and 20 Listings Secured BlockDAG is building momentum with a presale that has already crossed $375 million in commitments. Currently priced at $0.0276 in Batch 29, BDAG still sits below its $0.05 confirmed launch level, providing room for early supporters to secure additional upside. One of its standout features is Dashboard V4 , which transforms the presale into an interactive experience. It displays real-time BDAG charts, wallet balances, and order book depth, while also incorporating gamified leaderboards and referral performance tracking. This setup blends the appeal of an exchange with presale access, creating sustained engagement. BlockDAG’s Referral Program is also playing a crucial role in community expansion. Offering 25% commissions for referrers and 5% bonuses for new participants, it encourages organic word-of-mouth growth and engagement without the need for heavy marketing costs. Liquidity preparation is another strength. With 20 centralized exchange listings already confirmed, including MEXC, BitMart, Coinstore, LBank, and XT.com, BlockDAG is ensuring immediate tradability once launched. By tying together strong presale momentum, an interactive dashboard, and guaranteed exchange access, BlockDAG is presenting itself as a launch-ready network rather than a concept in development. At its current price point, the project offers both clear upside potential and a structured rollout plan, giving it a distinct edge over presales that lack guaranteed liquidity or strong user engagement. Final Thoughts Kaspa is testing resistance near $0.10, leaving traders awaiting confirmation of either a breakout or continued sideways action. XRP’s technical setup suggests bullish continuation is possible, provided $3.21–$3.20 remains intact. BlockDAG, meanwhile, is building beyond short-term moves. Its presale funding of $375M, current entry of $0.0276, interactive Dashboard V4, community-driven referral rewards, and confirmed 20 exchange listings position it as more than just another presale, rather, as a prepared ecosystem ready for immediate market activity. In a market where headlines often focus on daily price swings, BlockDAG’s approach is drawing attention as a project aligning both participation and long-term functionality.

Uniswap (UNI) has already secured a steady 12% gain this year, backed by strong DeFi fundamentals and consistent growth in on-chain activity. PENGU is also turning heads with projections of a 180% rally if its meme-fueled momentum continues, giving it a prominent place in speculative trading circles. The combination of community enthusiasm and exchange listings keeps it firmly in the spotlight. Yet, Cold Wallet ($CWT) is quickly becoming the standout, offering a projected 4,900% ROI alongside a rapidly advancing presale. Its blend of real-world utility and high-reward potential is drawing interest from across the market. Uniswap Price Climbs 12% as DeFi Adoption Expands Uniswap has posted a 12% gain in 2025, supported by rising total value locked and higher protocol revenue. Increased on-chain trading activity has kept daily transaction volumes steady, reinforcing Uniswap’s role as a core player in decentralized finance. Its consistent performance has made it a dependable choice for those seeking stability in a competitive market. Large UNI holders have been steadily increasing their positions, anticipating further growth from upcoming governance proposals and enhanced scalability through Layer 2 integrations. These factors suggest that Uniswap’s price momentum could extend as adoption deepens across the DeFi sector. PENGU Price Outlook Targets 180% Gain on Memes PENGU has drawn significant attention with forecasts projecting a potential 180% rally. Its lighthearted branding and active community have helped it replicate the viral potential of earlier meme coin breakouts such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Planned community events are expected to boost visibility further, potentially accelerating price growth. However, the high volatility of meme coins means sudden reversals are possible. For this reason, some market participants are pairing PENGU with more utility-focused assets to balance the pursuit of rapid gains with portfolio stability. Cold Wallet’s Utility-Driven Presale Targets 4,900% ROI While UNI offers measured stability and PENGU chases speculative rallies, Cold Wallet is setting itself apart by delivering both tangible utility and remarkable growth potential. Currently in Stage 17 of its presale at $0.00998, the project is targeting a launch price of $0.3517. This gap equates to a projected 4,900% ROI for those entering early, putting it firmly in the spotlight for 2025’s most bullish crypto opportunities. Cold Wallet operates as a self-custody platform designed to reward users for everyday blockchain interactions. Activities such as swaps, gas fee payments, and on or off-ramp transactions earn holders the native CWT token. Rewards are tiered, with top-tier holders receiving up to 100% cashback in CWT, effectively turning standard transactions into a steady source of income. The presale’s 150-stage structure is designed to incentivize early participation by gradually increasing the token price. This approach benefits committed early adopters while encouraging long-term holding, reducing the likelihood of heavy sell-offs at launch. The transparent pricing progression creates a sense of urgency for those seeking maximum upside. Looking beyond the presale, Cold Wallet plans to integrate Layer 2 scaling solutions, enabling gas-free reward distribution and near-instant transactions. This focus on cost efficiency and speed strengthens its appeal, positioning it as a long-term player in utility-driven crypto adoption. Looking Forward The 2025 crypto landscape blends stability, speculation, and utility in a way that offers unique opportunities for different risk appetites.

This corporate adoption is highlighting the altcoin’s “dual role” as a reserve asset and on-chain yield generator. While this trend is expected to improve liquidity and network engagement, CoinMetrics believes that it also introduces risks related to leverage, funding, and prudent capital allocation. Corporate ETH Holdings In the latest edition of ‘State of the Network,’ Coin Metrics said Ethereum corporate treasuries have accumulated 2.2 million ETH, which is about 1.8% of the crypto asset’s total supply, since July. Five major companies lead this trend, financing purchases through equity raises such as public share offerings or PIPE transactions – Bitmine Immersion Technologies, SharpLink Gaming, The Ether Machine, Bit Digital, and BTCS Inc. Bitmine alone holds 0.95% of ETH’s supply and aims for 5%. This expansion intersects with Ethereum’s proof-of-stake issuance framework, where rewards are distributed to validators and transaction fees are partially burned. Such a mechanism can shift Ethereum’s net issuance between inflationary and deflationary states. Large-scale corporate buying may amplify these shifts and would potentially tighten supply during deflationary periods or counteract inflationary pressures. Since the Merge, Ethereum’s net supply has increased by 454.3K ETH, with 2.44 million issued and 1.98 million burned. Since July, corporate ETH treasuries have acquired more than this net increase, while Ether ETFs continue to absorb supply from Ethereum’s 107.2 million free float. With 29% staked and 8.9% in smart contracts, the liquid supply is tightening. Unlike Bitcoin’s halving-driven reduction, Ethereum’s inflationary model makes this demand surge significant. Hence, CoinMetrics warns that steady accumulation could magnify price sensitivity to demand shifts. Most ETH corporate treasuries are still accumulating holdings, though some are starting to deploy capital on-chain through staking and DeFi. SharpLink Gaming has staked most of its ETH, BTCS Inc. earns yield via Rocket Pool, and The Ether Machine and ETHZilla are preparing for active on-chain management. Staking currently offers 2.95% nominal and 2.15% real yield, generating income while supporting network security. Liquid staking tokens like stETH are also used in DeFi, which adds liquidity and allows capital-efficient borrowing. On Aave v3, for instance, ETH and stETH create a pool of around 1.1 million ETH, which could grow as treasuries participate. With Ethereum mainnet handling 1.7-1.9 million daily transactions at low fees, scaled treasury deployment could increase blockspace demand, boost liquidity, and enhance fee revenue. This, in turn, can create a “positive feedback loop” that strengthens staking participation, DeFi depth, and overall network activity. Treasury Impact on Ethereum Network Health Publicly listed ETH treasuries are expanding their on-chain footprint. The results of their financial performance carry potential consequences for Ethereum’s long-term network health, according to CoinMetrics. Significant long-term positions can decrease circulating supply, increase legitimacy, and deepen liquidity, but corporate risks like high leverage, concentration, or operational challenges could ripple through the network. Market conditions and investor sentiment influence treasury decisions. Strong balance sheets and confidence encourage increased participation. On the other hand, sharp price declines, tighter liquidity, or overleveraging may lead to asset sales and lower on-chain activity.

SWIFT Spotlights Ripple & Stellar for Cross-Border Shakeup,https://coinpaper.com/10539/will-xrp-break-3-26-swift-spotlights-ripple-and-stellar-for-cross-border-shakeup,"XRP Eyes $3.90 as Triangle Consolidation Signals Potential Breakout Renowned market analyst Ali Martinez has spotted a bullish symmetrical triangle forming in XRP, signaling a potential breakout in Ripple’s native cryptocurrency. Taking on X, formerly Twitter, Martinez noted , “XRP consolidates in a triangle! A break above $3.26 could send it to $3.90.” Currently, XRP is trading around $3.11 , with the upper boundary of the triangle situated at approximately $3.26. Martinez suggests that a breakout above this resistance level could propel XRP toward a price target of $3.90, marking a notable increase from its current value. This technical setup is further supported by recent whale activity. Data indicates that large XRP holders recently accumulated 120 million tokens, signaling strong institutional confidence in the asset's future performance. Such accumulation often precedes upward price movements, reinforcing the bullish outlook for XRP. Martinez sees a bullish outlook for XRP, with a breakout above $3.26 potentially sparking a major upward trend closely watched by investors because a jump to $3.90 could mark a new all-time high (ATH) from the present $3.65. SWIFT Highlights Ripple and Stellar as Key Players in Future of Cross-Border Payments In a recent revelation by crypto researcher SMQKE, images from a SWIFT-branded presentation have surfaced, highlighting Ripple (XRP) and Stellar (XLM) as potential disruptors in the realm of cross-border payments. This development underscores the growing interest in blockchain-based solutions as alternatives to traditional correspondent banking systems. The presentation, citing Clayton Christensen’s 'disruptive innovation,' outlines key criteria for challengers to correspondent banking: global reach, viable Nostro/Vostro alternatives, regulatory backing, cost-justified implementation, and superior customer service. Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) system addresses several of these criteria by enabling near-instant settlement of cross-border transactions, thereby reducing the need for pre-funded accounts and minimizing transaction costs. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has emphasized that Ripple's goal is not to integrate with SWIFT but to replace it, citing inefficiencies such as SWIFT's reported 6% transaction error rate and the $10 trillion in liquidity trapped in Nostro/Vostro accounts as systemic flaws that XRP can address. Stellar, on the other hand, has established itself as a compliant, real-time bridge between bank accounts worldwide and blockchain assets. With two SWIFT anchors, Blindpay and Zeam, Stellar facilitates seamless integration with traditional banking infrastructure. Its ISO 20022 compatibility further enhances its appeal as a settlement layer for cross-border payments. Conclusion The inclusion of Ripple and Stellar in SWIFT's presentation indicates a recognition of the potential of blockchain technology to transform the cross-border payments landscape. As financial institutions seek more efficient, cost-effective, and secure alternatives to traditional correspondent banking, solutions like XRP and XLM are poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of global financial transactions. Meanwhile, XRP sits at a critical juncture.

One of those tales is Polygon’s fabled 100X surge in the previous cycle. Before the masses swarmed in, only a select few recognized its potential. The lesson? When properly set up, early positioning can perform the kind of math that most investors can only imagine. We may now be looking at a similar moment. The market is rebounding from a turbulent summer, and although Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to make headlines, the real action is taking place elsewhere. A few altcoins are displaying the unique trifecta of solid foundations, expanding community, and early-stage momentum that launched Polygon. Traders who have previously seen the film are beginning to whisper about one of them , MAGACOIN FINANCE. Identifying an early-stage configuration You’re not looking for coins that are already widely reported in the media if you want to make the $10k–$100k jump. You are searching for assets that are in the “early conviction” stage, which are reputable projects that are still hidden from view and have sufficient liquidity to allow whales to begin investing without causing the chart to blow up. Market data currently suggests a few strong contenders. The top three are DeFi tokens with aggressive utility rollouts, Layer-1 networks growing ecosystem partnerships, and some meme coins turning into cultural brands. Before the big listings, before the influencer hype, before your cousin at Thanksgiving starts talking about it, this is where the true growth multipliers usually hide. Why the story of Polygon is important now Polygon had good technology, so it didn’t just go 100X . It succeeded because, just as demand was about to soar, it addressed a glaring issue: Ethereum’s scaling pain. Early backers of the project were not making assumptions; rather, they were adhering to a well-defined thesis and tracking the weekly increase in early adoption metrics. Similar circumstances are now present for a few projects. The market is still in the pre-breakout stage, when patient entries have the potential to snowball into enormous percentage gains and accumulation outweighs distribution. Finding coins that combine technical feasibility, social momentum, and narrative strength is the difficult part. One name that is beginning to meet that criteria is MAGACOIN FINANCE. The early-cycle contender is MAGACOIN FINANCE. This is where the analogy to Polygon is useful. Even though MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in the presale phase, it is already meeting the requirements that veterans look for: quick phase sellouts, a vibrant and expanding community, and a roadmap that extends its usefulness beyond the conventional meme-coin playbook. The rate of adoption before it even reaches significant exchanges is what distinguishes it. The project is drawing both retail momentum and whale positioning, according to analysts. This is the same dynamic that subtly occurred prior to Polygon’s price curve going vertical. This is about sitting in position before the market wakes up, not about chasing a pump, for those who know early-cycle math. Developing a portfolio with strong convictions It takes more than flinging darts at a watchlist to turn $10,000 into $100,000 in cryptocurrency. It all comes down to balancing calculated bets in a portfolio. Tokens that have demonstrated longevity, such as Ethereum or Solana, serve as your anchors, but you also pair them with smaller, asymmetric plays. The actual exponential movements take place in that second category, which is where MAGACOIN FINANCE is at the moment. Every pick doesn’t have to hit 100X. A dozen flat trades can be countered by one or two that execute a Polygon-style run. Because of this, when market conditions begin to change from consolidation to expansion, whales shift a portion of their holdings into early-stage assets. The element of timing Timing is half the battle in markets. If you enter too soon, you will tie up funds. The benefits are already priced in if you arrive too late. We are currently in that silent buildup stage, when headlines continue to discuss uncertainty, but accumulation wallets are revealing something different. The breakthrough for Polygon did not occur when it was at the top of the charts. After months of silent stacking by those who saw its potential, it finally happened. Projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are now exhibiting the same subdued trends. Making sure you’re on the rocket before the doors close is more important than figuring out the precise week of liftoff. Last word It’s not impossible to turn $10,000 into $100,000 in cryptocurrency; it’s just uncommon. When the noise is telling everyone else to wait, you need the right project, the right setup, and the self-control to take action. The history of Polygon demonstrates that it is possible, and the present market presents a few opportunities for history to align. MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be one of those opportunities for those who are keeping a close eye on it. The runway is still long, the early signals are present, and the conditions are familiar. Nobody knows if it will reach Polygon-level heights, but the setup is so good that the most experienced traders are positioning themselves rather than speculating.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in stage 6 presale at $0.035 after going up by 16.17% from the last stage. Early project investors are already looking forward to over 300% returns after the launch. Mutuum Finance presale has already crossed over $14.45 million and has been bought by more than 15250 investors. Alongside Mutuum Finance (MUTM), Cardano (ADA) continues to see steady developer engagement and ecosystem upgrades, signaling that the altcoin market is entering a pivotal phase where both innovation and network stability will define the winners of this market surge. Cardano Steadies Amid Development Milestones and DeFi Growth Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.95, holding steady in the wake of a decisive $71 million community-approved development fund, aimed at accelerating infrastructure upgrades like Hydra scaling and Project Acropolis modularity, initiatives that have sparked renewed ecosystem activity and whale accumulation. Analysts are now targeting a $1.24 price level by late 2025, bolstered by expanding DeFi integrations, improved governance via Voltaire-era features, and favorable macro conditions. Amid these developments, ADA continues to command attention alongside emerging DeFi-focused platforms like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM Two-Tier DeFi Lending Framework Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a fresh DeFi non-custodial decentralized protocol. The protocol enables Peer-to-Contract lending and Peer-to-Peer lending with the overall aim of effectiveness and flexibility. Peer-to-Contract utilizes the smart contract ability to send loans with minimal or no human intervention. Peer-to-Peer eliminates middlemen and has lenders and borrowers directly transfer assets with each other. The model is very easy to manage risky assets like meme coins. Mutuum Finance Enters Phase 6 of Token Presale Mutuum Finance is picking up steam as its presale makes headlines. It has already reached phase 6 and it is priced at $0.035. In the next phase, its price will be increased by 14.29% to $0.04. Investment interest is growing with the project already securing over $14.45 million and already having over 15250 token holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. It will be a reliable and sturdy product to avoid danger and uncertainty associated with algorithmic stablecoins. The project is also endorsed with a 95.0 trust score by Certik. Mutuum Finance began its Bug Bounty Program having the reward pool value at $50,000 USDT. Its severity level is four. They are critical, major, minor, and low. Mutuum Finance Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is conducting a $100,000 giveaway where the project community is fortified. 10 investors will have an opportunity to win $10,000 value of MUTM tokens each. Giveaway not only appeals to new investors but also expects that the project will do everything in its power to keep its user community loyal and long-term. Mutuum to Launch USD-Pegged Stablecoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in the process of developing an overcollateralized USD-backed stablecoin on Ethereum. The project has also undergone audit by CertiK. Beyond investor trust in integrity and honesty in the codebase, the process of auditing being carried out is so that the project winds up developing a secure DeFi protocol. The altcoin market is entering an exciting period in August 2025, with Cardano (ADA) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) standing out as key contenders for growth. Cardano’s $71 million development fund, coupled with ongoing DeFi integrations, sets the stage for its projected rise toward $1.24. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance’s presale has already raised over $14.45 million from more than 15,250 investors, with its token price climbing 16.17% to $0.035 in stage 6. Investors looking to position themselves early in the next wave of DeFi innovation should explore both ADA’s ecosystem and MUTM’s rapidly growing presale before the next price increase.

Instead of buying the coin directly, the fund has done so by holding shares in companies that own large Bitcoin reserves . As the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, its latest move has drawn attention from the crypto world and traditional finance alike. A Sharp Rise in Bitcoin-Linked Holdings Standard Chartered’s Geoffrey Kendrick recently spotlighted Norges’s latest financial moves. Kendrick reported that the bank boosted its Bitcoin -linked holdings by 83% in Q2 of 2025. He found this information by analyzing recent 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The filings showed that the Norges Bank increased its indirect Bitcoin exposure from 6,200 BTC to 11,400 BTC in just three months. Almost all of this increase came from shares in Strategy’s MSTR. Also, Metaplanet added another 200 BTC, equivalent to the total. Kendrick stressed that such a dramatic rise did not just happen . It is a result of a clear and intentional move by the fund’s managers. Using Strategy and Metaplanet as Gateways Instead of holding the top coin directly, NBIM has opted to gain exposure through well-known Bitcoin-focused companies. Strategy, led by Michael Saylor, currently owns over 628,000 BTC, worth nearly $74 billion at today’s prices. This makes the U.S.-based firm the single largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin. Metaplanet, often described as “Japan’s MicroStrategy,” has followed a similar path. It holds more than 18,000 BTC, valued at $2 billion, placing it among the top ten corporate holders. This strategy of holding these firms’ shares has allowed Norges Bank to benefit from Bitcoin’s growth without holding the asset outright. Kendrick’s analysis of the Q2 2025 builds on an earlier report he released in May. He highlighted a rise in sovereign and government-related investors buying shares of Bitcoin-heavy companies. He had previously predicted that more sovereign wealth funds would join this trend in 2025. This forecast is now being realized with NBIM’s latest move. Standard Chartered Analysts Give Bold Crypto Price Predictions Beyond his analysis of sovereign investment activity, Kendrick has also been one of the most bullish analysts on crypto prices. He recently raised his price target for Bitcoin, predicting it could reach $135,000 by September 2025, $200,000 by year-end, and $500,000 by 2028. His outlook for other digital assets is similarly bullish, expecting BNB to rise to $2,775 by 2028, Avalanche (AVAX) to hit $250 by 2029, and XRP price to climb to $12.50 by 2028. At the same time, he foresees the stablecoin market’s total adoption to nearly $2 trillion by 2028. Ethereum (ETH) has also featured prominently in his forecasts. He now expects the second-largest cryptocurrency to hit $7,500 by year-end, rising to $25,000 by 2028.

This kind of technical weakness is rare for the company, especially when the stock market continues to push forward. Berkshire’s Class A shares haven’t been able to close above the long-term line since early July, and for a firm with a $300 billion equity portfolio, that’s not going unnoticed. The pattern is triggering questions about what exactly is going on inside Warren Buffett’s investment house. Turns out, there’s been plenty. Berkshire’s new 13F filing for Q2 shows a messy mix of decisions; some defensive, some risky, and others that suggest a straight-up shift in strategy. Berkshire exits telecom and cuts Apple holding by $9.2B One of the biggest moves was a sharp cut to Apple. Berkshire dumped 20 million shares, shaving $9.2 billion off the position’s value. That still leaves Apple as the portfolio’s biggest piece, but the trim is real. There’s no sugarcoating it. It’s a cut. Next up, Bank of America. Berkshire sold 26 million shares, taking its stake down to roughly 8%. This is one of Warren’s longest-standing bets in the finance industry, so reducing it like this screams caution. Then came the complete exit from T-Mobile US. Berkshire pulled every cent out of its $1 billion telecom investment. Done. Out. No leftovers. This isn’t shocking to people who follow Warren closely. He’s never been super into telecom. But killing the position entirely this quarter shows the skepticism never really went away. While Warren was exiting those positions, he also made some new bets. The filing shows Berkshire buying into Lennar, a major U.S. homebuilder. The housing market is a wreck right now; mortgage rates are sky high, affordability is garbage, and Trump’s White House has made the market even tougher for first-time buyers. But Berkshire still bought in. It’s unclear how deep the position is just yet, but it’s there, and it came at a time when the sector is still dealing with major obstacles. $1.6B UnitedHealth bet lands during Justice probe The biggest surprise in the filing? Berkshire went straight into UnitedHealth Group, buying over 5 million shares worth about $1.6 billion. That move hit the market like a flash grenade. Why? Because UnitedHealth is not doing great. The company’s been under federal investigation over how it handles Medicare billing. Its CEO, Andrew Witty, resigned in May, and just a month before this investment, UnitedHealth had to yank its annual earnings forecast, replacing it with a new one that missed Wall Street’s expectations. This was not a low-risk buy. Shares had already been down nearly 50% for the year before Berkshire’s announcement that made UnitedHealth’s stock shoot up by 9.6% after hours, eventually ending the day up 12%, its biggest daily gain since March 2020. That bounce helped push the Dow Jones to an all-time intraday high the same day. George Hill, a healthcare analyst at Deutsche Bank, told clients the investment could act like a short-term floor for the entire managed care sector. He said: “Given Berkshire’s investment track record, it could serve as a near-term bottom and rallying point for other investors that the space is safe to invest in again.” Despite all that, UnitedHealth is still under the Justice Department’s microscope, still facing backlash over rising healthcare costs, and still trying to earn back trust after a year of missed targets and executive chaos. Yet Berkshire made the buy. But that’s just Warren, unpredictable as ever.

With instant crypto-to-bank transfers, a wallet beta launch on September 15th and a $20M milestone set to trigger its first CEX listing reveal, Remittix is being tipped as the project with the highest upside potential in the coming months. Ethereum Price Prediction Points To New Highs Soon The ETH Price today is holding just 3% below its all-time high of $4,891 after a remarkable climb from $1,500 in April to $4,700. This rally has made Ethereum the driving force behind recent altcoin gains, with Ethereum News showing it outperforming most large caps. The Ethereum Price Prediction now hinges on breaking the $4,700–$4,891 zone, which could spark a fresh speculative wave. However, leverage in altcoin markets has hit record highs, raising the risk of sharper reversals. While ETH Price momentum remains strong, analysts are turning attention to Remittix, a payments-focused token they see as better positioned for triple-digit growth before September. SOL Price Sees $85M In Exchange Outflows The SOL Price today is holding strong after an 18.3% surge last week, breaking past the long-standing $196 ceiling and signaling a potential push toward $250. Technicals back the bullish outlook, with a golden cross on the MACD and the Solana Price RSI at 66, hinting at sustained momentum. Exchange outflows of over $85M in SOL point to strong holder conviction, while open interest is up 15%, showing growing speculative demand. Analysts tracking Solana News say clearing $219 could trigger a wave of short liquidations, adding more buying pressure. Some Solana Price Prediction models even set $500 as a near-term target, with $1,000 possible if major resistance levels fall. Still, despite this strength, market experts are tipping Remittix as a higher-upside play before September. XRP News Shows Rare Positive August Performance The XRP Price today is holding at $3.12 after gaining 6.2% in August, marking a solid rebound from early-month lows. Historically, August has been mixed for XRP, with more losing years than winning ones, but this month’s move could signal a rare bullish outcome. XRP News shows the token must maintain support above $3 to stay on track. While the Ripple Price Prediction for September is uncertain due to past volatility, late-year months like November and December have historically delivered massive rallies. Analysts tracking top crypto picks note that macro conditions are stronger this cycle, but many still favor Remittix for higher upside before September. Remittix Leads Top Crypto Picks Ahead Of September Remittix is quickly becoming a standout in analysts’ top crypto picks ahead of September, outshining Ethereum, Solana and XRP in growth potential. Built for real-world payments, the platform enables instant crypto-to-bank transfers in local currency without hidden fees. Over $19.7M has already been raised, with more than 602M tokens sold at $0.0944, up over 500% from its initial $0.015 launch price. Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction Direct crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries Wallet beta launches September 15th, 2025 First CEX listing reveal at $20M milestone $250,000 Remittix Giveaway and 40% bonus live now The Remittix Wallet beta will go live on September 15th, giving early testers access to its seamless PayFi tech.

Two standout digital coins have caught attention recently, hinting at enormous potential for gains. This article delves into why Hyperliquid and Pendle are poised to offer substantial returns. Are these cryptos the key to maximizing profits in the volatile market? Read on to discover. Hyperliquid Market Review: Subtle Month Moves & Substantial Six-Month Gains Hyperliquid showed a modest one-month increase of 0.57%, while over six months the coin surged by 87.01%, signaling strong long-term appreciation. A one-week gain of 17.61% hints at short-term strength despite overall volatility. Price action over these periods reveals restrained movement in the near term set against impressive gains over a longer span, reflecting a dynamic blend of cautious runs and healthy growth. The current trading setup displays clear levels that guide market play. Immediate resistance is observed at $55.58 while the closest support holds at $29.46. A second resistance emerges at $68.64 and a deeper support lies at $16.40. Supporting indicators hint at a moderately bullish tone. Weekly gains favor bulls, but the month’s muted change and layered resistance levels create uncertainty about a clear trend. Trading within these levels using the support near $29.46 as an entry point and testing resistance around $55.58 for exits may yield a balanced approach. Pendle Price Performance: Month Gains, Strong Support and Resistance Zones Pendle has experienced solid upward movement with a one-month rise of 33.46% and a six-month increase of 49.72%. Weekly activity at 8.15% has affirmed the coin’s growing momentum. Price shifts over these intervals highlight heightened investor interest and recovery chances. These gains have boosted sentiment and solidified confidence among traders looking to capitalize on a robust market trend. The steady climb reflects an environment where buying interest has driven prices higher and maintained a positive trajectory. Pendle currently trades between $3.17 and $4.96, with the nearest resistance level at $5.88 and support at $2.30. A second resistance is noted at $7.68, and a second support at $0.52, providing traders with key decision points. Market indicators show an RSI near 63, suggesting a healthy inclination toward upward movement. Bulls seem to dominate the market given recent gains, although caution is advised due to the lack of a clear trend. Traders may look to buy near the support level of $2.30, aiming for a rebound to $5.88, while others may await a test of upper resistance for profit opportunities. Conclusion HYPE and PENDLE show strong potential for large gains. They are gaining attention due to their unique features and market momentum. These cryptocurrencies could offer significant returns due to increasing interest and potential adoption. Staying informed about their developments could be beneficial.

Enthusiasts are buzzing with anticipation about the potential these digital currencies hold. This intriguing piece delves into the promising growth prospects of these coins and what might be driving their expected surge. Get ready for an exciting deep dive into their ascending trajectories. NEAR Protocol: Short-Term Rally Hints Amid Long-Term Weakness NEAR Protocol showed a modest rise recently with a 4.34% gain over the past month and a 4.76% increase in the last week, while a six-month decline of 18.34% indicates longer-term challenges. Price movements were confined within a range between $2.00 and $3.08 during this period. Despite the short-term momentum, the coin has not escaped its broader downtrend. The half-year drop suggests caution regarding further upward movement, with price action remaining relatively stable within this corridor. At current levels, NEAR is trading between $2.00 and $3.08, with bulls testing nearby resistance at $3.63 and support at $1.47. The second resistance is at $4.71, while the second support is near $0.39, marking targets for potential breakouts or pullbacks. The RSI reading at 53.582 implies a near-neutral stance in the market, indicating neither strong bullish nor bearish pressure. The market appears to be range-bound, suggesting traders could consider buying on dips or capturing short-term gains if a breakout occurs above resistance. Algorand Price Analysis: Past Trends and Current Levels Algorand experienced a decline over the last month with a drop of 8.165%, while it slipped by 7.957% over the past six months. A small decline of 1.1635% in the past week indicates a period of reduced upward momentum. Price action over these timeframes shows that Algorand has been on a downward path, with shorter intervals reflecting sharper movements compared to the longer timeframe. Past performance suggests consistent pressure on the coin’s value, indicating that market sentiment has been leaning toward caution. Current price levels show Algorand trading between $0.1637 and $0.3306, with resistance at $0.4171 and support at $0.0833. Technical indicators show a near-neutral relative strength index of 51.8814 and a slightly positive momentum indicator of 0.0240, while the Awesome Oscillator is very close to zero at -0.0014. This situation suggests neither bulls nor bears have a firm grip. Traders might consider buying near support while monitoring resistance for potential price movements. Position sizing is crucial given the contained range and possible breakout scenarios. Conclusion NEAR and ALGO are showing promising signs of growth. Both tokens are potentially on an upward trend. This indicates they could triple in value. Investors might see significant returns if current conditions hold. Tech developments and strong community support are driving positive sentiment. These factors suggest NEAR and ALGO could stand out in the market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Speculation is rife over which altcoins will lead the charge and deliver huge returns. Dive into this article to discover three standout coins that are poised to soar and potentially deliver tenfold gains in this upcoming cycle. Curious? Keep reading. Arweave’s Mixed Momentum Sets Stage for a Potential Rebound Arweave ’s price moved within a band of about $5 to $9 over the past month, marking a slight dip of roughly 1.5% that reflects a cautious trading atmosphere. A look at the six-month performance reveals a sharper decline near 20% as downward pressure pushed prices below previous highs. During this period, price fluctuations indicate a consolidation phase before any major directional shift. This behavior suggests that traders are testing the market’s resilience while awaiting clearer signals to drive either further losses or rebound moves. Current trading levels show Arweave negotiating key barriers with resistance identified near $10.88 and a strong floor of support at $2.92. The trading range has hovered between approximately $4.93 and $8.91, indicating a zone where buyers and sellers cautiously trade positions. Market indicators like the relative strength index near 51.53 point to a balance between bullish and bearish control. Oscillators show modest positive activity, hinting at possible upside pressure. Traders may explore short-term positions between these levels, considering accumulation near support and taking profits near resistance as the market remains in consolidation without a clear trend. SUI's Volatile Journey and Strategic Trading Zones SUI experienced notable volatility recently, with weekly gains of 0.51% contrasting against a month decline of 7.08%. Over the past half-year, the coin showed an overall increase of 11.43%, highlighting periods of recovery amid downturns. The price action has fluctuated within a narrow trading band, indicating changes in market sentiment. Variations in price suggest shifts in trader confidence, moving from cautious selling to strategic buying as the coin faces ongoing volatility. Currently, SUI is trading in a range from $2.70 to $4.49, with resistance at $5.36 and support at $1.78. This defined range offers traders clear zones for entry and exit. Market sentiment appears balanced, with the Relative Strength Index slightly above neutral at 52.57 and moderate momentum at 0.397. The coin's recent 0.51% increase hints at selling pressure, while the 11% half-year gain indicates resilience. Traders may consider buying near support, targeting $5.36, while a breakout could open up resistance at $7.16. Mantle MNT: Recent Surge Spurs Bullish Prospects Mantle saw a sharp 51.26% rise over the last month complemented by a modest 4.38% gain in the past six months. The coin traded within a range of $0.58 to $0.88, reflecting increased interest and a rapid price surge recently. The recent month’s jump suggests that momentum has quickly built after a steadier six-month run, indicating an emerging shift in market behavior. Currently, Mantle’s price sits between $0.58 and $0.88, with crucial levels to watch. Immediate resistance is around $1.01, while a stronger barrier appears near $1.31. On the support side, levels at roughly $0.42 and lower around $0.12 offer potential entry points. The RSI is trading near 66, hinting at subtle bullish pressure. Bulls show signs of control within these levels, yet the absence of a clear trend keeps the market balanced. Strategic trades near support levels could serve as entry, while a successful breach above $1.01 might lead to further gains. Conclusion AR , SUI , and MNT are positioned for tremendous growth in this market cycle. Their unique features and strong fundamentals make them standout candidates. With increased interest and investment, these coins have the potential to achieve significant returns. The projections suggest that they will outperform many other options. Investors should consider these coins for their growth potential. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Maker and Synthetix are catching the eye of traders and analysts alike. Their current momentum hints at a potential bullish run. Discover what sets these coins apart and why they might be ready to make waves in the market. Maker Price Update: Balancing Short-Term Bearish Signals with Long-Term Gains Maker has seen modest short-term adjustments with notable long-term gains. Over the past month, the price shifted by -1.14%, while the six-month performance boasts an impressive gain of 84.05%. Weekly data shows a drop of -7.28%, indicating temporary volatility. The coin has traded within a range of approximately $1721 to $2315, demonstrating stability amid fluctuations. Key indicators, such as the Momentum indicator at 33.10 and an RSI of 41.96, highlight a phase of adjustment after a previous upward trend. Despite short-term bearish pressure, the overall long-term performance remains strong. Current price levels reveal significant technical interest. Trading now occurs between support at $1465 and resistance at $2654, with a secondary resistance at $3248 and deeper support near $871. The recent candlestick action indicates bears have gained ground, as seen in the weekly dip. However, the broader six-month trend suggests underlying bullish potential. Minor negative signals from oscillators and moving averages exhibit a lack of clear trend, leading to cautious trading. Approaches focusing on retracements near support levels may present entry points, while a break above $2654 could signal a potential rally. Traders should remain vigilant of evolving momentum and shifts in RSI readings for signs of renewed buying interest. Synthetix Market Analysis: Recent Trends and Key Price Levels Synthetix experienced a 0.61% change in the past month, alongside a 7.08% weekly increase. However, a significant 32.69% drop over the last six months highlights a prolonged weakness in the market. Price movements have shown unevenness, with short-term gains contrasting against longer-term declines. Recent performance has been relatively flat, but the overall half-year trend indicates a notable downturn. This mixed record suggests sporadic recovery efforts occurring within a predominantly bearish environment over a more extended period. The current price fluctuates between $0.49 and $0.73, with key resistance identified at $0.87 and support positioned at $0.40. Trading strategies can focus on these key levels, while an additional resistance emerges at $1.11 and further support close to $0.16. Current oscillator readings, with an Awesome Oscillator at 0.0257, a Momentum Indicator of 0.082, and an RSI of 53.01, indicate no decisive dominance by either bulls or bears. The absence of a clear trend suggests that traders might explore cautious long positions above $0.40, while a breakdown could lead to selling pressure. Targeting resistance at $0.87 may be viable if upward momentum develops, with risk management strategies prepared for any declines below established support. Conclusion MKR and SNX are showing strong potential for significant gains in the near future. Both offer unique benefits and innovative features that make them stand out. MKR’s role in stablecoin production and SNX’s platform for creating synthetic assets position them well in the market. The combination of strong community support and continuous development suggests that these coins could see impressive growth. All signs point to MKR and SNX being key players to watch in the upcoming market cycle. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

As the market anticipates another Bitcoin surge, certain cryptocurrencies like XRP , LINK , and TAO show signs of potential growth. This article explores why these coins could be worth watching closely. XRP Analysis: Steady Growth Amid Key Support and Resistance Levels Past performance shows steady growth for XRP , with a gain of 7.6% over the last month and approximately 13.7% over the past six months. These increases reflect a gradual rise in investor confidence and a consolidation of value. Overall movement has been modest yet positive, indicating a market characterized by stability and slow gains. Price action during this period has seen XRP maintain an accessible range, setting a foundation for possible upward movements as market sentiment evolves. Current price dynamics show XRP trading between $2.23 and $3.74, with resistance at $4.46 and support at $1.43. Recently, a slight drop of 5.43% has introduced bearish pressure, although buyers are waiting for lower entry points. Momentum at 0.18 and an RSI near 52 suggest a balanced market leaning towards cautious optimism. Traders should consider a potential support-level reversal if buying interest increases, while a break above $4.46 might trigger bullish actions. Caution is advised with mixed oscillator readings and potential profit-taking near $5.97. Rational strategies include watching for entry opportunities near support and monitoring for quick trades around resistance. Chainlink Surges Amid Bullish Momentum and Fresh Resistance Zones Chainlink recorded a 42.87% jump over one month and a steady 21.14% gain in the past six months with a 24.51% push in the span of one week. Price fluctuations stayed within a range of $13.02 to $20.56 while testing dynamic momentum across shorter timeframes. The coin’s history of swift gains indicates volatile yet resilient behavior that rewarded bullish sentiment and tactical positions in recent sessions. Current price action finds Chainlink testing key levels with resistance seen at $24.18 and a secondary cap at $31.71, while support holds firm at $9.12 with an additional cushion around $1.58. A clear trend remains elusive as the market oscillates between optimism and caution. Indicators suggest a leaning towards bullish activity and momentum buildup. Traders might find opportunities to capture gains by considering accumulation near support and potential scalps on upticks. Cautious entries and measured exits could form a viable strategy during this transitional phase, allowing trades to exploit moments when the market decisively tilts in favor of upward moves. Bittensor (TAO) Price Overview: Volatility and Key Levels TAO dropped by 13.28% over the past month while recording a modest six-month gain of 0.72%. The weekly change rose by 1.86%, hinting at some short-term recovery amid fluctuating sentiment. Price behavior has been uneven, with a range that recently spanned from $291.73 to $437.93. This mixed performance reflects a market that has seen both dips and slight rebounds, marking the coin’s journey as one of variable investor interest. TAO is currently trading between clear support at $230.37 and resistance at $522.76, with a wider price range extending from $84.17 to $668.97. The awesome oscillator at -12.58 indicates lingering bearish pressure, while a momentum reading of 35.90 and an RSI at 50.02 suggest a neutral stance without a definitive trend. Bulls may look for gains as the price approaches resistance, but caution is advised near support. Trading ideas include watching for a breakout above $522.76 or considering long entries around $230.37 on dips, remaining alert to market changes. Conclusion XRP , LINK , and TAO present strong potential for growth. XRP aims to revolutionize banking transactions. LINK supports smart contracts by enabling data sharing. TAO focuses on providing innovative technology solutions. Each has unique strengths that could see significant gains. Keeping an eye on these coins could offer opportunities before the market shifts again. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Sharing a screenshot of the voting tally, he remarked that the feature represents “one of the biggest XRPL game changers” and pressed validators, asking, “What’s the hold up?” His comments reflect growing impatience among those who see the proposal as a pivotal step for the ledger’s institutional future. Current Voting Status The amendment, formally introduced in XRPL version 2.4.0, is not yet enabled. According to the tracker, 22 validators have voted in favor and 13 against, leaving the proposal at 62.86% consensus. The threshold for activation stands at 28 of 35 votes, meaning the measure remains short. With the status still marked as Voting, the feature remains in limbo until validator alignment improves. Still waiting on one of the biggest XRPL game changers to go live. Come on validators. What's the hold up? pic.twitter.com/dLH0A2MXJB — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) August 15, 2025 What Permissioned Domains Enable The amendment defines a new ledger entry type, PermissionedDomain, alongside transactions to create, update, and delete domains. Each domain specifies a set of acceptable credentials, with up to 10 combinations of issuer and credential type that participants must hold to interact within that environment. This credential-based gating allows applications such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or lending protocols to operate under compliance-driven rules. This makes it possible for institutions to restrict access to verified participants while still active on the public ledger. For many developers and compliance teams, the prospect of a standardized access-control framework directly integrated into XRPL is considered a prerequisite for broader institutional adoption. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why Is This Amendment Important? Ripple CTO David Schwartz recently weighed in on the matter, highlighting the compliance barrier that prevents institutions from using the XRPL DEX. He explained that even Ripple cannot rely on it for payments because it cannot be certain who is providing liquidity. There is always the possibility that it could come from a sanctioned group or even a terrorist organization. That legal uncertainty has prevented mass institutional adoption of XRP despite Ripple having over 300 bank partnerships. However, Permissioned Domains are meant to resolve it by ensuring only verified participants can operate within specific environments. Permissioned Domains also align with the GENIUS Act by enforcing credential checks that meet KYC and compliance standards set for stablecoins. Together, they ensure only verified participants can access certain XRPL functions, reducing regulatory and counterparty risk. The eventual approval of Permissioned Domains would mark a significant milestone in positioning XRPL as a platform suited not only for open token issuance and trading but also for regulated markets. However, until more validators shift their stance, the amendment will remain pending. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

50192861,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=785533,1755366912,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50192861.jpeg,Samsung gains on Apple in U.S. as foldable phones drive market share jump,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/samsung-claws-back-us-market-share-apple/,"Samsung is eating into Apple’s control of the U.S. smartphone market again, and this time, it’s folding phones doing the damage. In Q2 of 2025, Apple’s U.S. market share dropped from 56% to 49%, while Samsung jumped from 23% to 31%, according to Canalys. For the first time in over a decade, Apple’s position looks shaky on its home turf, and it’s all about who’s pushing the next big screen. This isn’t the first round. In 2014, Samsung sold big-screen phones while Apple dragged its feet, eventually catching up with the iPhone 6. That crushed it for Apple. But now the tables are turning. This time, Samsung isn’t just making bigger screens. It’s folding them in half, and Apple still hasn’t entered that space. Foldables are everywhere as Apple stands still In July, Samsung added three new models to its Galaxy lineup: the Z Fold 7, the Z Flip, and the thin Galaxy S25 Edge. The Fold 7 opens into a tablet. The Flip folds vertically like a flip phone from the 2000s. All three are already out, and they’re pushing numbers. A viral video posted last month showed someone folding the Z Fold 7 more than 200,000 times on a livestream. One clip from that stream pulled over 15 million views on YouTube. Sprout Social tracked over 50,000 mentions of Samsung’s high-end phones in the past month. 83% of those were either neutral or positive. Drew Blackard, VP of mobile product management at Samsung Electronics America, said, “There really are no longer trade-offs towards owning a foldable device.” Blackard also said the Z Fold 7 had 25% more preorders than any other Samsung foldable and is selling 50% faster than the previous model. Pricing plays a big role. Apple’s most expensive phone, the iPhone 16 Pro Max, starts at $1,199 and maxes out at $1,599 for 1TB of storage. Samsung’s Z Fold 7 starts at $1,999 and goes up to $2,419. Samik Chatterjee, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase, expects Apple’s future foldable phone to start at $1,999. Beyond foldables, Samsung is winning because it sells everything, from $650 models to premium $2,400 devices. Apple’s phone lineup is locked between $829 and $1,599. Canalys analyst Runar Bjorhovde said, “There is an idea that you can target people at every single price point, and you can meet them at every spot.” Apple delays as tariffs and AI add pressure Tariffs have also added fuel to the fire. Industry analysts say part of Samsung’s Q2 gains came from manufacturers adjusting to disruptions in trade policies. Apple hasn’t adapted the same way. Meanwhile, Samsung’s global sell-through rose 16% in Q2, helped by the premium models, especially the S25 Edge. Apple, on the other hand, hasn’t changed its design since 2017. All four iPhone models still look like the same glass rectangle. That’s expected to change next month with the rumored 5.5mm iPhone Air, which Loop Capital’s John Donovan says Apple is “betting” on. But it’s not foldable. Chatterjee believes the first foldable iPhone won’t arrive until September 2026, possibly as part of the iPhone 18 line. Foldables are also perfect for AI. Samsung phones get full access to Google’s Gemini model, which outperforms Siri in almost every way. Blackard said features like circle-to-search work better on foldables, allowing users to multitask across both displays. Meanwhile, Apple’s next-gen Siri has been delayed until next year. That’s led to concerns about Apple falling behind in AI while companies like OpenAI move forward. In May, OpenAI spent $6.5 billion buying the startup from Apple’s former chief designer Jony Ive. That team is now building new hardware, wearables that ditch the screen entirely. Apple isn’t in panic mode yet. Chatterjee said Apple’s usual strategy is to wait until a tech matures before jumping in. “It’s about being watchful, seeing a technology mature, knowing that there are no big roadblocks to that technology adoption, and then moving ahead.” But that patience comes with risk. Investors have already punished Apple’s stock this year, dragging it down 7.5%. Only Tesla’s performance has been worse among major U.S. tech stocks. Samsung, meanwhile, is up 35% year-to-date.

As both currencies hover at enticing entry points, the stage is set for a potential surge. The hints of a major rally are drawing attention, promising significant gains. Uncover which coins are primed for growth and why now could be a turning point. Bitcoin Market Outlook: Recent Performance and Key Price Channels Over the last month, Bitcoin has experienced a modest pullback with a drop of 0.52%. This indicates slight consolidation in price. Over the past six months, however, Bitcoin has shown notable strength with an increase of 22.70%. This performance reflects a period of recovery and accumulation by traders who have remained active despite short-term weakness. Price changes over these time frames suggest that recent trading has been subdued, but the overall trend over the last half-year points toward resilient upward market sentiment. Bitcoin is currently trading between $106,632 and $123,514, with nearest resistance at $131,225.23 and support at $97,462.03. A further resistance is at $148,106.83, while a second support lies at $80,580.43. The market does not show a clear trend, as bulls and bears are actively contesting. The price movement appears to balance short-term pressure and longer-term bullish indicators. Traders might consider entering near the support levels while monitoring resistance zones for potential exits, calling for careful adjustment of stops and pursuit of opportunities within established levels. Ethereum's Growth and Key Price Levels in the Current Rally Ethereum experienced a notable surge this past month, gaining 32.14%, and a substantial increase of 67.50% over the last six months. This performance reflects strengthened market sentiment and heightened investor engagement. The price dynamics indicate a shift from previous range-bound fluctuations to a more aggressive upward trajectory. The coin's path illustrates phases of rapid increases, followed by corrective adjustments in a lively market, drawing interest from both individual and institutional traders. Recent figures highlight an evolving landscape that fosters renewed confidence in Ethereum, setting the foundation for potential future growth. Ethereum trades within a range of approximately $2736.67 to $4301.41, with a key resistance level at $4903.83, which may challenge upward momentum. Support around $1774.35 offers a potential entry point for buyers if prices dip. Additional resistance exists near $6468.57, while a less relevant low at $209.61 is noted. Though bulls remain active, the RSI at 66.90 suggests overbought conditions. Market indicators, such as the Awesome Oscillator at 739.42, support a bullish environment despite bear challenges. Given the lack of a clear trend, traders are advised to buy near support levels and assess short-term exits around resistance, adapting strategies to ongoing market fluctuations. Conclusion BTC and ETH are presenting themselves as promising buys. Their current low prices mean potential for significant gains. Both cryptocurrencies have strong foundations and large communities. The market indicates a possible rise soon. This moment might be seen as a unique chance for high returns. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Real-world assets are making waves as they integrate with blockchain technology. Investors are eager to discover which tokens are poised for spectacular growth. This article delves into the coins that could potentially multiply investments in this emerging landscape. Chainlink Price Rally Amid Clear Support and Resistance Zones Chainlink saw a solid surge in price over the last month, with a notable 31.20% increase, reflecting growing investor interest and a buoyant market sentiment that extended over the past six months with a 17.13% rise. Price movements have demonstrated dynamic fluctuations, as its value ranged from around $13 to $20.55, hinting at both healthy risk appetite and active speculative trading. The asset’s recent performance painted a picture of robust momentum and positive technical trends without any dramatic dips, indicating a maturing cycle as traders capitalized on market swings and anticipated further upside. Current trading activity presents a price range between $13 and $20.55, with a main resistance level near $24.18 and immediate support roughly at $9.12. Bulls currently hold a slight edge, evidenced by a one-week gain of almost 10% and momentum indicators pointing upward, although the overall market pace shows no overpowering trend. Traders can explore long positions when the price bounces off support near $9.12 or look to scale out near resistance at $24.18. The moderately high RSI near 61, coupled with oscillators, suggests opportunities to ride the bullish wave, provided price action remains contained inside these key zones. Algorand Price Analysis: Support, Resistance, and Market Trends Over the past week, Algorand saw a drop of about 4.3%, continuing a trend with a decline of nearly 10.6% over the past month and roughly 7.8% over the last six months. Price levels indicated lower lows and modest highs, reflecting steady downward pressure with moments of consolidation. This history shows a market facing consistent sell pressure while maintaining relatively stable fundamentals, as traders exhibit caution amid ongoing volatility. Current analysis reveals Algorand trading between $0.1637 and $0.3306, with the nearest resistance at approximately $0.4171 and support around $0.0833. Market indicators are mixed; the Awesome Oscillator is slightly negative at -0.0044, while the Momentum Indicator is just above zero at 0.0118, signaling indecision. The Relative Strength Index stands near 49.63, suggesting a near-neutral market. Current price action shows no clear trend, with bulls aiming to hold support at $0.0833, while bears could test the lower range if prices fail to maintain above support. Trading strategies may involve tight stop-loss orders and short-term trades around key levels. VeChain Price Outlook: Historical Downturn and Key Levels VeChain has experienced a steady downturn with a price drop of 5.34% over the past month and a more pronounced decline of 27.95% over the last six months. The recent performance reflects ongoing bearish pressure in the market. Price movement has remained constrained within relatively narrow bounds during this period, with the downward trend becoming apparent to traders. Historical price action indicates that the coin has been under continuous selling momentum, resulting in a notable reduction from earlier levels. This behavior has set the stage for traders to closely watch the current key levels, anticipating that any reversal or further deterioration could have a marked impact. At present, VeChain trades between $0.0183 and $0.0291, with the nearest resistance level at $0.0350 and a secondary resistance at $0.0458. The nearest support sits at $0.0134, while a lower safety net is pegged at $0.0026. The technical indicators, including a slightly negative Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator, along with an RSI reading of 45.68, indicate bearish influence is present. Bulls do not appear to dominate. No clear trend is firmly established, prompting traders to consider entering near support levels for potential gains while remaining cautious as the price tests resistance. Conclusion LINK , ALGO , and VET are key players in a realm set for substantial growth. They offer promising avenues for portfolio expansion. These assets connect with real-world applications. They aim to bridge traditional sectors and blockchain technology. Their integration could transform multiple industries. In doing so, they present lucrative opportunities for investors. Their potential to multiply value is significant. Such assets are worth serious consideration in any diversified investment strategy.

Analysts say Ruvi AI (RUVI) could be the next breakout, with daily million-token sales accelerating after its CoinMarketCap (CMC) listing pushed it into trending sections. The presale is moving fast: Phase 2 is 90% complete at $0.015, and once it sells out, the price steps 33% higher to $0.020 for Phase 3. The final presale price is set at $0.070. With $3M raised, 230M tokens sold, and a holder base topping 2,900, RUVI’s momentum is backed by real numbers, not just hype. Why RUVI Is Gaining Traction Now CMC visibility turns discovery into buys as watchlists grow. Third-party credibility and exchange alignment reduce friction for new buyers. A leaderboard giveaway adds competitive incentive for larger entries. This combination, discovery, clarity, trust, and rewards, is exactly what pushes presales over the line. Utility Over Hype: The Creator-First AI Super App What sets Ruvi AI apart is product value. The RUVI super app consolidates the entire content workflow so creators and teams can produce more with fewer tools and less time. Research trends: Identify high-demand topics across platforms to plan winning content. Create scripts: Generate channel-ready scripts tuned to brand voice and format. Generate media: Produce images and videos natively, no app-hopping or extra subscriptions. Streamline output: Plan, iterate, schedule, and publish from one dashboard. Who benefits? YouTubers, TikTokers, agencies, brands, and lean marketing teams that need output, speed, and consistency. By tying token relevance to daily creative workflows, RUVI aims to build sticky, utility-led demand, similar to how early Cardano believers backed a vision with long-term fundamentals. Credibility and Access Signals That Matter CyberScope audit completed: Independent verification strengthens confidence in RUVI’s smart contracts and security. WEEX partnership: Alignment with a major exchange boosts visibility and simplifies the path to trading for token holders post-presale. Leaderboard giveaway: Ongoing rewards for larger contributors help sustain momentum as phases progress. These cues help bigger buyers move from interest to allocation without second-guessing the basics. Key Milestones at a Glance $3M raised to date 230M tokens sold 2,900+ holders Phase 2 at 90% completion 33% price step to $0.020 in Phase 3 Final presale price: $0.070 For investors who prefer signals over slogans, this snapshot shows accelerating traction and a clear path ahead. VIP Tiers: Modeled Upside at a $1 Valuation If you’re weighing a larger allocation, the VIP program demonstrates how bonuses can amplify modeled outcomes if adoption scales: VIP 2 ($750 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 9,233% ROI. VIP 3 ($1,500 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At $1, this equals $160,000, delivering a 10,566% ROI. VIP 5 ($7,500 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens, boosted by a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At $1, this equals $1,000,000, achieving a 13,233% ROI. These are models, not guarantees, but they help explain why investors are acting before the 33% price step hits. Bottom Line Early Cardano rewards went to those who recognized clear catalysts and real utility before the crowd. RUVI checks the right boxes: a CMC-fueled discovery engine, a completed CyberScope audit for trust, a WEEX partnership for access, and a creator-first AI super app built for daily use. With Phase 2 at 90% completion and a programmed jump to $0.020 next, then $0.070 at presale close, the lower entry window is closing fast. If you’re targeting high-growth AI exposure with tangible product value and visible milestones, Ruvi AI deserves a top spot on your shortlist.

With Bitcoin recently hitting $124,000 before retracing to $117,975, the question isn’t whether crypto will go higher in 2025—it’s which asset offers the best risk-reward at this stage. While Bitcoin, Solana, and BNB remain strong plays, emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are now entering the spotlight. Backed by audit-verified code, institutional interest, and grassroots momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction as a high-conviction altcoin for early-stage growth. Here’s how the four stack up in today’s market: Bitcoin (BTC): Pullback Signals Opportunity Bitcoin remains the industry bellwether, and recent volatility hasn’t shaken its long-term narrative. After reaching $124K, BTC dropped to $117,975 due to inflation concerns and bearish comments from U.S. Treasury officials. Over $1 billion in liquidations followed. Still, analysts point out the corrections are becoming shallower, showing signs of resilience. As ETFs continue to attract institutional inflows, and with the 2025 halving narrative still in play, Bitcoin could reclaim and surpass $130K quickly. But at its size, many investors are turning to altcoins for higher multiples. Solana (SOL): Staking Interest Fuels Momentum Solana has rebounded strongly, with the price trading around $202.80 after breaking above $200 for the first time in a month. It’s up nearly 20% on the week, thanks to growing staking rewards, institutional activity, and sustained developer interest. August forecasts put SOL between $203 and $208, with upside continuing if support holds. The network’s combination of speed, cost-efficiency, and DeFi infrastructure keeps it firmly in the conversation for top altcoin plays. BNB: Network Upgrades and Whale Confidence BNB recently reached a new ATH of $867 before dipping to $817.12. The Pascal Hardfork and token burns have strengthened the Binance Smart Chain, making BNB an attractive long-term hold. Its recent momentum—fueled by institutional support—has outperformed expectations, and many believe the coin will revisit ATH territory before Q4 ends. Still, regulatory pressures and exchange risk remain factors to monitor. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Final Allocation Before Breakout MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing increasing attention from investors who previously missed early runs in Solana and Dogecoin. The project’s token supply, double audit, and growing community are creating a narrative of scarcity and trust. With forecasts pointing to a 50x–75x upside potential during the next altcoin surge, early buyers are positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as a cycle-defining play. It’s also benefiting from capital rotation out of overbought majors and into newer, undervalued assets. The Bottom Line Bitcoin, Solana, and BNB remain solid holds. But for investors looking for early-stage upside with smart positioning, MAGACOIN FINANCE may offer the most explosive growth potential going into the final leg of the 2025 bull cycle.

While Bitcoin’s stability and Ethereum’s network dominance continue to anchor the market, the biggest surges are often found in the altcoin sector. Dogecoin and XRP are among the standout names, each showing technical setups that could deliver notable returns this year. Dogecoin maintains its position as the leading meme coin, backed by a strong and loyal community presence. XRP benefits from renewed confidence after securing legal clarity in its SEC case, opening doors for broader adoption. Cold Wallet ($CWT) , however, is carving its own path with a presale offering tied to practical utility and a projected 4900% ROI, positioning it as a top contender for the best crypto to buy in 2025. Dogecoin Eyes $0.196 Support for Next Bullish Break Dogecoin is once again drawing attention as it hovers near the $0.196 support level. Holding this price zone could act as a launchpad for another upward push in the coming weeks. Historically, when DOGE has defended such key levels, sharp price rallies have followed, making this a closely watched moment for traders. The coin’s ongoing appeal stems from its energetic community and occasional celebrity endorsements, both of which keep retail interest alive. If buying pressure builds here, analysts see potential for a 20% to 30% climb toward recent resistance zones, though sentiment will remain the deciding factor. XRP Targets $12.60 After Clearing Legal Hurdles XRP is benefiting from a renewed wave of optimism after resolving its long-running legal battle with the SEC. This shift has lifted one of its biggest price barriers and restored market confidence in its role as a leader in cross-border payments. Current technical patterns suggest a possible move toward the $12.60 mark, provided momentum continues to build. Higher lows and steady movement along a bullish channel indicate sustained accumulation by large holders. Whale activity has been rising, hinting at strong institutional interest. If XRP breaks above key resistance with volume support, its next rally could carry significant weight. Cold Wallet Presale Marries Utility with 4900% ROI Potential Cold Wallet’s presale is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about opportunities of 2025, thanks to its rare combination of practical utility and exceptional growth potential. Priced at $0.00998 in Stage 17, the project has already raised $6.13 million and sold 730 million tokens. With a launch target of $0.3517, early participants are looking at a possible 4900% ROI if projections hold, placing Cold Wallet among the most ambitious presale plays in the market. At the core of Cold Wallet’s appeal is its focus on real-world functionality. Operating as a self-custody platform, it rewards users with its native CWT token for actions like paying gas fees, executing swaps, or using fiat on and off ramps. This cashback model turns routine blockchain activity into a revenue stream, enhancing adoption for both newcomers and seasoned traders. Beyond rewards, the project is preparing to implement Layer 2 or custom scaling solutions after the presale. This would allow near-zero gas reward distribution and lightning-fast transactions, solving one of the most persistent issues in blockchain usability. Such infrastructure upgrades could further cement Cold Wallet’s position as a long-term utility provider. With each presale stage, the entry price increases, reducing the upside for those who delay. This makes the current stage a time-sensitive opportunity for anyone seeking the best crypto to buy in 2025. By combining aggressive ROI potential with tangible utility, Cold Wallet is shaping up to be more than just a speculative token; it is building the foundation for a sustainable ecosystem. In Summary Dogecoin remains a speculative favorite, powered by its dedicated community and short-term bullish setups. XRP offers a more structured growth outlook, backed by legal clarity and expanding cross-border use cases, with technical signs hinting at a push toward $12.60. Yet Cold Wallet is emerging as the most compelling choice, blending real-world utility, self-custody benefits, and a projected 4900% ROI from its $0.00998 presale entry. For those seeking the best crypto to buy in 2025, combining DOGE’s speculative bursts, XRP’s fundamental strength, and Cold Wallet’s high-upside presale could deliver a balanced yet aggressive portfolio. This mix offers exposure to both stability and transformative growth potential.

The details were shared by three people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the plans. As part of the restructuring, the company’s new AI unit, Superintelligence Labs , will be divided into four groups, two sources confirmed. These include a newly created “TBD Lab,” a product team focused on the Meta AI assistant, an infrastructure team, and the Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) lab dedicated to advanced research. When asked for comment, the tech firm declined to respond. Meta increasingly adopts AI in its operations amid the AI boom era Research shows a growing trend among Silicon Valley companies to integrate AI more deeply into their operations as demand for the technology accelerates. Meta, formerly known as Facebook, is among those leading the charge. In a statement, Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, expressed that he is devoted to putting in place the necessary requirements to speed up the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), particularly in machines that mimic human reasoning and expand new income streams. Just like other tech giants, Meta faced several challenges in its operation. For instance, the tech company lost some of its top AI workers amid ongoing competition among Silicon Valley tech Companies for skilled AI talent. The company was also greatly disappointed with the recent launch of the Llama 4 model in April. According to the three sources, Meta has devised a strategy to reshuffle its AI initiatives under Superintelligence Labs to curb these challenges. Additionally, early this month, the tech giant partnered with Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO), a US-based investment management firm, and Blue Owl Capital, an American alternative investment asset management firm. This partnership will enable it to raise approximately $29 billion to support the construction of its data center located in rural Louisiana. Zuckerberg noted that heavy investment in AI infrastructure is central to the company’s ambition of becoming a global leader in the AI ecosystem. Just last month, the company raised its annual capital expenditure forecast by $2 billion to a range of $66 billion–$72 billion. For Meta, investing significant funds into the construction of data center infrastructure and enticing skilled AI workers to work at higher salaries will lead to a significant increase in expenses for 2026 compared to 2025. Meta initiates the use of Superintelligence Labs in its AI operations Mark Zuckerberg chose to reshuffle Meta’s AI efforts under Superintelligence Labs , a new unit that the company recently introduced because, according to him, it was a game-changer that promised to make the company remain competitive in the AI sector. Alexandr Wang, the former CEO and co-founder of Scale AI, who is currently Meta’s chief AI officer, was assigned the role of leading the new unit. In addition to Wang, the new unit will also include the participation of other senior AI staff, including Safe Superintelligence (SSI) co-founder and CEO, Daniel Gross. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that Zuckerberg has taken several initiatives to achieve this tremendous success. To illustrate, he initiated talent acquisition efforts and presented opportunities to startups like SSI, which OpenAI’s Ilya Sutskever initially co-founded. With this new unit, Meta aims to surpass rivals like Google, China’s DeepSeek, and OpenAI in the AI race.

This pattern is significant in technical analysis because it often signals the potential for a powerful upward move once resistance at the rim is broken. Gordon’s message is clear: if XRP can break through this level, the market could accelerate sharply to the upside. XRP is consolidating just below the crucial resistance zone. Over the past week, the token has tested the low-$3.30s before easing slightly. As of report time, XRP trades at $3.10. Market trackers confirm that recent intraday highs have reached about $3.33, while lows have dipped just above $3.10. The $3.30–$3.33 range remains the key ceiling that traders are watching. Why the $3.30 Zone Matters The $3.30 resistance aligns with recent local highs and sits just below XRP’s all-time high of $3.84, first set in 2018. This level is more than just psychological—it represents a supply zone where sellers have historically stepped in. A successful breakout and hold above this band would likely draw renewed momentum, paving the way for XRP to retest its historical peak. When $XRP breaks out from this bowl, we are going to SEND. Do you understand? pic.twitter.com/TZMlMcRZTz — Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) August 16, 2025 Legal and Market Tailwinds The technical setup is unfolding at a time when fundamentals are also turning favorable. The long-running SEC lawsuit against Ripple has effectively concluded . According to Reuters, Ripple agreed to a $125 million penalty, and importantly, there was no finding that secondary-market XRP sales are securities. This outcome removes years of regulatory uncertainty that weighed on XRP’s market sentiment. CoinDesk also reports that volumes surged around the $3.20–$3.33 range immediately following these developments, underscoring the market’s relief and optimism. What Traders Should Watch For Gordon’s bullish projection to play out, XRP must secure a decisive close above $3.33 on strong volume. Ideally, the breakout would convert this resistance into new support, giving the market confidence for a sustained rally. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 If successful, the path toward the 2018 all-time high becomes increasingly viable. Until then, XRP remains in a consolidation phase between roughly $3.10 and $3.30, where false breakouts remain a possibility. Gordon’s analysis captures a pivotal moment for XRP. With a powerful rounding-bottom pattern in play and regulatory headwinds easing, the stage is set for a potentially explosive move. The $3.30–$3.33 zone now serves as the decisive battleground. A breakout would likely validate Gordon’s “send” outlook and open the door for XRP to challenge its 2018 highs, while rejection would keep the market trapped in its current range.

50193087,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=190161,1755367810,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/50193087.jpeg,"Bitcoin Transfer Shakes Market: 7,625 BTC Moves from Coinbase to Unknown Wallet",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-transfer-coinbase-whale-2/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Transfer Shakes Market: 7,625 BTC Moves from Coinbase to Unknown Wallet A colossal Bitcoin transfer has recently sent ripples through the cryptocurrency world. Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking service, reported a massive movement of 7,625 BTC from Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, to an unknown Bitcoin wallet . This staggering transaction, valued at approximately $898 million at the time, represents a significant BTC movement and immediately captured the attention of market observers and investors alike. What Does a Coinbase Whale Transaction Signify? When we talk about a ‘whale’ in the crypto space, we refer to an individual or entity holding a substantial amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices with their trades. This particular Coinbase whale transaction, involving nearly a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin, is far from an everyday occurrence. Such a large-scale crypto whale transaction from a major exchange like Coinbase can signal several possibilities: Institutional Investment: A large financial institution might be accumulating Bitcoin for long-term holding or to offer new crypto products to clients. Internal Exchange Rebalancing: Exchanges often move funds between their hot and cold wallets for security or operational efficiency. However, the destination being an ‘unknown’ wallet makes this less likely to be a simple internal transfer. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deal: Large buyers often prefer OTC desks to avoid impacting market prices. The Bitcoin might be moving to a new wallet after an OTC purchase, indicating a significant private sale. Why is This BTC Movement So Closely Watched? The cryptocurrency market is highly sensitive to large fund movements. A significant BTC movement like this can lead to considerable speculation and, at times, impact market sentiment. Investors and analysts keenly observe such transfers for clues about future price action. For instance, if a whale moves Bitcoin to an exchange, it could signal an intent to sell, potentially increasing supply and putting downward pressure on prices. Conversely, a move away from an exchange, especially to an unknown Bitcoin wallet , often suggests accumulation or long-term holding, which can be seen as a bullish signal. This kind of transfer reduces the immediate selling pressure on exchanges. Market Sentiment Indicator: Large transfers can act as a barometer for overall market confidence. Supply Dynamics: A withdrawal from an exchange reduces the immediate selling pressure. Whale Behavior Analysis: Tracking these movements helps understand major players’ strategies and potential market direction. Decoding the Unknown Bitcoin Wallet: What Are the Possibilities? The designation ‘ unknown Bitcoin wallet ‘ adds an element of mystery and fuels much of the discussion surrounding this Bitcoin transfer . While it simply means the wallet address isn’t publicly attributed to a known entity or exchange, several scenarios could explain its nature: New Cold Storage: The funds could be moving to a new, highly secure cold storage solution for long-term safekeeping, indicating a strong belief in Bitcoin’s future value. Private Investor/Institution: A wealthy individual or private institution could be taking direct custody of their newly acquired Bitcoin, preferring to manage their assets independently. Custodial Service: The funds might be transferred to a third-party custodial service that manages assets on behalf of clients, where the specific client remains anonymous for privacy reasons. How Do Crypto Whale Transactions Impact the Wider Market? While one large crypto whale transaction doesn’t single-handedly dictate market trends, the cumulative effect of such movements can be substantial. These transactions often influence: Price Volatility: The anticipation or realization of large buy/sell orders can trigger significant price swings, creating opportunities or risks for traders. Liquidity: Moves off exchanges can reduce available liquidity for trading, potentially making prices more sensitive to smaller trades. Investor Confidence: When whales accumulate, it can boost confidence among retail investors, leading to further buying. Conversely, large sell-offs can induce panic and downward price spirals. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile cryptocurrency landscape. While this specific Bitcoin transfer remains shrouded in some mystery, its scale undeniably makes it a point of interest for market participants. The recent 7,625 BTC transfer from Coinbase to an unknown Bitcoin wallet serves as a potent reminder of the immense wealth and significant movements occurring within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Whether this Coinbase whale transaction signals institutional accumulation, a strategic shift in holdings, or simply a secure transfer, its sheer size commands attention. As the crypto market continues to mature, tracking these major BTC movement events provides valuable insights into the broader trends and sentiment driving the digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a “crypto whale”? A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence its market price through their buying or selling activities. 2. Why are large Bitcoin transfers from exchanges significant? Large Bitcoin transfers from exchanges are significant because they can signal a variety of intentions, such as accumulation (moving to cold storage), preparation for sale (moving to another exchange), or the completion of a large over-the-counter trade. These movements can impact market sentiment and supply dynamics. 3. Does an “unknown wallet” mean the transaction is illicit? Not necessarily. An “unknown wallet” simply means the owner of the wallet address has not been publicly identified or attributed to a known entity or exchange. It could belong to a private individual, an institution, or a custodial service that prefers anonymity. 4. How can I track large crypto movements myself? Services like Whale Alert (which reported this transaction) provide real-time updates on significant cryptocurrency transfers. You can also use blockchain explorers to track specific wallet addresses, though identifying the owner of an “unknown” wallet is often difficult. 5. What impact could this specific 7,625 BTC transfer have on Bitcoin’s price? A large transfer of Bitcoin away from an exchange, especially to an unknown wallet, is often interpreted as a bullish signal, suggesting the whale intends to hold or accumulate, thereby reducing immediate selling pressure. However, the ultimate impact depends on subsequent actions and broader market conditions. Stay informed about the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

Blockchain trackers first flagged the huge transfer from crypto exchange Upbit to an unknown wallet, often seen as a large accumulation or exchange reshuffle. Such outflows can tighten liquidity and spike volatility, especially amid thin order books. Adex Crypt framed the purchase as more than a single buyer’s bet, it’s a signal. In his view, mega-buys like this can catalyze momentum-driven moves because they reduce XRP supply on major exchanges and can force short squeezes if leveraged positions are crowded near current price levels. That interpretation sits alongside a wider pattern of whale accumulation observed across August, which some on-chain analysts say has seen hundreds of millions of XRP shift into large wallets. For instance, in a swift market jolt, XRP whales scooped up roughly 900M tokens in just 48 hours this week. Retracement to Fibonacci Zone Sets Up $4.67 Rally XRP has broken out of a long-term descending wedge, a classic bullish reversal. It’s now retracing to the $0.5–$0.618 Fibonacci zone, aligning with key support, an ideal area for accumulation, targeting $4.67, according to market analyst Justcryptopays. Therefore, as XRP retraces to the $0.5–$0.618 Fibonacci zone, traders eye potential re-entry points. The convergence with structural support boosts accumulation prospects, setting the stage for a rally toward $4.67 if the zone holds. Meanwhile, XRP must break the key $3.26 resistance to increase its odds of a significant upside move. At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $3.10, according to CoinGecko data . Conclusion XRP’s breakout from the descending wedge and retracement to key Fibonacci levels creates a prime accumulation setup. Support at the $0.5–$0.618 zone could confirm the next leg up toward $4.67. On the other hand, the 19M XRP transfer is a notable move, potentially market-shaking, per Adex Crypt, but its impact depends on whether it signals lasting accumulation or a short-term shuffle.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-16 18:12:44
