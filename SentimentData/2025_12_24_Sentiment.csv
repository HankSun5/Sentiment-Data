Related Reading: Dogecoin: Why This One Price Level Is Drawing All the Attention While ADA continues to trade under pressure near the mid-$0.30 range, founder Charles Hoskinson has shifted attention away from short-term price movements toward longer-term structural developments, particularly within Cardano’s decentralized finance and security roadmap. The contrast between weak market sentiment and expanding ecosystem narratives has become one of the defining features of Cardano’s current phase. ADA's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview ADA Price Weakness Reflects Broader Caution Cardano (ADA) remains in a consolidation pattern after slipping below $0.37, weighed down by persistent selling pressure and declining risk appetite across the altcoin market. On-chain data shows that large holders are reducing their exposure, with tens of millions of tokens being redistributed over recent days. Derivatives metrics reinforce this cautious stance, as short positions continue to outnumber longs and momentum indicators remain subdued. Technically, ADA is trading below key moving averages, keeping the near-term outlook fragile. Analysts identify the $0.35 level as a critical support zone, with a deeper decline toward the $0.27–$0.30 range possible if sentiment deteriorates further. Founder Urges Patience on Security and Infrastructure Against this backdrop, Hoskinson has used recent commentary to address longer-term challenges rather than short-term volatility. Hoskinson has warned against rushing into post-quantum cryptography upgrades, arguing that while the tools already exist, deploying them prematurely could impose heavy performance costs on blockchains. Larger signatures and slower verification, he noted, could undermine scalability long before quantum computers become a practical threat. Hoskinson’s position reframes the security debate around timing rather than urgency. While global standards for post-quantum cryptography are now finalized, he maintains that readiness depends on hardware capabilities, network economics, and validator incentives. DEXes Framed as Long-Term Opportunity Hoskinson has also highlighted what he sees as a valuation disconnect within Cardano’s DeFi sector. Responding to recent activity around the privacy-focused sidechain Midnight and its token NIGHT, he argued that trading volumes on Cardano-based decentralized exchanges remain low relative to their potential. Stablecoins and cross-chain bridges remain central to this thesis. Without deep liquidity and reliable settlement assets, Cardano’s DEX ecosystem struggles to compete with more mature networks. Hoskinson suggested that once these components are in place, decentralized exchange activity could expand significantly, framing the current period as one of accumulation rather than stagnation. Currently, Cardano’s market narrative remains split. ADA’s price reflects caution and consolidation, while ecosystem development points to longer-term optionality.

56258766,647974,1766527214,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56258766.jpeg,Ripple CTO Explains How The XRP Ledger ‘Will Take Over The World’,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-cto-xrp-ledger-take-over-the-world/,"On a Token Relations webinar for the XRP ecosystem on Dec. 20, Ripple CTO David Schwartz was asked the sort of question that usually produces a tidy dashboard answer, what on-chain metrics actually matter, what’s “real” economic activity, and what trends are showing up across the ledger (and, yes, the ETF chatter in the background). He went straight to the point: usage that sticks, value that moves, and the boring-but-decisive plumbing that financial institutions actually care about will “take over the world.” How Ripple Wants To Make The XRPL Mainstream “I definitely focus on metrics that show sustained usage and real value moving through the network,” Schwartz said . “Transaction activity is probably the clearest signal. The XRP ledger has now processed more than four billion transactions with pretty consistent settlement in about four to five seconds at a fairly predictable fee.” That’s the pitch in one breath: scale, predictable finality, and fees so low you don’t have to pretend they’re a feature.“You know, a transaction on the XRP ledger costs a tiny fraction of a penny,” the Ripple CTO added. “It’s not trying to extract value from people’s transactions. That’s trying to enable people to do what they need to do.” Then he pivoted to liquidity, the kind of line XRP holders love to hear, but framed as infrastructure rather than tribal scoreboard-watching. “Liquidity is another huge factor,” Schwartz said. “XRP is a top five digital asset by market capitalization and has been for I think 10 years now, about 109 billion dollars deep global liquidity for real financial activity. That depth matters.” The bigger point he kept coming back to was momentum in actual network use, not just “we issued a token and it sat there.” “The XRP ledger itself is now one of the top 10 blockchains for real world activity this year with a rate of increase that’s just absolutely astonishing from a use case that was you know almost unthinkable just a year ago,” he said. “We now have institutional issuers like Guggenheim, Ondo [Finance] , Aberdeen [Standard Investments], Franklin [Templeton] .” And then the part that’s meant to separate “RWA theater” from RWAs that matter : “And it’s not just issuance, you know, it wouldn’t be super exciting if they were just sort of issuing an asset on chain that just sort of sat on chain,” the Ripple CTO said. “What’s interesting is that these assets are actually moving and settling on chain. So the financial activity is getting the benefit.” That little distinction is where a lot of tokenization narratives either hold up or collapse. Anybody can “issue” a thing on a ledger. The harder bit is getting it to behave like financial infrastructure, moving, settling, plugging into workflows that aren’t built for crypto vibes. Schwartz also threw a bit of cold water on the current retail mix. XRPL has users who love the tech (and users who love leverage), but he was pretty blunt that this isn’t the endgame. But obviously that’s not how we’re going to take over the world. We’re going to take over the world with solid financial products that solve real world use cases. And we are actually starting to see that now enabled by things like stablecoins and tokenized real world assets that let us handle these use cases like payments and like reasonable investments, tokenized money, market funds and treasuries,” he said. “ And retail might follow the institutions, not the other way around. The Ripple CTO pointed to “more than 500,000 new wallets” created, framing it as early evidence that institutional rails can drag everyday users in behind them. At press time, XRP traded at $1.88.",XRP|David Schwartz|ripple|ripple news|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price,EN,0,0,MARKET|WALLET|XRP|ONDO|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-23 22:00:14

Speaking in a long Truth Social post, Trump declared that he has not enacted what he calls ‘The Trump Rule.’ “The Financial News today was great — GDP up 4.2% as opposed to the predicted 2.5% (and this, despite the downward pressure of the recent Democrat Shutdown!),” said Trump. The president added that markets no longer react the way they once did, as past rallies followed good economic news, while current rallies fade because investors assume the Fed will step in to curb inflation by raising rates. Trump said this mindset blocks the kind of long-term market growth the country once experienced during earlier expansion periods. He argued that strong markets do not cause inflation and said bad policy decisions do. Trump stated that his preferred Fed chair would cut rates when markets are performing well and avoid what he described as unnecessary interference. “I want my new Fed Chairman to lower Interest Rates if the Market is doing well, not destroy the Market for no reason whatsoever,” Trump wrote. Trump said inflation should be handled later if needed, not during market rallies. He added that rate hikes can wait until there is a clear reason, saying the wrong timing can stop growth that could lift GDP by double digits within a year. Trump also said economic planners who resist market expansion prevent sustained growth. He wrote that the United States should reward success and not punish it, adding that anyone who disagrees with him will never hold the Fed’s top job. Kevin Hassett backs faster cuts as Fed signals caution Kevin Hassett, the National Economic Council director, echoed parts of Trump’s stance in a CNBC interview on Tuesday. Kevin said the Federal Reserve is moving too slowly on rate reductions, even though economic growth has accelerated. He said the United States is lagging other central banks globally when it comes to easing policy. Kevin said advances in artificial intelligence are pushing productivity higher while also keeping inflation pressure lower. He also linked recent growth to trade policy, saying tariffs implemented under Trump reduced the U.S. trade deficit and accounted for about 1.5% of third-quarter growth. Official figures showed the economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.3%, exceeding the Dow Jones consensus estimate of 3.2%. The Federal Reserve cut rates by a quarter point on Dec. 10, marking its third reduction of the year. The central bank also indicated future cuts could slow. Three Fed governors voted against the move, the highest number of dissents since 2019. After the meeting, Jerome Powell, the current Fed chair, said the decision was “a close call.” Trump has repeatedly criticized the Fed for not cutting rates faster. Kevin’s potential candidacy to replace Jerome when his term ends in May has raised concerns among some Fed watchers about political closeness to the White House. Kevin addressed that directly, saying on CNBC last week that Fed independence is “really important.” Trump said in a prime-time address last week that he will announce his Fed chair nominee soon. He said the choice will be someone who strongly supports lower interest rates. The speech focused on affordability pressures facing households. A CBS News/YouGov poll published Sunday showed Trump’s economic approval rating at 37%. When asked about that figure, Kevin said public opinion often lags behind economic performance. “In the end, it turns out that I think it has a lot to do with news coverage and how people are processing, their glimpse of the outside world,” Kevin said.

The findings point to Ethereum quietly becoming a settlement layer for corporate payments and consumer spending, rather than just peer transfers. And while most stablecoin transactions, by count, still happen between individuals, the bulk of the money now flows through business-linked wallets, a sign that real-world payment use is gaining ground. Institutions Drive Volume, Consumers Fuel Growth The findings, published in an Artemis research report, provided a detailed look at stablecoin payments on Ethereum, which hosts nearly half of the global stablecoin supply. In the study, Artemis separated personal payments from business activity, analyzing transactions from August 2024 to August 2025 and classifying wallet types. The data shows a clear divide. Person-to-person (P2P) transfers made up 67% of the transaction count but only 24% of the total dollar volume. In contrast, business-involved payments, though fewer in number, accounted for the majority of value. This trend accelerated significantly in the past 12 months, with business-to-business (B2B) payment volume expanding by 156%, while the average transaction size increased 45%, suggesting institutions are moving larger sums. However, according to the report, the fastest-growing category was person-to-business (P2B) payments, which saw a 167% rise in volume. James, Head of Ecosystem at the Ethereum Foundation, highlighted the trend on social media, noting that “institutions aren’t sending more payments. They’re sending bigger ones.” What this Means for Ethereum’s Wider Role The payment trend comes with Ethereum’s native token trading just under the $3,000 level, reflecting a 2.5% drop in the last 24 hours. In the past seven days, it has gained slightly over 1% while losing 5% of its value over two weeks. ETH’s current value remains 5.5% higher than it was 30 days ago, despite a significant decrease of over 40% from its August all-time high, which was just shy of $5,000. Analysts say stablecoin usage, rather than price speculation, may be one of Ethereum’s strongest long-term demand drivers. Meanwhile, Artemis’ broader “Stablecoin Wrapped 2025” report added some context. It shows USDT adding more supply this year than the next five issuers combined, while on-chain B2B payments reached an annual run rate of nearly $77 billion. These figures suggest that firms are increasingly trusting blockchain rails for real transactions. The data also revealed concentration risks, where roughly 84% of stablecoin volume comes from the top 1,000 wallets, meaning large players still control most flows. That raises questions about how decentralized stablecoin usage truly is, even with adoption growing. Taken together, the findings suggest Ethereum’s stablecoin economy is maturing. Instead of mainly serving individuals sending small sums, the network is becoming a backbone for business payments and everyday commerce. If this pattern continues, analysts believe Ethereum’s value may depend less on hype cycles and more on its role as financial plumbing for a growing digital economy.

The Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange is recruiting a quantitative trader to join a team responsible for buying and selling financial contracts tied to the outcomes of sporting events on its prediction market platform. https://t.co/1aQemhmjuy is looking for a new employee to work on a market making team that will face off against customers on the company’s prediction market exchange https://t.co/M90qMhiCQ3 — Bloomberg (@business) December 23, 2025 Liquidity or Conflict? Crypto.com’s Market-Making Role Sparks Debate According to a recent Bloomberg report , the role would sit on Crypto.com’s market-making desk and involve actively trading against customer orders to support liquidity across sports contracts and other derivatives offered on the company’s U.S. platform. The hiring effort comes as prediction markets expand rapidly across both crypto and traditional finance. These platforms allow users to trade contracts that settle based on real-world outcomes , such as sports results or political events, with prices reflecting the market’s implied probability. While prediction markets have long presented themselves as neutral venues where participants trade against each other, the use of in-house market makers has raised questions about conflicts of interest. Market making has become a sensitive issue for event-contract exchanges, particularly those operating under U.S. federal oversight. Critics argue that when an exchange or its affiliate takes the opposite side of customer trades, the structure begins to resemble a traditional sportsbook that profits from customer losses. Those concerns have already surfaced elsewhere in the industry. Kalshi , one of the most prominent regulated prediction market operators, runs an internal unit known as Kalshi Trading. Polymarket , a major decentralized platform, is also reported to be building its own internal market-making team. Crypto.com’s job listing states that the new hire would seek to “maximize profits while carefully managing risks,” language that has fueled debate over whether the firm is effectively trading against its users. In response, in a report, a Crypto.com spokesperson said the company does not rely on proprietary trading as a revenue source and described its business model as providing customer access to digital assets and event contracts for a fee while remaining risk neutral. The spokesperson added that the internal market maker does not receive preferential access to customer order flow or proprietary data and operates under rules disclosed to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , which oversees derivatives markets in the U.S. Prediction Markets Hit Record Volumes, but Trading Rules Stir Concerns The exchange has also taken steps to attract external liquidity providers. Like its competitors, Crypto.com has sought to bring in professional trading firms to ensure continuous buying and selling, particularly in high-volume sports markets. However, company rules grant designated market makers on sports contracts a three-second head start over smaller traders, a policy that has drawn scrutiny for potentially allowing large participants to adjust prices ahead of retail users. The broader industry continues to grow despite these concerns, with prediction markets linked to sports and politics having driven much of the recent surge in activity. Platforms including Kalshi, Polymarket, and Limitless recorded a combined $44 billion in trading volume this year, with Kalshi reaching roughly $1 billion in weekly volume at its peak. Source: Dune Analytics On-chain prediction markets have expanded even faster, with monthly volume climbing from under $100 million in early 2024 to more than $13 billion, according to joint research from Keyrock and Dune Analytics. Major crypto firms are also entering the space. Coinbase recently rolled out prediction market trading on its platform and agreed to acquire The Clearing Company as part of its push to scale regulated event-based markets. The move followed Kalshi’s $300 million Series D raise at a $5 billion valuation , showing investor interest in the sector.

For a coin based on Arbitrum , this is almost unheard of. This price action puts it at over a $2.7B circulating market cap, making it one of the largest coins on Arbitrum. Many in the Rain community have asked a fair question: “How come @Rain__Protocol is built on @arbitrum , but Arbitrum doesn’t follow Rain on X?” So we turned the question into a $10,000 incentivized market: Will Arbitrum follow Rain’s X account by December 11, 2025?

The protocol launched around 2023 to 2024 and was down nearly 99% at one point. It gained massive attention in late November 2025 when Nasdaq-listed biotech company Enlivex Therapeutics announced a $212M private placement to build the world’s first corporate digital asset treasury centered on RAIN tokens. That move, along with appointing former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to its board, caused the token to surge dramatically, peaking at around 20,000% YTD. Over the last month alone, RAIN is up more than 125%, and this is still a beta product. Investors are now wondering what comes next with this level of strength. Rain Crypto Price Prediction: Can RAIN Hit a New ATH This Week? Source: RAINUSD / TradingView The chart is showing one clear pattern over the last month: an accumulation phase followed by a large upside candle in a short period of time. If this pattern repeats, the next leg higher could happen at any time, given the current range it is moving through at these levels. A break above the psychological resistance at 0.01 would be the first step and would confirm the bullish setup. However, there is still a possibility it moves the other way, especially with the RSI nearing oversold levels. A drawback toward the $0.06 level is possible. Bitcoin Hyper Is What Speculation Looks Like With Real Utility While narratives like RAIN show how fast speculation can move prices, Bitcoin Hyper is targeting something much more fundamental: fixing Bitcoin’s biggest limitations. Bitcoin Hyper is a Layer 2 built to bring speed, low fees, and real on-chain utility to Bitcoin, using Solana-grade performance while keeping BTC as the settlement asset. Instead of betting on hype alone, Hyper focuses on enabling DeFi, payments, staking, and high-throughput applications directly for Bitcoin holders. Through the Hyper Bridge, users can move BTC onto the Hyper network and receive a 1:1 representation with near-instant finality. That opens access to yield strategies and on-chain activity that Bitcoin simply cannot support on its base layer. Early momentum has been strong, with Bitcoin Hyper raising over $29.7M so far and offering staking yields of up to 39% APY during its early phase. As more capital looks for utility-driven narratives rather than pure speculation, Hyper is positioning itself as a serious Layer 2 contender going into 2026. In a market where hype fades fast, infrastructure tends to last.

Sentiment has turned decisively cautious, with investors reassessing risk exposure and preparing for a potentially challenging period ahead. Despite multiple attempts to stabilize, price action remains compressed, offering little confirmation that bullish momentum is ready to return. Related Reading: The Gold-to-Bitcoin Rotation Narrative Gains Strength: A Data-Driven Review According to an analysis by XWIN Research Japan, the current market phase is best described as a range-bound consolidation following a high-level correction, with momentum conditionally tilted to the downside. While Bitcoin has remained largely sideways over the past three months, traditional safe-haven assets have followed a very different trajectory. Gold and silver have continued to push higher, reflecting rising demand for defensive assets amid persistent geopolitical tensions, policy uncertainty, and expectations of lower real interest rates. This divergence highlights a structural challenge for Bitcoin in the current macro environment. Institutional capital can allocate to precious metals with relative ease, benefiting from deep liquidity, established market infrastructure, and clear regulatory frameworks. Silver, in particular, has amplified gold’s move, supported by tighter supply dynamics and greater sensitivity to speculative flows. Bitcoin’s Role as a Risk Asset Limits Its Upside The analysis explains that Bitcoin has not followed gold and silver higher because it is still treated primarily as a high-beta risk asset, rather than a pure safe haven. In risk-off environments, capital typically flows first into gold and government bonds, where investors seek stability and capital preservation. Bitcoin, by contrast, is often a secondary consideration, attracting flows only after confidence improves. Unlike gold’s long-term and relatively price-insensitive buyer base, Bitcoin remains more exposed to short-term positioning and marginal demand, making broad macro tailwinds insufficient on their own to sustain a durable uptrend. CryptoQuant data reinforces this interpretation. Bitcoin’s apparent demand has recently turned negative, signaling that fresh demand is not expanding even as prices hold at relatively elevated levels. At the same time, Short-Term Holder SOPR has spent extended periods below 1, indicating that short-term participants are selling at a loss or near breakeven. This behavior typically adds selling pressure on rebounds, as underwater holders use price strength to exit positions. As long as capital continues to favor gold and silver, Bitcoin’s internal demand structure remains a key constraint. The base case points to continued support for precious metals, while Bitcoin’s upside stays capped by weak demand and short-term holder pressure. That view would only change if apparent demand turns sustainably positive and STH SOPR reclaims and holds above 1. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Lags Network Utility: A Valuation Reset Is Underway Price Holds Critical Support as Trend Weakens Bitcoin is currently trading near the $87,000–$88,000 area after a sharp corrective move from recent highs above $110,000. The chart shows that price has lost the short-term bullish structure, with BTC now firmly below the 50-day moving average (blue), which has started to slope downward. This confirms that short-term momentum has turned negative and rallies are facing increasing overhead supply. More importantly, price is now testing the 100-day moving average (green), which sits just above the current level and has acted as dynamic support throughout much of this cycle. The market’s reaction around this zone is critical. A sustained hold above the 100-day MA could allow Bitcoin to stabilize and form a base, while a decisive breakdown would likely expose the 200-day moving average (red), currently rising near the low $80,000s. Related Reading: Ethereum Market Structure Strengthens: Binance Netflows Point to Long-Term Conviction Volume dynamics reinforce the cautious outlook. The sell-off from the October peak was accompanied by elevated volume, signaling distribution rather than a shallow pullback. Since then, volume has tapered off, suggesting a lack of aggressive dip-buying interest at current levels. Structurally, Bitcoin remains in a broader uptrend as long as it holds above the 200-day MA, but the loss of the 50-day and weakening momentum indicate consolidation or further downside risk in the near term. Bulls need a recovery back above $90,000 to regain control and shift sentiment meaningfully.

The IMF said discussions on the second review of the country’s 40-month Extended Fund Facility program are ongoing as authorities work to meet agreed benchmarks. Growth forecasts were revised upward, and the fund signaled continued financial support tied to further policy steps. IMF Notes Faster Growth Reports note that growth is running above earlier forecasts. The IMF now sees real GDP growth near 4% for 2025. Local data show the economy expanded 5.1% in the third quarter of 2025 compared with the same quarter a year earlier, led by construction and remittance-driven consumption. Remittances and stronger investment flows were cited as key drivers. The fund said higher confidence and improved fiscal numbers have helped create space for short-term rebuilding of reserves. Gradually, then suddenly. https://t.co/MWP0avqlDE pic.twitter.com/hYYONaRLcI — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) December 22, 2025 A Program Backed By Clear Conditions Based on IMF releases, a staff-level agreement was reached with El Salvador in December 2024 for a program worth about $1.4 billion. That arrangement sets fiscal targets and governance measures meant to restore sustainability. Earlier, when the IMF completed the first review and Article IV consultation in June 2025, a disbursement equivalent to roughly $118 million in SDRs was approved. Reports added that authorities have enacted a new fiscal law, strengthened public procurement transparency, and advanced governance measures for state firms. Key Reforms And Conditions An actuarial study on pensions has been published, and steps to tighten anti-money-laundering rules were discussed with IMF staff. The fund has also pressed for limits on public sector exposure to cryptoc urrencies; according to international coverage, measures to reduce that exposure and to make private crypto use voluntary are under consideration. What Comes Next For The Program According to IMF briefings, the second review will require follow-through on prior actions and the meeting of fiscal targets. Continued disbursements depend on progress, and IMF teams remain in contact with Salvadoran authorities to work through outstanding issues. In parallel, the IMF has reiterated its position on El Salvador’s Bitcoin policy. According to recent IMF statements, the fund wants the country’s public sector Bitcoin holdings to remain capped, with no additional purchases made under the current loan program. The IMF has also pushed for a reduced state role in crypto-related activities, including changes tied to the Chivo wallet, arguing that limits are needed to contain fiscal and financial risks. Salvadoran officials have said Bitcoin remains part of their strategy, though IMF documents show no confirmed increase in government-held Bitcoin since early 2025.

Chris Kelly, who was Facebook’s chief privacy officer and general counsel, told CNBC on Tuesday that making AI more efficient will be critical going forward. Human brains run on just 20 watts of power, he pointed out. AI companies are building facilities that need billions of watts. “I think that finding efficiency is going to be one of the key things that the big AI players look to,” Kelly said. The companies that figure out how to cut data center costs will come out ahead, he believes. The construction boom has raised questions about where the electricity will come from. The power grid is already under pressure. Nvidia and OpenAI announced plans in September for data centers needing at least 10 gigawatts of electricity. That’s enough to run roughly 8 million American homes for a year. It’s also about what New York City uses during its busiest summer days in 2024, based on New York Independent System Operator figures. Worries about expenses grew after DeepSeek released a free large language model in December 2024. The Chinese company said it cost less than $6 million to develop. That’s dramatically lower than what American competitors have spent. Kelly expects more Chinese companies to become major players. President Donald Trump recently approved the sale of Nvidia’s H200 chips to China. Open-source models from China will give people access to basic computing power and AI tools, Kelly added. Consumers face soaring bills The rush to build these facilities is already hitting electricity bills. Data centers that haven’t been constructed yet are pushing power prices higher as reported by Cryptopoltian previously. Regular customers might end up paying for expensive infrastructure that may not be needed if demand predictions are wrong. Consumers on the biggest electric grid in the country will pay $16.6 billion to guarantee future power supplies for data centers between 2025 and 2027. That’s according to a watchdog report released this month. The grid is PJM Interconnection. It provides electricity to over 65 million people in 13 states, including Virginia, which has the world’s largest data center hub. Northern Illinois and Ohio are growing markets too. “A lot of us are very concerned that we are paying money today for a data center tomorrow,” said Abe Silverman. He was general counsel for New Jersey’s public utility board from 2019 to 2023. “That’s a little bit scary if you don’t really have faith in the load forecast.” Data center boom may not be as big as power companies think Home electricity costs have already gone up in states with major data center activity. Residential prices in September jumped 20% in Illinois, 12% in Ohio, and 9% in Virginia compared to the same month last year. The federal Energy Information Administration provided those numbers. All three states rank among the top five data center markets nationwide. Joe Bowring leads Monitoring Analytics. He explained that data center power costs show up directly on household bills. “When the wholesale power costs go up, people pay more, when it goes down people pay less,” he said. PJM predicts data centers will need an extra 30 gigawatts by 2030. That’s enough electricity to power more than 24 million homes annually. But there’s uncertainty about whether that demand will actually happen. Data center developers often explore multiple locations before choosing one, said Cathy Kunkel. She’s a consultant at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. That means the forecasts likely count some projects twice.

The iPhone maker brought in $109.2 billion from its Services division alone this year while pushing its total worth past $4 trillion. That makes Apple only the second company ever to hit that mark, joining Nvidia in an exclusive club. But behind the scenes , several key executives are heading for the door. Jeff Williams, who served as chief financial officer, has retired from the company. His departure is significant because many inside Apple viewed him as the top candidate to eventually replace Tim Cook as chief executive. Two other longtime leaders are also on their way out. Lisa Jackson, who handles government relations, plans to retire in late January. Kate Adams, the company’s top lawyer, will leave in late 2026. The changes don’t stop there. John Giannandrea, who runs Apple’s artificial intelligence work, is stepping down. His replacement will be Amar Subramanya, who previously worked on AI projects at Google and Microsoft. Alan Dye, a vice president focused on design, left Apple to take a job running a new design studio at Meta’s Reality Labs division. Cook prepares his successor These moves come as Cook appears to be grooming John Ternus, a senior vice president who oversees hardware engineering, to take over when he decides to step aside. The Financial Times reported Cook might leave as soon as early 2026, though Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman says no firm date has been set. Cook took charge of Apple 14 years ago when company founder Steve Jobs died. Jobs had rescued Apple from near collapse after returning in 1997, following his earlier dismissal in 1985. He then launched a series of hit products like the iPod and iPhone that transformed the company. Since Cook joined Apple in 1998 and later became chief executive, he has kept that momentum going. Under his watch, Apple introduced the Apple Watch and AirPods. The company’s services business exploded in size. Cook also pushed Apple to design and use its own computer chips, giving the company greater control over how its devices work. Cook’s skills as a negotiator helped Apple survive several tough spots. The company faced off against the Justice Department, dealt with the pandemic, and navigated trade tensions with China under President Trump. Trump eventually decided not to put tariffs on smartphones and some other tech products from China. These decisions paid off for shareholders. Apple’s market value jumped from $1 trillion in 2018 to $4 trillion this year. Total revenue climbed to $416 billion for fiscal 2025, compared to $391 billion the year before. Major product updates on the horizon Looking ahead, Apple is preparing major product updates. According to Gurman, the company plans to release its first foldable iPhone in the second half of 2026. That could push iPhone sales even higher than current record levels. Apple is also working on a cheaper MacBook model, which would make its laptops available to more buyers. While a budget laptop might not generate as much profit per sale, it could bring in new customers who then pay for Apple’s subscription services. Whoever follows Cook will take over a company at the height of its success. Phone sales have slowed down overall, but Apple still benefits from hundreds of millions of customers who upgrade their devices regularly and increasingly pay for Apple services. The next leader will face challenges too. Investors want to see Apple make more progress on artificial intelligence. The company needs to show off its improved version of Siri. Apple will also need to compete with Meta, Google, and Samsung in smart glasses. Meta already sells two different smart glasses models, and Google and Samsung are both developing their own. For now, Cook remains in charge. Whether that changes next year remains to be seen. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Engineers hired through the Trump administration’s U.S. Tech Force program will earn between $150,000 to $200,000 annually until the period of employment ends. Applications to Donald Trump’s U.S. Tech Force program Scott Kupor, director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, announced on Tuesday that roughly 25,000 people have expressed interest in joining President Trump’s U.S. Tech Force program, which aims to recruit 1,000 engineers for two-year federal positions. The administration intends to complete the first round of hiring by March 31, 2026. The program targets software engineers, data scientists, AI specialists, and cybersecurity experts who are still early in their careers. The program’s website states that candidates do not need to be holders of traditional degrees or meet any minimum experience requirements. However, they must demonstrate strong technical skills through work experience, projects, or certifications. Annual compensation ranges from $150,000 to $200,000 plus benefits. Cryptopolitan previously reported that those who complete their government service will have opportunities in the private sector. Major technology companies, including Apple, Google, Nvidia, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Oracle, Palantir, and xAI, have pledged to consider program alumni for positions after their two-year period of employment ends. The participating companies can also nominate their own employees for temporary government service positions. OPM described the program as a coordinated effort involving the Office of Management and Budget, General Services Administration, White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and multiple agency leaders. Participating agencies include the Departments of Defense, Labor, Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, and Justice, along with the IRS. Why is President Trump seeking engineers? The Office of Personnel Management estimates the federal government could see about 1 in 8 civilian workers gone by the end of the year, or about 300,000 employees out of 2.4 million, with more than 150,000 accepting voluntary buyout offers. Earlier this year, the Trump administration let go of more than 200 AI experts hired under the Biden administration’s National AI Talent Surge. Biden’s parallel initiative resulted in about 200 hires, with roughly 75 remaining in government roles, representing a retention rate of approximately 37%. Former employees from the U.S. Digital Service were dismissed or quit during the first months of the Trump administration. The entire 18F digital consulting group at the General Services Administration was also shut down. The Social Security Administration closed its Office of Transformation in February. The Defense Digital Service closed after suffering mass resignations, and the IRS had lost over 2,000 tech workers as of June. President Donald Trump, in the first months of his second term, focused on eliminating government jobs, sparing only positions his administration considered necessary to maintain national security. Now, the administration is attempting to address a “critical skills” gap in government. Only about 7% of the U.S. government workforce is in their early career, compared to almost a quarter in the rest of the workforce, according to Kupor.

The latest Shiba Inu price prediction shows the immediate future of the dog-themed memecoin appears bleak going into 2026. One OG member of the ShibArmy couldn’t contain his disappointment, taking to X to share his displeasure in a recent post saying “shib is going down and we are (as shib investors) losing money.” $shib is going down and we are (as shib investors) loosing money. Could you please do something? @ShytoshiKusama @kaaldhairya — Shibholder (@Shibaholder__) December 21, 2025 The concerned investor called out to Shiba Inu founder Shytoshi Kusama to “please do something” to stop the price grinding slowly toward zero. First-Ever Weekly Death Cross Signals Deeper Decline Ahead Adding to the concerns, technical indicators show that Shiba Inu has completed its first-ever weekly death cross this year, where the shorter moving average crossed below the longer one, a classic bearish signal. The token is now trading at $0.00000706, down about 3%, and more significantly, it’s breaking below a critical horizontal support level that had held since early 2023. The descending trendline from the 2024 highs continues acting as resistance, with price moving lower within this downward channel. Source: TradingView What’s particularly concerning is that oscillators at the bottom show weakness, with both indicators hovering in the lower range around 37 and 31, suggesting diminished momentum and potential oversold conditions that haven’t yet triggered a bounce. The technical setup reflects analysts’ expectations of continued decline, likely targeting psychological levels significantly lower than current prices. Without a catalyst to break this pattern, the path of least resistance appears to be further downside, especially if the broken support level now acts as resistance on any attempted recovery. Analyst Declares SHIB “Dead” Unless Key Support Reclaimed Crypto analyst Nebraskangooner has delivered the verdict that Shiba Inu is now “dead unless it reclaims the $0.00000135 support level.” This represents a critical threshold that could determine whether SHIB can mount any meaningful recovery or continue its descent into 2026. The confluence of technical breakdown, weakening momentum indicators, and deteriorating market sentiment paints a challenging picture for SHIB holders. The completion of the weekly death cross, combined with the break below multi-year support, suggests the bearish structure could persist without significant fundamental catalysts. Source: X/ Nebraskangooner For SHIB to reverse this trend, it would need to reclaim the broken support level, ideally with strong volume and momentum shifts in the oscillators. Until then, traders remain cautious as fear continues dominating sentiment around one of the original 2021 cycle memecoins. Pepenode Emerges as New Memecoin Alternative With Shiba Inu and other 2021 cycle memecoins entering bearish territory, new cycle memecoins like Pepenode (PEPENODE) are seeing attention turn to them as fresh opportunities for investors.

Speaking at a press conference held online, Paz said company representatives from Tesla, Amazon and Oracle will travel to Bolivia in January to share details about their technology investments. The plans include building data centers in El Alto and Cochabamba, he said. Foreign Minister Fernando Aramayo told the Wall Street Journal that his government was looking for financial help from the Trump administration and wants to open the country’s large lithium reserves to outside investors. Aramayo said he had also talked about the possibility of a currency swap with US officials during a trip to Washington in December. Last week, Bolivia’s government rolled out a sweeping emergency decree that ended two decades of fuel subsidies and also laid out a plan to fix public finances and bring in foreign investment. The decree did not give any details on lithium or a currency swap agreement with the United States. A government spokesman told Reuters that lithium reserves were not a topic of discussion with the United States. “The currency swap is part of the topics related to US support for the economic stabilization process, but the agenda also includes US investment in different sectors. Lithium was not discussed at all,” the spokesperson said. Satellite internet gets green light In the press conference attended by Bloomberg, Paz also mentioned that Bolivia has given permission to OneWeb, SpaceX’s Starlink and Amazon’s Leo to do business in the country. These companies will use satellites that orbit close to Earth to provide better internet service. Foreign businesses must get approval to work in Bolivia. The announcement did not specify whether Tesla, Amazon and Oracle have received such approval. The previous administration, led by President Luis Arce and his left-wing government , had turned down a request from Starlink to operate there. These potential investments would represent a big change for Bolivia, which spent nearly 20 years under socialist leadership that avoided American businesses and built ties with China and Russia instead. Paz, who holds moderate views, took office in November and has shown support for working with the United States. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week that “government officials are currently in Bolivia seeking to facilitate investments that will foster prosperity for both our nations.” Scholarship program for young Bolivians Paz said IBM, Google, Amazon Web Services, Oracle and the Project Management Institute will provide 10,000 scholarships to young people in Bolivia for technology training next year. The best students will get to tour SpaceX locations in Texas and Florida. The US has also praised Bolivia’s recent economic changes , especially ending a fuel subsidy that kept gas and diesel prices low for almost 20 years. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that “we applaud President Paz’s historic efforts to open Bolivia to the world by committing to meaningful reforms to attract international investment”. “This is the path forward, not one of stagnation, blockades or dynamite,” Paz said about protests against his government’s move to end fuel subsidies.

56259801,https://timestabloid.com/?p=93156,1766532617,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Japanese Analyst Outlines Conditions For 1,000 Yen XRP",https://timestabloid.com/japanese-analyst-outlines-conditions-for-1000-yen-xrp/,"XRP has experienced prolonged weakness as digital asset markets remain under strain, yet a Japanese financial commentator believes the current phase may precede a significant shift. Angorou, a widely followed analyst in Japan, has presented a detailed outlook suggesting that XRP could eventually reach a valuation of 1,000 yen, which converts to approximately $6.41 at prevailing exchange rates. At the time Angorou published his assessment, XRP was trading near $1.99, equivalent to roughly 300 yen. While recent price action has disappointed many market participants, he argues that broader structural and regulatory developments could materially improve XRP’s outlook in 2026. Market Performance Leading to the Current Price Angorou’s analysis begins with a review of XRP’s price movement since late 2024. In early November of that year, XRP was valued at approximately 75 yen. Shortly thereafter, Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election altered expectations across the cryptocurrency market. Campaign signals pointing toward regulatory reform and a potential leadership change at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission led investors to anticipate a resolution of Ripple’s legal challenges. This shift in sentiment contributed to a rapid rise in XRP’s price. By January 2025, the token had surpassed 500 yen. However, the rally proved unstable, as a market-wide correction, partly attributed to tax-related selling, pushed XRP back into the 200-yen range. The asset later regained momentum and recorded a new peak of 542 yen in July 2025. Following that high, XRP entered a sustained decline. By the time of Angorou’s commentary, the price had retreated to around 303 yen, representing a drawdown of approximately 45% from its July peak. This performance placed XRP among the weaker assets within the upper tier of cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Whale Activity Reflects Shifting Confidence On-chain data also plays a central role in Angorou’s thesis. He examined wallet addresses holding at least 1 million XRP, which equates to more than 300 million yen at current prices. On November 6, 2024, there were 2,111 such addresses. As XRP prices climbed following the U.S. election, accumulation by these large holders increased significantly. The number of whale addresses continued to grow even after XRP peaked in mid-2025, reaching a record 2,758 by October. However, as prices declined sharply thereafter, the number of large holders fell to approximately 2,011, indicating a rapid reversal in sentiment. Angorou also observed signs of reduced participation from retail investors, which may have further pressured prices.

In November, Canary Capital introduced the first U.S.-listed spot XRP exchange-traded fund. Since then, four additional XRP-focused ETFs have entered the market. These products have demonstrated unusual consistency. Since their launch, XRP ETFs have not recorded a single day of net outflows. From mid-November onward, they achieved 25 consecutive trading days of inflows, bringing total assets to approximately $1.07 billion, or about 169 billion yen. This inflow streak exceeds those previously observed in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana ETF products. Regulatory Clarity as a 2026 Catalyst Angorou believes regulatory developments could be decisive for XRP’s future. He highlighted proposed U.S. legislation aimed at clearly distinguishing between securities and commodities. Under such a framework, assets classified as commodities would fall under the oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which applies fewer constraints than the SEC. Bitcoin already holds commodity status, and similar recognition for Ethereum appears increasingly likely. Angorou contends that if XRP were formally classified as a commodity, U.S. banks and financial institutions could adopt Ripple’s payment infrastructure without legal uncertainty. He also referenced Ripple’s conditional approval to operate as a trust bank, which could expand its role within regulated financial services. To estimate XRP’s potential upside, Angorou examined its historical valuation relative to Bitcoin. During earlier periods of strong market confidence, XRP’s ratio to Bitcoin averaged 0.169, with peaks as high as 0.48. Throughout the SEC lawsuit period, the ratio remained significantly lower. If regulatory clarity restores XRP’s standing and narrows this gap, Angorou estimates the token could reach approximately 780 yen under stable Bitcoin prices. Should legislative reforms coincide with Bitcoin rising above 20 million yen, he believes XRP could surpass the 1,000-yen threshold in 2026.

Despite the pullback, BTC remains the largest crypto asset, carrying a market value of roughly $1.75 tn and a circulating supply just under 20 mn coins, close to its hard cap of 21 mn. Broader market sentiment has softened. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index sits at 29, firmly in “fear” territory, while the Altcoin Season Index is at 17, signaling a clear Bitcoin-dominant phase. Total crypto market capitalization hovers near $2.96 tn, suggesting capital is consolidating rather than exiting the asset class altogether. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Picture: Consolidation, Not Breakdown On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin price prediction seems bearish as BTC continues to trade inside a descending channel that formed after the rejection near $94,200 earlier this month. Importantly, downside follow-through has been limited. Each move toward the $84,500–$85,000 zone has attracted buyers, creating higher lows within the channel. Price is currently squeezed between the 50-EMA near $88,200 and the 100-EMA around $88,850, a compression that often precedes a directional move. Recent candlesticks show small bodies and spinning tops, reflecting balance rather than panic selling. Momentum indicators echo this pause, with RSI near 44 and showing early signs of bullish divergence. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Bitcoin Outlook: What Could Come Next From a pattern standpoint, the structure resembles a falling flag, a setup that often resolves higher if support holds. A brief dip toward $85,000 followed by a break above $90,500 would shift momentum back in favor of the bulls. Such a move could reopen the path toward $94,200, with $98,000 emerging as a stretch target if confidence rebuilds. For now, Bitcoin is consolidating rather than distributing. As long as $84,500 remains intact, the market looks more like it’s preparing for its next move than bracing for a deeper collapse. In phases like this, patience often pays, especially as sentiment resets and longer-term opportunities begin to take shape. PEPENODE: A Mine-to-Earn Meme Coin Nearing Presale Close PEPENODE is gaining momentum as a next-generation meme coin that blends viral culture with interactive gameplay. With over $2.38 mn raised and the presale approaching its cap, interest is building fast as the countdown enters its final stretch. What makes PEPENODE stand out is its mine-to-earn virtual ecosystem. Instead of passive holding, users can build digital server rooms using Miner Nodes and facilities, earning simulated rewards through a visual dashboard. The concept brings gamification and competition into the meme coin space, giving holders something to do before launch. The project also offers presale staking, allowing early participants to earn boosted rewards ahead of the token generation event.

56262835,648100,1766534416,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56262835.jpeg,Cardano Founder Explains Why Not Sell ADA For NIGHT,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-why-not-sell-ada-for-night/,"After the successful Midnight (NIGHT) token airdrop, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson is getting a familiar question from ADA holders: if NIGHT is the new token tied to Cardano’s privacy network, why not sell ADA and move across? In a Dec. 21 appearance on the Discover Crypto podcast, he argued the premise is flawed because Midnight is designed to extend ADA, not replace it. Why Not Sell Cardano For NIGHT “They’re complimentary. They do different things,” Hoskinson said . “Midnight is the ChatGPT of privacy . That’s its job. It’s a blockchain to blockchain infrastructure module. So, what Midnight does is it actually makes Cardano applications have privacy.” That distinction is central to his pitch: Midnight is positioned less as a liquidity siphon and more as an infrastructure module that gives Cardano-native apps a feature set they can use to differentiate in an increasingly crowded DeFi landscape. Hoskinson argued that early adopters are more likely to be Cardano applications precisely because they need a lever to compete for users, rather than larger incumbents elsewhere that tend to be slower-moving. “Which ones do you think are going to adopt privacy first? Uniswap and PancakeSwap and all these giant things that are slow moving and they’re very conservative because they have a lot of users of value flow,” he said. “No, it’ll be Cardano applications. Because they need to gain users and so this is how they leapfrog the competition.” From there, Hoskinson broadened the argument into a cross-chain liquidity thesis, leaning heavily on Bitcoin DeFi as a source of potential inflows. He described Bitcoin as relatively “agnostic” capital that will route to wherever yield, credit, and utility are most accessible, and claimed Cardano’s UTXO model makes it a more natural destination than account-based chains. “When you look at Bitcoin… it doesn’t care if it goes to Ethereum or Solana or Cardano or other places to get yield,” he said. “It’s going to go to the closest continent and the closest continent is Cardano because it’s a UTXO system and Bitcoin is UTXO system. So through Cardano DeFi in particular upgraded with Midnight suddenly Bitcoin’s going to get privacy preserving yield and credit.” He added that the same privacy-preserving yield concept could extend beyond Bitcoin. “And it’s the same for XRP and these other things,” Hoskinson said, arguing that Midnight’s privacy tooling is intended to “hybridize” on-chain and off-chain infrastructure rather than “steal TVL or steal luster from other systems.” In practical terms, Hoskinson also tied the ADA-versus-NIGHT decision to distribution and security. He emphasized that Cardano “launched Midnight,” framing it as evidence the ecosystem can execute large-scale initiatives while positioning ADA holders for preferential participation. “If you’re an ADA holder, you get first access to all of these things and you get the largest proportion of the airdrop,” he said. “And also, Cardano secures Midnight. So, that means ADA holders get NIGHT tokens .” How High Can ADA Go? Hoskinson was also pressed on Cardano price expectations. While he refrained to name any price targets, he used that moment to lay out what he described as a “value leakage” theory tied to Bitcoin’s institutional bid. He said Bitcoin is the only asset he feels comfortable forecasting with any confidence, arguing that large allocators are structurally “stuck” in Bitcoin exposure via ETFs and buy-and-hold mandates, which changes the old cycle mechanic where retail would rotate profits from BTC into alts. In that setup, he suggested the main route for capital to spill from Bitcoin into other ecosystems is not spot rotation, but Bitcoin DeFi yield: if Cardano can offer yield and credit inside a risk profile that institutional holders can tolerate, demand can “leak” outward from BTC without investors selling BTC outright. That is the basis for his view that chains embracing Bitcoin DeFi could move more in sync with Bitcoin, while others could remain decorrelated, even if Bitcoin continues higher. The broader message was less about discouraging trading behavior and more about presenting a structural rationale for staying exposed to ADA. In Hoskinson’s framing, Midnight is not meant to displace ADA; it is meant to expand the set of use cases Cardano applications can offer, while keeping ADA holders economically involved through security ties and token distribution. At press time, ADA traded at $0.36.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Charles Hoskinson|Midnight|NIGHT,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|TRADING|AIRDROP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-24 00:00:16

According to the exchange, most respondents in its ongoing prediction market believe XRP will close 2025 within a narrow trading range between $1.50 and $2.00. Gemini shared results from its XRP year-end pricing poll through a public post on X . The poll, which has been active since December 12, captures user forecasts for XRP’s closing price at the end of the calendar year. As participation increased, consensus around the $1.50–$2.00 range strengthened. Growing Confidence in a Narrow Price Range In its most recent update, Gemini reported that users initially assigned a 63% likelihood to XRP ending the year above $1.50 but not exceeding $2.00. As market conditions evolved, confidence in this outcome rose further. At the time of reporting, 73% of participants favored this price band, indicating a growing belief that XRP will remain range-bound through year-end. There's currently a 63% chance XRP ends the year between $1.50 and $2.00 pic.twitter.com/bCJ6fJuV6n — Gemini (@Gemini) December 22, 2025 At the same time, expectations for higher closing prices have diminished. Earlier in the polling period, 38% of respondents projected a finish between $2.00 and $2.50. That share has since declined to 28%, signaling reduced optimism for a late-year breakout. Predictions for more aggressive upside moves are even less common. Only a small fraction of users assigned probability to XRP closing between $2.50 and $3.00, and confidence in a finish above $3.00 remains minimal. Both scenarios currently carry estimated probabilities of roughly 4%. Limited Expectations for a Major Downside Move While the prevailing view favors stability, some participants anticipate further weakness. Gemini noted that a small portion of respondents expect XRP to end the year below $1.50. That figure has increased modestly, from 6% to 7%, following recent market-wide price pullbacks. Despite this, downside expectations remain limited compared to the dominant view that XRP will hold within its current range. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 How Gemini Will Determine Results Gemini also clarified how outcomes will be finalized once the prediction window closes. The poll is scheduled to resolve on December 31, 2025, at 09:00 a.m. (GMT +1). XRP’s final price will be determined using the GRR-KAIKO_XRPUSD_8UTC benchmark provided by Kaiko. For example, predictions tied to the $1.50–$2.00 range will be settled positively if XRP’s recorded price exceeds $1.50 and does not surpass $2.00 at the resolution time. The exchange stated that payouts will be issued no later than the following day. With roughly one week remaining in the year, XRP is trading at approximately $1.88. Since mid-December, its price has fluctuated between $1.80 and $2.00, reinforcing expectations that it may remain within that corridor through year-end. While this outlook contrasts sharply with XRP’s rally earlier in the year, when prices reached levels above $3.60 , it reflects prevailing caution amid broader market uncertainty. Nonetheless, some participants continue to anticipate improved conditions beyond year-end, citing potential institutional activity and regulatory developments as longer-term factors.

The law was set to start January 1st. Judge Robert Pitman granted an order stopping the Texas App Store Accountability Act (SB 2420) from taking effect. He wrote that the law is like requiring “every bookstore to verify the age of every customer at the door and, for minors, require parental consent before the child or teen could enter and again when they try to purchase a book.” Pitman hasn’t ruled yet on whether the law is actually legal. But by blocking it now, he’s saying the state probably won’t win this fight in court. First legal challenge sets stage for national debate This ruling matters because Texas was first in line with this type of law. Utah and Louisiana passed similar ones, and Congress is now looking at doing this nationwide. So what happens here could set the tone for what comes next everywhere else. So how the law would work? App stores like Apple and Google would have to check ages, then pass that information along to app developers. The goal is keeping kids away from apps they shouldn’t be using. Parent advocacy groups came up with this idea originally, though Meta and other big tech companies like Snap and X ended up lobbying for it too. The Computer & Communications Industry Association sued to stop the law. Their members include Apple, Google, and Meta. They claimed the law “imposes a broad censorship regime on the entire universe of mobile apps” and would make teens jump through hoops to access online content. Kids and their parents would have to give up personal data just to use apps. A student advocacy group filed their own lawsuit too. They argued the law violates the constitution by limiting what speech kids can see. Texas officials say the law is constitutional and should be allowed. The state can appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has overturned similar blocks on internet rules before. Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office hasn’t said yet whether they’ll appeal. Judge says law fails constitutional test Judge Pitman said the law has to pass the strictest First Amendment test. That means Texas must prove it’s “the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling state interest.” He found the state didn’t meet that bar. In fact, he said it wouldn’t even pass a lower standard because Texas hasn’t shown their methods actually connect to their goals. The judge acknowledged protecting kids online is important. But he added, “the means to achieve that end must be consistent with the First Amendment. However compelling the policy concerns, and however widespread the agreement that the issue must be addressed, the Court remains bound by the rule of law.” Apple really didn’t want this law to happen. CEO Tim Cook reportedly called Governor Greg Abbott himself to try talking him out of signing it. The company has previously faced antitrust scrutiny in various jurisdictions over its app store policies. Google opposed the Texas version too but recently supported California’s different approach, which collects less user data. A House Energy and Commerce subcommittee just advanced two bills that mix ideas from both the Texas and California versions. This push for a national law worried Apple enough that Cook met with committee leaders the day before they voted on the bills. With all these laws moving forward in different states and Congress, app store companies are starting to make their own changes. Apple rolled out new kids safety features this year, including letting parents share their children’s age ranges with app developers. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

RootstockLabs has announced a significant milestone: the Rootstock RIF token is now listed on Korbit, a leading South Korean cryptocurrency exchange. This strategic move opens new doors for accessibility and marks a focused push into the vibrant East Asian market. For investors and crypto enthusiasts, this listing comes packed with commemorative events, including airdrops and trading competitions, making it a pivotal moment for the ecosystem. What Does the Rootstock RIF Korbit Listing Mean for Investors? This listing is more than just another token on an exchange. It represents a bridge between Bitcoin’s foundational security and South Korea’s dynamic crypto economy. Korbit’s users now have direct access to Rootstock RIF , the native token powering the Rootstock network—a Bitcoin Layer 2 solution. This integration simplifies the process for users to engage with Bitcoin-based decentralized finance (DeFi), which has traditionally required more technical steps. Therefore, it significantly lowers the barrier to entry. How Can You Participate in the Korbit RIF Airdrop Events? To celebrate the listing, Korbit is hosting several engaging events with substantial Rootstock RIF rewards. Participation is straightforward but requires specific actions. Here are the key opportunities: Bank Link Airdrop: Users who link a Shinhan Bank account and agree to receive marketing materials are eligible. Quiz Winners: The first 2,500 participants to correctly complete a quiz will receive tiered RIF rewards. Deposit & Trade Bonus: The first 300 users who deposit over 900 RIF and complete a trade will each get 667 RIF. Trading Competition: A weekly contest will distribute 700,000 RIF among the top 100 traders by cumulative volume. These initiatives are designed to boost initial liquidity and user engagement on the platform. Why is Rootstock Targeting East Asia for Institutional Growth? The listing is part of a broader, strategic vision. RootstockLabs has clearly stated that its business focus for the coming year will center on institutional collaboration in East Asia, specifically naming South Korea and Japan. The company operates a Bitcoin collateral vault, a core DeFi primitive. Their goal is to attract South Korean institutional clients interested in depositing Bitcoin or U.S. dollars into this vault to be used as collateral for various financial operations.

The widely watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index has held steady at a reading of 24, firmly in the ‘extreme fear’ zone. This persistent sentiment reading offers a crucial, data-driven snapshot of investor psychology. For anyone involved in crypto, understanding this index is not just academic—it’s a vital tool for navigating turbulent markets. Let’s break down what this prolonged period of extreme fear means and how you can interpret it for your investment decisions. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us Right Now? A score of 24 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a clear signal. The market is experiencing intense pessimism. This index, compiled by Alternative.me, acts as a sentiment thermometer. It ranges from 0 (maximum fear) to 100 (maximum greed). The current stagnation at 24 suggests a market paralyzed by uncertainty, where selling pressure and negative news are outweighing any bullish optimism. This isn’t a fleeting moment of panic; it’s a sustained state of caution that colors every trade and headline. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? This sentiment score isn’t a guess. It’s a composite index built from several market data points. Knowing its components helps you see beyond the single number. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index formula includes: Volatility (25%): Sharp price swings, especially downward, increase fear. Market Volume (25%): High volume during downturns signals panic selling. Social Media (15%): The tone and volume of conversations on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Polls of market participant sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): A rising BTC dominance often signals a ‘flight to safety’ from altcoins. Google Trends (10%): Search volume for terms like ‘Bitcoin crash’. Therefore, the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading reflects a confluence of negative data across all these fronts. Should You Be Afraid When the Index Shows Extreme Fear? This is the critical question for investors. While extreme fear feels alarming, historically, it has often presented contrarian opportunities. The core principle behind the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is that excessive fear can lead to undervalued assets, while extreme greed can signal a market top. However, this is not a simple buy signal. You must consider: Your Risk Tolerance: Can you handle further potential downside? Investment Horizon: Are you trading short-term or investing for years? Market Context: What macro-economic factors are driving the fear? Blindly buying during extreme fear is risky, but completely ignoring the signal may mean missing a long-term entry point. The key is disciplined strategy, not emotion. Actionable Insights in a Fear-Driven Market So, what should you actually do when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is this low? First, avoid making panic-driven decisions. Use this time for research and portfolio review. Consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to build positions gradually, reducing the impact of volatility. Secondly, reassess your portfolio’s fundamentals. Are the projects you hold still solid, or was your investment based on hype? Finally, use tools like this index to plan, not to react. Set your entry and exit points based on logic before sentiment overwhelms you. Conclusion: Navigating the Sentiment Storm The Crypto Fear & Greed Index stuck at 24 is a powerful reminder that markets are driven by human emotion as much as by code and technology. While it signals a challenging environment, it also provides a structured way to gauge the market’s mood. By understanding its components and historical context, you can transform fear from a paralyzing force into a strategic data point. Remember, the most successful investors often demonstrate courage when others are fearful, but they do so with careful planning and a clear mind. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable predictor of price? A: It is a reliable indicator of current sentiment, not a direct price predictor. It shows investor emotion, which can influence but does not guarantee future price movement. Q: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A: The index is updated daily, providing a near real-time pulse on market sentiment. Q: Should I only look at the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for Bitcoin? A: While it is heavily influenced by Bitcoin, it reflects overall cryptocurrency market sentiment, as Bitcoin’s movements typically dictate the trend for altcoins. Q: Has the index ever been wrong? A: Sentiment can remain ‘extreme’ for extended periods during prolonged bear markets. The index signals opportunity zones but does not time the exact market bottom. Q: Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index score? A: You can view the live index on its official website, Alternative.me, or on many major cryptocurrency data platforms. Q: Can I use this index for day trading? A> It is more valuable for medium to long-term strategic decisions than for short-term day trading, as sentiment shifts can be slow.

This historic spot gold all-time high signals a powerful shift in global markets, capturing the attention of investors worldwide. For those accustomed to the volatility of cryptocurrencies, this gold rally offers a fascinating contrast in safe-haven asset behavior. Let’s delve into what’s driving this unprecedented move and explore its potential implications. What’s Fueling the Historic Spot Gold Rally? The journey to this spot gold all-time high is not a random event. Several powerful economic forces have converged to create the perfect storm for gold’s ascent. Understanding these drivers is crucial for any investor looking to navigate the current financial landscape. Firstly, persistent global inflation concerns have eroded confidence in fiat currencies. Investors are turning to gold, a classic store of value, to protect their wealth. Secondly, geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty have increased the demand for safe-haven assets. When stocks and digital assets wobble, gold often shines brightest. Why Does This All-Time High Matter for Your Portfolio? Reaching a new spot gold all-time high is more than just a headline; it’s a critical market signal. This milestone confirms gold’s enduring role in a diversified investment strategy. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, it highlights the importance of balancing a high-growth, digital portfolio with tangible, time-tested assets. Consider these key takeaways for your investment approach: Diversification is Key: Gold’s inverse relationship with riskier assets can provide crucial portfolio stability. Inflation Hedge: Gold has historically preserved purchasing power during periods of currency devaluation. Market Sentiment Indicator: A strong gold price often reflects broader investor caution and a search for safety. Spot Gold vs. Digital Gold: A New Dynamic? This record-breaking price for physical spot gold invites an interesting comparison with Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold.’ While both are seen as hedges against traditional finance, their recent performances can tell different stories. The surge in physical gold underscores a flight to a proven, tangible asset during uncertainty. However, this doesn’t diminish crypto’s potential. Instead, it emphasizes a strategic viewpoint: a modern portfolio might benefit from holding both. Physical gold offers millennia of history as a value reserve, while digital assets represent technological innovation and future potential. The new spot gold all-time high reminds us that both can play vital, complementary roles. Actionable Insights: What Should Investors Do Now? Witnessing a historic spot gold all-time high can trigger a fear of missing out (FOMO). However, a disciplined strategy is better than a reactive one. Here is a simple framework to consider. First, assess your current asset allocation. Is your portfolio overly exposed to one type of risk? Second, consider dollar-cost averaging into gold ETFs or physical bullion to gain exposure without timing the market. Finally, use this event as a learning moment about macroeconomic trends and how different asset classes, from crypto to commodities, interact. Conclusion: A Golden Moment in Market History The breach of $4,500 for spot gold is a landmark event that reinforces the metal’s timeless appeal. This spot gold all-time high is a powerful testament to its role as a financial sanctuary during turbulent times. For the astute investor, it serves as both a validation of gold’s core principles and a prompt to review and balance their entire investment strategy for the road ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does ‘spot gold’ price mean? The spot price is the current market price at which gold can be bought or sold for immediate delivery and payment, as opposed to futures contracts for delivery later. What usually happens after gold hits an all-time high? While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, a new high can attract more investment, but it may also lead to short-term profit-taking and volatility. The long-term trend depends on the underlying economic drivers. Is it too late to invest in gold after this rally? Market timing is extremely difficult. Many investors use gold as a long-term hedge, not a short-term trade. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your goals is always recommended. How can I easily invest in spot gold? Average investors typically gain exposure through Gold Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) that track the price, shares in gold mining companies, or by purchasing physical bullion from reputable dealers. Does a strong gold price mean a weak stock market? Not necessarily, but it often indicates rising risk aversion. Gold and stocks can rise together in certain environments, like during expansive monetary policy, but they frequently have an inverse correlation during crises.

This action highlights the persistent dangers lurking in the unregulated corners of the crypto market and serves as a stark warning for investors. What is the SEC Pyramid Scheme Case About? The SEC alleges that the groups operated a multi-level marketing fraud, posing as financial experts to lure victims. They promised outsized profits from artificial intelligence-based investments, directing people to trade on fraudulent platforms. The charged entities include Morocoin Tech Corp., Berge Blockchain Technology Co. Ltd, Cirkor Inc., and investment clubs AI Wealth Inc, Lane Wealth Inc., AI Investment Education Foundation Ltd, and Zenith Asset Tech Foundation. How Did This Crypto Fraud Operate? The scheme relied on a classic playbook with a modern, tech-savvy twist. Promoters used the allure of AI and cryptocurrency to create an air of sophistication and inevitability. Here is how they allegedly executed the plan: False Expertise: The groups presented themselves as seasoned financial and technology experts. AI Hype: They dangled the promise of proprietary AI algorithms that could guarantee trading profits. Fake Exchanges: Victims were funneled to the three charged exchanges, which were likely controlled by the fraudsters. Pyramid Structure: The scheme likely encouraged existing members to recruit new investors, with payouts based on recruitment rather than real investment success. This combination of buzzwords and complex technology made the SEC pyramid scheme appear legitimate to unsuspecting investors. Why is the SEC’s Action So Significant? This case is more than just a large fraud bust. It represents a clear signal from regulators. The SEC is actively policing the crypto space for traditional financial crimes like pyramid and Ponzi schemes, regardless of the technological wrapper. For the crypto industry, such enforcement is a double-edged sword. While it protects consumers, it also underscores the regulatory scrutiny that all platforms now face. The charges demonstrate that the SEC will pursue not just the primary architects but also the supporting infrastructure, like the exchanges that facilitated the fraud. How Can You Avoid Crypto Investment Scams? The shocking details of this SEC pyramid scheme charge are a powerful reminder to practice vigilance. Here are actionable steps to protect your capital: Verify Everything: Check if an exchange is properly registered. Be deeply skeptical of “guaranteed” returns, especially those tied to AI or secret strategies. Understand the Product: If you cannot clearly explain how an investment makes money, it is a major red flag. Beware of Recruitment Pressure: Legitimate investments do not require you to recruit friends and family to turn a profit. Consult Independent Sources: Do not rely solely on information provided by the promotion. Seek out independent reviews and news. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto? This enforcement action will likely accelerate two trends. First, increased due diligence by investors who are now more aware of schemes disguised as innovation. Second, continued and possibly intensified regulatory actions from the SEC and other bodies worldwide. The era of the “wild west” in crypto is closing, and platforms operating in gray areas will face significant legal risks. In conclusion, the SEC’s decisive move to charge these entities in a $14 million pyramid scheme is a crucial development. It dismantles a harmful fraud, educates the public on modern scam tactics, and reinforces the message that regulatory oversight in cryptocurrency is real and active. While innovation should thrive, it must do so on a foundation of transparency and legality, not deception. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Which companies did the SEC charge in this pyramid scheme? A1: The SEC charged three cryptocurrency exchanges—Morocoin Tech Corp., Berge Blockchain Technology Co. Ltd, and Cirkor Inc.—and four investment clubs: AI Wealth Inc, Lane Wealth Inc., AI Investment Education Foundation Ltd, and Zenith Asset Tech Foundation. Q2: How much money did investors lose in this scheme? A2: According to the SEC’s investigation, the alleged pyramid scheme defrauded investors of a total of $14 million. Q3: What was the main promise used to lure victims? A3: The groups allegedly posed as financial experts and promised profits from artificial intelligence (AI)-based investments, directing people to trade on their fraudulent cryptocurrency exchanges. Q4: Is this a common type of fraud in cryptocurrency? A4: Yes, pyramid and Ponzi schemes that use the hype around new technologies like AI and crypto are unfortunately common. They exploit a lack of understanding and the promise of high, quick returns. Q5: What should I do if I think I’ve been targeted by a similar scam? A5: You should immediately stop any further investments, gather all documentation (emails, transaction records, promises made), and report it to the SEC’s whistleblower program or the relevant financial authority in your country. Q6: Does this mean all AI-related crypto projects are scams? A6: No, not at all. Many legitimate projects utilize AI. However, this case highlights that scammers frequently misuse popular buzzwords like “AI” to appear credible. Always conduct thorough, independent research.

Large altcoins slow down. Liquidity seeks the following place to expand. During such times, there are projects, which begin to slowly crawl before they can even be known to the rest of the market. Such a trend has already established itself around a single fresh DeFi crypto that has already risen over 250% when some of the most popular altcoins are performing flat or poorly. The large holder’s early positioning is attracting more attention with allocation currently standing at more than 99%. A Yield and Risk Control Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a developing crypto DeFi, which is based on lending and borrowing. Fundamentally, the protocol enables the users to provide assets and obtain yield, and borrowers to obtain liquidity by placing collatorals. On the P2C side consumers inject funds into pools and gain APY according to actual borrowing demand. To illustrate this, a reliable supplier of assets can issue yield, which will change with usage, rather than speculation. Borrowers on the P2P side are presented directly with terms of lending. The lending to value ratios are set in advance. There are liquidation cutoffs. In the case where the borrower has surpassed the stipulated LTV, collateral may be sold to secure the lenders. These mechanics are used to take away the unexpected shocks, and preserve stability of the system. Exposure to presale activity has also contributed significantly to the initial development in tandem with the protocol design. The token has done so by increasing the phases in a structured way and has increased by about 250% since its entry level was significantly low. Demand has not been frenzied but steady which is usually an indicator of buildup and not of short term speculation. The Next Transition Point, V1 Launch and Security It is no wonder analysts are keeping a close eye on MUTM, and timing of this case is one of the reasons. The protocol is currently looking to undergo its V1 release that will bring it out of the development stage to active use. Most DeFi crypto projects traditionally start to reprice as soon as the users are able to borrow, lend, and interoperate on chain. Another big concern has been security. Mutuum Finance has completed a CertiK token scan with excellent rating and full Halborn security review is underway. Another level of protection is included by a bug bounty program. Such measures are important since the lending procedures pertain to direct use of user funds. Serious capital usually holds down its investments until it has the green flag. According to this arrangement, there can be a conservative price model in which some analysts suggest that MUTM may experience a 3x move on its current price once the first step to V1 adoption takes place. This perception is linked to increase in usage, and not market hype. mtTokens and Oracle Infrastructure The major characteristic of this protocol is the mtTokens. Upon the supply of assets, the users are given the mtTokens that reflect their voting power in the pools. These tokens increase in value when borrowers pay interests. This establishes the reason to hold other than trade short term. The other factor is the buy and distribute model. Protocol revenue is partially spent on purchasing MUTM tokens at the open market and allocating them to the holders of the mtTokens. This forms continuous pressure of buying which is directly related to use. The role of oracles is also here. There is a need for accurate price feeds to handle LTV ratios and liquidations. Quality oracle data assists in safeguarding the system and has the lending activity foreseeable. In these mechanics put together, analysts describe a more positive picture in which long-term protocol usage would help justify a 5x-7x long-term growth. In this model, there is an assumption that there is a smooth increase in demand for borrowing, but not abrupt increases. Why MUTM is compared to Early Aave Other observers liken Mutuum Finance to the early Aave, not in scale, but in form and in time. Aave succeeded through prioritizing loans before rolling out functions subsequently. It focused on definite regulations, stable interests paying, and excellent security before the mass media coverage came into play. The same applies to Mutuum Finance. It is in its infancy stage. There are reduced liquidity requirements. Price elasticity is in large measure. Meanwhile, the protocol is constructed with actual DeFi use as opposed to narrative hype. This is what has made MUTM to be referred to as a fresh crypto with asymmetric upside. It does not need huge inflows to transfer. It is also not reliant on social trends to operate. Allocation thumbs 99% and bigger holders move in is still being shifted into as attention shifts. Although most leading altcoins have a hard time getting a fresh wave, this crypto DeFi is at the point in which the structure, usage, and timing are starting to cooperate.

After failing to sustain momentum above key psychological and technical levels, market sentiment has shifted toward caution, with investors closely monitoring liquidity behavior and exchange flows for early signals of regime change. Related Reading: The Gold-to-Bitcoin Rotation Narrative Gains Strength: A Data-Driven Review Recent analysis from Arab Chain, based on CryptoQuant’s Exchange Inflow Value (7-day cumulative) metric, highlights a notable divergence in liquidity patterns between major exchanges. The data aggregates Bitcoin and Ethereum inflows, providing a broader view of risk positioning across the two largest crypto assets. On November 24, when Bitcoin was trading around $88,438, Coinbase recorded seven-day cumulative inflows totaling approximately $21.0 billion. In contrast, Binance saw lower, though still significant, inflows near $15.3 billion. What stands out is that these elevated inflows occurred while prices were already well below prior highs. Rather than signaling aggressive accumulation, the data points to increased exchange activity consistent with portfolio rebalancing, hedging, or preparation for potential distribution. Exchange Inflows Signal Liquidity Tightening Despite Stable Bitcoin Prices By December 21, Bitcoin was trading near $88,635. Only marginally higher than late-November levels and still locked within a narrow consolidation range. While price action showed little progress, exchange flow data pointed to a notable shift in market conditions. Updated on-chain figures indicate that liquidity entering major trading venues declined sharply over the span of just a few weeks, underscoring a cooling in overall market activity. Coinbase, often used as a proxy for institutional and US-based flows, saw seven-day cumulative inflows fall to roughly $7.8 billion. That represents a steep drop of more than 60% compared with inflow levels observed in late November. Binance also experienced a contraction, but the decline was materially less severe, with inflows totaling about $10.3 billion over the same period. As a result, Binance surpassed Coinbase in net inflows during December, reversing the earlier dynamic. This divergence suggests that while broad liquidity has tightened, trading activity has become more concentrated on venues associated with shorter-term positioning and active risk management. At the same time, the absence of a significant price reaction highlights how Bitcoin has continued to trade sideways even as fresh capital flows slowed. Taken together, the data points to a market operating with reduced turnover and lower urgency on both the buy and sell side. Bitcoin’s ability to remain range-bound amid shrinking inflows reflects a quieter, more constrained liquidity environment compared with conditions seen just one month earlier.

The structure now reflects a clear shift in short-term trend dynamics, with price firmly below its major daily moving averages. Notably, Bitcoin has lost the 111-day and 200-day simple moving averages. Both of which have started to roll over and act as dynamic resistance rather than support. The rejection from the $110,000–$115,000 zone marked a decisive lower high, followed by an impulsive sell-off toward the mid-$80,000 range. Since then, price action has compressed into a narrow consolidation, suggesting temporary stabilization rather than a confirmed reversal. However, the inability to reclaim the declining moving averages indicates that upside attempts remain fragile. Related Reading: Ethereum Traders Chase Upside With Historic Leverage – Breakout Fuel Or Fragile Setup? Volume behavior adds to the cautious outlook. Selling pressure expanded during the initial breakdown, while subsequent rebounds have occurred on muted volume, signaling limited conviction from buyers. This imbalance suggests that dip-buying demand is present but not strong enough to force a trend shift. From a technical perspective, the $85,000–$88,000 area has become a critical near-term support zone. A sustained hold could allow for range formation. Failure to defend this level would increase the risk of a deeper retracement. For sentiment to improve, Bitcoin would need to reclaim the $95,000–$100,000 region and stabilize above its key daily averages.

Have you felt a subtle shift in the crypto winds? The latest data reveals a crucial signal: the Altcoin Season Index has climbed two points to 18. This movement, while seemingly small, often acts as an early whisper of changing market tides. For investors tracking the eternal dance between Bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies, this index serves as a vital compass. Let’s decode what this rise truly means for your portfolio. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? Before we dive into the implications of the recent increase, it’s essential to understand the tool itself. CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index is a specialized metric designed to measure market sentiment and capital flow. It performs a simple yet powerful comparison: it tracks the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped assets) against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. The mechanism is straightforward. The index declares a full-blown “ altcoin season ” when 75% of these top coins outperform Bitcoin. A score of 100 represents this peak. Conversely, a low score indicates a “Bitcoin season,” where the pioneer cryptocurrency dominates the gains. Therefore, the current reading of 18 suggests the market is still firmly in Bitcoin’s grip, but the two-point rise hints at nascent stirrings elsewhere. Why Does a Rising Altcoin Season Index Matter? A moving index is more than just a number; it’s a narrative of investor behavior. The recent uptick to 18, though far from the altcoin season threshold, is significant for several reasons. Early Signal: Major market rotations rarely happen overnight. Small, consistent increases in this index can foreshadow a broader trend where capital begins to trickle from Bitcoin into altcoins. Sentiment Gauge: It reflects growing investor confidence in projects beyond Bitcoin. When the index rises, it often means traders are starting to hunt for higher returns in the altcoin space. Portfolio Strategy: For the savvy investor, monitoring this index helps in timing portfolio rebalancing, potentially shifting weight from BTC to select altcoins as the trend develops. However, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. An index at 18 is a far cry from 75. This indicates we are in the very early, speculative stages of any potential shift. Navigating the Current Market: Bitcoin Season vs. Altcoin Hope So, are we still in a Bitcoin season? Absolutely. The low score confirms that Bitcoin continues to command the lion’s share of market strength and investor attention. This dominance is often driven by macroeconomic factors, institutional adoption, and its status as a digital gold. Yet, the two-point rise in the Altcoin Season Index injects a dose of intrigue. It asks a compelling question: Is this the calm before the storm, or merely a false dawn? History shows that altcoin seasons are often preceded by such tentative index movements. They can explode after Bitcoin’s price stabilizes following a major rally, as investors seek amplified gains. Therefore, the current landscape presents a dual reality: a present dominated by Bitcoin and a future pregnant with possibility for altcoins. The key is to watch for consistency. Will the index continue to climb in the coming weeks, or will it fall back? Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors What should you do with this information? Panic buying altcoins is not the answer. Instead, adopt a strategic and measured approach. Monitor, Don’t Chase: Use the Altcoin Season Index as a weekly monitoring tool, not a daily trading signal. Look for sustained upward trends over weeks. Research Fundamentals: If a rotation begins, not all altcoins will rise equally. Focus on projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear utility. Manage Risk: Any shift into altcoins should be gradual. Consider them a higher-risk, higher-reward portion of your portfolio and size your positions accordingly. Watch Bitcoin: Remember, Bitcoin remains the market anchor. Significant BTC price drops usually drag down the entire market, regardless of the index reading. The Bottom Line: A Signal Worth Watching The rise of the Altcoin Season Index to 18 is a noteworthy development in the crypto ecosystem. It is not a siren call for an immediate altcoin boom, but rather a flicker on the radar—a hint that patient capital may be starting to evaluate opportunities beyond Bitcoin. For informed investors, this is a time for heightened research and preparation, not impulsive action. The index provides a valuable framework for understanding market cycles, reminding us that crypto markets are perpetually in flux, rotating between dominance and diversification. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a good Altcoin Season Index score to start buying altcoins? There’s no magic number. A sustained rise above 25-30 can indicate strengthening momentum, but always combine this with fundamental research on individual projects. Never invest based on a single metric. Q2: Does a rising index guarantee altcoin profits? No. The index measures past performance relative to Bitcoin. It indicates a trend, not a guarantee of future profits. Altcoins remain highly volatile and risky assets. Q3: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? The index is typically updated daily, tracking the rolling 90-day performance of the top 100 coins against Bitcoin. Q4: Can we have a “Bitcoin and Altcoin season” at the same time? Technically, the index defines the seasons as mutually exclusive. However, in broad market bull runs, both Bitcoin and major altcoins can appreciate, with altcoins simply outperforming on a relative basis. Q5: Where can I check the current Altcoin Season Index? The index is publicly available on CoinMarketCap’s website under their market analysis or research tools section. Share This Insight!

56264823,648071,1766538015,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,"Ethereum Pulls Back on ETF Outflows, but Corporate Treasuries Continue to Add Exposure",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-pulls-back-on-etf-outflows-but-corporate/,"Ethereum’s (ETH) market structure is showing a clear split between financial products and direct balance-sheet accumulation. While U.S.-listed Ethereum ETFs have struggled to attract consistent inflows in recent sessions, corporate treasuries are quietly increasing their exposure, creating a mixed signal for investors heading into the final days of 2025. Recent ETF data highlights this contrast. According to flow trackers, several Ethereum ETFs recorded flat or negative flows, including a session where BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF posted zero net inflows. ETF Demand Softens as Ethereum Trades Near Key Levels Ethereum has momentarily held above the $3,000 psychological level despite the ETF withdrawals, signaling that selling pressure has not translated into a broad market breakdown. The Ethereum Price action has remained range-bound, with resistance forming above recent highs and buyers continuing to defend lower support zones. Analysts note that ETF flows have historically amplified short-term momentum, but their absence often leads to consolidation rather than sharp declines. The uneven ETF activity also reflects market concentration. While some Ethereum funds briefly recorded inflows earlier in the week, most products showed little to no activity. This points to selective positioning rather than a coordinated institutional exit, even as risk appetite remains muted across crypto markets. Corporate Accumulation Offsets Ethereum ETF Weakness In contrast to the hesitation among ETF investors, corporate buyers have continued to accumulate Ethereum directly. Bitmine Immersion Technologies , now the largest known corporate holder of ETH, has surpassed 4 million ETH in total holdings, representing more than 3% of the circulating supply. The firm added nearly 100,000 ETH in a single week, buying into recent price weakness at an average cost of around $3,000. This steady accumulation highlights a longer-term thesis centered on Ethereum’s role in staking, tokenization, and blockchain-based financial infrastructure. Unlike ETF flows, which are often driven by short-term sentiment and portfolio rebalancing, corporate treasury strategies tend to reflect multi-year positioning. A Market Divided Between Caution and Conviction The divergence between ETF flows and direct corporate accumulation underscores a market in transition. Financial products tied to Ethereum appear sensitive to macro conditions and regulatory clarity, while some firms are using price pullbacks to build strategic exposure. As 2026 approaches, Ethereum’s price may continue to reflect this balance, limited upside without renewed ETF demand, but firm underlying support from long-term holders willing to accumulate outside traditional investment vehicles.

In the fresh move, ED carried out coordinated searches across three states. These raids were linked to a case involving fake investment platforms that allegedly duped investors in India and overseas. The Enforcement Directorate reportedly raided 21 residential and office locations across Karnataka, Maharashtra and New Delhi. This was part of a money laundering investigation. The searches were conducted under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The case was registered against 4th Bloc Consultants and several other individuals. ED finds web of crypto wallets According to the ED, the probe comes out of an FIR and intelligence inputs shared by the Karnataka state police. The authorities have described it as an organised and multi-year financial fraud operation. The accused allegedly ran a network of fake crypto investment platforms that closely looked like actual trading websites. The platforms under investigation used to promise unusually high returns. However, they targeted both Indian residents and foreign nationals. The scammers lure them with claims of quick and regular profits through digital assets. Investigators highlighted that the operators used photographs of well-known personalities and so-called crypto experts without permission to build credibility. The report added that several early investors were paid small returns to establish trust before larger sums were asked for. These tactics mirror classic multi-level marketing and pig-butchering scams. The ED said the group relied heavily on social media platforms to promote the schemes. This includes Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Telegram. However, referral bonuses were offered to expand the investor base. This takes a dark turn as funds were allegedly routed through a web of crypto wallets, shell companies and foreign bank accounts. Crypto scams traced back to 2015 Officials have marked that the proceeds of crime were moved using peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto transfers. The scammers also used hawala channels before converting them into cash or parking them in bank accounts. It added that some funds were also used directly for crypto transactions. Authorities also traced movable and immovable assets in India and abroad. These assets were allegedly acquired using the funds gathered from fraud. The ED had stated that the syndicate had been operating since at least 2015. No arrests have been announced so far. In a public advisory, the agency issued a warning for investors against engaging with several websites suspected to be part of the scam network. This includes goldbooker.com, cryptobrite.com, hawkchain.com, cubigains.com, bitminerclub.com and others. It has urged immediate cessation of any related activity. Meanwhile, digital assets are not legal tender in the country. The global crypto is dealing with high selling pressure.

Anthony Pompliano, a prominent voice in crypto investing, presents a compelling counter-narrative. He suggests that this current stability might be the very factor that prevents a devastating Bitcoin price crash in early 2026. This perspective challenges the common fear that flat periods signal impending doom, offering a fresh lens for long-term holders. Could Lower Volatility Actually Prevent a Bitcoin Price Crash? In a recent CNBC interview, Pompliano, founder of Pomp Investments, made a striking observation. He directly linked Bitcoin’s recent subdued price action to a reduced risk of a severe downturn. Historically, parabolic rallies have often been followed by brutal corrections. However, the current environment appears different. Pompliano argues that with Bitcoin price volatility at lower levels, the conditions for a catastrophic 70-80% drop are simply not present. This maturation of the market acts as a natural buffer. Think of it this way: a market that climbs slowly on a steady path is less likely to plunge off a cliff than one that rockets up a sheer mountain face. The reduced speculative frenzy means fewer weak hands are in the game, creating a more solid foundation. Therefore, while the excitement of massive green candles might be missing, the trade-off is significant stability. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Long-Term Performance? It’s easy for investors to feel disappointed when short-term expectations aren’t met. Pompliano urges a shift in focus to the bigger picture. He highlights Bitcoin’s undeniable long-term track record: The asset has gained 100% over the past two years . It has soared an impressive 300% over the past three years . These figures underscore a crucial point: Bitcoin’s value proposition is not defined by quarterly performance, but by its multi-year growth trajectory. The potential absence of a sharp Bitcoin price crash in 2026 would further validate this journey toward becoming a less volatile, more institutional-grade asset. How Should Investors Navigate This New Phase? This analysis provides actionable insight for anyone holding BTC. The traditional cycle of “boom and bust” may be softening. For investors, this evolving dynamic suggests a few key strategies: Reassess Risk: The probability of a historic, portfolio-wrecking crash may be lower than in previous cycles. Embrace Patience: Extraordinary bull run returns may moderate, but so might the depths of the bears. Focus on Fundamentals: Network security, adoption trends, and macroeconomic factors become even more critical indicators than daily price swings. In essence, Bitcoin is potentially transitioning from a high-octane speculative asset to a more resilient store of value. This doesn’t eliminate risk, but it does reshape it. Conclusion: Stability Over Speculation Anthony Pompliano’s take reframes market sentiment. A muted year-end is not a failure, but a potential sign of strength and maturity. The fear of a major Bitcoin price crash in early 2026 is mitigated by the very lack of euphoria that some investors lament. This creates a more sustainable path forward, favoring those with long-term conviction over short-term speculators. The journey of Bitcoin continues to be revolutionary, but its path may be becoming less treacherous. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does Pompliano’s analysis mean Bitcoin won’t drop at all in 2026? A: No. He suggests a sharp, catastrophic crash (like 70-80%) is unlikely, but regular market corrections and volatility are still expected. Q: Why does lower volatility prevent a major Bitcoin price crash? A: Extreme crashes often follow periods of extreme, unsustainable speculation and leverage. Lower volatility typically indicates a market with stronger hands and less reckless buying, creating a sturdier price floor. Q: Should I change my investment strategy based on this? A: It reinforces a long-term, disciplined strategy like dollar-cost averaging (DCA). It suggests panic selling during normal downturns may be less justified, but always do your own research. Q: Has Bitcoin’s volatility decreased permanently? A> While the overall trend is toward lower volatility as the market matures and institutional participation grows, Bitcoin will likely remain more volatile than traditional assets like stocks for the foreseeable future. Q: What are the biggest risks to Bitcoin if not a price crash? A> Key risks include regulatory crackdowns in major economies, critical technological flaws, severe global macroeconomic crises, or the rise of a superior competing technology.

Originally slated for release this month, the launch is now pushed to March 2026. This decision stems from a fundamental strategic shift: AMO Labs is pivoting from general electric vehicle data collection to focus exclusively on Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) system. For holders of AMO Coin and observers of the crypto-mobility intersection, this announcement raises crucial questions about strategy, timing, and future value. Why is AMO Labs delaying the D2E 2.0 launch? The core reason is a complete revision of the company’s business strategy. AMO Labs stated it must align with rapidly changing global mobility trends. Initially, the platform aimed to gather data from a broad range of electric vehicles, including brands like BYD. However, the company now believes the most valuable, high-fidelity data comes from Tesla’s advanced FSD system. This pivot isn’t a simple adjustment; it requires building a more advanced and complete technological infrastructure from the ground up, making the previous launch schedule impossible. What does focusing on Tesla FSD mean for AMO Coin? This strategic shift carries significant implications for the AMO Coin ecosystem. By concentrating on Tesla FSD, AMO Labs is betting on quality over quantity. Tesla’s system represents one of the most sophisticated and widely deployed autonomous driving suites globally. Therefore, data from these vehicles is potentially more valuable for training AI models and creating mobility-related blockchain services. This focus could position AMO Coin as a specialized token within a high-growth niche, but it also introduces new dependencies and challenges. Potential Benefit: Access to superior, real-world autonomous driving data. Key Challenge: Reliance on a single manufacturer’s ecosystem and technology stack. Long-term Vision: Creating a premium data marketplace for AI and mobility developers. How will this delay impact the crypto mobility sector? The delay of AMO Labs’ D2E 2.0 platform sends a clear signal about the maturation of blockchain applications in real-world sectors. It highlights that integrating complex, physical-world systems like autonomous vehicles with blockchain requires more time and specialized focus than initially anticipated. This move may encourage other projects in the space to prioritize depth and data quality over speed to market. For investors, it underscores the importance of due diligence on a project’s underlying technology partnerships and its adaptability to market shifts. What are the actionable insights for crypto investors? For anyone following AMO Coin or similar tokens, this development offers several lessons. First, it demonstrates that serious blockchain projects in sectors like mobility must be flexible and respond to technological advancements. The pivot to Tesla FSD shows strategic agility. Second, long delays, while frustrating, can sometimes indicate a commitment to building a robust product rather than releasing a subpar one. Investors should monitor AMO Labs’ progress in building its new Tesla-focused system and any new partnerships that emerge from this strategic shift. In conclusion, AMO Labs’ decision to delay D2E 2.0 until 2026 is a bold strategic gamble. By shifting focus entirely to Tesla’s FSD data, the company is aiming for a higher-value, more specialized position in the crypto-mobility landscape. While the wait is extended, the potential payoff involves creating a unique data asset on the blockchain. The success of this pivot will ultimately depend on AMO Labs’ execution and the evolving landscape of autonomous vehicle technology. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: When is the new launch date for AMO Labs’ D2E 2.0 platform? A: The launch has been rescheduled for March 2026. Q: Why did AMO Labs change its focus to Tesla FSD? A: The company revised its strategy to align with global mobility trends, believing Tesla’s FSD system provides more advanced and valuable data for its blockchain platform. Q: What was the original focus of the D2E 2.0 platform? A: It was initially designed to collect and utilize data from a broad range of electric vehicles, including manufacturers like BYD. Q: How might this affect the value of AMO Coin? A: The long-term impact is unclear. The focus on a premium data source (Tesla FSD) could increase the platform’s potential value, but the long delay may test investor patience in the short term. Q: Is AMO Labs partnering with Tesla? A: The announcement describes a focus on Tesla’s FSD data but does not specify a formal partnership with Tesla, Inc.

The Heybit shutdown is scheduled for January 30, 2026, marking the end of its operations worldwide. This decision comes two years after the company exited the challenging South Korean market, signaling persistent difficulties in the evolving crypto landscape. Why is the Heybit Shutdown Happening? Heybit Global made the official announcement on December 23. The company stated that concluding its operations was a necessary step. They cited significant changes in both the business environment and the global regulatory framework as the primary reasons. Essentially, it became too difficult to continue running the service sustainably under the new conditions. The precise time for the Heybit shutdown is 9:00 a.m. UTC on the specified date. This gives users a clear, two-year window to manage their assets and transition to other platforms. The extended notice period is crucial for user security and fund safety. What Does This Mean for Current Heybit Users? If you have assets on Heybit, you must take action before the deadline. The platform is not closing immediately, but planning your exit strategy is essential. Here are the key steps every user should follow: Withdraw All Funds : Ensure you move your cryptocurrency and any fiat balances to your private wallet or another reputable exchange well before January 2026. Download Your Records : Export your transaction history, tax documents, and account statements for your personal records. Disable Services : Cancel any recurring buys, automated trading strategies, or linked payment methods associated with your Heybit account. Proactive management is your best defense against potential last-minute technical issues or support delays as the final date approaches. How Does Regulatory Change Impact Crypto Services? The mention of a shifting “regulatory environment” is a common yet powerful challenge for crypto businesses. Governments worldwide are creating new rules for digital assets. These regulations aim to protect consumers and prevent illegal activities but can also increase operational costs and complexity for companies. For a service like Heybit, which focused on wealth management, compliance can become particularly burdensome. The need for stricter licensing, enhanced reporting, and greater capital reserves can make it unfeasible for some platforms to continue, leading directly to a service shutdown . What Can We Learn from the Heybit Exit? The planned Heybit shutdown serves as a stark reminder of the volatility and uncertainty inherent in the cryptocurrency industry. While innovation is rapid, the market is also consolidating. Users should always prioritize the security and longevity of the platforms they use. This event underscores several critical lessons for crypto participants: Not Your Keys, Not Your Crypto : The fundamental principle of holding your own private keys remains paramount. Diversify Your Platforms : Avoid keeping all your assets on a single exchange or service. Stay Informed : Follow official announcements from any platform you use to avoid being caught off guard by changes. In conclusion, the orderly wind-down of Heybit provides a clear example of how a crypto business can responsibly exit the market. By giving users ample notice and a specific timeline, they are allowing for a safe transition of assets. However, it ultimately reinforces the need for personal responsibility and vigilance in managing digital wealth. The crypto ecosystem continues to mature, and such events are part of its ongoing evolution toward greater stability and regulation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: When exactly is Heybit shutting down? A: All Heybit Global services will end at 9:00 a.m. UTC on January 30, 2026. Q: Why is Heybit closing? A: The company stated that changes in the business and regulatory environment made it too difficult to continue operations. Q: Is my money safe until the shutdown? A: The platform is operational until 2026. However, it is strongly advised to withdraw your funds to a personal wallet or another exchange well before the deadline to avoid any last-minute issues. Q: What should I do if I have a Heybit account? A: You should plan to withdraw all assets, download your account history and statements, and cancel any automated services linked to your account. Q: Did Heybit already shut down in South Korea? A: Yes, Heybit withdrew from the South Korean market approximately two years before this global shutdown announcement. Q: Are other crypto platforms at risk of shutting down? A> The regulatory landscape is challenging globally. While not all platforms will shut down, it highlights the importance of using reputable, well-established services and never leaving large sums on any exchange indefinitely.

Sources close to the situation noted that this project was permitted to collect funds through one of the country’s programs, which offers tax incentives for cultural projects. Brazil’s Federal Register revealed that this approval process enabled the initiative to raise approximately 1.09 million reais, equivalent to around $197,000. These funds were primarily collected from private firms and individual donors to develop an instrumental concert that utilizes financial data to compose music, incorporating ideas generated from art, mathematics, economics, and physics. Nonetheless, sources pointed out that this news did not disclose whether any blockchain technology would be involved in the performance. It was mentioned that the concert will take place in Brasília, Brazil’s modern, planned federal capital. Brazil takes a different approach in the crypto industry Just recently, reports noted that the new orchestral project description has been released. In this project description, it was revealed that the initiative will utilize an algorithm that enables it to transform monetary numerals into musical notation easily. This process will be made possible by monitoring the price shifts of Bitcoin and related technical data in real-time during the show. These data inputs are essential in this show as they help shape melody, rhythm, and harmony while the orchestra executes the live performance. Additionally, this method aims to provide individuals with an auditory experience of BTC’s fluctuations by transforming market sentiment into music, blending traditional orchestral instruments with data-inspired compositions. Meanwhile, sources familiar with the situation stated that the approval confirmed the newly adopted initiative meets the requirements of Brazil’s Rouanet Law and marks the completion of a technical review, permitting sponsors to deduct their donations from taxes effectively. Following this statement, individuals in the crypto ecosystem ignited heated discussions. To address this controversy, Brazilian officials attempted to explain that the new orchestral project falls under the “Instrumental Music” category, which, according to their argument, affects the application process for tax benefits. They also pointed out that the fundraising is scheduled to conclude by December 31. On the other hand, several analysts decided to weigh in on the topic of discussion. They argued that such a project builds upon previous experiments in algorithmic art that have employed crypto-related and other real-world data as inspiration for innovative works. Brazil secures recognition of programmable digital art that responds to BTC’s price changes A group in San Francisco, primarily focused on programmable digital art, launched a piece in 2020. This piece adapted its appearance in response to the price fluctuations of Bitcoin. This initiative was known as Right Place & Right Time by artist Matt Kane. It utilized the cryptocurrency’s live market data to prevent fluctuations in Bitcoin’s value from altering the artwork’s visuals. Notably, this work was introduced via Async Art, a blockchain platform for programmable, interactive digital art (NFTs). At that time, Kane arranged the artwork into a main “Master” image, consisting of several separate layers. Each layer responded to the price movement of BTC, with data changes greatly impacting aspects such as size, rotation, and positioning with time. Additionally, sources identified another artist in a similar field. This artist was called Refik Anadol. He reportedly utilized AI, algorithms, and large datasets to create immersive installations. These installations could transform various sources, such as environmental details and historical records, into visual art that changes over time.

This shocking development serves as a stark warning to investors and highlights the growing regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrency misconduct worldwide. What Exactly Was This NFT Fraud Scheme? The executive deceived approximately 30 investors out of over 3 billion won (about $2.2 million) through a sophisticated deception strategy. The scheme centered around false promises that the project’s token would be listed on a major South Korean exchange, creating artificial demand and misleading investors about the project’s legitimacy and potential value. What made this NFT fraud particularly effective was its use of celebrity endorsement. The project leveraged a former national soccer player for promotion, lending credibility to what was essentially a fraudulent operation. This case demonstrates how bad actors can exploit both technological novelty and social influence to perpetrate financial crimes. How Did Authorities Uncover This Elaborate Scam? South Korean regulators have been increasingly vigilant about cryptocurrency misconduct, especially following several high-profile cases in recent years. The investigation revealed several red flags that investors should watch for: Unverified exchange listing claims that couldn’t be confirmed through official channels Celebrity endorsements that seemed disproportionate to the project’s actual development Pressure tactics emphasizing limited-time opportunities to invest Vague technical documentation and unrealistic return projections The seven-year sentence reflects South Korea’s serious approach to NFT fraud and financial crimes in the digital asset space. This punishment sends a clear message to other potential offenders about the consequences of exploiting investors in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. What Does This Mean for NFT Investors Worldwide? This case provides crucial lessons for anyone considering NFT investments. First, celebrity endorsements should never replace thorough due diligence. Second, exchange listing promises require verification directly from the exchanges themselves. Third, regulatory frameworks are catching up with cryptocurrency innovations, providing better protection for investors. The NFT fraud case also highlights the importance of understanding jurisdictional differences in cryptocurrency regulation. South Korea has implemented some of the world’s strictest cryptocurrency regulations, including real-name trading systems and comprehensive reporting requirements. However, regulatory approaches vary significantly across countries, creating both challenges and opportunities for global investors. How Can You Protect Yourself from Similar NFT Scams? Protecting yourself requires a combination of skepticism, research, and understanding of basic investment principles. Here are actionable steps every investor should take: Verify all claims independently rather than relying on promotional materials Research the team’s background and previous project history Understand the technology behind any NFT project before investing Check regulatory compliance in the project’s home jurisdiction Diversify investments to mitigate potential losses from any single project This South Korean NFT fraud case represents a turning point in how authorities worldwide approach cryptocurrency crimes. As digital assets continue to gain mainstream acceptance, regulatory frameworks and enforcement mechanisms are evolving rapidly to protect investors while fostering innovation. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Crypto Accountability The seven-year sentence for this cryptocurrency CEO marks a significant moment in the maturation of digital asset markets. It demonstrates that authorities worldwide are developing the expertise and legal frameworks necessary to prosecute sophisticated NFT fraud schemes effectively. For legitimate projects and ethical entrepreneurs, this development represents progress toward a more trustworthy ecosystem. For investors, it provides reassurance that regulatory protections are strengthening even as market opportunities expand. Frequently Asked Questions What was the main method used in this NFT fraud scheme? The CEO falsely claimed the project’s token would be listed on a major South Korean exchange and used a former national soccer player for promotion, deceiving investors about the project’s legitimacy and potential value. How much money was involved in this fraud case? The scheme defrauded approximately 30 investors out of over 3 billion won, which is equivalent to about $2.2 million USD. What sentence did the crypto CEO receive? The executive was sentenced to seven years in prison, reflecting South Korea’s serious approach to cryptocurrency-related financial crimes. Why is this case significant for the broader cryptocurrency industry? This case demonstrates that authorities are developing effective methods to prosecute sophisticated digital asset fraud and sends a strong deterrent message to potential offenders worldwide. What should investors look for to avoid similar NFT scams? Investors should verify exchange listing claims directly with exchanges, research team backgrounds thoroughly, understand the underlying technology, check regulatory compliance, and maintain healthy skepticism about celebrity endorsements. How are South Korean regulations different from other countries? South Korea has implemented strict measures including real-name trading systems, comprehensive reporting requirements, and active enforcement against cryptocurrency misconduct.

56264825,648090,1766541608,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56264825.jpeg,Bitcoin Enters Risk-Off Regime: Sentiment and On-Chain Data Align,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-enters-risk-off-sentiment-on-chain-data/,"Bitcoin continues to trade below the psychologically important $90,000 level, reinforcing a cautious tone across the market as more analysts begin to warn that the current cycle could be transitioning toward a broader bear phase in 2026. Despite several attempts to regain upside momentum, price action has remained fragile, with volatility picking up and confidence fading among short-term participants. Recent on-chain insights from analyst Axel Adler add weight to the growing risk-off narrative. Market sentiment, which reached euphoric levels earlier this month, has undergone a notable reversal. After peaking in early December, optimism quickly faded as prices failed to sustain higher levels, triggering a steady deterioration in sentiment indicators. The latest readings now place sentiment firmly below neutral, reflecting a clear cooling in trader conviction. This shift is particularly notable because it follows a failed seasonal rebound attempt, often referred to as the “Santa rally,” which historically tends to support prices. Instead, the market’s inability to capitalize on that window has reinforced the view that short-term conditions have deteriorated. The downward turn in sentiment metrics suggests that traders are increasingly defensive, with reduced risk appetite and lower willingness to add exposure at current levels. As Bitcoin remains capped below key resistance, sentiment dynamics point to a market that is no longer driven by momentum but by caution, uncertainty, and a reassessment of the medium-term outlook. Bitcoin Trades Below Key Cost Bases as Recovery Signals Remain Elusive Bitcoin continues to trade under pressure, with price hovering near the $87,400 level, a zone that analysts view as structurally weak in the short term. According to insights shared by Axel Adler, Bitcoin is currently trading below all major short-term holder realized price benchmarks, highlighting the fragility of recent demand. The closest overhead barrier is the short-term holder, 1-week to 1-month realized price around $90,300, a level now acting as immediate resistance rather than support. Above that, resistance intensifies sharply. A dense supply cluster emerges between $100,400 and $101,500, where the 1-month to 3-month short-term holder realized price converges with the aggregate short-term holder realized price. This zone also aligns closely with the 365-day simple moving average near $101,800, reinforcing its importance as a longer-term inflection area. Additional moving average resistance is positioned even higher, with the 111-day and 200-day SMAs near $104,300 and $107,900, respectively. Trading below short-term holder cost bases implies that the most recent buyers are sitting on unrealized losses. As a result, relief rallies toward breakeven levels risk triggering renewed selling. For market conditions to improve meaningfully, Bitcoin would need to reclaim and hold above the $90,000 area. Until then, the absence of strong spot demand leaves the market exposed to further downside, despite long-term support anchored near the aggregate realized price at $56,300. Price Pulls Back to Key Weekly Support: Trend Structure Is Tested Bitcoin is consolidating near the $87,700 level on the weekly chart, following a sharp rejection from the $110,000–$115,000 region earlier this cycle. The chart shows a clear loss of momentum after the parabolic advance that defined most of 2024 and early 2025, with price now correcting toward its rising long-term averages. Notably, Bitcoin is trading just above the weekly 111-day simple moving average, which has historically acted as an important trend gauge during bull market corrections. The pullback has so far remained orderly. Despite several weeks of downside pressure, the price has not broken decisively below the ascending structure that began in late 2023. However, the loss of the faster weekly moving average, combined with lower highs since the peak, suggests that the market is transitioning into a consolidation or corrective phase rather than an immediate trend continuation. Volume dynamics reinforce this view. Selling pressure has increased during down weeks, while recovery attempts have lacked strong follow-through, pointing to cautious positioning among participants. Meanwhile, the 200-day weekly moving average remains far below current levels, underscoring that the broader trend is still intact, albeit stretched. From a structural perspective, holding the $85,000–$88,000 area is critical. A sustained breakdown below this zone would expose deeper downside risk, while stabilization here could allow Bitcoin to build a base before attempting another directional move.

That context explains why crypto market commentator Brad Kimes, widely known on X as Digital Perspectives, reiterated a long-standing message that continues to resonate with many XRP holders: “Never sell your XRP.” His comment was in anticipation of the upcoming XRPL Lending Protocol. Why You Shouldn’t Sell Your XRP The comment from Digital Perspectives was a response to a post from Ed Hennis, a software engineer at Ripple, who recently outlined the upcoming proposal for the XRPL Lending Protocol. The proposal introduces fixed-term, fixed-rate, underwritten credit directly at the protocol level of the XRP Ledger. This approach is interesting because it moves lending away from smart-contract layers into a standardized, protocol-native system governed by validator consensus. Related Reading: Here’s Why The XRP Price Keeps Crashing According to the explanation by Ed Hennis, the proposed loans on the XRPL Lending Protocol are going to be done with structured, clear terms, predictable interest, and explicit authorization, features that real-world institutions expect before committing capital. Therefore, Digital Perspectives’ “never sell” message is a reflection of a longer-term view where holders never sell their XRP and instead use them as collateral for loans. Instead of relying on generalized liquidity pools like most lending protocols, the design of the XRPL Lending Protocol places each loan inside a segregated Single Asset Vault. This structure isolates risk to a specific credit facility and avoids the cross-contamination that has plagued many DeFi lending platforms during periods of market stress. Therefore, the XRPL Lending Protocol reduces execution risk and creates a framework that resembles traditional credit markets more closely than existing crypto lending models. Real-World Applications Of The XRPL Lending Protocol Most decentralized lending systems today depend on heavy overcollateralization to offset volatility and the risk of anonymity. That approach might work for traders, but it is inefficient for real businesses that operate on predictable cash flows and underwritten credit lines. Enterprises are accustomed to borrowing without locking up more capital than the value of the loan itself, and that mismatch has kept many institutions on the sidelines. Related Reading: Ripple Reveals How It’s Hijacking A $16 Trillion Industry Using The XRP Ledger The XRPL’s approach introduces undercollateralized, institutionally underwritten lending alongside existing overcollateralized models. This expands the range of viable borrowers and aligns on-chain credit with how financing actually works in traditional markets. As noted by Hennis, real-world use cases of XRPL’s lending protocol include market makers borrowing XRP/RLUSD for inventory and arbitrage, Payment Service Providers (PSPs) borrowing RLUSD to pre-fund instant merchant payouts, and fintech lenders accessing short-duration working capital. The feature is slated to be available for voting at the end of January 2026. From there, the voting decision is up to validators on the XRP Ledger. Once the lending protocol goes live and XRP begins to play a direct role in institutional credit markets, selling XRP at that stage may be short-sighted.

This massive Trump Media Bitcoin transfer , reported by blockchain tracker Lookonchain, has sent ripples through financial and crypto circles, raising urgent questions about its purpose and the broader implications for political finance in the digital age. What Do We Know About This Trump Media Bitcoin Transfer? The transaction occurred roughly eight hours before public reporting. The funds moved from the presumed Trump Media-linked wallet to a cryptic address beginning with ‘bc1qq’. However, the ultimate purpose remains shrouded in secrecy. Was this a strategic sale, a move to a new custodian, or something else entirely? The lack of clarity is what makes this event so significant. Blockchain’s transparency shows the movement, but its inherent privacy often hides the ‘why’. Why Is This Massive Bitcoin Movement So Significant? This isn’t just another large crypto transaction. The potential link to a high-profile political figure’s business venture adds multiple layers of scrutiny. Firstly, it highlights the growing intersection of major political entities and the volatile cryptocurrency market. Secondly, the sheer scale demands attention. A Trump Media Bitcoin transfer of this magnitude can influence market sentiment and spark regulatory discussions. Consider the key questions this event prompts: Market Impact: Could a potential sale of 2,000 BTC exert selling pressure on Bitcoin’s price? Strategic Motive: Is this related to corporate treasury management, liquidity needs, or portfolio rebalancing? Transparency: What does this say about the visibility of financial movements for entities tied to public figures? Navigating the Murky Waters of Crypto and Politics The incident perfectly illustrates a central tension in cryptocurrency: public ledgers versus private actors. Anyone can see the transaction, but identifying the parties and their intent is challenging. This Trump Media Bitcoin transfer therefore becomes a case study. It forces observers to confront how traditional financial scrutiny applies—or fails to apply—to blockchain-based assets held by politically adjacent companies. For investors and analysts, the event is a reminder: Always verify on-chain data through multiple sources like Lookonchain. Distinguish between observable facts (the transfer) and speculation (the purpose). Consider the broader narrative impact on crypto adoption and regulation. The Unanswered Questions and Lasting Implications Until the entity behind the wallet clarifies the move, speculation will continue. The primary mystery is the fundamental purpose. A sale could indicate a need for fiat currency or a bearish outlook on Bitcoin’s short-term price. A custody change might suggest seeking enhanced security or different financial partners. The silence amplifies the intrigue. Ultimately, this high-profile Trump Media Bitcoin transfer underscores cryptocurrency’s evolving role. Digital assets are now held by diverse institutions, from tech firms to media companies. Their management of these assets is becoming a new frontier for corporate strategy and public accountability. This event may prompt more entities to proactively communicate their crypto treasury strategies to avoid market uncertainty. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How do we know the wallet is linked to Trump Media? A1: Blockchain analytics firms like Lookonchain use clustering techniques to associate wallet addresses with entities. This link is based on their analysis, though official confirmation from Trump Media is pending. Q2: Can the recipient address (bc1qq…) be traced? A2> Blockchain is transparent. Future transactions from that address can be tracked, but identifying the actual owner requires off-chain information, which is often private. Q3: What does a transfer this large mean for Bitcoin’s price? A3: A direct sale on an exchange could create temporary selling pressure. However, if the coins were simply moved to cold storage, the market impact would be neutral. The intent is crucial. Q4: Are transactions like this common for large companies? A4: Yes. Companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy actively manage their Bitcoin treasuries, making large transfers for operational or strategic reasons. The political connection here adds a unique layer of interest. Q5: What should I watch for next? A5> Monitor for any official statement from Trump Media or DJT. Also, watch the recipient address for any further movements that might reveal its purpose, such as deposits to a known exchange wallet. Q6: Does this affect the legitimacy of cryptocurrency? A6> Not directly. It demonstrates that major, newsworthy entities are actively using blockchain networks, reinforcing crypto’s role in modern finance, albeit with ongoing transparency debates.

In doing so, the computing power has become a key resource in aiding blockchain networks. Cloud mining as one of the models where users can take part in this infrastructure even without possessing physical equipment is increasingly becoming the focus of both new and known market players. Fleet Mining has a special Christmas cloud mining event and it is a combination of stable mining production and the element of 2x cashback reward structure. A single account can earn a total of more than $200,000 . through deposit cashback and a contract cashback, which is quite a structured and transparent chance to participate in the event. Why Cloud Mining is So Interesting to Commoners Cloud mining makes it easier to get involved in blockchain infrastructure by eliminating the normal barriers. Users do not have to buy mining machines, control the use of electricity, or take care of technical maintenance. Instead, mining farms are operated on a professional level and the computing power is distributed automatically by the platform. To users who would rather have an unambiguous and manageable model of participation, cloud mining provides: • None of the ownership or care of hardware. • None of the technical set up and operational learning curve. • Daily settlement of profits by automated system functioning. • Clear expenses and clear terms of contract. Fleet Mining also adds to this model by combining renewable energy sources and AI-based computing resources management to aid in the reduction of overheads in operations and efficiency. The Benefits of the Fleet Mining Platform Fleet Mining has a big long term international system that is geared towards stability: • There were 97 mining farms implemented in the world which were wind and solar-powered. • More than 3 million mining equipment at a time. • AI-assisted hash power distribution in order to maximize computing efficiency. • Clear cloud mining contracts with automatic settlement per day. This infrastructure facilitates the ability of Fleet Mining to sustain the stable mining production and high-value incentive programs during the large events like Christmas. Christmas Double Cashback Structure The Christmas event will provide a two-stage reward system, in which the users can gain at two phases of engagement. Deposit Cashback The users get an automatic cashback during the period in which they are participating in the event, with a one-time deposit to the account: • $1,000–$4,999: 2% cashback • $5,000–$9,999: 3% cashback • $10,000–$29,999: 6% cashback • $30,000–$99,999: 13% cashback • $100,000 and above: up to 20% cashback Increased deposit levels offer more initial value which facilitates increased mining capacity in the beginning. Contract Cashback Besides deposit bonuses, users may get an add-on cashback contract-based: • Cashback on contracts can be up to $50,000 and above. • Increasing contract values will open increasing cashback ratios. • Deposit cashback and contract cashback can be used as standalone and combined. This structure enables one participation to create several reward layers. Example of Reward Stacking The user makes a deposit of $100,000 which is deposited in the Christmas event and earns a maximum of $20,000 as deposit cashback. Additional cashback to the contract is provided after a user buys a valid cloud mining contract. Combination of rewards enhances the effective mining power in relation to the normal periods of participation. Supported Cryptocurrencies Fleet Mining sponsors mining and settlement on a variety of mainstream digital assets, such as: BTC, ETH, XRP, DOGE, USDT, USDC, and BCH. How the Mining Process Works 1. Pay for an account at Fleet Mining . 2. Make a deposit and get a cashback of the same amount automatically. 3. Choose a cloud computing agreement. 4. The AI system of Fleet Mining automatically assigns hash power on-the-fly once it is switched on. 5. Mining is automatic and the profits are settled on a daily basis. Users can also withdraw profits or use them to increase the mining capacity. Other Incentive of participation The referral program of Fleet Mining is still active during the period of Christmas: • Referral commission rate: 4.5% • No limit on referrals • No extra cost of participation. Conclusion The Christmas cloud mining event of Fleet Mining is developed as a structured incentive program but not as a promotion of a short-term character. It is a combination of automated cloud mining, transparent contracts and a two-tier cashback reward system to make its participants have a better and more efficient opportunity to participate in blockchain computing infrastructure throughout the holiday period.

This decision directly impacts trading strategies and portfolio management for users engaged with these markets. Let’s break down what this OKX delist action means, the critical timelines involved, and the essential steps every affected trader must take. What Exactly Is OKX Delisting? OKX has officially stated that it will remove the DEGEN/USDT and CETUS/USDT perpetual futures trading pairs from its platform. The delisting is scheduled for 8:00 a.m. UTC on December 26. Perpetual futures are popular derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on an asset’s future price without an expiry date. Therefore, this OKX delist means all open positions for these specific contracts must be closed or settled before the deadline. Why Would an Exchange Delist Futures Contracts? Exchanges like OKX periodically review their listed products. The decision to delist perpetual futures for DEGEN and CETUS likely stems from a combination of factors designed to maintain a healthy trading ecosystem. Common reasons include: Low Liquidity: When trading volume for a contract dries up, it can lead to poor price execution and increased risk for traders. Risk Management: Exchanges must manage their overall exposure. Volatile or less-established tokens can pose higher systemic risks. Strategic Refocus: Platforms often streamline offerings to concentrate resources on markets with stronger user demand. While OKX has not specified the exact reason, such delist actions are a standard part of exchange operations to ensure market integrity. Key Dates and Immediate Actions for Traders Time is of the essence. The clock is ticking toward the December 26 cutoff. Here is your actionable checklist: Mark Your Calendar: All trading for DEGEN/USDT and CETUS/USDT perpetual futures will halt at 8:00 a.m. UTC on Dec. 26. Close Open Positions: You must actively close any open long or short positions in these contracts before the deadline. Do not wait for automatic settlement. Cancel Open Orders: Remember to cancel any pending limit or stop orders tied to these futures pairs to avoid unexpected execution attempts. Withdraw Funds: After closing positions, you can withdraw your USDT margin from the futures account if desired. Ignoring this OKX delist notice could lead to the exchange automatically settling your position at the mark price, which may not align with your trading strategy. What Does This Mean for DEGEN and CETUS Tokens? It’s crucial to understand that this delist action applies specifically to the perpetual futures derivatives on OKX. As of this announcement: The underlying DEGEN and CETUS tokens may still be available for spot trading on OKX and other exchanges. The decision primarily affects leverage traders and does not necessarily reflect on the fundamental value of the tokens themselves. Traders should monitor official channels of both OKX and the token projects for any further updates. However, the removal of a major derivatives market can sometimes impact spot market sentiment and liquidity, so staying informed is key. Navigating the Aftermath and Protecting Your Portfolio This event serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic nature of crypto markets. To safeguard your investments, consider these insights: Diversify Across Exchanges: Avoid concentrating all derivative trading on a single platform. Stay Alert to Notices: Regularly check the announcements section of any exchange you use. This OKX delist was posted on their official website. Have an Exit Strategy: Always know how you will exit a derivatives position, especially in less liquid markets. Proactive management is your best defense against unexpected exchange actions. Final Summary: A Proactive Approach is Essential The decision by OKX to delist perpetual futures for DEGEN and CETUS is a clear operational update that requires immediate attention from involved traders. By understanding the reasons, adhering strictly to the December 26 deadline, and managing your positions proactively, you can navigate this change smoothly. Always prioritize risk management and use official exchange communications as your primary source of truth in the fast-evolving world of crypto derivatives. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade DEGEN and CETUS on OKX after December 26? A1: This delisting only affects the specific DEGEN/USDT and CETUS/USDT perpetual futures contracts. You will need to check OKX’s spot market listings to see if the tokens are still available for regular trading. Q2: What happens if I forget to close my position before the deadline? A2: OKX will likely settle all remaining open positions at the mark price around the delisting time. This automatic settlement may result in a price less favorable than if you had actively closed the position yourself. Q3: Will this delisting affect the price of DEGEN and CETUS tokens on other exchanges? A3: While the direct impact is on OKX’s futures market, reduced trading avenues can sometimes influence overall market sentiment and liquidity for a token. It’s wise to monitor the broader market reaction. Q4: Are other exchanges likely to delist these futures contracts too? A4: Not necessarily. Each exchange makes independent listing decisions based on its own criteria. There is no automatic chain reaction, but it’s a good practice to check announcements from other platforms where you trade. Q5: Is my funds safe during this delisting process? A5: Yes, your funds are safe. The process involves closing your derivative contract positions. Any remaining margin (USDT) in your futures account will remain yours to withdraw or use for other trades. Q6: Where can I find the official OKX announcement? A6: The official notice is posted on the OKX website under their announcements or support section. Always rely on these official channels for the most accurate and timely information.

The institutional investor, believed to be a subsidiary of LD Capital, acquired an additional 6,379 ETH worth approximately $130 million through a leveraged loan. This bold Trend Research ETH purchase strategy reveals much about institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential, even during challenging market conditions. Why Is Trend Research Doubling Down on ETH? The latest Trend Research ETH purchase represents a continuation of an accumulation strategy that began last November when Ethereum traded around $3,400. According to reports from AmberCN, the entity now holds a staggering 580,000 ETH valued at $1.72 billion. What makes this transaction particularly noteworthy is the context: Trend Research currently faces an unrealized loss of approximately $141 million on its existing holdings. This raises important questions about institutional investment psychology in cryptocurrency markets. Why would an experienced investor increase exposure to an asset showing paper losses? The answer likely involves several strategic considerations: Long-term conviction in Ethereum’s fundamental value proposition Dollar-cost averaging strategy during price corrections Portfolio rebalancing to maintain target allocations Leveraged positioning to amplify potential upside Understanding the $141 Million Unrealized Loss An unrealized loss represents paper losses that haven’t been locked in through selling. For Trend Research, this $141 million figure reflects the difference between their average purchase price and current market value. However, institutional investors often view such metrics differently than retail traders. Seasoned investors understand that volatility creates both risk and opportunity. The substantial Trend Research ETH purchase during a downturn suggests they see current prices as attractive entry points rather than reasons for concern. This perspective aligns with traditional investment wisdom about buying quality assets during market fear. The Leveraged Loan Strategy Explained Trend Research executed this latest Trend Research ETH purchase using a leveraged loan structure. This approach allows investors to: Amplify purchasing power without liquidating other positions Maintain exposure to potential upside while managing cash flow Potentially benefit from tax advantages in certain jurisdictions Implement sophisticated portfolio management strategies However, leverage introduces additional risks, particularly in volatile cryptocurrency markets. Margin calls and forced liquidations become concerns during sharp price declines. Trend Research’s willingness to employ leverage despite existing paper losses demonstrates remarkable confidence in their market thesis. What This Means for Ethereum’s Market Structure Large-scale institutional accumulation like the Trend Research ETH purchase significantly impacts market dynamics in several ways: First, it reduces circulating supply as ETH moves from exchanges to long-term holding addresses. Second, it establishes stronger support levels as institutional buyers provide consistent demand. Third, it signals to other market participants that sophisticated investors see value at current prices. This accumulation pattern suggests institutions are positioning for what they believe will be the next major market cycle. Their actions often precede broader market movements, making such transactions important indicators for attentive observers. Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors The Trend Research ETH purchase offers valuable lessons for investors of all sizes: Institutional time horizons differ significantly from retail traders Paper losses don’t necessarily trigger panic selling among experienced investors Strategic accumulation during downturns can build substantial positions Leverage represents a double-edged sword requiring careful management Most importantly, this transaction reinforces that cryptocurrency markets continue maturing, with institutional players implementing sophisticated strategies previously reserved for traditional assets. Conclusion: A Bold Bet on Ethereum’s Future The latest Trend Research ETH purchase demonstrates that conviction often outweighs short-term paper losses in institutional cryptocurrency investing. While the $141 million unrealized loss seems staggering, Trend Research’s response—doubling down with another $130 million purchase—speaks volumes about their long-term outlook. This move highlights the growing sophistication of cryptocurrency markets and the strategic approaches institutional investors bring to the space. As Ethereum continues evolving with technological upgrades and expanding use cases, accumulation by entities like Trend Research suggests they anticipate substantial future value creation. Frequently Asked Questions What is Trend Research? Trend Research is believed to be a subsidiary of LD Capital, an institutional investment firm active in cryptocurrency markets. They focus on research-driven investment strategies in blockchain and digital assets. Why would anyone buy more of an asset showing losses? Experienced investors often increase positions during price declines if they believe the asset’s long-term fundamentals remain strong. This strategy, called dollar-cost averaging, can lower average purchase prices over time. What is an unrealized loss? An unrealized loss represents a decrease in an investment’s value that hasn’t been locked in through selling. It’s a “paper loss” that could reverse if prices recover. How does a leveraged loan work for crypto purchases? A leveraged loan allows investors to borrow funds to purchase more assets than their cash would normally allow. This amplifies both potential gains and losses. Does this large purchase guarantee Ethereum’s price will rise? No single transaction guarantees price movement. However, substantial institutional accumulation typically indicates strong conviction and can influence market sentiment and structure. Should retail investors follow Trend Research’s strategy? Retail investors should never blindly follow institutional strategies. Their risk tolerance, time horizons, and portfolio structures differ significantly from most individual investors.

The S&P 500 closed at a record on Tuesday after an upward revision to third-quarter GDP showed annualised growth of 4.3%, a report that also pushed bond yields higher and kept growth stocks in demand. In crypto, Bitfinex analysts said Bitcoin has bounced decisively from the low $80,000 support zone identified earlier. “However, the recovery now faces a substantial headwind in the form of a dense overhead supply cluster accumulated by top buyers between $94,000 and $120,000,” they added. “This concentration of supply has created a distinctly top-heavy market structure, where rebound attempts are increasingly capped by sell pressure. This dynamic is reminiscent of early 2022, when recoveries during the initial stages of a bearish phase repeatedly failed to gain traction.” MSCI’s regional gauge of Asia Pacific stocks extended gains into a fourth straight session, rising about 0.2% at the open.

Fed Leadership Uncertainty Keeps Markets On Edge On the policy front, Trump has also kept markets guessing about the next Federal Reserve chair, repeating that he wants a rate cutter in place as he nears an announcement. In Asia, investors tracked signals out of Beijing and New Delhi, where the Reserve Bank of India moved to ease tight conditions with fresh liquidity measures that include bond purchases and a dollar rupee swap.

This action, reported by on-chain analytics platform The Data Nerd, involves 5.68 million ETHFI being withdrawn from the Ether.fi liquid staking protocol. For investors and market watchers, this raises immediate questions about the fund’s strategy and the potential implications for the ETHFI ecosystem. What Does It Mean When Arrington Capital Unstakes ETHFI? When a major institutional player like Arrington Capital makes a move, the market takes notice. The transaction, executed roughly five hours before the report, represents a substantial shift of assets. Unstaking typically involves converting a liquid staking derivative, like ETHFI, back into its underlying asset or moving it to another platform. This action by Arrington Capital could signal several things: a routine portfolio rebalance, a strategic shift in their DeFi exposure, or a response to changing market conditions surrounding ETHFI. Understanding the ETHFI and Ether.fi Ecosystem To grasp why this move matters, you need to understand the players. Ether.fi is a leading liquid staking protocol on Ethereum. It allows users to stake their ETH and receive a liquid token, eTH, in return, which can be used across other DeFi applications. ETHFI is the native governance token of the Ether.fi ecosystem. Therefore, when Arrington Capital unstakes ETHFI, it is moving a significant amount of governance and utility tokens tied to this specific protocol. Liquid Staking: Allows staked assets to remain “liquid” and usable elsewhere. Governance Tokens: Like ETHFI, grant holders voting rights on protocol decisions. Institutional Activity: Large moves can influence token perception and liquidity. Why Would a Hedge Fund Like Arrington Capital Unstake? Analyzing the potential reasons behind Arrington Capital’s decision to unstake provides crucial context. Hedge funds operate with specific risk-reward frameworks. Their decision to unstake ETHFI could be driven by profit-taking after a price increase, reallocating capital to new opportunities, or adjusting to revised risk assessments of the liquid staking sector. It is not necessarily a negative signal but a calculated maneuver reflective of their investment thesis. The Broader Impact on ETHFI and Liquid Staking So, what could this mean for the average ETHFI holder or someone interested in liquid staking? Large unstaking events can temporarily increase selling pressure on the token. However, they also highlight the mature, liquid nature of the market where institutions can enter and exit sizable positions. The fact that Arrington Capital was staking with Ether.fi in the first place underscores institutional confidence in the protocol’s infrastructure. The key takeaway is to monitor the fund’s next move—do they sell, hold, or redeploy the capital? Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Watching whales like Arrington Capital is educational, but how should you react? First, avoid panic. Institutional moves are one data point among many. Second, use tools like The Data Nerd to track on-chain flows yourself. Third, consider the fundamentals of the project—has anything changed with Ether.fi’s technology or roadmap? The decision by Arrington Capital to unstake ETHFI is a case study in portfolio management, not a direct investment signal for retail. In conclusion, the move by Arrington Capital to unstake $4 million in ETHFI is a noteworthy event in the DeFi landscape. It demonstrates the active role institutions play in governance token economies and the liquidity of modern staking protocols. While it may cause short-term speculation, the long-term health of projects like Ether.fi depends on adoption and utility, not single transactions. Observing these flows is essential for a complete market picture. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Arrington Capital? A1: Arrington Capital is a well-known cryptocurrency and blockchain-focused hedge fund founded by tech investor Michael Arrington. Q2: What does “unstaking” ETHFI mean? A2: Unstaking ETHFI refers to the process of withdrawing the ETHFI tokens from a staking contract or protocol, like Ether.fi, making them liquid and transferable again. Q3: Does Arrington Capital unstaking ETHFI mean they are selling it? A3: Not necessarily. Unstaking simply means moving the tokens out of the staking contract. They could be moving them to a different wallet, holding them, or preparing to sell. The action itself does not confirm a sale. Q4: How can I track moves like this myself? A4: You can use on-chain analytics platforms and blockchain explorers (like Etherscan) to track large wallet transactions tagged to known entities. Q5: What is Ether.fi? A5: Ether.fi is a decentralized, non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on Ethereum that allows users to earn staking rewards while maintaining liquidity. Q6: Should I unstake my ETHFI because Arrington Capital did? A6: You should not make investment decisions based solely on the actions of a single entity. Always conduct your own research (DYOR) and consider your individual investment strategy and risk tolerance. Found this analysis of Arrington Capital’s move insightful? The world of crypto moves fast, and sharing knowledge helps everyone navigate it better.

56268889,648061,1766545226,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56268889.jpeg,"Here’s How Many Transactions XRP Must Process To Reach A $2,000 Price Tag",https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-to-reach-a-2000-price-tag/,"Crypto analyst Rob Cunningham has detailed the conditions and how many transactions XRP would need to handle to reach a $2,000 valuation. He explained that the token must process sovereign-scale settlement volumes and eliminate liquidity stress to achieve its full potential. The Transaction Threshold For A $2,000 XRP In a rather lengthy X post this Monday, Cunningham outlined a new framework for understanding XRP’s potential price trajectory. He emphasized that the most important question for cryptocurrency is the price at which it eliminates pre-funding, slippage, and liquidity stress for sovereign-scale settlement . The analyst evaluated this using metrics such as global settlement volume , order-book depth, central-bank-scale transaction sizing, and the need to avoid balance-sheet drag. According to his analysis, the minimum clean operating range for XRP lies between $1,500 and $3,000 per coin. At a $2,000 valuation, XRP’s network would need to hold $200 trillion in value and process up to $2 quadrillion in daily transactions with a tenfold velocity. Cunningham described XRP at the $2,000 level as a rail , a reserve, and a unit of account bridge . He stated that if the cryptocurrency could achieve this valuation, liquidity would effectively become invisible, and the cost of capital could approach zero, making XRP function more like energy than conventional money. The analyst also asserted that beyond the $1,500 to $3,000 range, XRP ceases to be “priced” in conventional terms and is instead evaluated based on its functional utility. He declared that XRP would reprice faster than any other asset in history. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, which usually move based on earnings, narratives, or market cycles, XRP would be repriced like infrastructure—fast, violent, and discolored. Analyst Compares XRP Move To Oil Discovery And Predicts Explosive Rally In his analysis, Cunningham also predicted that XRP’s price will eventually be driven by its structural role rather than typical market factors. He explained that once the market recognizes Ripple Labs and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as essential to global settlements, three key dynamics could kick in simultaneously. First, it could optionally collapse as XRP stops being one of many cryptocurrencies and becomes a required input. Second, the future value could exceed the present value . Third, the “float” becomes functionally illiquid, as long-term holders remain firm and institutions must acquire XRP regardless of price. The analyst has compared this rare combination of factors to oil discoveries, wars, shifts in reserve currency, or recognition of monopoly infrastructure. The analyst also outlined a three-phase acceleration pattern for XRP, emphasizing that the token’s growth would occur in leaps, with rapid bursts of 3X to 10X. The first phase, Recognition Shock, could last weeks to three months, triggered by clear regulatory finality and treasury-level integration . The second phase, Future Value Compression, may last three to twelve months as the market prices XRP to prevent scarcity . The final phase, Infrastructure Pricing, could span one to three years, with XRP no longer priced but managed.",XRP|Recognition Shock|ripple|ripple labs|Rob Cunningham|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-24 03:00:26

After reaching a historic all-time high in November 2024, the network has struggled to reclaim its former momentum. This loss of momentum reflects technical exhaustion and a market recalibration after an aggressive run-up. Thus, SOL has entered a new phase as investors assess whether fresh demand can emerge or if the network needs a new catalyst to reassert leadership. How Solana Momentum Fades After The November Peak Crypto trader Ardi has revealed on X that market interest has noticeably thinned ever since Solana set its $296 all-time high in November 2024. On-chain data has shown that buying pressure has been dominated almost by the retail-sized wallets, particularly those making purchases between $0 and $1,000. Related Reading: Solana Faces Critical Test Near $100 as Macro Pressure and Network Upgrades Collide Ardi argues that while many observers point to micro conditions to explain the stalled price action, the tape reveals that the distribution has begun before the peak. The selling volume had already been accelerating for months before October 10, signaling that major players were planning their exits long before the drawdown. The data also confirms a massive divergence between demographics. Meanwhile, the mid-sized wallets involving $0 to $100,000, and the institutional-sized wallets involving $100,000 to $10 million in volume have been in a steady downtrend for roughly 13 months. Over the same period, retail wallets have shown a consistent uptrend, and are clearly convinced that SOL is still trading at a deep discount price. This imbalance leads to the ultimate question: Is Solana’s value now intrinsically tied to memecoins? The correlation between SOL’s demand and the memecoin actively on the network has been near-perfect, which means that without the frenzy of the meme sector, most bids would largely be disinterested. What Comes After Memes Will Decide Solana’s Future An investor and trader, Jas pointed out that 2025 has definitely been a reset for Solana, but it isn’t over for the altcoin. SOL active monthly traders have fallen from roughly 30 million to under 1 million, a staggering 97% drop in network activity. The speculative engine was the memecoin boom that fueled its rise and also exposed its biggest vulnerability. Related Reading: Solana at a Breaking Point: Fading Memecoin Hype and Alameda Unlocks Test the $140 Support Zone Furthermore, SOL is down nearly 58% from its yearly high. SOL’s network revenue dropped fivefold year-over-year from $2.5 billion in 2024 to $500 million in 2025. The contrast with Ethereum is hard to ignore, and ETH generated $1.4 billion in revenue this year and outperformed SOL by 56% year-to-date. “SOL’s future may depend less on memes and more on what follows them,” Jas noted.

That’s the staggering reality revealed by security firm CertiK in their latest report. This massive loss highlights critical vulnerabilities that every crypto investor and developer needs to understand immediately. What’s Causing These Massive Web3 Security Breaches? CertiK’s analysis reveals a disturbing trend in Web3 security. Hackers have shifted their focus from individual protocol vulnerabilities to systemic weaknesses. The numbers tell a sobering story: $3.35 billion lost through various security incidents across the blockchain space. This represents more than just stolen funds. It reflects fundamental challenges in how we secure decentralized systems. The report indicates that traditional security approaches are no longer sufficient against sophisticated attackers targeting the Web3 infrastructure itself. Why Are Supply Chain Attacks So Devastating? The most alarming finding concerns supply chain attacks. These accounted for approximately half of all losses, totaling $1.45 billion. But what exactly makes these attacks so effective and dangerous? Systemic vulnerability : Attackers target services used by multiple companies Amplified damage : A single breach can compromise numerous projects Difficult detection : These attacks often go unnoticed until it’s too late The Bybit hack in February serves as a prime example. This wasn’t just about one exchange’s security failure. It demonstrated how weaknesses in shared infrastructure can create ripple effects throughout the entire Web3 security landscape. How Is AI Changing the Phishing Game? CertiK’s report contains another crucial warning about artificial intelligence. Hackers now use AI to create sophisticated phishing sites and messages that are nearly indistinguishable from legitimate communications. This represents a new frontier in Web3 security threats. Traditional phishing detection methods struggle against AI-generated content. These systems can create personalized messages, mimic official communication styles perfectly, and adapt their approaches based on user responses. The implications for Web3 security are profound and concerning. What Can You Do to Protect Your Assets? While the numbers are alarming, there are practical steps everyone can take to improve their Web3 security posture. Understanding these threats is the first step toward better protection. Verify everything : Double-check URLs, email addresses, and communication sources Use hardware wallets : Keep significant assets in cold storage whenever possible Stay informed : Follow security updates from projects you invest in Enable multi-factor authentication : Add extra layers to all your accounts Remember that Web3 security isn’t just about technology. It’s about developing healthy skepticism and verification habits. The most sophisticated security systems can still fail if users don’t practice basic safety measures. The Future of Web3 Security: What Needs to Change? The $3.35 billion loss represents a wake-up call for the entire industry. Web3 security must evolve from reactive patchwork to proactive, systemic protection. This requires collaboration across projects, better security standards, and increased user education. Developers need to prioritize security from the ground up. Investors must demand transparency about security practices. The industry as a whole needs to share threat intelligence and develop collective defense mechanisms. Only through coordinated effort can we strengthen Web3 security against these sophisticated threats. The CertiK report delivers a clear message: Web3 security is at a critical juncture. While the technology promises decentralization and financial freedom, these benefits mean nothing without robust protection. The $3.35 billion lost this year represents both a warning and an opportunity. It’s time for the industry to mature its security practices before more value disappears into the digital void. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is a supply chain attack in Web3 security? A supply chain attack targets services or infrastructure components used by multiple companies. Instead of hacking individual protocols, attackers compromise shared tools, libraries, or service providers, creating widespread damage across many projects simultaneously. How does AI make phishing more dangerous for Web3 users? AI can generate highly convincing phishing content that mimics legitimate communications perfectly. It can create personalized messages, adapt to user responses, and bypass traditional detection methods that look for specific patterns or errors. Are decentralized platforms inherently less secure? Not inherently, but they face different security challenges. While decentralization eliminates single points of failure, it also distributes security responsibility. This requires users to be more vigilant and projects to implement stronger security measures throughout their ecosystems. What should I look for in a Web3 project’s security practices? Look for regular security audits by reputable firms, transparent reporting of incidents, bug bounty programs, and clear communication about security updates. Projects should also have incident response plans and insurance where appropriate. Can hardware wallets protect against all Web3 security threats? Hardware wallets provide excellent protection against many threats, particularly those involving private key theft. However, they don’t protect against all Web3 security risks, such as smart contract vulnerabilities or protocol-level attacks on the networks themselves. How often should I review my Web3 security practices? Review your security practices at least quarterly, or whenever you hear about major security incidents. Regular updates to software, password changes, and security setting reviews should become routine habits for anyone involved in Web3. Found this Web3 security analysis valuable?

According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT market, BTC is currently trading at $86,977.44. This sudden movement has sent ripples through the digital asset space, prompting investors to ask: what’s driving this decline, and is it a temporary dip or the start of a larger trend? What Caused the Bitcoin Price to Fall Below $87,000? Market analysts point to several converging factors for today’s Bitcoin price action. First, broader macroeconomic concerns have resurfaced, with uncertainty around interest rate policies creating risk-off sentiment across all asset classes. Secondly, significant sell pressure emerged from a cluster of large wallet addresses, often referred to as ‘whales,’ moving coins to exchanges. This typically signals an intent to sell and can trigger automated stop-loss orders, accelerating the downward momentum. Furthermore, technical indicators had been flashing warnings. The $87,000 level had acted as strong support in recent weeks. However, once this level broke, it transformed into a resistance zone, inviting more selling. The move highlights the volatile nature of crypto markets, where sentiment can shift rapidly based on technical breaks and on-chain data. Is This a Buying Opportunity or a Warning Sign? For seasoned traders, a pullback in the Bitcoin price presents a classic dilemma. Is this a healthy correction within a longer bull market, or a sign of deeper weakness? Let’s break down the perspectives. The Bull Case: Corrections are normal and necessary. They shake out weak hands and allow the market to consolidate before its next leg up. Key long-term fundamentals, like institutional adoption through ETFs and the upcoming halving event, remain intact. The Bear Case: The break of a major support level like $87,000 is technically bearish. It could indicate that the recent rally was overextended and that further downside toward $84,000 or lower is possible before finding a true bottom. Therefore, your strategy depends entirely on your investment horizon. Short-term traders might see volatility, while long-term holders may view this as a chance to accumulate at a slightly lower cost. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Navigating such market moves requires a clear plan. Here are some immediate steps to consider. Review Your Portfolio Allocation: Ensure your exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies aligns with your overall risk tolerance. A sharp drop is a good reminder to check your asset allocation. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Fear of missing out (FOMO) on rallies and fear of further loss during dips are the two biggest enemies of rational investing. Stick to your predefined strategy. Monitor Key Levels: Watch how the market reacts around the $86,500 and $85,000 levels. A strong bounce could signal resilience, while a break lower may indicate more pain ahead. Remember, the Bitcoin price is influenced by a complex mix of technicals, macroeconomics, and on-chain flows. No single factor tells the whole story. Conclusion: Navigating Market Volatility with Confidence Today’s drop in the Bitcoin price below $87,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the cryptocurrency market’s inherent volatility. While unsettling, these movements are part of its DNA. The key for investors is not to predict every swing but to understand the underlying forces and maintain a disciplined approach. By focusing on long-term trends, sound risk management, and the fundamental value proposition of decentralized digital assets, you can navigate these dips with greater confidence and clarity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why did Bitcoin’s price drop suddenly? The drop is likely due to a combination of technical selling after breaking the $87,000 support level, increased sell orders from large holders, and a cautious broader market sentiment. Should I sell my Bitcoin now? This is a personal decision based on your investment goals and risk tolerance. Panic selling during a dip often locks in losses. Many investors use these periods to reassess their strategy rather than make impulsive moves. How low could the Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact price levels is impossible. However, traders often watch previous support zones, like $85,000 or $84,000, to gauge where buying interest might return. Is this the end of the Bitcoin bull market? A single-day drop does not define a bull or bear market. Bull markets are characterized by higher highs and higher lows over a sustained period. This could simply be a correction within that larger trend. What is the best thing to do during a price drop? The best action is often to do nothing rash. Review your original investment thesis, ensure you are not over-leveraged, and consider if your long-term outlook has changed. For some, it may be a strategic buying opportunity. Where can I get reliable Bitcoin price information? Use reputable aggregate sites or data from major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken for real-time prices. Always cross-reference information. Found this analysis of the Bitcoin price movement helpful? Market insights are best when shared.

Its tiered access and strategic whitelist offer a chance to secure tokens at the lowest entry level, setting the stage for potential exponential growth before broader market momentum kicks in. Hesitation could mean missing the jump entirely. While Apeing gears up for its moment, Bitcoin continues to set the stage as the market anchor. With large institutional moves and strategic liquidity injections, BTC provides the foundation on which altcoins like Apeing can rally. Meanwhile, Cardano refines its vision, rolling out enterprise integrations and privacy-focused upgrades to strengthen its ecosystem. Together, these three playmakers create a backdrop where early action matters more than ever. Why Apeing Is the Spotlight of the Best Upcoming Crypto Scene Apeing stands out in the crowded altcoin arena, making it one of the best upcoming crypto opportunities for 2025. Its unique tiered approach ensures early participants access Stage 1 at a fraction of the listing price, giving both small-scale traders and serious investors a clear advantage. By using a whitelist, Apeing reduces chaotic public-entry competition, letting strategic participants maximize gains before the wider market hype fully kicks in. The narrative driving Apeing is simple but powerful. While others endlessly debate charts and indicators, Apeing rewards instinctive, timely action. Historical patterns in crypto confirm that those who act first, taking bold yet measured steps, often capture outsized returns. Its combination of structured early access, active community engagement, and market readiness cements Apeing as more than hype; it’s a calculated opportunity in the best upcoming crypto space. Bitcoin Holds the Fort: Institutional Moves Shape Market Momentum Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem, trading near $87,908.77 with a market cap of $1.755 trillion. Approximately 19.97 million BTC are in circulation out of a maximum of 21 million, emphasizing scarcity and long-term value. Daily trading volumes hover around $36.16 billion, reflecting consistent activity from both retail and institutional investors. Its dominance ensures that market sentiment often pivots around BTC’s movements, creating a reference point for altcoins and shaping overall liquidity and investor confidence. Recent institutional strategies underscore Bitcoin’s role as a market anchor. Several firms have paused fresh BTC acquisitions, redirecting $748 million into dividend reserves, signaling a focus on accumulation rather than immediate trading. This careful, strategic approach stabilizes the broader market, providing predictability that benefits the entire crypto ecosystem. Investors interpret these moves as long-term confidence in BTC’s fundamentals, reinforcing its reputation as a reliable store of digital capital amid volatile market conditions. Cardano Shapes the Future: Upgrades and Enterprise Momentum Cardano continues its research-driven expansion, trading at roughly $0.366 with a 24-hour volume of $537 million. The network emphasizes enterprise adoption, proof-of-stake efficiency, and privacy-enhancing protocols, positioning itself as a strong Layer 1 contender. Active community participation strengthens governance and ecosystem development, supporting projects that aim for real-world impact. These strategic focuses make Cardano a blockchain that balances sustainability with technological innovation, attracting developers and enterprises while maintaining network security and scalability. Recent announcements highlight Cardano’s commitment to practical applications and ecosystem growth. By integrating tier-1 stablecoins and advancing privacy-focused projects like Midnight, the network broadens DeFi and enterprise capabilities. These developments solidify Cardano’s long-term roadmap, enhancing investor confidence in its scalability, governance, and adoption potential. As the blockchain matures, its focus on real-world utility, energy efficiency, and technological upgrades ensures that Cardano remains a sustainable and forward-thinking platform in the competitive Layer 1 landscape. Stage Importance: Why Early Access Matters In the world of crypto, timing is everything. Stage 1 of Apeing provides the lowest entry tier, offering participants tokens at $0.0001 before broader market exposure. Early entry often means immediate upside once the coin lists at $0.001, delivering a potential 10× return before wider momentum builds. Understanding these stages is crucial for those looking to maximize gains and avoid public-sale chaos. Stage-based access also aligns incentives with community engagement. Participants gain not only financial exposure but also a sense of strategic positioning. This approach prevents reckless market behavior and creates a loyal base of early adopters ready to support long-term project growth, making Apeing a standout in the competitive landscape of the best upcoming crypto.

The price is trading below $2,950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a rising channel with support at $2,980 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it settles below the $2,880 zone. Ethereum Price Faces Rejection Ethereum price failed to stay above the $3,000 pivot level and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin . ETH price dipped below $2,980 to enter a bearish zone. The bears were able to push the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,775 swing low to the $3,075 high. Besides, there was a break below a rising channel with support at $2,980 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,980 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

The first key resistance is near the $3,000 level. The next major resistance is near the $3,050 level. A clear move above the $3,050 resistance might send the price toward the $3,120 resistance. An upside break above the $3,120 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,200 resistance zone or even $3,220 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,000 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,880 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,775 swing low to the $3,075 high. The first major support sits near the $2,845 zone. A clear move below the $2,845 support might push the price toward the $2,800 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,775 region.

XRP Positive/Negative Sentiment Has Gone Down In a new post on X, analytics firm Santiment has discussed about the latest trend in the Positive/Negative Sentiment for XRP. This indicator measures the ratio between the positive and negative comments related to the asset that are appearing on the major social media platforms. The metric works by going through social media posts/comments/threads to separate for those making mentions of the cryptocurrency and putting them through a machine-learning model. This model classifies each post as “positive” or “negative.” The indicator counts up the number of comments in each category and finds the ratio between them. Related Reading: Bitcoin Perps Heat Up Again As Leveraged Longs Rise When the value of the Positive/Negative Sentiment is greater than 1, it means posts pertaining to a bullish sentiment are dominant on social media. On the other hand, the metric being under the threshold implies a bearish mentality is shared by the majority of users on these platforms. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the XRP Positive/Negative Sentiment over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP Positive/Negative Sentiment saw a huge spike earlier in the month, implying positive comments related to the coin shot up on social media platforms. What followed this burst of optimism among retail traders, however, was a drop in the cryptocurrency’s price. This pattern of the asset going against the crowd expectations is something that has been witnessed in digital asset markets throughout history. Based on the historical trend, the analytics firm has defined regions where the likelihood of a reversal move becomes notable. The positive sentiment spike witnessed earlier in the year broke into the “greed zone,” corresponding to the area where price corrections tend to happen. Since the plunge in the XRP price, sentiment among retail social media users has deteriorated fast, with the Positive/Negative Sentiment plummeting all the way to a value of 1.01. At this value, bearish comments aren’t dominant yet, but the fact that negative posts are balancing out the positive ones is still something to take note of. In fact, this value is firmly inside Santiment’s “fear zone,” implying that the current degree of bearish sentiment is already significant.

XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $1.90, down 1.3% over the last 24 hours.

Headlines erupted, and the crypto community cheered. However, a crucial reality check hides behind this dazzling nominal figure. When you adjust for inflation, the inflation-adjusted BTC price tells a different, more sobering story. According to a detailed analysis, Bitcoin’s real value hasn’t yet breached the $100,000 barrier. Why does this gap exist, and what does it mean for your investment strategy? What is the Real Inflation-adjusted BTC Price? Alex Thorn, Head of Research at Galaxy Digital, applied a critical lens to Bitcoin’s headline number. By benchmarking the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) to 2020 and adjusting Bitcoin’s price accordingly, he calculated the asset’s true purchasing power. The result? Bitcoin’s real, inflation-adjusted all-time high sits at $99,848. This means the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar has eroded so significantly that today’s record high doesn’t buy as much as it seemingly should. Why Your Dollar Buys Less: The Silent Tax of Inflation To understand the inflation-adjusted BTC price , you must first grasp inflation’s relentless effect. Since 2020, the real purchasing power of the U.S. dollar has fallen by approximately 20%. Think of it this way: The Same Basket Costs More: What $100 bought in 2020 now requires about $120. CPI as the Benchmark: The government uses the CPI to track the average price change of a basket of consumer goods and services. A 20% Erosion: This decline is the “silent tax” that diminishes the value of cash holdings over time. Therefore, a nominal price record doesn’t automatically translate to a real-value record. The inflation-adjusted BTC price cuts through the noise to show the asset’s strength against this erosion. How Do We Calculate the True Bitcoin Value? The calculation is straightforward but powerful. Analysts take Bitcoin’s nominal price and adjust it downward to reflect the dollar’s lost purchasing power. They use monthly CPI data from 2020 to the present. For instance, if the CPI shows a 20% increase since the base year, a $126,000 Bitcoin today has the equivalent purchasing power of roughly $105,000 in 2020 dollars. The fact that the adjusted figure is below $100,000 highlights how substantial inflation has been. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Investors? This analysis is not meant to spread fear but to foster clarity. Understanding the inflation-adjusted BTC price provides a more accurate benchmark for success. Here are the key takeaways: Context Over Hype: It separates nominal price hype from genuine purchasing power growth. A Sturdier Benchmark: The $100,000 level becomes a more meaningful psychological and financial target to watch. Long-Term Perspective: It reinforces Bitcoin’s narrative as a hedge against currency debasement. The very need for this adjustment proves why such an asset is valuable. Essentially, Bitcoin’s journey to a true, inflation-smashing high is still underway. The next major headline should be when the inflation-adjusted BTC price decisively crosses the $100,000 threshold. The Compelling Conclusion: Look Beyond the Nominal Number Bitcoin’s surge to $126,000 is an undeniable testament to its growing adoption and market strength. However, the wise investor looks deeper. The inflation-adjusted BTC price reveals that in terms of real-world purchasing power, Bitcoin’s peak is still ahead. This perspective doesn’t diminish Bitcoin’s achievement; it reframes it. It highlights the relentless pressure of inflation and sets a clearer, more honest target for the next bull run. True victory isn’t just a number on a screen—it’s a number that holds its value against the test of time. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does ‘inflation-adjusted BTC price’ mean? A: It means Bitcoin’s price is recalculated to account for the decrease in the U.S. dollar’s purchasing power due to inflation. It shows what the price would be if the dollar had the same value as it did in a base year (like 2020). Q: Why is the inflation-adjusted price lower than the nominal price? A: Because inflation has made each dollar worth less. A $126,000 Bitcoin today can buy fewer goods and services than a $126,000 Bitcoin could have in 2020, so its real value is adjusted downward. Q: Is Bitcoin still a good hedge against inflation if its adjusted price is lower? A: Yes, absolutely. The fact that we are even having this conversation proves the point. While its adjusted price hasn’t set a new real high yet, its nominal price soaring while the dollar weakens demonstrates its potential as a store of value compared to cash. Q: How often is the CPI data updated, and how is it used? A: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics releases CPI data monthly. Analysts use this data stream to continuously calculate the real purchasing power of currency and, by extension, the real value of assets like Bitcoin. Q: Should I wait for the inflation-adjusted price to hit $100k before investing? A> Not necessarily. Investment decisions should be based on a broader strategy, including your financial goals and risk tolerance. This metric is a tool for understanding true value, not a direct investment signal.

The latest signs indicate that consumer sentiment remains broadly positive regarding the economic outlook, even as prices continue to rise and financial markets become jittery. And while inflation has increased the price of goods and services on a day-to-day basis, and fluctuations in the equity market have added to the pressure on the growth trend, they have not been large enough to alter the overall optimism significantly. The overall consumer sentiment index hit 109.9 in December, according to the Bank of Korea’s report on Wednesday. That was a 2.5 point decrease from November’s eight-year high, but well above a neutral 100, which helps demarcate optimism from pessimism. At this metric, consumer sentiment is strong enough to provide robust support for durable growth in consumer spending, and with it, working hours and wages. Here, the point is that optimism moderation was coupled with a widening range of consumer prices and greater currency volatility. Those measures have somewhat subdued household sentiment, but in general, confidence is stronger than in past eras of economic uncertainty. Rising prices and currency swings weigh on confidence Inflation remained a problem for households as they approached the end of last year, despite the continued rise in costs of food, utilities, and services. These price pressures “partially dampened” some of the optimism experienced in November, when confidence peaked at its highest level in eight years, the Bank of Korea said. The slight decrease was the result of higher consumer prices and a greater exchange rate volatility, the central bank added. Still, exports have been broadly resilient this year, bolstered by strong semiconductor shipments. That’s despite higher US tariffs on Korean goods that have impacted Seoul’s second-largest export market. Importantly, the fall in confidence was modest. The index remained well above the neutral range, suggesting that households were still broadly optimistic about their income outlook, labour market conditions, and future spending, even though they may be more cautious of short-term risks. Strong exports and housing optimism support the outlook Sentiment was also reflected in external demand, with exports performing relatively well for the year overall. Strong chip sales have also proved to be a significant boost, helping South Korea cope with poor performance elsewhere, which has continued to be marked by global trade uncertainty. Even with the United States slapping tariffs on some Korean goods, which have put the brake on shipments to Seoul’s second-largest export market, that resilience has been on. Elsewhere, robust demand for advanced chips has supported the impact and helped underpin overall export momentum. This consumer sentiment strength has been reflected in the Bank of Korea’s economic forecasts. In November, it revised its growth forecast for this year to 1% and for the future to 1.8%, due to sustained domestic consumption and export support from abroad. Housing expectations were also a significant factor in shaping consumer sentiment. A sub-index measuring expectations for home prices rose for a second-straight month, up 2 points to 121. In parts of Greater Seoul, this includes prices for apartments, which have also climbed, although at a slower pace. The index of consumer expectations regarding household debt, meanwhile, remained steady at 96 for the second consecutive month. This persistence suggests that concerns over borrowing have not increased, despite house prices remaining stable. The Bank of Korea stated that there are still risks to the economy, including a weak Korean won and high home prices in Seoul, which are likely to persist. The central bank stated that those factors could impact financial stability. Keeping consumer confidence above the neutral level for an eighth consecutive month suggests that households continue to have greater expectations for the future as 2026 begins, it added.

The South Korean crypto exchange giant has announced a critical, temporary suspension of its crypto deposits and withdrawals . This planned pause is a proactive step for security and transparency, but it requires your immediate attention to avoid any trading disruptions as the year ends. What’s Happening with Bithumb’s Services? Bithumb will temporarily halt all crypto deposits and withdrawals for a 10-hour window. This suspension is scheduled for December 31st, from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. UTC. The primary reason for this pause is to conduct a mandatory, regular asset audit. Therefore, this is a standard operational procedure, not a reaction to any security incident. However, it’s crucial to understand what this means for your account. During this period, you will not be able to move funds onto or off the Bithumb platform. Let’s break down exactly what is and isn’t affected. What Services Are Affected (And What Aren’t)? Knowing the scope of this suspension helps you plan your crypto activities accordingly. Here is a clear breakdown: Paused Services: All cryptocurrency deposit and withdrawal functions will be completely inactive. Available Services: Crucially, spot trading on the Bithumb exchange will continue to operate normally. You can still buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies within your account balance. This distinction is vital. The audit focuses on verifying the assets Bithumb holds, not on the trading engine itself. Think of it as a bank counting its cash in the vault while the teller windows remain open for transactions between account holders. Why Are Regular Crypto Exchange Audits So Important? You might wonder why a major exchange like Bithumb needs to pause services for an audit. The answer lies in trust and security. Regular asset audits are a cornerstone of a reputable cryptocurrency exchange’s operations. They serve several key purposes: Proof of Reserves: Audits verify that the exchange holds the full amount of customer assets it claims to, a practice often called Proof of Reserves. Regulatory Compliance: In South Korea’s strict regulatory environment, such audits are often mandatory to ensure compliance with financial laws. User Confidence: Transparent audits build user confidence by demonstrating the exchange’s solvency and operational integrity. Therefore, while a temporary halt on Bithumb crypto deposits and withdrawals is an inconvenience, it ultimately contributes to a safer and more transparent ecosystem for all users. Actionable Steps for Bithumb Users Before Dec. 31 Don’t get caught off guard. To ensure a smooth experience, consider these simple steps before the suspension window begins: Plan Your Transfers: If you need to deposit funds for trading or withdraw profits, complete these actions well before 8:00 a.m. UTC on December 31st. Review Open Orders: Ensure any time-sensitive trading strategies do not rely on the ability to move assets during the 10-hour window. Stay Informed: Monitor official Bithumb announcements for any updates, though such planned audits typically proceed on schedule. By taking these precautions, you can navigate this routine maintenance without any impact on your crypto strategy. Conclusion: A Sign of Strength, Not Weakness In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, transparency is paramount. Bithumb’s decision to conduct this audit and temporarily pause crypto deposits and withdrawals reflects a commitment to robust financial practices. While it requires minor planning from users, this procedure reinforces the exchange’s dedication to security and regulatory compliance. Ultimately, such measures are designed to protect user assets and maintain the long-term health of the trading platform. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade on Bithumb during the suspension? A1: Yes. Spot trading will remain fully operational. Only the deposit and withdrawal functions for cryptocurrencies will be paused. Q2: Will my funds be safe during the audit? A2: Absolutely. The audit is a verification process. Your assets remain secure in Bithumb’s wallets. The pause is a procedural step to ensure an accurate snapshot of holdings. Q3: Does this affect Korean Won (KRW) deposits or withdrawals? A3: The announcement specifies cryptocurrency services. Typically, fiat currency (KRW) channels are managed separately and may not be affected, but you should check Bithumb’s official notice for complete details. Q4: What happens if I try to initiate a transaction during the pause? A4: The interface for crypto deposits and withdrawals will likely be disabled or will reject any transaction attempts during the 10-hour window. Your request will not be processed until services resume. Q5: Are other exchanges doing similar audits? A5: Yes. Regular asset audits are becoming a standard best practice for major, compliant cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide to ensure transparency and build trust. Q6: Will services resume exactly at 6:00 p.m. UTC? A6: Bithumb aims to restore services at the stated time. However, in rare cases, audits can take slightly longer. It’s always wise to allow for a small buffer before initiating critical transactions immediately after the deadline. Found this guide on Bithumb’s essential service update helpful?

According to data, spot Solana ETFs have posted $750.10 million in cumulative net inflows as of December 22, with outflows recorded on only three trading days since launch. All of those outflows were relatively small, and each was less than $33 million, despite the intense, choppy price action in the last quarter of the year. Solana Ecosystem Growth CoinShares explained that the consistent inflows mean that investors are using regulated investment vehicles to gain exposure to Solana rather than rotating capital out shortly after launch, a pattern that has previously affected some crypto-linked products. Market participants see the trend as an indication that Solana is increasingly being viewed as a long-term allocation rather than a short-term trade, especially as its ecosystem activity and infrastructure continue to expand, despite earlier concerns about decentralization. Alongside ETF-related developments, Solana’s validator infrastructure has also seen rapid adoption of new performance-focused technology. As of November 10, 2025, around 24.2% of Solana validators are running Frankendancer, a hybrid validator client that combines elements of the existing Agave client with components from Jump Crypto’s Firedancer project. This is a sharp increase from just six validators using the software in January 2025. Data cited by CoinShares show that validators operating Frankendancer are earning higher average fees and tips than those running Agave alone. This essentially reflects improved performance and transaction processing efficiency. Additionally, Solana validators are increasingly adopting DoubleZero, a dedicated private mesh network designed to improve communication between validators by bypassing parts of the public internet. As of November, 290 validators representing roughly 36% of total staked SOL are connected through DoubleZero. Such a level of adoption highlights growing demand for lower latency and more reliable transaction propagation across the network. Stablecoins on Solana The infrastructure upgrades come as activity on Solana continues to rise. Stablecoin usage on the blockchain has also expanded sharply over the past two years. In fact, the total value of stablecoins circulating on the network has increased from about $1.8 billion in early 2024 to roughly $12 billion by November 2025, as per on-chain data. USDC accounts for the largest share, followed by USDT. Meanwhile, newer entrants such as PayPal’s PYUSD and Paxos-issued USDG are also gaining traction. The rapid growth in stablecoin supply points to Solana’s increasing role in payments, trading, and settlement activity, as well as its appeal to companies seeking faster and lower-cost blockchain infrastructure.

Robert Mitchnick, who leads BlackRock’s digital assets strategy, flagged the recruitment drive recently, saying the firm is hiring for multiple leadership roles across its digital assets team in New York, London and Asia. The openings range from associate roles to senior leadership, covering product strategy, research, fund services and compliance, according to job listings and role descriptions posted on BlackRock’s careers pages. High-Paying Crypto Roles Anchor Expansion Plan One of the most senior postings, a managing director role in New York, puts the salary range at $270,000 to $350,000 and tasks the hire with leading major cross firm digital assets initiatives tied to crypto assets, stablecoins and tokenization. In Singapore, BlackRock is also hiring a managing director to run digital assets strategy across Asia Pacific, with responsibilities that include building a multi-year commercial plan, shaping regulatory engagement, and mapping distribution through banks, brokers, crypto exchanges and fintech platforms. BlackRock’s listings also point to a global build-out around digital asset tokenization and controls, with roles in areas such as fund services and financial crime compliance alongside legal coverage for EMEA markets. From ETFs To Tokenization, BlackRock Deepens Its Bet The firm is asking new hires to show up in person, with the postings reiterating a hybrid model that requires at least four days a week in the office and one day from home. The hiring push lands after BlackRock helped pull crypto deeper into traditional portfolios through its spot Bitcoin ETF, and it has also pushed into on chain finance with a tokenized institutional liquidity fund on Ethereum. BlackRock has even put its iShares Bitcoin Trust among its top investment themes for 2025 , placing it alongside short-term Treasuries and a mega-cap US tech basket, a signal that the firm sees crypto exposure as a core portfolio building block for some clients. Tokenization is part of the same arc, and BlackRock’s BUIDL fund has already shown up in market plumbing, including being accepted as collateral at crypto exchange Binance, a milestone for tokenized Treasuries in institutional style workflows.

For the fourth consecutive day, investors have pulled money from spot Bitcoin ETFs, creating a net outflow of $188.38 million on December 23 alone. This persistent trend signals a shift in investor sentiment that demands closer examination. What’s Driving the Spot Bitcoin ETF Exodus? Recent data from Trader T reveals a clear pattern of withdrawal from these popular investment vehicles. The consistent outflows suggest investors might be taking profits, repositioning portfolios, or reacting to broader market uncertainty. When we examine which specific spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced the largest outflows, the distribution tells an important story about where the pressure is concentrated. The leader in outflows was BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which saw $157.08 million exit. This is significant because BlackRock represents institutional heavyweight participation. Following IBIT were Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with $15.30 million in outflows, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) with $10.28 million, and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) with $5.72 million. The remaining U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded no net movement for the day. How Do These Outflows Impact the Broader Crypto Market? Spot Bitcoin ETFs serve as a crucial bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. Their daily flow data acts as a real-time sentiment gauge for institutional and retail investors alike. Therefore, sustained outflows can create several ripple effects: Downward price pressure : Selling from ETF providers to meet redemption requests can increase sell-side pressure on Bitcoin itself. Reduced liquidity : As assets under management shrink, it can affect the overall liquidity and trading efficiency of these products. Sentiment contagion : Negative flow data can influence broader market psychology, potentially affecting Bitcoin’s price beyond direct selling. It’s worth noting that while four consecutive days of outflows creates a noticeable trend, it doesn’t necessarily indicate a long-term reversal. The market for spot Bitcoin ETFs remains relatively new, and flow volatility is expected as investors find their equilibrium. However, the concentration in BlackRock’s fund suggests larger players might be adjusting their exposure. Should Investors Be Worried About Spot Bitcoin ETF Stability? For current and prospective investors, understanding the context is crucial. These outflows occurred during a typically quieter holiday trading period, which can amplify percentage movements. Furthermore, the approval and success of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in 2024 attracted substantial capital that may now be undergoing natural rebalancing. Key factors to monitor include: Whether the outflow trend continues into the new year How Bitcoin’s price responds to reduced ETF buying pressure If any specific catalysts (regulatory news, macroeconomic data) correlate with the withdrawal patterns The data clearly shows that not all spot Bitcoin ETFs are experiencing equal pressure. While IBIT saw significant outflows, others remained neutral. This selective movement indicates investors are making specific fund choices rather than abandoning the asset class entirely. What Does the Future Hold for Bitcoin ETF Investments? Looking ahead, the trajectory of spot Bitcoin ETF flows will provide valuable insights into institutional adoption maturity. Short-term volatility in flows is normal for emerging financial products. The true test will be whether net inflows resume as market conditions evolve. Investors should remember that spot Bitcoin ETFs are designed for long-term exposure to Bitcoin’s price, not daily trading based on flow data. The current outflow streak serves as a reminder that even innovative financial products experience natural market cycles and investor reassessment periods. In conclusion, the four-day outflow streak totaling $188.4 million from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs represents a notable shift in short-term investor behavior. While concerning on the surface, it reflects normal market mechanics where investors rebalance, take profits, and respond to evolving conditions. The concentrated outflows from major funds like BlackRock’s IBIT warrant attention, but they don’t necessarily undermine the long-term thesis for Bitcoin investment through regulated exchange-traded products. Frequently Asked Questions What are spot Bitcoin ETFs? Spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through traditional brokerage accounts without needing to directly purchase or store the cryptocurrency. Why are investors pulling money from Bitcoin ETFs? Investors might be taking profits after price increases, rebalancing year-end portfolios, reacting to broader market uncertainty, or adjusting their risk exposure based on changing market conditions. Do ETF outflows directly cause Bitcoin’s price to drop? They can create downward pressure. When investors redeem ETF shares, providers may need to sell Bitcoin to raise cash, potentially increasing sell-side pressure in the market. Is this the end of Bitcoin ETF popularity? Not necessarily. New financial products often experience volatility in early flows. The long-term adoption trend will depend on Bitcoin’s performance, regulatory developments, and continued institutional interest. Which Bitcoin ETF saw the largest outflows? BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) experienced the largest single-day outflow at $157.08 million on December 23, according to the reported data. Should I sell my Bitcoin ETF holdings because of this news? Investment decisions should be based on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon rather than reacting to short-term flow data alone. Consider consulting with a financial advisor. Found this analysis of spot Bitcoin ETF outflows helpful?

56270644,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=251149,1766551511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Alarming Reversal: US Spot ETH ETFs Bleed $95.5M in Net Outflows,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-spot-eth-etfs-outflows-3/,"BitcoinWorld Alarming Reversal: US Spot ETH ETFs Bleed $95.5M in Net Outflows In a stark reversal for Ethereum investors, the nascent US spot ETH ETFs have stumbled, recording a significant net outflow of $95.5 million on December 23rd. This sudden shift back to negative territory raises crucial questions about short-term sentiment and the stability of institutional demand for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. What Triggered the US Spot ETH ETFs Outflow? Data from Trader T reveals a clear pattern of withdrawal. After a brief, one-day respite that ended a seven-day streak of outflows, the funds collectively bled capital. This return to net outflows for US spot ETH ETFs suggests that the previous day’s inflow was an anomaly rather than a trend reversal. The market is clearly experiencing a period of consolidation and profit-taking. Which Funds Are Leading the Exodus? The outflow was not evenly distributed. A closer look shows which major players are seeing the most significant capital flight: Grayscale’s ETHE: Led the pack with a substantial withdrawal of $50.89 million. BlackRock’s ETHA: Followed with outflows of $25.05 million. Bitwise’s ETHW: Contributed $13.98 million to the total. Franklin Templeton’s EZET: Recorded a smaller outflow of $5.61 million. All other funds in the space reported zero net activity for the day, highlighting where the pressure is concentrated. Is This a Cause for Long-Term Concern? While a single day of outflows for US spot ETH ETFs is notable, it’s essential to view it in context. The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, and ETF flows often reflect short-term trader sentiment rather than long-term investment conviction. However, consistent outflows can pressure the underlying asset, Ethereum, by reducing the buying pressure these funds typically provide. Therefore, investors should monitor whether this becomes a sustained trend. A key factor will be the broader macroeconomic environment and Bitcoin’s price action, which often sets the tone for the entire digital asset class. What Should Ethereum Investors Do Now? For holders, this news serves as a reminder of market volatility. The performance of US spot ETH ETFs is a valuable sentiment indicator. Instead of reacting hastily, consider these points: Review Your Strategy: Does short-term flow data impact your long-term thesis on Ethereum? Diversify: Ensure your portfolio isn’t overexposed to any single asset or investment vehicle. Stay Informed: Watch for follow-up data to see if this outflow is an isolated event. Actionable insight often comes from patience and perspective, not panic. The Bottom Line on ETH ETF Flows The $95.5 million net outflow from US spot ETH ETFs is a clear signal of shifting short-term capital. It underscores that even with major financial institutions involved, the crypto market remains dynamic and sensitive. For the ecosystem’s health, the focus will be on whether these products can attract consistent inflows over the coming quarters, proving their staying power beyond initial launch excitement. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are US spot ETH ETFs? They are exchange-traded funds that hold physical Ethereum (ETH), allowing investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency’s price without directly buying or storing it. Why do ETF net outflows matter? Net outflows mean more money is being withdrawn from the funds than deposited. This can reduce the funds’ need to buy more Ethereum, potentially removing a source of buying pressure from the market. Is Grayscale’s ETHE converting from a trust? Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) was a pre-existing product that converted to a spot ETF. Its large outflows may be due to investors who bought the trust at a discount now taking profits. Could this affect Ethereum’s price? Potentially. Sustained large outflows could lead to selling pressure if the ETF issuers need to sell ETH to meet redemptions. However, one day of data is rarely enough to move the market significantly on its own. Where can I track this data? Data is compiled by analysts like Trader T and reported by various financial and crypto news outlets. Fund issuers also report their assets under management (AUM) regularly. Are Bitcoin spot ETFs seeing similar outflows? Not necessarily. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF flows can diverge based on separate investor sentiments and market narratives for each asset.

The company confirmed on Monday that the Ontario Securities Commission approved it to issue common shares, warrants, subscription receipts, debt securities, or units over the next 25 months. The company stated that the $58 million base shelf prospectus is designed to fund both strategic Bitcoin purchases and general corporate needs, allowing Matador to access capital efficiently while remaining disciplined in terms of timing and pricing, as part of a long-term Bitcoin strategy. “Obtaining the receipt for our CAD $80 million base shelf prospectus is a critical step in maturing our capital structure,” said Deven Soni, CEO of Matador. The company expects to build up its Bitcoin treasury incrementally, utilizing multiple financing sources instead of relying solely on one, and noted that shelf approval does not obligate it to raise money immediately. According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET, the firm currently holds approximately 175 Bitcoins, worth around $15.3 million, ranking 90th globally among corporate holders. Matador bought $4.5 million worth of Bitcoin Mark Voss, Matador’s chief visionary, insists the firm would keep a close eye on Bitcoin’s volatility and time its capital deployment carefully through the current market cycle. Soni also noted, “Matador may, from time to time, allocate available capital toward Bitcoin purchases or other corporate purposes, depending on market conditions, regulatory requirements, the company’s financial position, and other factors.” In December 2024, the TSX-listed firm began executing its Bitcoin-first strategy with a $4.5 million Bitcoin purchase, saying at the time that BTC would help future-proof its treasury. Since then, the company has grown its Bitcoin treasury by roughly 767%. Notably, last month, the company finalized the closure of its convertible note program, signaling a full commitment to acquiring Bitcoin for its balance sheet as it works toward acquiring 6,000 BTC. The firm stated that its decision to add Bitcoin and US dollars to its treasury is driven by concerns that Canada’s debt levels could erode the purchasing power of the local currency. The company’s ultimate target is to hold 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply, roughly 210,000 BTC, a milestone only Michael Saylor’s Strategy has reached so far. Some 190 companies hold Bitcoin, though their stocks have been falling sharply. Investment in companies holding Bitcoin has grown to over 190 publicly traded companies, a sign of continued institutional traction from the inception of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. Although most Bitcoin-holding companies have seen their stocks decline during market drawdowns, leading analysts to question the long-term sustainability of their treasury strategies. Some corporate Bitcoin holders are even selling part of their BTC to settle their financial obligations as the market tightens. For instance, Sequans sold 970 BTC in November to pay off convertible debt, deferring its goal of raising 100,000 BTC. In addition, Strategy has temporarily suspended the buying of Bitcoin and raised its cash holding to $2.19 billion following a $747.8 million equity sale. Rising cash balances indicate a desire to maintain short-term financial flexibility and satisfy dividend and debt obligations with a capital structure that incorporates preferred shares and borrowing. With 671,268 Bitcoin, valued at an average price of $74,972, the firm currently holds a total amount of this cryptocurrency of around $50 billion.

At the same time, Brazil is embracing Bitcoin from a more cultural angle after approving funding for an experimental orchestral project that converts live Bitcoin price data into music. Overall, Bitcoin can be a point of tension for international lenders while also serving as creative inspiration somewhere else. El Salvador Is Moving Forward With Chivo Wallet Sale? The International Monetary Fund confirmed that negotiations over the potential sale of El Salvador’s government-run Chivo Wallet are well advanced. In a statement that was issued Monday, the IMF said Salvadoran authorities were continuing discussions related to the country’s Bitcoin project and that talks surrounding the divestment of Chivo were progressing, although specific details of the transaction were not undisclosed. The update follows a deal that was reached in May between the IMF and El Salvador, under which the fund agreed to disburse $120 million as part of a $1.4 billion loan program for 2024. One of the core conditions of that agreement was a commitment by the Salvadoran government to stop further Bitcoin acquisitions and scale back public-sector involvement in Bitcoin-related economic activity. According to the IMF, this included winding down state participation in the Chivo wallet. Despite these commitments, there are still some questions over whether El Salvador is fully complying with the terms of the agreement. While the IMF reported in July that the government had not purchased any Bitcoin since December of 2024, the country’s Bitcoin Office continued to announce additional acquisitions . Officials revealed purchases totaling 1,090 Bitcoin in November alone, valued at roughly $100 million at the time. These announcements have fueled uncertainty around how strictly the government is actually adhering to the IMF-backed framework. El Salvador’s Bitcoin balance history (Source: El Salvador Bitcoin Office ) El Salvador’s embrace of Bitcoin dates back to 2021, when it became the first country in the world to recognize the cryptocurrency as legal tender. The move was championed by President Nayib Bukele. Since then, Bitcoin has been central to Bukele’s economic strategy and international image, even though it drew criticism from multilateral institutions. According to official data from the Bitcoin Office, El Salvador currently holds 7,509 Bitcoin, which is worth approximately $659 million at current market prices. Bukele publicly pushed back against suggestions that the government will abandon its Bitcoin strategy. In March, he stated that El Salvador will continue buying at least one Bitcoin per day, saying the policy was “not stopping,” regardless of external pressure. Brazil Funds Bitcoin Music Experiment Brazil is taking a very different approach to how it embraces Bitcoin. An experimental orchestral project in Brazil is set to transform Bitcoin market data into live music after receiving official approval to raise funds through one of the country’s federal tax-incentive programs for cultural initiatives. According to Brazil’s Federal Register, the project has been authorized to seek up to 1.09 million reais, or roughly $197,000, from private companies and individual donors to stage an instrumental concert that translates financial data into sound. The initiative will take place in Brasília, the country’s federal capital, and centers on converting real-time Bitcoin price movements into musical notation using an algorithmic system. During the performance, Bitcoin’s price behavior and related technical data will be tracked live and mapped to elements like melody, rhythm, and harmony, guiding an orchestra as it plays. The goal is to give audiences an audible representation of Bitcoin’s volatility, blending traditional orchestral instrumentation with data-driven composition inspired by principles from art, mathematics, economics, and physics. The project description does not specify whether blockchain or on-chain infrastructure will be directly used in the performance itself. Approval under Brazil’s Rouanet Law confirms that the proposal passed technical review and qualifies for tax-deductible sponsorships, which allows contributors to offset donations against their taxes. Fundraising for the concert must be completed by Dec. 31, and the initiative was formally classified under the “Instrumental Music” category, which determines how the tax incentives are applied. One-of-a-kind programmable piece that generates a new image each day, synced with Bitcoin’s volatility The Brazilian project follows a lineage of experiments that treat cryptocurrency data as creative raw material. Earlier examples include a 2020 programmable artwork by Matt Kane that changed visually in response to Bitcoin price movements and was released through Async Art, as well as data-driven installations by artist Refik Anadol that use algorithms and artificial intelligence to convert complex datasets into visual experiences.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-24 05:00:00

56273838,648208,1766552446,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56273838.jpeg,South Korean Giant BC Card Concludes Stablecoin Payments Pilot Ahead Of 2026 Framework,https://bitcoinist.com/south-korean-bc-card-concludes-stablecoin-pilot/,"South Korean payments giant BC Card has completed its pilot project to verify the stability and convenience of card-integrated stablecoins in collaboration with domestic and international digital asset companies. BC Card Completes Stablecoin Payment Pilot Project For Foreigners On Tuesday, South Korea’s largest payment processing company, BC Card, announced it had concluded its two-month pilot project enabling foreigners to use stablecoins as a payment method at domestic merchants. The project was conducted alongside blockchain financial firm Wavebridge, overseas digital wallet company Aaron Group, and remittance fintech company Global Money Express. According to BC Card, the pilot focused on “verifying whether foreign currency-based stablecoins held by foreigners could be practically used within the domestic payment environment, while also assessing payment convenience and stability.” For the project, foreign users converted their stablecoins held in oversea wallets parented with BC Card into digital prepaid cards that could be used at domestic affiliated merchants using a QR code, without requiring a physical card or currency exchange procedures. The company integrated stablecoin payments into the existing card authorization and settlement structure using a digital prepaid card as an intermediary, the announcement explained, noting that “this design enables both paying customers and merchants to transact in the same manner as with conventional card payments.” BC Card’s President, Choi Won-seok, stated, “Stablecoins, due to their technical characteristics, are particularly useful for cross-border payments and hold significant potential to improve the domestic payment experience for foreign consumers.” South Korean Companies Prepares For 2026 Framework The payments giant affirmed that the pilot was not a “short-term technical verification” but a “process to prepare a stablecoin payment structure responsive to future domestic legal and regulatory changes.” Notably, the South Korean government recently failed to submit the highly anticipated bill for the Second Phase of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act, which will address the issuance and distribution of won-pegged stablecoins. As reported by Bitcoinist, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) did not meet the ruling party’s December 10 deadline to submit the government’s legislation to the National Policy Committee. According to local media, the government bill was delayed after the FSC and the Bank of Korea (BOK) failed to resolve their differences over the issuance of won-denominated stablecoins. The financial authorities reportedly agree that financial institutions must be involved in the issuance of the tokens but disagree on the extent of banks’ role. While the central bank has been pushing for a consortium of banks owning at least 51% of any stablecoin issuer seeking approval in the country, the FSC has expressed concerns that giving a majority stake to banks could reduce participation from tech firms and limit the market’s innovation. Recent reports affirmed that the government’s proposal is expected to be announced by early next month at the latest, as the integrated bill must be submitted in January 2026. “To protect the public’s right to know, there will be a separate opportunity to explain the government’s proposed bill to the public while submitting it to the National Assembly,” an FSC official stated last week. Ultimately, BC Card pledged to strengthen its cooperation with relevant agencies while considering the flow of virtual asset legislation, aiming to “lead the establishment of a ‘Korean-style stablecoin payment infrastructure’ by progressively advancing a payment model compliant with domestic regulations.” “BC Card will leverage its card payment infrastructure to progressively prepare a stable stablecoin payment model that aligns with Korea’s legal and regulatory environment,” the company’s president concluded.",Crypto News|Bank of Korea|BC Card|Crypto legislation|Financial Services Commission|FSC|South korea stablecoins|South Korean authorities|Stablecoin Legislation|Stablecoin payments|total|total crypto market cap,EN,0,0,ASIA|FIAT|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-24 05:00:46

However, market analyst Sam Daodu has identified five critical catalysts that could drive the altcoin to new all-time highs of $5 by 2026. Potential Bullish Catalysts For XRP In a detailed report, Daodu emphasized that for XRP to reach $5, multiple specific factors need to work in unison. Each of these catalysts aims to address various barriers that have kept XRP’s price stagnant. At the forefront of Daodu’s analysis is the potential for a BlackRock-backed XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). Since mid-November 2025, spot XRP ETFs have attracted over $1 billion in cumulative inflows. Should BlackRock move forward with its ETF, estimates suggest that inflows could exceed $2 billion. Related Reading: XRP Price Forecasts For 2026 Unveiled By AI Simulation: Should Investors Remain Bullish? Daodu’s analysis points that such capital influx would not only reshape market demand but would also solidify XRP’s position as the sole cryptocurrency tied to a fully regulated token in the United States, significantly enhancing its case for reaching $5. Next on the list is the evolving significance of Japan within the XRP narrative. Ripple, in collaboration with SBI Holdings, is set to launch RLUSD—Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin—in Japan by the first quarter of 2026, pending regulatory approval. The use of RLUSD on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) can create substantial demand for XRP as a bridge currency, supporting the case for it to reach $5, even if this impact unfolds gradually over time. From Tokenization To ETFs The third catalyst that Daodu identified is the tokenization of assets. Ripple’s expanded partnership with Archax aims to bring in “hundreds of millions of dollars” in tokenized equity, debt, and funds onto the XRP Ledger by mid-2026. Should the XRP Ledger capture even a modest 5-10% of the tokenized asset settlement market, the demand for XRP would increase significantly, further supporting its goal of reaching $5. In fourth place, macroeconomic policy plays a crucial role in shaping XRP’s upside potential. Anticipated rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) would likely decrease returns on cash and short-term bonds, traditionally driving capital toward riskier assets that offer growth and liquidity. Related Reading: New Crypto Tax Proposal: Bipartisan House Duo Pushes For Stablecoin Safe Harbor Lastly, recent on-chain data points to a noteworthy change in supply dynamics. Exchange-held XRP has decreased, with 1.35 billion XRP removed from exchanges in less than two months. Balances plummeted from approximately 3.95 billion tokens to about 2.6 billion, with more than a billion leaving in just a short span of three weeks. Such withdrawals are indicative of a behavioral shift among holders, as many are opting to move XRP into long-term storage solutions. Daodu posits that reaching the $5 mark will not stem from a singular headline or moment of exuberance. It will necessitate a convergence of multiple factors, including strong ETF inflows, institutional adoption, and favorable macroeconomic conditions. As of this writing, the altcoin was trading at $1.88, dropping by almost 50% from all-time high levels reached back in July of this year.

Early asset growth positions XRPC as a leading spot XRP ETF, with liquidity stabilizing quickly following launch despite a short operating history. XRPC’s spot structure allows performance to closely track XRP’s price, making it suitable for investors seeking long-term exposure through traditional brokerage accounts. Ongoing institutional upgrades to the XRP Ledger support XRP’s role as payments and settlement infrastructure rather than as a purely speculative asset. Growing stablecoin and tokenized asset activity on the XRP Ledger may sustain institutional interest and contribute to XRP demand and volatility over time. Investment Thesis I rate Canary XRP ETF (NASDAQ: XRPC ) a strong buy for those seeking exposure to the cryptocurrency XRP ( XRP-USD ) in a traditional market since it is an efficient and structurally sound method of gaining long-term exposure to XRP. By holding XRP directly via a spot structure, XRPC avoids the features such as roll costs, daily resets, and decays that cause other XRP ETFs, many of which are futures or leveraged-based, to underperform. Although the fund has a short operating history, the ETF has a 0.50% fee, and its yet improving liquidity make it an efficient wrapper around an asset that, for various reasons , I believe is entering a stage of increasing adoption and valuation. And, over the next 12 months, XRPC's performance will no doubt be driven by both XRP's spot price, as well as post-launch ETF flows, growing institutional usage of the XRP Ledger (per the latest State of the XRP Ledger for Q3 2025), and expanding activity in both stablecoins and tokenized assets—all catalysts that should influence both demand and volatility for XRP and, consequently, XRPC. The Basics: Fund Structure, Mechanics, and Performance Fund Structure XRPC is a spot XRP trust that was created to provide direct exposure to XRP less the Trust's fees and operating expenses and holds XRP as its primary asset with only limited cash positions that are used for operational purposes, such as expenses or creation and redemption activity. According to the XRPC Prospectus , the Trust does not operate as a traditional '40 Act ETF but is rather structured as a grantor trust and, thereby, treats the investor as if they own XRP directly. Holdings Table (XRP Canary ETF Website) Mechanics The net asset value [NAV] is calculated one time per trading day, after the market closes at 4:00 p.m. EST, and, to determine NAV, Canary Capital uses the CME XRP-USD Reference Rate. The total value of the Trust's XRP holdings, after all the accrued fees and expenses are accounted for, are then divided by the number of shares outstanding that then give Canary Capital their daily NAV. Also, during the trading day, XRPC publishes an indicative value, which is provided by CoinDesk Indices , that updates frequently as XRP moves throughout the day, no doubt important to investors given that it serves a real-time reference point for where the Trust's shares should, in theory, be trading. This mechanism is what helps to keep the market price of XRPC aligned with the underlying value of XRP, although it is worth saying that temporary premiums or discounts can still occur, especially when there are periods of heightened volatility. Performance Finally, because the Trust holds XRP directly, as opposed to using derivatives or leverage, XRPC's performance is primarily driven by movements in XRP's spot price, adjusted for fees of course, without the roll costs or tracking distortions that investors commonly find in other derivatives-based crypto products—as we'll see below—with our XRP ETF peer comparisons. XRPC was launched just over a month ago on November 13 , so its public trading history is still limited. Thus, we don't have enough data to draw solid conclusions as to how the trust performs across varying market conditions or varying trading environments, but what is important is to note that XRPC's market behavior should simply be viewed as a reflection of XRP's general price movements, albeit with near-term volatility found and influenced ETF-related headlines in combination with adoption milestones and catalysts found on the XRPL as discussed below. Peer Comparison: How XRPC Differs from Other XRP ETFs XRPC is but one of the more recent XRP ETFs; however, much of the current XRP ETF market consists of derivative-based products. Thus, below are peer comparisons to just some of these other XRP ETFs. XRPI When it comes to unlevered alternatives in the XRP ETF marketplace, the most comparable one is XRPI (NASDAQ: XRPI ) that tracks XRP using CME futures as opposed to holding the asset directly as in the case of XRPC. And XRPI's futures structure means that, since these futures must be rolled over time (i.e. expiring futures contracts must be sold and new ones must be bought the next month with these futures contracts trading at a premium to XRP's current spot price, thereby eating into returns), returns can, and sometimes will, often lag and, thus, underperform XRP itself . And we can see this effect in the YChart below, with XRPI underperforming XRPC by one percentage point in the last month of trading. Data by YCharts XRPT and XXRP Meanwhile, we also have leveraged XRP ETFs, such as XRPT (NASDAQ: XRPT ) and XXRP (NYSEARCA: XXRP ). However, since these are leveraged ETFs built for 2x exposure, they should only be seen as short-term tactical investments and not as long-term investments. Nevertheless, both ETFs aim to give investors XRP's daily moves multiplied by two using futures or swaps , the catch being that they reset their exposure every trading session and, thus, make them unsuitable for holding past short windows of time because these daily resets will erode returns even in a short period of time. We can see this effect in the YChart below, with both of these 2x leveraged ETFs underperforming XRPC by approximately 11 to 12 percentage points in the last month. The only time these leveraged ETFs outperformed XRPC were in short periods in late November and early December when the price of XRP hovered and stayed above the $2.20 price range. Data by YCharts What Makes XRPC Different As we can see, what makes XRPC different is not only that it is the first spot XRP ETF , but also that it holds XRP directly as opposed to relying on futures, swaps, or leverage as noted in the ETFs above. Thus, the drawbacks of daily resets, roll costs, structural decay, and so forth that are tied to derivates are non-existent with XRPC, meaning that, over time, XRPC's performance should more closely reflect XRP's spot price, minus fees, especially important if the adoption catalysts referred to below begin to play out over multiple-month horizons as opposed to short, tactical windows. In sum, this ETF trades complexity for convenience for investors who are looking for straightforward, long-term exposure to XRP without the drag from leverage or futures. Costs and Liquidity XRPC has a net expense ratio of 0.50%, which is both standard and in line with the median for all ETF fees, per Seeking Alpha 's data, with liquidity stabilizing fairly quickly after its first month of trading with a notable 0.15% bid/ask spread that almost matches the median 0.14% for the ETF market. This is good news for investors since they are not paying a meaningful liquidity penalty to access spot XRP exposure. XRPC ETF Expenses (Seeking Alpha) 12-Month Outlook: Three Potential Catalysts There are three major catalysts that I believe will drive both XRPC's price and XRP's demand and volatility in the next 12 months: 1. Post-Launch Flows, Fee Compression, and Liquidity Share Capture As of now, there are three other spot XRP ETFs that have gone live: Bitwise XRP ETF (NYSEARCA: XRP ), Franklin XRP ETF (NYSEARCA: XRPZ ), and Grayscale XRP Trust ETF (NYSEARCA: GXRP ). So the first of the 2026 drivers becomes which of these four wins in assets and liquidity, and investors should expect competition in areas such as fees, spread compression, and AUM concentration into the products that can achieve the better combination of cost, execution, and distribution. All that to say, in other words, that XRPC's success in the next six to twelve months depends less on being a spot ETF and more about whether the investment can become, within its category, the most liquid and lowest-friction ways to trade XRP in a traditional brokerage account. Comparison Table of Spot XRP ETFs (Seeking Alpha) Via the inserted screenshots, we can see that, as of now, XRPC has attracted the largest asset base among its competitors, with approximately $336 million in assets compared to the lower AUM levels among its competitors. Its first-mover advantage in the spot XRP marketplace has resulted in a higher AUM, though it is worth pointing out that it is also the highest of the four in expense ratios, which suggests—to me at least—that fees are not yet the dominant driver of investor behavior in the early stages of this category because investors are instead prioritizing liquidity, familiarity, and early availability over fee levels—all elements XRPC has taken advantage of. And whether this early lead proves durable will depend on XRPC's trading depth and competitive spreads as the fee competition continues to intensify in 2026. Data by YCharts 2. Institutional-Grade XRPL Upgrades The most recent state of the XRP Ledger for Q3 2025 emphasized a clear, strategic direction for the XRPL: making the network usable for regulated financial institutions. There are new features being rolled out, such as allowing users to verify identity, enforce compliance rules, and even manage permissions directly on the XRPL—changes that are absolutely huge for XRP because it is moving XRP from speculative cryptoasset to a more serious payments and settlement infrastructure. And if these upgrades continue online as planned, then the XRPL will no doubt become a more attractive platform for banks, custodians, and tokenization providers—all of which support more sustained institutional interest in XRP as an asset over time that, necessarily, spill over into XRPC. 3. Expansion of Stablecoins and Tokenized Assets on the XRPL Per the same state of the XRP Ledger report for Q3, activity on the Ledger continued to build, with the report noting both higher transaction volumes and a growing number of active users along with an increased issuance of stablecoins and tokenized RWAs (i.e. real-world assets)—an important trend for XRPC because both stablecoins and tokenized treasuries are becoming vital parts of modern digital finance. Should the XRPL continue to attract regulated dollar-backed stablecoins and tokenized credit, or even treasury products for that matter, then I believe it will deepen the network's relevance for institutional holders and help to keep XRP as part of the broader conversation of financial infrastructure. Key Risks XRP Price Risk Since XRPC holds XRP directly, XRPC is completely susceptible to the price swings of XRP, and losses in XRP means losses in XRPC. There is no diversification or income components to the ETF to offset any potential declines. A Short Trading History As mentioned above, XRPC was launched just last month, so we investors have only a short performance record, and, therefore, limited data as to how the ETF will perform during, say, long periods of market stress or even extreme volatility. Premium and Discount Risk As seen in the premium/discount chart below, XRPC has traded both above and below NAV (though deviations on both sides have been modest), so investors may still pay more than the underlying when they buy or even receive less when they sell; and this is even more true when there are periods of high volatility. Premium/Discount Chart (XRP Canary ETF Website) Tracking Differences The YCharts below illustrates how XRP has declined more than XRPC in the last month, albeit the difference was small—approximately 2.5 percentage points. This highlights the daily NAV calculation noted above, as well as market pricing and the timing effects that can cause short-term differences even if the structure of the ETF is spot-based as in the case of XRPC. Data by YCharts Catalyst Timing Risk Even if we suppose that our longer-term adoption described above remains intact, the timing of regulatory decisions, institutional product and feature rollouts on the XRPL, and general ecosystem growth for XRP can be uneven. If these catalysts are delayed, or even if market sentiment deteriorates, then XRPC can, of course, experience sharp downturns even if there are no changes in XRP's long-term usage. Regulatory Risk Of course, we can't complete this section on key risks without mentioning the fact that, despite XRP's recent legal clarity , there is always the potential for future regulatory challenges that could affect XRP, potentially impacting its liquidity, its demand, its exchange access, and thus, by extension, XRPC. Conclusion In conclusion, Canary XRP ETF is a clean way of gaining long-term XRP exposure via an ETF wrapper. Its spot structure allows potential returns to mirror that of XRP itself without the roll costs, daily resets, or structural decay seen in other ETFs and, though it has a short operating history, its 0.50% expense ratio, early asset growth, and stabilizing liquidity make it both competitive among its other spot XRP ETF rivals and efficient for any investor seeking XRP exposure through a traditional brokerage account.

56272368,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=251155,1766553911,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,AINFT Unveiled: Bithumb’s Strategic Rebrand from APENFT Sparks Curiosity,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bithumb-renames-apenft-ainft/,"BitcoinWorld AINFT Unveiled: Bithumb’s Strategic Rebrand from APENFT Sparks Curiosity In a swift and decisive move, South Korean cryptocurrency exchange giant Bithumb has announced a significant rebrand. Effective today, the token formerly known as APENFT will now operate under the new name AINFT . This strategic shift from APENFT to AINFT is more than a simple label change; it signals a potential evolution in the project’s vision within the dynamic non-fungible token (NFT) and digital asset space. What Does the AINFT Rebrand Mean for Investors? The change from APENFT to AINFT took effect at 5:30 a.m. UTC. Bithumb has confirmed that both the trading pair name and the token’s official English designation have been updated. For existing holders, this is primarily a nominal update. Your holdings and the token’s core functionality on the exchange remain unchanged. However, such a rebrand often prompts a deeper question: why now? Rebranding in the crypto world is a powerful tool. It can signify a pivot, a refinement of goals, or an effort to better capture a project’s essence. The move from APENFT to AINFT strongly suggests a heightened focus on artificial intelligence (AI). This aligns with one of the most dominant trends in technology today, potentially positioning the token within the burgeoning intersection of AI and blockchain. Decoding the Strategy Behind the Name Change While Bithumb’s announcement was direct, the implications are worth exploring. A name change from APENFT to AINFT is a strategic communication. Let’s break down the potential benefits and considerations behind this decision. Market Positioning: The new AINFT name immediately associates the token with artificial intelligence, a sector attracting massive investment and innovation. This could broaden its appeal beyond the traditional NFT art community. Clarity of Vision: “APENFT” may have been less descriptive to new market participants. AINFT offers clearer, instant thematic recognition in a crowded market. Future-Proofing: The NFT ecosystem is rapidly expanding into utility, gaming, and AI-generated content. The AINFT rebrand could be a foundational step for the project to explore these advanced use cases. However, a key challenge for any rebrand is maintaining and communicating continuity. Existing supporters of APENFT will look for assurances that the project’s core mission remains intact, even as its name evolves to AINFT . Navigating the Change: A Practical Guide for Users If you are currently holding or trading this token on Bithumb, here is what you need to know. The transition from APENFT to AINFT is administrative. Your wallet balance automatically reflects the new ticker. All existing trading pairs, order books, and historical data have been seamlessly migrated. Therefore, you do not need to take any action. It is crucial, however, to update your mental notes and any personal tracking sheets. When searching for news, market data, or community discussions, you will now need to use the new keyword: AINFT . This ensures you stay informed as the project charts its new course under this refreshed identity. The Bigger Picture: AI and NFTs Converge This rebrand from APENFT to AINFT is a microcosm of a larger trend. The fusion of AI and blockchain technology is creating new frontiers. AI can be used to generate unique NFT art, manage dynamic NFT properties, or even curate digital collections. By embracing the AINFT name, the project positions itself at the heart of this convergence, which could unlock novel utilities and value propositions beyond static digital art. In conclusion, Bithumb’s announcement is a strategic punctuation mark in the story of this token. The shift from APENFT to AINFT is a forward-looking move that aligns the asset with a key technological narrative. While the immediate trading impact may be neutral, the long-term success of AINFT will hinge on how effectively the team executes a vision that justifies its new, AI-infused name. It represents a deliberate step into a future where digital ownership is increasingly intelligent and interactive. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Do I need to swap my old APENFT tokens for new AINFT tokens? A: No. The change is purely in name and ticker. Your existing tokens on Bithumb are automatically recognized as AINFT . Q: Will the token contract address change? A: Based on Bithumb’s announcement, the rebrand appears to be an exchange-level update. The underlying blockchain contract address may remain the same, but always verify this with official project channels for actions on decentralized platforms. Q: Why did they change the name from APENFT to AINFT? A> While not explicitly stated, the new name strongly suggests a strategic refocusing or enhanced emphasis on the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with NFTs, aligning with current tech trends. Q: How does this affect the price or trading of the token? A: Short-term price action is unpredictable. Fundamentally, a rebrand alone doesn’t change value; it’s the future development and utility built under the AINFT name that will determine long-term price trajectory. Q: Where can I find more information about the AINFT project’s new roadmap? A> Investors should monitor Bithumb’s official announcements and seek out the official social channels or website for the AINFT project itself for updates on its future direction. Q: Is my AINFT safe on the Bithumb exchange after this change? A> Yes. The rebrand is an administrative update conducted by a major, regulated exchange. It does not affect the security of the tokens held in your Bithumb account. Found this insight into the AINFT rebrand helpful? The crypto world moves fast, and knowledge is power.

Further, VanEck’s lead of Digital Assets Research Matthew Sigel pointed out that Bitcoin’s historical four-year cycle “remains intact” following the early October 2025 high. “That pattern suggests 2026 is more likely a consolidation year than a melt-up or a collapse.” The report titled “Plan for 2026: Predictions from Our Portfolio Managers” presented a stronger and steadier crypto market view on mining economics and the evolution of stablecoins. Bitcoin Lows Are Temporary, Reflects ‘Softer Risk’: Schassler Bitcoin price stands at a critical juncture, after weeks of controlled downside. The price action has narrowed, indicating consolidation rather than renewed selling pressure. Besides, gold surged past $4,500 an ounce for the first time, grabbing the spotlight. However, the analyst remained optimistic about a potential rally, stressing that the current BTC market slump “reflects softer risk appetite and temporary liquidity pressures.” “As debasement ramps, liquidity returns, and Bitcoin historically responds sharply. We have been buying.” Schassler also predicted that the gold surge would continue to $5,000 in 2026, and the bull run would introduce real volatility. The yellow metal is up more than 70% this year and is currently trading past $4,500 per ounce. Strong Fundamental Drivers Behind BTC, ETH Prices in 2026 The crypto industry is moving deeper into integration with traditional finance, with more regulated institutions entering the space. However, Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets, YouHodler, told Cryptonews that prices are expected to have a more gradual, long-term impact rather than generating immediate upside. “The strongest fundamental drivers of BTC and ETH in 2026 will remain macroeconomic,” Lienkha noted. Besides, crypto corporate treasury allocations remain a major catalyst for market momentum in 2026, he added. “In the short and medium term, major cryptocurrencies remain heavily influenced by macroeconomic conditions — particularly interest rates, liquidity trends, and broader risk sentiment.” Additionally, increasing jurisdictions establishing clear and transparent regulatory frameworks for crypto could also facilitate broader institutional participation, Lienkha told Cryptonews. “We are likely to see a significant rise in the involvement of banks and other financial institutions in the market in 2026.” The post VanEck Manager Predicts Strong Bitcoin Comeback in 2026 Despite Its Current ‘Lag’ appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|VanEck,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-12-24 05:37:54

As we look toward 2026, 2027, and beyond, the burning question on every investor’s mind remains: Will DOGE finally reach the elusive $1 milestone? This comprehensive analysis examines the technical indicators, market dynamics, and adoption trends that will shape Dogecoin’s journey through 2030. Understanding Dogecoin’s Current Market Position Before diving into future predictions, we must understand Dogecoin’s present reality. Unlike many cryptocurrencies with complex utility propositions, DOGE thrives on community strength and mainstream recognition. The coin maintains consistent trading volume and remains among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, demonstrating remarkable resilience despite market volatility. Dogecoin Price Prediction 2026: The First Major Test 2026 represents a crucial inflection point for Dogecoin’s valuation. Several factors will influence this Dogecoin price prediction : Mainstream merchant adoption rates Regulatory clarity for meme coins Technological upgrades to the Dogecoin network Overall cryptocurrency market maturity Based on current growth trajectories and historical patterns, conservative estimates place DOGE between $0.35 and $0.65 by late 2026. This range assumes moderate adoption increases without major technological breakthroughs. Will DOGE Reach 1 Dollar by 2027? The $1 question dominates every Dogecoin price prediction discussion. For DOGE to reach this psychological milestone by 2027, several conditions must align perfectly: Required Condition Current Status 2027 Outlook Market Cap Requirement $23 billion ~$140 billion needed Daily Transaction Volume $1-2 billion Need $5-7 billion sustained Active Addresses ~70,000 daily Need 200,000+ daily Merchant Acceptance 2,000+ merchants Need 10,000+ merchants The path to $1 requires either massive retail adoption or significant institutional investment. While challenging, the 2027 timeline remains plausible if cryptocurrency adoption accelerates beyond current projections. Dogecoin 2030: Long-Term Vision and Realistic Targets Looking further ahead to our Dogecoin 2030 forecast, we enter more speculative territory. By this decade’s end, several paradigm shifts could transform Dogecoin’s utility: Potential integration with major social media platforms for tipping and transactions Enhanced blockchain capabilities through proposed Dogecoin upgrades Possible recognition as a legitimate digital currency by more governments Evolution from pure meme coin to hybrid utility token Realistic Dogecoin 2030 price targets range from $1.50 to $3.00 in bullish scenarios, while conservative models suggest $0.75 to $1.25. The wider spread reflects increasing uncertainty further into the future. Key Factors Influencing This Cryptocurrency Forecast Every cryptocurrency forecast carries inherent uncertainty, but these specific elements will determine Dogecoin’s trajectory: Positive Catalysts: Elon Musk’s continued endorsement, integration with X (formerly Twitter) payments, successful Dogecoin Foundation initiatives, broader retail adoption during bull markets. Potential Headwinds: Regulatory crackdowns on meme coins, technological stagnation, community fragmentation, competition from newer meme cryptocurrencies. The most reliable cryptocurrency forecast models weigh these factors against historical performance during previous market cycles. The Meme Coin Future: Beyond Just Dogecoin Understanding Dogecoin’s potential requires examining the broader meme coin future . These assets face unique challenges and opportunities: Dependence on community engagement rather than technical fundamentals Higher volatility compared to utility-focused cryptocurrencies Greater susceptibility to social media trends and influencer opinions Potential for rapid adoption during cultural moments The meme coin future will likely see increased differentiation, with some projects evolving beyond their origins while others fade into obscurity. Dogecoin’s first-mover advantage and established brand provide significant staying power. Expert Opinions and Conflicting Predictions Financial analysts and cryptocurrency experts remain divided on Dogecoin’s prospects: Bullish View: Proponents point to Dogecoin’s unmatched brand recognition, low transaction fees compared to Bitcoin, and passionate community as foundations for sustained growth. Some analysts suggest $1 represents only an intermediate target, with $5-10 possible in extreme bull markets. Bearish Perspective: Skeptics emphasize Dogecoin’s inflationary supply model, lack of technical innovation compared to newer blockchains, and dependence on celebrity endorsements rather than fundamental utility. They argue that without significant technological upgrades, Dogecoin may struggle to maintain its position. Actionable Insights for Dogecoin Investors Based on our comprehensive analysis, consider these strategies: Dollar-Cost Averaging: Regular investments can mitigate timing risks in volatile markets Portfolio Allocation: Limit Dogecoin exposure to a percentage appropriate for high-risk assets Exit Strategy: Define clear profit-taking and loss-limiting parameters before investing Stay Informed: Monitor Dogecoin development proposals and community initiatives Frequently Asked Questions What is Dogecoin’s maximum supply? Unlike Bitcoin’s fixed supply, Dogecoin has an inflationary model with approximately 5 billion new coins created annually. This means there’s no hard cap on total supply. Who created Dogecoin? Dogecoin was created in 2013 by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer as a lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin. How does Elon Musk influence Dogecoin? Elon Musk , CEO of Tesla and X , has significantly impacted Dogecoin through public endorsements and discussions about potential integration with his companies. Can Dogecoin be used for actual purchases? Yes, thousands of merchants accept Dogecoin, including some major companies through payment processors. The Dogecoin Foundation actively promotes merchant adoption. What’s the difference between Dogecoin and other meme coins? Dogecoin boasts the largest market capitalization, longest history, and most recognized brand among meme coins. Its proof-of-work consensus mechanism differs from many newer meme coins built on other blockchains. Conclusion: The Realistic Path Forward Dogecoin’s journey to $1 represents more than just a price milestone—it symbolizes the maturation of meme coins as a legitimate cryptocurrency category. While our analysis suggests the $1 target remains challenging for 2026-2027, it becomes increasingly plausible as we approach 2030. Success depends on balancing Dogecoin’s unique community-driven appeal with tangible utility improvements. Investors should approach with cautious optimism, recognizing both the unprecedented opportunities and substantial risks inherent in this distinctive digital asset.

Chainlink has established itself as a critical infrastructure project in the blockchain ecosystem, but investors are asking one crucial question: can LINK price reach the coveted $100 milestone? As we look toward 2026, 2027, and beyond to 2030, understanding the factors that could drive Chainlink’s valuation requires examining both technical fundamentals and market dynamics. The journey to $100 won’t be straightforward, but several compelling developments suggest this target might be within reach for the leading oracle network. Understanding Chainlink’s Current Market Position Chainlink operates as a decentralized oracle network that connects smart contracts with real-world data. Unlike many cryptocurrencies that serve primarily as digital currencies, LINK has a clear utility function within the blockchain ecosystem. The token is used to pay node operators for retrieving data from external sources and delivering it to smart contracts. This fundamental utility creates consistent demand for LINK tokens, which forms the basis for any serious Chainlink price prediction analysis. The current adoption metrics tell a promising story. Chainlink secures tens of billions in value across multiple blockchain networks and has established partnerships with major traditional financial institutions and technology companies. This institutional adoption provides a solid foundation for future growth that many speculative tokens lack. Chainlink Price Prediction 2026: The Foundation Year Looking toward 2026, several factors will influence LINK’s price trajectory. The continued expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications represents the most significant growth driver. As more financial products move on-chain, the demand for reliable oracle services will increase proportionally. Chainlink’s established position as the market leader in this sector gives it a substantial competitive advantage. Key factors for 2026 Chainlink price prediction include: Enterprise adoption of blockchain technology Expansion of Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) Integration with traditional financial systems Development of new oracle use cases beyond DeFi Market analysts generally project a conservative range of $40-60 for LINK by 2026, assuming continued steady growth in the broader cryptocurrency market and successful execution of Chainlink’s development roadmap. LINK Price Analysis for 2027: The Acceleration Phase By 2027, we expect to see accelerated adoption of blockchain technology across multiple industries. Chainlink’s oracle services will likely become increasingly integrated into supply chain management, insurance, gaming, and other sectors beyond traditional finance. This diversification of use cases could significantly increase demand for LINK tokens. Factor Bullish Scenario Bearish Scenario Market Adoption Widespread enterprise integration Slow regulatory approval Technology Development Successful scaling solutions Technical challenges with new features Competition Maintained market leadership Increased competition from new projects Regulatory Environment Clear, favorable regulations Restrictive policies affecting DeFi The 2027 LINK price prediction becomes more optimistic if Chainlink successfully executes its vision of becoming the standard middleware for all blockchain applications. Price targets in the $60-85 range appear reasonable under moderate growth conditions, with the potential for higher valuations if market conditions become exceptionally favorable. Cryptocurrency Prediction for Chainlink 2030: The Long-Term Vision Looking all the way to 2030 requires considering both technological evolution and market maturation. By this point, blockchain technology could be deeply integrated into global financial systems and various other industries. Chainlink’s position as a critical infrastructure provider would be firmly established if current development trends continue. The $100 target for LINK becomes increasingly plausible when considering: Total addressable market expansion as blockchain adoption grows Network effects strengthening Chainlink’s competitive position Potential tokenomics adjustments to increase scarcity or utility Broader cryptocurrency market growth over a six-year timeframe While reaching $100 would require significant market capitalization growth, it remains within the realm of possibility if Chainlink maintains its leadership position and the broader cryptocurrency market continues to expand. A realistic Chainlink 2030 price prediction might range from $80 to $120, with the upper end representing optimal conditions across technology, adoption, and market factors. Will LINK Price Reach $100? The Critical Factors The question of whether LINK can reach $100 depends on several converging factors. Market sentiment, technological development, competitive landscape, and regulatory environment will all play crucial roles. Chainlink’s team, led by Sergey Nazarov , has demonstrated consistent execution capability, which provides confidence in their ability to navigate these challenges. Key milestones that could signal progress toward the $100 target include: Significant increase in total value secured (TVS) by Chainlink oracles Expansion into new industry verticals beyond finance Successful implementation of staking mechanisms that increase token utility Partnerships with major traditional corporations Investors should monitor these developments closely, as they will provide early indicators of whether the $100 LINK price prediction is becoming more or less likely over time. Risks and Challenges for Chainlink’s Growth No cryptocurrency prediction can ignore potential risks. For Chainlink, these include technological competition from projects like Band Protocol and API3 , regulatory uncertainty affecting the broader DeFi ecosystem, and execution risks associated with scaling the network to meet growing demand. Additionally, macroeconomic factors that affect the entire cryptocurrency market will inevitably influence LINK’s price trajectory regardless of Chainlink’s specific fundamentals. Understanding these risks is essential for developing a balanced perspective on Chainlink’s future potential. While the path to $100 exists, it is not guaranteed and will require navigating multiple challenges successfully. Conclusion: A Measured Optimism for Chainlink’s Future Chainlink occupies a unique and increasingly important position within the blockchain ecosystem. As the bridge between smart contracts and real-world data, its utility is fundamental to the expansion of decentralized applications. Our analysis suggests that while reaching $100 presents challenges, it remains a plausible target within the 2026-2030 timeframe under favorable conditions. The most likely scenario involves gradual progress toward this milestone, with potential acceleration if certain technological and adoption thresholds are crossed. Investors should maintain realistic expectations while recognizing Chainlink’s strong fundamentals and market position. The journey to $100 will test both the technology and the team, but Chainlink has consistently demonstrated its capability to meet such challenges.

As investors and enthusiasts watch its volatile price swings, one question dominates the conversation: Can the Pepe memecoin reach the elusive 1 cent mark? This comprehensive analysis dives deep into PEPE price predictions from 2026 through 2030, examining the factors that could propel it to new heights or anchor it in its current range. We’ll separate hype from reality and explore what it would truly take for this frog-themed token to make the monumental leap. Understanding the PEPE Memecoin Phenomenon Before we dive into specific PEPE price prediction numbers, it’s crucial to understand what we’re analyzing. PEPE emerged in 2023 as a tribute to the iconic ‘Pepe the Frog’ internet meme, riding the wave of community-driven, social media-fueled cryptocurrencies. Unlike projects with complex whitepapers and utility promises, PEPE’s value proposition is rooted entirely in culture, community, and the speculative nature of meme assets. Its explosive initial growth demonstrated the immense power of viral trends in the modern crypto landscape, but also highlighted the extreme volatility and risk inherent in such assets. The Pepe memecoin exists in a unique space where traditional financial metrics often take a backseat to social sentiment and online engagement. Key Factors Influencing PEPE Price Predictions Creating a reliable cryptocurrency forecast for an asset like PEPE requires examining multiple dimensions beyond simple chart patterns. Several critical factors will determine whether PEPE can sustain growth over the coming years: Market Sentiment and Hype Cycles: As a memecoin, PEPE’s price is exceptionally sensitive to social media trends, influencer endorsements, and overall crypto market enthusiasm. Broader Crypto Market Conditions: PEPE typically moves in correlation with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. A sustained bull market provides the essential liquidity and risk appetite needed for memecoin speculation. Community Development and Utility: While currently minimal, any development of actual utility, partnerships, or ecosystem expansion could significantly alter its valuation model. Regulatory Environment: Increasing regulatory scrutiny on cryptocurrencies, particularly those deemed purely speculative, could impact trading access and investor sentiment. Competitive Landscape: The emergence of new memecoins constantly vies for the same speculative capital and community attention. PEPE Price Prediction 2026: The First Major Test By 2026, the crypto market will have undergone another full cycle from the anticipated 2024-2025 bull run. Our PEPE price prediction for this period considers a post-halving market environment. If PEPE survives the inevitable bear market that typically follows a bull run and maintains a dedicated community, a realistic target range could be between $0.000008 and $0.000015. This represents significant growth from current levels but remains far from the 1 cent dream. Achieving even the upper end of this range would require PEPE to maintain cultural relevance and avoid being displaced by the next viral memecoin sensation. The key question for 2026 will be whether PEPE transitions from a pure meme to a project with some sustainable elements. PEPE Price Prediction 2027: Building on Foundations The 2027 forecast depends heavily on what happens in the preceding years. If the Pepe memecoin establishes itself as a enduring brand within crypto culture—similar to how Dogecoin survived multiple cycles—we could see it begin to decouple slightly from pure hype-driven movements. A potential range of $0.000012 to $0.000025 is plausible if broader market conditions are favorable and the project demonstrates any form of development or expanded use cases. However, this still represents a market capitalization in the billions, requiring substantial sustained investment and belief. The memecoin analysis for this period must account for whether PEPE can attract more institutional or long-term holders, rather than just short-term speculators. PEPE Price Prediction 2030: The Long-Term Vision Looking further ahead to 2030, predictions become increasingly speculative. The extreme best-case scenario for PEPE enthusiasts involves the token reaching somewhere between $0.0001 and $0.0005. Even this optimistic range falls a full order of magnitude short of 1 cent. To put the 1 cent target in perspective: at a price of $0.01, PEPE would require a market capitalization approaching or exceeding $500 billion—a figure comparable to today’s entire cryptocurrency market cap outside of Bitcoin. While not mathematically impossible in a scenario of extreme hyper-adoption and currency devaluation, it represents a monumental challenge that goes far beyond typical cryptocurrency forecast models. A more grounded PEPE coin future involves establishing itself as a top-tier memecoin with periodic surges during market euphoria phases. The Monumental Challenge: Can PEPE Realistically Reach 1 Cent? Let’s address the central question directly. For the Pepe memecoin to reach $0.01, several unprecedented events would need to occur simultaneously: Requirement Explanation Probability Massive Supply Reduction A token burn of 90-99% of circulating supply Very Low Hyper-Adoption PEPE becoming a widely used payment method or store of value Extremely Low Extreme Market Inflation Global economic conditions devaluing fiat currencies dramatically Unpredictable Cultural Domination PEPE becoming a globally recognized symbol beyond crypto Low While the community’s hope is powerful, a sober memecoin analysis suggests that reaching 1 cent is more of a symbolic rallying cry than a realistic financial target under current parameters. The mathematics of market capitalization present a formidable barrier. This doesn’t mean significant gains are impossible—only that expectations should be calibrated to the token’s fundamental nature and the scale of the cryptocurrency market. Risks and Considerations for PEPE Investors Any discussion of PEPE price prediction must include a frank assessment of risks. Memecoins represent the highest-risk segment of the cryptocurrency market. Their value is not derived from cash flow, technological innovation, or asset backing, but from collective belief and cultural momentum. This makes them vulnerable to sudden sentiment shifts, celebrity tweets, regulatory crackdowns, and community infighting. Furthermore, the sheer number of competing memecoins creates constant dilution of attention and capital. Investors should only allocate funds they are prepared to lose entirely and view PEPE as a speculative entertainment asset rather than a foundational investment. The PEPE coin future is inherently unpredictable. Actionable Insights for Navigating PEPE’s Future Rather than focusing solely on the distant 1 cent dream, consider these practical approaches: Dollar-Cost Averaging: If believing in the long-term cryptocurrency forecast for PEPE, small, regular investments can mitigate timing risk. Community Participation: Active engagement in PEPE communities can provide early signals about sentiment shifts and development news. Portfolio Balance: Treat PEPE as a high-risk, high-potential-reward satellite holding within a diversified crypto portfolio. Exit Strategy Definition: Determine specific price targets or conditions for taking profits or cutting losses before emotions take over. Continuous Research: Stay updated on not just PEPE, but overall memecoin trends and broader market conditions that drive speculative assets. Conclusion: The Realistic Path Forward for PEPE The journey of the Pepe memecoin from internet joke to serious financial discussion topic is a testament to the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency. While our analysis suggests that reaching 1 cent by 2030 requires a scenario bordering on the miraculous, this doesn’t diminish the potential for substantial percentage gains from current levels. The true value of PEPE may lie not in hitting an arbitrary price point, but in its role as a cultural touchstone and gateway asset for new crypto participants. As with all memecoins, success will be measured in community resilience, cultural impact, and the ability to capture moments of market euphoria. The most realistic PEPE price prediction involves periodic surges during bull markets, with consolidation in between, as the project navigates the challenging landscape of sustaining relevance in an attention-driven economy.

This comprehensive analysis examines the key factors that will shape Bitcoin’s trajectory through the next halving cycle and beyond, providing data-driven insights for strategic investors. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Understanding the Foundation Making accurate Bitcoin price predictions requires analyzing multiple interconnected factors. Historical patterns, particularly around halving events, provide valuable context. The 2024 halving reduced block rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, setting the stage for supply dynamics that will influence prices through 2026 and beyond. Market cycles typically follow a four-year pattern, with post-halving years often showing significant appreciation. Several fundamental drivers will determine BTC price movements: Institutional adoption through ETFs and corporate treasuries Regulatory developments in major economies Macroeconomic conditions including inflation and interest rates Technological advancements in the Bitcoin network Global adoption as a store of value and payment system BTC Price 2026: The Post-Halving Momentum Year By 2026, Bitcoin will be approximately two years past its 2024 halving, historically a period of significant price appreciation. If past cycles repeat, we could see BTC price reaching levels between $150,000 and $250,000. This projection assumes continued institutional adoption and favorable regulatory environments in key markets. Factor Bullish Scenario Bearish Scenario Institutional Investment $50B+ inflows via ETFs Regulatory restrictions Global Adoption 2-3 major countries adopt as legal tender Limited sovereign adoption Macro Environment Favorable monetary policy Recessionary pressures Bitcoin Halving 2028: The Next Supply Shock The Bitcoin halving 2028 event will reduce block rewards from 3.125 to approximately 1.5625 BTC, creating another significant supply shock. Historically, halving events have preceded major bull markets, though the magnitude of impact may diminish as Bitcoin’s market cap grows. The 2028 halving will occur when Bitcoin is nearly two decades old, potentially coinciding with mainstream financial integration. Key considerations for the 2028 halving cycle: Reduced new supply entering the market daily Potential miner consolidation as rewards decrease Increased focus on transaction fee revenue for network security Possible acceleration of Layer 2 solutions adoption Cryptocurrency Forecast: Bitcoin’s Role in the Broader Market Any comprehensive cryptocurrency forecast must acknowledge Bitcoin’s continued dominance. As the original cryptocurrency, BTC typically sets the tone for the entire digital asset market. By 2027-2028, we expect Bitcoin to maintain its position as the primary reserve asset within the crypto ecosystem, though its dominance percentage may fluctuate based on altcoin innovation cycles. The relationship between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will evolve through several phases: Bitcoin leads market cycles, with altcoins following Increased correlation during risk-off periods Potential decoupling as different use cases mature Bitcoin as collateral and settlement layer for other chains Bitcoin Adoption: The Ultimate Price Driver Sustained Bitcoin adoption represents the most significant factor for long-term price appreciation. Between 2026 and 2030, we anticipate several adoption milestones that could propel BTC price to new heights. These include sovereign wealth fund allocations, central bank digital currency interoperability, and integration with traditional financial infrastructure. Critical adoption metrics to monitor: Number of addresses holding 1+ BTC Institutional custody solutions growth Payment processor integration Developing nation adoption rates Retirement fund allocations 2030 Vision: How High Can Bitcoin Realistically Go? Looking toward 2030, Bitcoin price predictions become more speculative but remain grounded in fundamental analysis. Conservative estimates suggest a range of $500,000 to $1,000,000 per BTC, assuming continued adoption at current rates. More optimistic scenarios, incorporating hyperbitcoinization or significant monetary system disruption, suggest even higher valuations. Several transformative developments could accelerate Bitcoin’s price appreciation: Major reserve currency instability Global debt crisis driving safe-haven demand Technological breakthroughs improving scalability Intergenerational wealth transfer to digital-native investors Climate-positive mining becoming standard Risks and Challenges to Consider While the long-term outlook appears promising, investors must acknowledge significant risks. Regulatory uncertainty remains the primary concern, with potential restrictive legislation in major economies. Technological risks include quantum computing threats to cryptography and network security challenges as block rewards diminish. Market risks encompass liquidity crises, exchange failures, and correlation with traditional risk assets during systemic events. Actionable Insights for Investors Successful navigation of Bitcoin’s price journey requires strategic planning. Dollar-cost averaging remains the most reliable approach for long-term investors. Portfolio allocation should reflect individual risk tolerance, with many experts recommending 1-5% exposure for conservative investors and higher percentages for those with greater risk appetite. Security practices, including proper custody solutions, become increasingly important as holdings grow. FAQs: Bitcoin Price Prediction 2026-2030 What is the most reliable Bitcoin price prediction model? Several models attempt to predict Bitcoin’s price, including the Stock-to-Flow model created by PlanB , but all have limitations. The most reliable approach combines multiple models with fundamental analysis. How will the 2028 Bitcoin halving affect price? Historically, halving events have preceded bull markets due to reduced new supply. However, as Bitcoin matures, the impact may diminish relative to adoption and macroeconomic factors. What companies are driving Bitcoin adoption? Major corporations like MicroStrategy and financial institutions including BlackRock through their ETF products are significant adoption drivers. Technology firms like Block (formerly Square) are also advancing Bitcoin integration. Can Bitcoin reach $1 million by 2030? While possible under optimal conditions, this represents an aggressive prediction requiring accelerated adoption and favorable macroeconomic conditions. More conservative estimates range from $250,000 to $500,000. Who are the most influential voices in Bitcoin predictions? Industry leaders like Adam Back of Blockstream, Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy, and analysts like Peter Brandt provide influential perspectives, though all predictions should be critically evaluated. Conclusion: The Decisive Decade Ahead The period from 2026 to 2030 represents a critical phase in Bitcoin’s evolution from speculative asset to established store of value. While precise price predictions remain challenging, the fundamental trajectory appears upward, driven by increasing scarcity through halving events and expanding global adoption. Investors who maintain a long-term perspective, manage risks appropriately, and stay informed about market developments will be best positioned to benefit from Bitcoin’s continued growth story.

As one of the most researched and fundamentally sound blockchain projects, Cardano continues to capture investor attention despite market volatility. This comprehensive analysis examines ADA’s price trajectory from 2026 through 2030, combining technical analysis, fundamental developments, and expert insights to answer the burning question: Can Cardano reach $2 and beyond? Understanding Cardano’s Current Market Position Cardano stands as a third-generation blockchain platform founded by Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Ethereum. Unlike many cryptocurrencies that prioritize speed over security, Cardano employs a research-first approach, with every upgrade undergoing rigorous academic peer review. This methodology has created one of the most secure and scalable blockchain networks, but it has also meant slower development compared to competitors. As of current market conditions, ADA trades significantly below its all-time high of $3.10 reached in September 2021. The cryptocurrency has faced several challenges: Extended development timelines for key upgrades Competition from faster-moving layer-1 solutions General cryptocurrency market downturns Regulatory uncertainty affecting investor sentiment Despite these challenges, Cardano maintains a strong community and continues to deliver on its roadmap. The successful implementation of smart contracts through the Alonzo upgrade marked a significant milestone, opening the door for decentralized applications and DeFi protocols on the network. Cardano Price Prediction 2026: The Foundation Year By 2026, Cardano’s ecosystem should be substantially more mature. Several key developments are expected to influence ADA’s price: Factor Potential Impact Price Range Estimate Full Hydra implementation High scalability (1M+ TPS) $0.85 – $1.40 DApp ecosystem growth Increased utility and demand +30-50% from baseline Regulatory clarity Institutional adoption Variable based on jurisdiction The cryptocurrency forecast for 2026 depends heavily on broader market conditions. If the crypto market enters another bull cycle, ADA could test the $1.40 resistance level. However, conservative estimates place ADA between $0.85 and $1.20, assuming moderate ecosystem growth and stable market conditions. ADA Price Trajectory for 2027: The Scaling Phase 2027 represents a critical year for Cardano’s long-term valuation. By this time, the network should have fully implemented its scaling solutions, particularly Hydra, which promises to make Cardano one of the fastest and most efficient blockchains. This technical superiority could drive significant adoption. Key factors influencing the ADA price in 2027: Enterprise adoption of Cardano for supply chain and identity solutions Growth of DeFi and NFT markets on Cardano Interoperability with other blockchain networks Staking participation rates and network security Our analysis suggests that if Cardano captures even 5-7% of the total DeFi market by 2027, ADA could reach between $1.50 and $1.80. The $2 target becomes plausible if multiple positive catalysts align, including major partnership announcements and successful implementation of all scaling solutions. Cardano 2030: Long-Term Vision and Valuation Looking toward 2030 requires considering macro trends in blockchain adoption. By this decade’s end, blockchain technology should be integrated into numerous industries, from finance to healthcare to governance. Cardano’s focus on sustainability, security, and peer-reviewed development positions it well for institutional adoption. Several scenarios could unfold for Cardano by 2030: Bull Case: Cardano becomes a leading blockchain for government and enterprise use, with ADA reaching $3-5 Base Case: Steady growth as a top-10 cryptocurrency, with ADA stabilizing around $1.80-2.50 Bear Case: Failure to capture significant market share, with ADA remaining below $1 The most likely scenario involves Cardano maintaining its position as a premium blockchain solution for specific use cases, particularly in developing nations through partnerships like those in Africa. This targeted adoption could drive steady, sustainable growth rather than explosive price movements. Will ADA Price Hit $2? The Critical Analysis The $2 question dominates Cardano discussions. Reaching this milestone requires several conditions: First, Cardano must demonstrate real-world utility beyond speculation. The growing ecosystem of decentralized applications needs to attract substantial user bases. Second, the network must maintain its security and decentralization advantages while achieving competitive transaction speeds and costs. Third, broader cryptocurrency adoption must continue, increasing total market capitalization. Technical analysis of ADA’s price history reveals that $2 represents both a psychological barrier and a key resistance level. Breaking through this level would require: Requirement Current Status 2030 Projection Daily Active Addresses ~100,000 500,000+ Total Value Locked (DeFi) ~$200M $5B+ Network Revenue Minimal Sustainable Based on current growth trajectories and planned developments, our cryptocurrency forecast suggests ADA has a 60-70% probability of reaching $2 between 2027 and 2029. The exact timing depends largely on market cycles and specific catalyst events. Risks and Challenges to Cardano’s Growth No price prediction is complete without considering potential obstacles. For Cardano, several risks could impact its trajectory: Development Delays: Cardano’s methodical approach sometimes results in slower implementation than competitors Competition: Ethereum’s continued dominance and emerging layer-1 solutions create a crowded market Regulation: Unfavorable regulatory developments in major markets could limit growth Technology Risks: Unforeseen technical challenges with scaling solutions or smart contracts Market Risks: Broader economic conditions affecting all cryptocurrency investments Investors should monitor these factors alongside Cardano’s development progress. The project’s transparency through regular updates from Charles Hoskinson and the development team provides valuable insights into addressing these challenges. Investment Strategies for ADA Given the volatility of cryptocurrency markets, consider these approaches to ADA investment: Dollar-Cost Averaging: Regular investments regardless of price fluctuations Staking: Earning rewards while supporting network security Portfolio Allocation: Limiting ADA to a percentage of your total crypto holdings Fundamental Monitoring: Tracking development milestones and ecosystem growth Remember that all cryptocurrency investments carry substantial risk. Only invest what you can afford to lose, and consider your investment horizon. For long-term believers in Cardano’s vision, the 2026-2030 period represents a significant opportunity, but short-term traders may face considerable volatility. Conclusion: The Path Forward for Cardano Cardano’s journey toward $2 and beyond represents more than just price speculation—it reflects the maturation of a fundamentally different approach to blockchain development. While the path contains uncertainties and challenges, Cardano’s commitment to research, security, and sustainable growth provides a solid foundation for long-term value creation. The coming years will test whether Cardano’s methodical approach can compete in an increasingly fast-paced cryptocurrency landscape. Success depends not just on technological achievements but on real-world adoption and utility. For investors, the key is balancing optimism about Cardano’s potential with realistic expectations about timeline and market conditions. As we look toward 2030, Cardano remains one of the most intriguing projects in cryptocurrency, with the potential to redefine how blockchain technology integrates with global systems. Whether ADA reaches $2 becomes less important than whether Cardano achieves its vision of creating a more secure, transparent, and equitable global financial system. Frequently Asked Questions What is Cardano’s main advantage over other cryptocurrencies? Cardano’s primary advantage is its research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach. Founded by Charles Hoskinson , this methodology prioritizes security and formal verification, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring high assurance, such as financial systems and identity solutions. How does Cardano’s proof-of-stake differ from other systems? Cardano uses Ouroboros, a provably secure proof-of-stake protocol developed through academic research. Unlike many proof-of-stake systems, Ouroboros has mathematically proven security properties similar to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work, but with significantly lower energy consumption. What major developments are planned for Cardano? The Cardano roadmap includes several key upgrades: Hydra for layer-2 scaling, Mithril for lightweight client verification, and ongoing improvements to smart contract capabilities. The development is led by Input Output Global (IOG) , with regular updates published through their research portal. Is Cardano a good investment for 2026-2030? Investment suitability depends on individual risk tolerance and investment horizon. Cardano presents a unique value proposition focused on security and sustainability, but like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility risk. Consider consulting with a financial advisor and conducting thorough research before investing. How can I stake my ADA tokens? ADA holders can delegate their tokens to stake pools through compatible wallets like Daedalus or Yoroi. Staking helps secure the network while earning rewards, typically around 4-5% annually. The process is designed to be accessible while maintaining decentralization.

Similar fractal setups in the past have shown that prolonged accumulation phases often precede explosive moves, rewarding patience rather than impulse. If the pattern holds, DOGE’s current calm could simply be the setup before the next major chase begins. A Familiar Fractal Emerges At A Critical Inflection Point According to a latest Dogecoin update by Cryptollica, the broader macro structure is beginning to mirror a familiar historical four-point fractal structure, with price action now sitting at Point 4. This phase closely resembles past pre-bull-run accumulation periods, where extended consolidation laid the groundwork for explosive upside moves. Related Reading: Dogecoin Holds The Floor, But Momentum Says Otherwise — A Critical Standoff Unfolds The first key element of the setup is the rounded bottom formation. Zones 1 and 2 represented long stretches of low volatility and market boredom, and where accumulation took place quietly. Notably, Zone 2 acted as the launchpad for Dogecoin’s powerful 2021 rally. In the current Zone 4, price behavior is once again stabilizing into a rounded base, suggesting a similar accumulation process is underway. Furthermore, the weekly RSI shows a recurring support zone around the 32 level, marked by a red baseline on the chart. Historically, each time RSI dropped to or hovered near the baseline of Points 1, 2, and 3, it marked a macro bottom. At present, RSI has returned to this same critical support area. This reset implies that selling pressure is fading while momentum conditions are aligning for a potential shift back in favor of buyers. Taken together, this setup points to a cyclical reset rather than random market noise. With a bullish rounding bottom in place and RSI sitting at a historical buy zone, the structure suggests Dogecoin may be entering a prime accumulation phase. If the fractal unfolds as it did in past cycles, the current calm could precede a strong impulsive move. $0.138: The Line That Separates Recovery From Stagnation In a more recent update, crypto analyst Kevin explained that a successful reclaim of the $0.138 level on the 3-day to weekly timeframes would mark a major shift for Dogecoin. Such a move would place price back above the macro 0.382 Fibonacci level as well as the 200-week simple moving average. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Stage A 600% Rally In 2026 If This Multi-Year Support Holds This development would be a strong bullish signal, but it is unlikely to happen in isolation. The setup would most likely align with Bitcoin reclaiming the crucial $88,000–$91,000 zone, a range that needs to be recovered to support broader market strength and risk-on momentum. Until those conditions are met, Dogecoin continues to chop within what is considered a long-term dollar-cost-averaging zone, suggesting consolidation persists while the market waits for a decisive macro trigger.

ZOOZ Strategy Ltd disclosed on Monday it received a notification letter from Nasdaq’s Listing Qualifications Department dated December 16. The letter informed ZOOZ that it is no longer compliant with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), which requires a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share on the Capital Market. Nasdaq said the company’s common stock failed to maintain the required bid price, and ZOOZ has until June 15, 2026, to take its shares close at or above $1.00 for at least 10 consecutive trading sessions or it will be removed from the exchange. US-Israeli listed Bitcoin DAT to use ‘available options’ to drive stock price up ZOOZ Strategy, which is also listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, said it is monitoring the situation and is looking at its options if its share price does not recover within the compliance window. The company mentioned one option under consideration is a reverse share split, which could lift their share price without changing overall market capitalization. According to Google Finance data, ZOOZ’s stock has been posting losses for the better part of 2025, tanking by over 84% in the last 12 months. On the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, ZOOZ shares were changing hands at ILA 127.00, down 2.08% on the day. Over the past five days, the stock fell 4.51%, while its six-month performance spells a decline of more than 50%. Looking at its year-to-date figures, the Bitcoin DAT’s shares are down 82% with a 52-week high of just $5 reached in July. ZOOZ’s financial results for the year ending in June garnered a revenue of $123,500, a year-over-year drop of more than 54%. Operating expenses rose by about 5% to $2.65 million, while net income was deeply in the negative column with a loss of $3.52 million. The company is reported to hold a total of 1,036 bitcoins, equivalent to $90 million at current prices. KindlyMD and Nakamoto holdings face similar Nasdaq predicament Just less than a week ago, Bitcoin treasury firm KindlyMD disclosed that it had also received a price-deficiency notice from Nasdaq. The healthcare data company turned digital asset treasury’s shares also traded below the $1.00 mark for 30 consecutive trading days after slipping down the level for the first time this year in early October. KindlyMD was created through a reverse takeover in August by Nakamoto, a Bitcoin-focused holding company founded by David Bailey. The transaction preserved the KindlyMD corporate name while changing the stock ticker, and its shares surged to record highs when the takeover was first announced in May. Per regulatory filings cited in Cryptopolitan’s report , KindlyMD said it plans to monitor its stock price and consider available options, but critics of the digital asset treasury model believe the firm should sell a portion of its 5,398 bitcoins to stabilize its business and improve NAKA’s share price. After the receipt of the Nasdaq notice, Nakamoto authorized a $10 million share repurchase program last week, which is 40% of the $24 million in cash and cash equivalents the firm reported as of September 30. ETHZilla abandons digital asset treasury strategy While ZOOZ and KindlyMD work to preserve their Nasdaq listings, ETH treasury company ETHZilla announced on Monday its exit from the business model by selling $74.5 million worth of its crypto holdings. The company said it sold Ether to reduce debt and “believes its value will be driven by revenue and cash flow growth from RWA tokenization business.” ETHZilla said it is discontinuing the mNAV dashboard on its website effective immediately, although it will still provide periodic balance sheet updates to investors. Less than six months ago, ETHZilla had transitioned into an Ethereum-based digital asset treasury joining several firms accumulating crypto assets as long-term holdings. The Peter Thiel-backed company said it currently holds 69,802 coins, valued at approximately $207 million after the recent asset sales.

One of the most revealing metrics for this is the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio . This data point offers a real-time snapshot of whether traders are leaning bullish or bearish on major exchanges. Let’s break down the latest figures and explore what they truly mean for your trading strategy. What Does the BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Tell Us? The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio measures the percentage of open positions that are long (betting on a price increase) versus short (betting on a price decrease). It’s a powerful sentiment indicator. However, interpreting it requires nuance. A high long ratio doesn’t always mean a price surge is imminent; sometimes, it can signal an overcrowded trade and potential for a sharp reversal. Currently, the aggregate data across major exchanges shows a slight tilt towards the bears. The overall 24-hour ratio stands at Long 48.32% / Short 51.68%. This indicates a marginally cautious or bearish sentiment among futures traders at this moment. Breaking Down the Data: Exchange-by-Exchange Analysis Sentiment is not uniform across all platforms. Each exchange has its own user base and trading culture, which is reflected in its BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio . Here is the latest snapshot from the top three exchanges by open interest: Binance: Long 48.68% / Short 51.32% – The world’s largest exchange shows a clear, though slight, bearish bias. OKX: Long 50.21% / Short 49.79% – Traders on OKX are almost perfectly balanced, with a razor-thin majority leaning long. Bybit: Long 49.7% / Short 50.3% – Similar to Binance, Bybit traders show a minor preference for short positions. This divergence is key. While the overall market is net short, OKX’s near-neutral stance suggests sentiment is fragmented. Traders should therefore avoid making broad assumptions based on a single data point. How to Use This Ratio in Your Trading Strategy So, you have the numbers for the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio . Now what? This metric is most powerful when used as a contrarian indicator or a confirmation tool, not a standalone signal. For instance, an extremely high long ratio (e.g., above 70%) can often precede a “long squeeze,” where over-leveraged longs are forced to sell, driving prices down rapidly. Conversely, extreme short ratios can fuel a “short squeeze” rally. The current ratios are not at extreme levels, suggesting a lack of strong consensus and potentially range-bound price action. Always combine this ratio with other analyses like price action, volume, and on-chain data. A bearish ratio during a strong uptrend might simply indicate healthy skepticism, not an impending crash. The Pitfalls of Relying Solely on Sentiment Data While invaluable, the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio has limitations. It only reflects the sentiment of futures traders, who are often more short-term focused and leveraged than spot market holders. Furthermore, large institutional players or “whales” can open positions that skew the data without reflecting their true market view. Therefore, treat this ratio as a gauge of crowd psychology within a specific segment of the market. It tells you what other leveraged traders are doing, which is useful for anticipating short-term volatility and potential liquidation events. Conclusion: A Tool, Not a Crystal Ball The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio is an essential tool for decoding market sentiment. The current data reveals a cautiously bearish tilt overall, with interesting variations between exchanges like Binance and OKX. This lack of extreme sentiment suggests the market is in a state of equilibrium, waiting for a catalyst. By integrating this metric into a broader analytical framework, you can make more informed decisions and better navigate the volatile waters of cryptocurrency trading. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is a perpetual futures contract? A: A perpetual futures contract is a derivative that allows traders to speculate on an asset’s price without an expiry date, using funding rates to tether it to the spot price. Q: Why does the long/short ratio differ between exchanges? A: Different exchanges cater to different user demographics (retail vs. institutional, geographic regions, etc.), leading to variations in collective trading sentiment and strategy. Q: Is a high long ratio bullish or bearish for Bitcoin? A: It can be both. While it shows bullish sentiment, an excessively high ratio can be a contrarian indicator warning of an overcrowded long trade and potential for a downside correction. Q: How often is this ratio updated? A> The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio is typically calculated and updated every 24 hours, providing a daily snapshot of market positioning. Q: Can this ratio predict Bitcoin’s price? A> No single metric can reliably predict price. This ratio is best used as a sentiment indicator to understand market positioning and potential risks, like squeezes, within a broader analysis.

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, one question dominates conversations among investors and analysts alike: What does the future hold for Ripple XRP? With its unique position in the financial technology space and ongoing legal developments, XRP has captured the attention of the crypto community. This comprehensive Ripple XRP price prediction analysis examines the factors that could drive XRP’s value through 2026-2030 and explores the critical question: Will XRP reach the coveted $5 mark? Understanding XRP Cryptocurrency Fundamentals Before diving into price predictions, it’s essential to understand what makes XRP cryptocurrency unique. Unlike many cryptocurrencies that rely on mining, XRP uses a consensus protocol that validates transactions through a network of trusted validators. This approach offers several advantages: Energy efficiency compared to proof-of-work systems Faster transaction settlement times (3-5 seconds) Lower transaction costs Scalability for institutional use cases Ripple Labs, the company behind XRP, has focused on building partnerships with financial institutions to facilitate cross-border payments. This institutional focus differentiates XRP from many other cryptocurrencies and forms the foundation for its long-term XRP price forecast . The Impact of the Ripple SEC Lawsuit on XRP’s Future No discussion about XRP’s future can ignore the ongoing Ripple SEC lawsuit . The legal battle between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been a significant factor influencing XRP’s price and market perception. The lawsuit’s outcome could have profound implications: Potential Outcome Impact on XRP Price Favorable settlement for Ripple Significant positive price movement Unfavorable ruling Continued regulatory uncertainty Clear regulatory framework Increased institutional adoption The resolution of this legal challenge could remove a major obstacle to XRP’s growth and provide the regulatory clarity needed for broader adoption. XRP Price Forecast: 2026-2030 Analysis Creating an accurate XRP price forecast requires considering multiple factors, including market trends, adoption rates, and macroeconomic conditions. Here’s a detailed breakdown of potential price scenarios: 2026 XRP Price Prediction By 2026, several key developments could influence XRP’s price: Resolution of regulatory challenges Increased adoption by financial institutions Broader cryptocurrency market trends Technological advancements in the Ripple network Based on current growth patterns and potential catalysts, conservative estimates suggest XRP could reach between $1.50 and $2.50 by 2026. More optimistic scenarios, assuming favorable regulatory developments and significant institutional adoption, could push prices toward $3. 2027-2028 XRP Market Analysis The 2027-2028 period represents a critical phase for XRP’s long-term trajectory. Our XRP market analysis suggests several factors will be particularly important: Global regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies Competition from other payment-focused cryptocurrencies Ripple’s success in expanding its partner network Overall cryptocurrency market capitalization growth During this period, XRP could potentially reach price levels between $2.50 and $4, depending on market conditions and adoption rates. 2030: Will XRP Reach $5? The $5 milestone represents a significant psychological and financial barrier for XRP. Achieving this price would require: Widespread institutional adoption of Ripple’s technology Clear and favorable global regulations Significant growth in the overall cryptocurrency market Successful expansion into new financial use cases While reaching $5 by 2030 is possible under optimal conditions, it represents an ambitious target that would require multiple positive developments aligning simultaneously. Key Factors Influencing XRP Price Prediction Several critical factors will determine whether our Ripple XRP price prediction materializes: Adoption by Financial Institutions Ripple’s primary value proposition lies in its utility for financial institutions. Increased adoption by banks and payment providers would: Increase demand for XRP as a bridge currency Demonstrate real-world utility Build credibility in traditional finance circles Technological Developments Ongoing improvements to the XRP Ledger and Ripple’s technology stack could enhance XRP’s competitive advantages. Key areas to watch include: Transaction speed improvements Security enhancements Interoperability with other blockchain networks Developer tools and ecosystem growth Market Competition XRP faces competition from both traditional financial systems and other cryptocurrencies. Successful navigation of this competitive landscape will be crucial for long-term price growth. Risks and Challenges in XRP Market Analysis While the potential for growth exists, investors must consider several risks: Regulatory uncertainty in key markets Competition from central bank digital currencies Market volatility affecting all cryptocurrencies Dependence on Ripple Labs’ business success Technological risks and security concerns A comprehensive XRP market analysis must account for these challenges when evaluating potential price movements. Expert Opinions and Alternative Scenarios Financial analysts and cryptocurrency experts offer varying perspectives on XRP’s future. While some are optimistic about reaching $5 or higher, others caution that regulatory challenges could limit growth. Most agree that XRP’s future price will depend heavily on: The outcome of regulatory proceedings Adoption rates among financial institutions Overall cryptocurrency market trends Technological advancements and competition FAQs: Common Questions About XRP Price Prediction What is the highest price XRP could reach by 2030? While predictions vary, some optimistic scenarios suggest XRP could reach between $5 and $10 by 2030 under ideal conditions, including widespread adoption and favorable regulations. How does the Ripple SEC lawsuit affect XRP price predictions? The SEC lawsuit against Ripple Labs creates significant uncertainty. A favorable resolution could trigger substantial price increases, while unfavorable outcomes could limit growth potential. What makes XRP different from other cryptocurrencies? XRP focuses primarily on facilitating cross-border payments for financial institutions, using a consensus mechanism rather than mining. This gives it different use cases and value propositions compared to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum . Can XRP reach $100 like some predictions suggest? While theoretically possible, reaching $100 would require extraordinary circumstances, including massive adoption and market conditions that significantly exceed current expectations. Most analysts consider this highly unlikely in the foreseeable future. What should investors consider when evaluating XRP price predictions? Investors should consider multiple factors, including regulatory developments, adoption rates, market competition, and overall cryptocurrency market trends. Diversification and risk management remain important principles. Conclusion: The Path Forward for XRP The journey toward $5 for XRP represents both opportunity and challenge. While the potential exists for significant growth, particularly if regulatory issues resolve favorably and adoption increases, investors must approach XRP with realistic expectations and thorough research. The cryptocurrency market remains volatile, and predictions should be viewed as educated estimates rather than guarantees. The most compelling aspect of XRP’s story is its focus on solving real-world financial problems. Unlike many cryptocurrencies that prioritize speculation, XRP aims to improve the efficiency of global payments. This practical focus could ultimately drive its long-term value, regardless of short-term price fluctuations.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin has yet to break $100,000 when adjusted for inflation, Galaxy Research says. Dollar purchasing power has fallen roughly 20% since 2020, altering Bitcoin’s real peak. Inflation and dollar weakness continue to support the debasement trade narrative. Galaxy’s head of research, Alex Thorn, said Tuesday that Bitcoin never crossed six figures when adjusted for inflation using 2020 dollars, despite the asset reaching an all-time high above $126,000 in October. “If you adjust the price of Bitcoin for inflation using 2020 dollars, BTC never crossed $100,000,” Thorn said. “It actually topped at $99,848 in 2020 dollar terms.” Galaxy Research Adjusts Bitcoin Price Using CPI to Account for Inflation Thorn’s analysis adjusts Bitcoin’s price using changes in the US Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks inflation based on the cost of a basket of goods and services. His calculation accounts for the gradual erosion of purchasing power across each inflation reading from 2020 through today. According to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, CPI rose 2.7% over the past 12 months as of November, continuing a trend that has significantly weakened the dollar’s buying power. Since 2020, the US dollar has lost roughly 20% of its value, meaning that prices today are about 1.25 times higher than they were four years ago. In practical terms, a dollar now buys only about 80% of what it could in 2020. When Bitcoin’s recent peak is viewed through that lens, the psychological six-figure threshold remains just out of reach in real terms, Galaxy Research data shows. The inflation backdrop remains a key factor shaping market narratives. US inflation surged above 9% in mid-2022 during the COVID-19 era and, while it has cooled, it is still running above the Federal Reserve’s long-term 2% target. if you adjust the price of bitcoin for inflation using 2020 dollars, BTC never crossed $100k it actually topped at $99,848 in 2020 dollar terms, if you can believe it pic.twitter.com/bo3UGfBXbY — Alex Thorn (@intangiblecoins) December 22, 2025 At the same time, the US dollar has come under pressure in global markets. The Dollar Currency Index (DXY), which measures the dollar against a basket of major currencies, is down 11% year-to-date and recently traded near 97.8, according to TradingView. The index touched a three-year low of 96.3 in September and has broadly trended lower since late 2022. This combination of persistent inflation and dollar weakness has fueled what traders often call the “debasement trade,” where investors rotate into assets they believe can preserve value as fiat currencies lose purchasing power. Bitcoin Remains Tied to Fed Policy as Inflation Eases Slowly, Analyst Says According to Linh Tran, market analyst at XS.com, Bitcoin’s recent price action underscores the market’s sensitivity to monetary policy expectations rather than headline economic data. While US inflation has eased from last year’s highs, the latest consumer price index reading of 2.7% suggests that the disinflation process remains slow and uneven, forcing “the Fed to maintain a cautious stance, making it difficult to pivot quickly toward an aggressive easing cycle,” Tran said in a note shared with Cryptonews.com. Last week, K33 also said Bitcoin’s prolonged sell-side pressure from long-term holders may be approaching its limits after years of steady distribution.

The USD1 market cap just executed a stunning vertical climb, adding nearly $50 million in supply almost overnight. This explosive growth follows a single, powerful catalyst: Binance’s promotional 20% Annual Percentage Rate (APR) offer. Let’s break down how this Trump-associated digital dollar is making waves. What Sparked the USD1 Market Cap Explosion? According to reports from Wu Blockchain, the trigger was clear. Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, launched a limited-time promotion featuring USD1. The offer? A compelling 20% APR for users who stake or hold the stablecoin on their platform. This high-yield opportunity acted like a magnet, pulling in massive capital. Consequently, the circulating supply of USD1 ballooned by 45.6 million tokens in a short period. This direct inflow of capital is the primary driver behind the surging USD1 market cap , which now sits impressively above $2.79 billion. Understanding USD1: More Than Just a Stablecoin Before this surge, USD1 flew somewhat under the radar for many crypto enthusiasts. It’s crucial to understand its background. USD1 is the stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial (WLFI). This entity has notable associations with the Trump family, adding a layer of political and media intrigue to its financial mechanics. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins, USD1 aims to maintain its 1:1 peg with the US dollar through traditional reserve backing. The recent USD1 market cap growth highlights a key trend: exchange promotions can significantly accelerate adoption and liquidity for newer stablecoin entrants. Why Did Binance’s 20% APR Work So Well? In a low-yield traditional finance environment, a 20% return is exceptionally attractive. Binance’s promotion tapped into a universal investor desire: high, safe yields. For context, most bank savings accounts offer less than 1% APR. Here’s why the strategy was effective: High Perceived Value: A 20% APR on a dollar-pegged asset presents a low-risk, high-reward scenario for many. Trust in the Platform: Binance’s vast user base provided instant scale and credibility. Liquidity Incentive: The promotion directly incentivizes holding and staking, reducing sell pressure and boosting network metrics. This perfect storm of factors is why we witnessed such a dramatic impact on the USD1 market cap . What Are the Implications of This Surge? This event is more than a temporary spike; it offers several key insights into the crypto market. First, it demonstrates the immense power of central exchanges (CEXs) like Binance to influence asset distribution and valuation almost overnight. Second, it shows that the stablecoin arena remains fiercely competitive, with new players using aggressive tactics to gain market share. Finally, the connection to high-profile figures can amplify market movements, drawing attention from both crypto-native and mainstream audiences. Monitoring the USD1 market cap stability post-promotion will be critical to understanding its long-term viability. The Bottom Line: A Lesson in Market Dynamics The dramatic rise in the USD1 market cap is a textbook case of incentive-driven growth in cryptocurrency. Binance’s high-yield promotion created immediate, measurable demand, proving that strategic exchange support can be a game-changer for asset liquidity. However, the true test for USD1 will be maintaining its peg and market position after the promotional APR period ends. For investors, it’s a reminder to always look beyond the yield to the fundamental backing and long-term use case of any stablecoin. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is USD1? USD1 is a US dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial (WLFI), an entity associated with the Trump family. It aims to maintain a 1:1 value with the USD. Why did the USD1 market cap increase so quickly? The primary catalyst was a Binance promotion offering a 20% Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for users holding USD1 on the exchange, which spurred massive buying and staking activity. Is the 20% APR from Binance still available? Promotional rates like these are typically limited-time offers. You must check Binance’s official announcements and savings products for the most current availability and terms. How is USD1 different from USDT or USDC? Unlike the more established USDT (Tether) and USDC (Circle), USD1 is a newer stablecoin with specific backing from WLFI and notable political associations. Its market share is significantly smaller. Is investing in USD1 for the high APR safe? While the yield is attractive, all investments carry risk. It’s essential to research the issuer’s transparency, reserve audits, and understand that promotional rates are not permanent. Can the USD1 market cap continue to grow? Future growth depends on continued adoption, utility beyond promotional yields, and maintaining trust in its peg. Sustaining momentum after the promotion ends is the key challenge.

56277033,648114,1766559609,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56277033.jpeg,"67% Of Ethereum Stablecoin Transfers Are P2P, Yet Institutions Dominate Volume",https://bitcoinist.com/67-ethereum-stablecoin-p2p-yet-institutions-volume/,"Data shows 67% of Ethereum transactions involving the stablecoins USDT and USDC are P2P in nature, but the majority of volume lies elsewhere. Business-Related Ethereum Stablecoin Transactions Dominate Volume In a new post on X, Ethereum Foundation head of ecosystem James has shared some numbers related to stablecoin transactions on the ETH blockchain. Stablecoins refer to cryptocurrencies that have their value pegged to a fiat currency. As these assets are relatively “stable” by nature, they have quickly established themselves as the preferred mode of payments, with their volume surpassing combined that of the top five non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies. But what does the nature of these transactions look like? Below is the data posted by James, showcasing how the transfers related to the Ethereum versions of USDT and USDC break down between retail and business payments. As is visible in the chart, 67% of USDT and USDC transactions on the Ethereum network that occurred between August 2024 and 2025 were of the peer-to-peer (P2P) type. Such transactions are usually a sign of activity from retail users. The small size of the users being involved could be why the transaction volume share of P2P transfers was just 24%. In contrast, business-involved payments made up for 76% of the volume, despite occupying a transactions share of just 33%. The Ethereum Foundation member sourced the data from Artemis’ report on Ethereum stablecoin payment usage. While stablecoins pegged to various currencies exist, Artemis focused on the USD-tied USDC and USDT as they are by far the most popular options, occupying 88% of the sector’s market cap. These coins circulate on several blockchains, but Ethereum is currently the most dominant network, hosting more than 50% of the global stablecoin supply. “We also only focus on transfer transactions and exclude any mint, burn, or bridge transactions from our analysis,” noted the report. Artemis has broken down how it classifies transactions. Transfers are considered P2P if they occur between the externally owned accounts (EOAs) of two separate users. Determining whether a transaction is P2P can be tricky, however, given that it’s not always possible to determine whether two accounts are owned by different entities. Problems also arise for wallets owned by exchanges and other centralized entities. “In our dataset we are able to label many institutional and firm EOA wallets; however, the labeling is not perfect and some EOA wallets that are owned by firms and are not documented in our dataset can be mislabeled as individual wallets,” explained the report. The second category is business-to-business (B2B), naturally consisting of the moves taking place between two institutional EOAs.

All three were bear market years, and 2025 isn’t, leading analysts and experts to ask: Is something broken? Many are specifically pointing at October 10, which saw BTC prices crash 10%, losing over $12,000 in a day or so in the industry’s largest leverage flush. “WTF happened on October 10th? Exchanges are saying they are fine. Market Makers are saying they are fine,” asked analyst ‘Max Crypto’ who added that crypto prices feel like a few big entities are selling non-stop. “This has really started to feel like a Luna event, when everyone said that we are fine, and it ended horribly.” WTF happened on October 10th? Exchanges are saying they are fine. MMs are saying they are fine. And the crypto prices feel like a few big entities are selling non-stop. This has really started to feel like Luna event, when everyone said that we are fine and it ended horribly. pic.twitter.com/D9RNefKgT7 — Max Crypto (@MaxCrypto) December 23, 2025 Did October 10 Break Crypto? “Oct. 10 was the pivotal moment to where we sit today, and the overhang of ‘Crashtober’ still haunts us,” said investor George Bodine. The October 10 calamity occurred coincident with record runs in gold and silver, both of which did have momentum, he said before adding, “I have never seen the fundamentals behind Bitcoin as strong as this year.” “October 10 wasn’t just ugly – it exposed problems that still haven’t been fixed, which is why the market feels so bad even now,” said crypto analyst Scott Melker. Liquidity remains severely compromised, and market makers have become more cautious, not less, making this worse than before, he said. Additionally, altcoins show no genuine recovery, bleeding whenever Bitcoin weakens without attracting new capital. This indicates money is exiting the market entirely rather than rotating between assets, contrary to what healthy market behavior would show. “October 10 broke something psychologically. It reminded everyone that this market can still just… fall apart. And once that realization sets in, behavior changes for a long time.” Until liquidity, participation, and conviction come back together, rallies will feel fragile, and selloffs will feel fast, he said. Is It All That Bad? Analyst ‘CrediBULL Crypto’ opined that the event didn’t break anything. “It was a massive deleveraging event, however, and we can see aggregate OI [open interest] has been bleeding ever since – which means confidence in positioning via perps has definitely taken a hit.” They said that if the price bottoms in this region and continues to rise, “we will see traders come back to the market like they always do, and OI will begin to rise once more.” Less leverage in the system is not a bad thing, “as it simply means this next rally is even more sustainable than the prior one.” Bitcoin was trading down on the day, struggling to maintain momentum above $87,000 at the time of writing.

This Friday, December 26, more than $23 billion worth of Bitcoin options are set to expire, marking the largest options expiration in the cryptocurrency’s history. How $23 Billion Roll-Off May Impact Bitcoin Prices Market expert NoLimit took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to elucidate the significance of this event. Understanding options expiration is crucial to grasping its potential impact on the market. In the expert’s words, options are leveraged bets on the future price of Bitcoin: call options anticipate an increase in price, while put options anticipate a decrease. When these options expire, one of two things happens: either they expire worthless, or they trigger hedging actions that necessitate buying or selling in the spot market. Related Reading: XRP Price Forecasts For 2026 Unveiled By AI Simulation: Should Investors Remain Bullish? With a massive $23.6 billion worth of Bitcoin options rolling off at once, a substantial amount of risk is being removed from dealer books in a single day. This clearing of positions is a primary driver of volatility. For perspective, previous year-end expiries have been significantly smaller: around $6 billion in 2021, $2.4 billion in 2022, $11 billion in 2023, and $19.8 billion in 2024. The sheer scale of this upcoming expiry highlights a shift in the market landscape, indicating that it is now largely shaped by institutional investors rather than retail traders. The specificity of this Friday is particularly noteworthy. Dealers have strategically hedged their positions around key Bitcoin price levels, and as the options expiry arrives, these hedges will be unwound. This process could lead to sharp price movements in either direction, especially given the current low-liquidity conditions in the market. The holiday season has resulted in diminished trading volume, which means that individual orders can impact prices more dramatically—potentially leading to violent price swings. Key Price Ranges Adding to the complexity, fellow market analyst MartyParty highlighted that significant gamma exposure is clustered in critical price ranges, particularly between $86,000 and $110,000. Estimates suggest that high gamma—around $238 million or more in notional sensitivity—will expire, amplifying volatility through delta-hedging flows as Friday approaches. The maximum pain point, where Bitcoin option sellers face the greatest loss, is pegged at $96,000.

This suggests a cautious but persistent optimism for a potential “Santa rally,” according to the analysts. The risk reversals also indicate a softening of bearish sentiment as Bitcoin’s spot price stabilizes. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $87,292, having recorded a loss of 2.5% in the past 24 hours and a 30% gap between the current trading price and the record high.

In a recent post accompanied by diagrams of the XRP Ledger’s consensus flow, he challenges prevailing assumptions about what decentralization should mean in practice. The focus is not solely on popularity or open participation, but on whether a system can deliver reliability and correctness at scale. According to X Finance Bull, many critics misunderstand XRP because they frame decentralization only in terms of being public. He argues directly that “Decentralization isn’t just about being public, it’s about being reliable,” setting the tone for a broader assessment of how the XRP Ledger reaches agreement across its network. What Crypto Maxis Don’t Understand About $XRP Decentralization isn't just about being public, it's about being reliable. Study the XRP Ledger Consensus Flow. The XRPL reaches consensus in seconds with no central coordinator and no waste. And it halts progress instead of… pic.twitter.com/YlGrgC6YTx — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) December 20, 2025 Consensus Without Central Coordination At the center of his argument is the XRP Ledger’s consensus mechanism. The attached images outline how validators propose transactions, compare results, and converge on a single ledger version in successive rounds. X Finance Bull highlights that the XRPL “reaches consensus in seconds with no central coordinator and no waste,” emphasizing that there is no mining and no dependency on a single controlling entity. He also points to a feature he considers critical: the network’s ability to stop rather than proceed when data cannot be validated. As he puts it, “it halts progress instead of confirming bad data.” In his view, this behavior is uncommon among major blockchains, yet essential for systems that aim to support financial infrastructure where errors carry real consequences. Correctness Before Incentives X Finance Bull contrasts this design with what he describes as incentive-driven models used elsewhere. He states that “Other chains prioritize incentives. $XRP prioritizes correctness, agreement, and forward progress, in that order.” The claim is that the XRP Ledger is engineered first to ensure all honest participants agree on the same outcome, and only then to move forward, rather than pushing blocks through because rewards depend on it. This framing positions the XRPL as a network built around disciplined validation rather than competitive block production. The consensus flow shown in the images reinforces this by illustrating how validators and tracking servers independently compute results and only accept a ledger when a strong majority of validators align. Why Institutions Are Paying Attention From this technical foundation, X Finance Bull connects XRP’s design to real-world adoption. He argues that “real-world institutions are building on it” not because of narratives or online trends, but because they require systems that deliver “uptime, clarity, and risk management.” In his assessment, enterprise users are less concerned with social momentum and more focused on whether infrastructure can operate consistently and transparently. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He reinforces this point by noting that the transaction rails are already active, suggesting that XRP’s technology is not theoretical but deployed in live environments where performance matters. A Long-Term View on XRP’s Role X Finance Bull closes with a forward-looking message, urging observers to look beyond surface-level debates and study the technology itself. “If you’re still sleeping on $XRP tech stack, it’s time to study,” he writes, adding that over the long term, this foundation “changes everything.” The post ultimately presents XRP as a network designed for agreement and reliability first, arguing that these traits, more than any narrative, explain why it continues to attract institutional interest and why its long-term significance should not be underestimated.

As the South Korean won stages a remarkable rally following intervention signals from authorities, the US dollar continues its descent to an 11-week low. These movements in traditional Forex markets create ripple effects across global digital asset trading, offering both opportunities and warnings for crypto investors monitoring macroeconomic trends. Why is the South Korean Won Rallying Against Major Currencies? South Korean financial authorities have sent clear signals that they are prepared to take action against excessive currency volatility. This intervention stance has triggered a significant rally in the South Korean won, which had been under pressure amid global economic uncertainties. The won’s recovery represents more than just a currency movement—it signals potential shifts in Asian market stability that could influence cryptocurrency trading patterns in the region. Key factors driving the won’s performance include: Explicit verbal intervention from Bank of Korea officials Improved trade balance data from South Korea Reduced risk aversion among Asian investors Technical rebound from oversold conditions US Dollar Weakness: What’s Driving the 11-Week Low? The US dollar’s decline to its lowest level in 11 weeks creates a fascinating backdrop for cryptocurrency markets. As the world’s primary reserve currency weakens, investors often seek alternative stores of value, including digital assets. The dollar’s slump reflects changing expectations about Federal Reserve policy and broader concerns about US economic performance. Currency Pair Current Level Weekly Change Key Driver USD/KRW 1,320 -1.8% BOK Intervention Signals USD/JPY 148.50 -0.9% BOJ Policy Expectations USD/CNY 7.18 -0.6% PBOC Support Measures Asian FX Markets React to Changing Global Dynamics The broader Asian FX markets are responding to multiple forces simultaneously. Regional currencies are benefiting from the dollar’s weakness while also navigating local economic challenges. For cryptocurrency traders, understanding these currency movements provides valuable context for digital asset price action, particularly in Asian markets where crypto adoption remains strong. Three critical developments shaping Asian FX markets: Central bank divergence between the Fed and Asian monetary authorities Improving economic indicators across several Asian economies Reduced geopolitical tensions in the region Currency Intervention Strategies and Their Market Impact South Korea’s approach to currency intervention offers lessons for all market participants. Rather than immediate market operations, authorities have used verbal guidance and strategic signaling to influence trader behavior. This method has proven effective in stabilizing the South Korean won without depleting foreign exchange reserves excessively. The success of this intervention strategy raises important questions: How do verbal interventions compare to direct market operations? What signals should cryptocurrency traders monitor from central banks? How do currency interventions affect digital asset correlations? Forex Trading Implications for Cryptocurrency Investors The intersection between traditional Forex trading and cryptocurrency markets has never been more significant. As Asian currencies gain strength against the dollar, capital flows may shift toward regional digital asset markets. Cryptocurrency traders should monitor several key indicators to navigate this evolving landscape successfully. Actionable insights for crypto investors: Monitor USD/KRW levels for Asian market sentiment cues Watch for correlation shifts between major currencies and cryptocurrencies Consider how currency movements affect mining profitability in different regions Track central bank statements for broader monetary policy trends FAQs: Understanding the Asian Currency Movements What prompted South Korean authorities to signal currency intervention? Bank of Korea officials expressed concern about excessive volatility in the South Korean won that could disrupt economic stability. Their statements aimed to stabilize expectations without immediate market operations. Which Asian currencies have benefited most from dollar weakness? The South Korean won, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan have all strengthened against the US dollar, though the won’s rally has been particularly notable due to intervention signals. How do these currency movements affect Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? Currency movements influence cryptocurrency markets through several channels: changing investment flows, altered mining economics in different regions, and shifts in risk appetite among traders. What should cryptocurrency traders watch in coming weeks? Key indicators include Federal Reserve policy statements, Bank of Korea follow-up actions, Asian economic data releases, and technical levels in major currency pairs. Are there historical precedents for similar currency interventions affecting crypto markets? Previous episodes of Asian currency intervention have sometimes coincided with increased cryptocurrency trading activity as investors seek alternatives to traditional assets. The dramatic movements in Asian FX markets, highlighted by the South Korean won’s rally and the US dollar’s decline, create a pivotal moment for global financial markets. Cryptocurrency traders who understand these traditional currency dynamics gain valuable perspective on digital asset price action. The intervention signals from South Korean authorities demonstrate how proactive policy can shape market outcomes, offering lessons for all market participants navigating volatile conditions. As the dollar continues its descent and Asian currencies find firmer footing, the connections between traditional Forex trading and cryptocurrency markets will likely strengthen further. Successful navigation of this environment requires attention to both currency fundamentals and digital asset technicals, with particular focus on Asian market developments that increasingly drive global crypto trends.

Thorn says that Bitcoin’s October all-time high of six figures translates to just $99,848 per coin if adjusted for inflation using a 2020 dollar baseline. “If you adjust the price of Bitcoin for inflation using 2020 dollars, BTC never crossed $100,000; it actually topped at $99,848 in 2020 dollar terms, if you can believe it,” he wrote on X late Tuesday. Inflation-adjusted valuation takes Bitcoin $150 below the six-figure mark According to Thorn’s assessment, the inflation-adjusted peak is accounted for by the steady erosion of dollar purchasing power read from Consumer Price Index readings since the 2020 pandemic economy. if you adjust the price of bitcoin for inflation using 2020 dollars, BTC never crossed $100k it actually topped at $99,848 in 2020 dollar terms, if you can believe it pic.twitter.com/bo3UGfBXbY — Alex Thorn (@intangiblecoins) December 22, 2025 The Consumer Price Index tracks inflation by looking at changes in the cost of a basket of goods and services, including food, energy, housing, and medical care. It is compiled by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and used by the Federal Reserve to make policy changes, and by investors to reduce or increase spending power and living costs. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the CPI rose 2.7% over the 12 months through November, the lowest annual inflation rate since July. It also came in below forecasts of 3.1% and the 3% pace announced by the BLS in September. Cumulative inflation since 2020 has reduced the dollar’s purchasing power by 20% over that period, which Thorn argues has made the greenback materially weaker currency than at the start of the decade. In November, energy prices rose 4.2% year-over-year, food prices increased 2.6%, and shelter costs rose 3%. Medical care also recorded an uptick of 2.9%, while household furnishings and operations increased by 4.6%, and recreation rose by 1.8%. Used cars and trucks saw a 3.6% increase on the upper side. The BLS did not collect CPI data for October due to a 43-day U.S. government shutdown, leaving a gap in the monthly inflation record and preventing the release of monthly rates for November. Rate cuts and ‘better looking GDP stats’ aid in dollar weakness According to CPI index data cited by the Wall Street Journal, the US dollar fell 0.22% on Tuesday’s close, on the heels of a stronger-than-expected US gross domestic product report and reduced expectations for Federal Reserve easing in 2026. Traders have lowered the probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on January 27–28 to 13%, down from 20% previously. US real GDP grew at an annualized rate of 4.3% in the third quarter, exceeding expectations of 3.3% and accelerating from the 2.5% pace in the second quarter. The GDP price index, a measure of inflation in the economy, climbed 3.8% annualized and well above the 2.7% prediction, up from 2.1% in the prior quarter. Economists like GuideStone Funds’ Jack Herr insist traders should not expect more dollar depreciation rates for 2026, but weaker growth could still cause the currency to drop even further. “If you see any weakness at any point next year, that could probably be bad for markets, but that could definitely affect the dollar too,” Herr told Reuters. Peter Schiff: Inflation will go up, Bitcoin will not In other news, safe-haven asset gold surged past $4,500 per ounce on Wednesday to a fresh record, and second-line silver also went above $72.30, eyeing $80 before year-end. Those rallies have added to gold advocate and Bitcoin naysayer Peter Schiff’s bag of reasons why investing in Bitcoin is not viable. According to Schiff, America is also headed for the worst inflation spell come next year. “The government, the Fed, and the financial media all agree that inflation will be coming down from here. But gold and silver, commodity, bond, and foreign exchange markets are clearly signaling that America is about to experience the highest inflation in its 250-year history. If Bitcoin won’t go up when tech stocks rise, and it won’t go up when gold and silver rise, when will it go up? The answer is: it won’t,” Schiff noted on X. Don’t just read crypto news.

According to data from on-chain analytics platform Onchain Lens, Hayes transferred 682 ETH, valued at approximately $2 million. This transaction from a major industry figure naturally sparks questions about market strategy and potential implications for Ethereum’s price trajectory. What Does the Arthur Hayes ETH Deposit Mean? When a prominent figure like Arthur Hayes moves a substantial amount of cryptocurrency, analysts and traders take notice. This specific Arthur Hayes ETH deposit could signal several possibilities. Is it a routine portfolio rebalancing, preparation for a new investment, or a strategic decision based on market outlook? Understanding the context of such whale movements is crucial for interpreting their potential impact. Firstly, it’s important to note that deposits to centralized exchanges like Binance often precede a sale or trade. However, they can also be used for staking, providing liquidity, or securing assets in an exchange wallet for future use. Without a public statement from Hayes himself, the exact motive remains speculative. Therefore, the market watches the subsequent on-chain flow for clues. Why Should Crypto Investors Pay Attention to Whale Moves? Tracking whale activity, like this Arthur Hayes ETH deposit , provides valuable insights beyond simple gossip. Large holders, or “whales,” often possess superior market information and resources. Their actions can serve as a leading indicator for broader market sentiment and potential price volatility. Market Sentiment Gauge: A large deposit to an exchange can suggest a whale is preparing to sell, which may indicate a bearish short-term outlook or profit-taking. Liquidity Signal: Such moves increase exchange liquidity, which can facilitate larger trades with less price slippage. Strategic Foreshadowing: For influential founders, actions can precede official announcements related to new projects or market views. However, it’s critical to avoid overreacting to a single transaction. One Arthur Hayes ETH deposit does not define a market trend. Savvy investors combine this data with other technical and fundamental analysis before making decisions. How Does This Impact Ethereum and the Broader Market? The immediate effect of the Arthur Hayes ETH deposit on Ethereum’s price was minimal, showcasing the asset’s mature and liquid market. However, the psychological impact can be more significant. News of founders or large investors moving funds can influence retail trader sentiment, sometimes creating short-term FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) or FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). For Ethereum specifically, monitoring the net flow of ETH to and from exchanges is key. A sustained increase in exchange deposits can signal selling pressure, while withdrawals to private wallets often indicate a long-term holding mentality. This single transaction is a data point in that larger narrative. Actionable Insights from the Hayes Transaction What can the average crypto enthusiast learn from this event? First, leverage free on-chain tools to track major wallets and exchange flows. Platforms like Etherscan, Nansen, and others make this data accessible. Second, always contextualize whale moves within the bigger picture. Consider: Overall market conditions (bullish/bearish) Upcoming Ethereum network upgrades or events Macro-economic factors influencing crypto Finally, use this information to reinforce your own risk management and investment thesis, not replace it. The Arthur Hayes ETH deposit is a noteworthy event, but it is not an automatic buy or sell signal. Conclusion: Decoding the Signal from the Noise The recent Arthur Hayes ETH deposit to Binance is a classic example of how the crypto market digests information from its most visible participants. While the $2 million transfer is substantial, its true meaning lies in the patterns it may be part of, not in isolation. For informed market participants, it underscores the importance of on-chain analytics and disciplined interpretation. The most successful strategies are built on a composite of data, not a single headline. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did Arthur Hayes deposit ETH to Binance? A1: The exact reason is unknown. It could be for selling, trading for another asset, staking, or simply moving funds for safekeeping. Without a statement from Hayes, it remains speculative. Q2: Should I sell my ETH because Arthur Hayes deposited his? A2: No. One transaction by any individual, even an influential one, should not dictate your investment strategy. Always base decisions on your own research, financial goals, and risk tolerance. Q3: How can I track whale movements like this? A3: You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan to view transaction histories of known wallets. More advanced platforms like Nansen, Arkham, or Glassnode specialize in labeling wallets and analyzing on-chain flow data. Q4: Does a deposit to an exchange always mean a sale is coming? A4: Not always. While it increases the possibility, funds on exchanges can also be used for staking, as collateral for loans, or to provide liquidity. The key is to watch if the ETH is subsequently sold on the spot market. Q5: How significant is a $2 million ETH transfer in the grand scheme? A5: While $2 million is a large sum, the daily trading volume for ETH is in the billions. A single transfer of this size is unlikely to move the market significantly on its own, but it contributes to overall exchange supply metrics. Q6: Has Arthur Hayes made similar large moves in the past? A6: Yes, as a co-founder of a major derivatives exchange, Hayes is an active participant in the crypto markets. His past transactions have sometimes aligned with broader market shifts, making his activity noteworthy for analysts. Found this analysis of the Arthur Hayes ETH deposit insightful?

For many market participants searching for the best cryptos to buy now, identifying a potential top crypto with both short-term momentum and long-term fundamentals has become a priority. Three very different cryptos that have been making headlines both for short-term investment and long-term potential include Dogecoin (DOGE), which continues not only to make headlines but also gain traction through both support and very attractive technical charts. Another is Shiba Inu (SHIB), also making headlines through ongoing support and development within its ecosystem and also through renewed support from traders who continue to be attracted through strong brand recognition. Lastly, one of the utility cryptos making headlines through both its presale program and ongoing support is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is currently priced at Phase 6 for only $0.035. The phase is also almost entirely sold out, meaning traders do not have very much time before the presale is over. The token is also rapidly making headlines through its strong DeFi offering and its unique tokenomics plan. It is also attractive not only due to potential growth but also due to its ability to reward presale buyers, making it a top bet among DeFi tokens for those seeking growth and utility within the next year. Dogecoin Price Analysis The Dogecoin (DOGE) seems to be stabilizing after the recently witnessed liquidity sweep, and the crucial support area of $0.13 is still intact. The selling pressure has eased somewhat, and if the buying force can recapture the $0.15–$0.16 levels, the route to higher resistance levels may open up. Since DOGE is displaying the strength to form a strong support base, it is entering the discussion list alongside the other highly sought-after altcoins, which are already garnering intense interest from whales and setting up for a massive explosion. Cardano Eyeing Breakout The Cardano (ADA) cryptocurrency appears to have all the indicators of yet another crypto that will have an explosive breakout very soon, currently hovering on the edge of a descending channel on a 12-hour graph. If ADA can successfully break through the resistance point, some analysts are predicting that ADA may reach $0.69 soon. Considering that interest in the overall altcoin market seems to have picked again, an ADA breakout may usher in renewed faith in leading crypto portfolios once again. MUTM Presale Nearing Completion in Phase 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly positioning itself as a must-have cryptocurrency for the investment sector in 2025 and is gaining popularity as one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy right now because of its early market development stage and fundamentals. Presale phase 6 is almost fully allocated, with more than 18,550 buyers participating, investing a total amount exceeding $19.5M+. The tokens are still available for a low price tag of only $0.035, which will rise by 20% to $0.04 with the onset of presale phase 7. MUTM is already considered the top cryptocurrency contender in the DeFi market. This high demand indicates that MUTM is an investment opportunity like no other. Most other altcoins like Dogecoin are simply instruments with the purpose of speculation in mind, whereas Mutuum Finance stands apart in the sense that it is based on real-world usage. Infrastructure and Price Discovery Mutuum Finance provides accurate and real-time prices for tokens via Chainlink oracles, which are verified against larger cryptos such as the value for USD, ETH, Matic, and AVAX. Furthermore, the model supports fallback oracles, aggregation feeds, and in-chain data, which play a critical role in the sustainability of this new chain. Given that Phase 6 is already almost full, people who wait may forgo this historic opportunity to join. As the end of December approaches, while Dogecoin and Shiba Inu continue to provide familiarity and liquidity, the token standing out as the most obvious early-stage opportunity is obviously Mutuum Finance (MUTM). For investors narrowing down the best cryptos to buy now, MUTM continues to emerge as a top crypto contender. Phase 6 is now 99% sold out at the price of $0.035, and a total of $19.5M has been raised by 18,550+ contributors, while an imminent increase in price by 20% to $0.04 is expected in Phase 7 of the project. Dwindling supply, DeFi usability, and tokenomics make MUTM the most compelling opportunity before the growth of 2026.

This action highlights the critical importance of transparency in the rapidly evolving crypto market. For investors, this serves as a crucial reminder to conduct thorough due diligence. Why Did Bithumb and Coinone Issue This AI16Z Warning? The exchanges took this step based on two primary concerns. First, the AI16Z project failed to disclose important information on time. This information could significantly impact the token’s value. Second, the project showed a lack of transparency when making major changes. Therefore, the warning acts as a red flag for potential investors. Such warnings are not common. Exchanges typically issue them only when they identify substantial risks. The goal is to protect users from potential financial loss. Consequently, this AI16Z investment warning signals deep concerns about the project’s governance. What Does an Investment Warning Mean for Crypto Projects? An investment warning is a serious designation. It tells users that a listed asset carries higher-than-normal risk. However, it does not mean the token is delisted immediately. Instead, it places the project under heightened scrutiny. For the AI16Z project, the implications are significant: Trading Continues: Users can still buy and sell the token, but with official caution. Increased Scrutiny: The project team must now address the exchanges’ concerns directly. Investor Awareness: The warning empowers users to make more informed decisions. This process underscores the evolving role of exchanges as market watchdogs. Their actions can directly influence investor confidence and project accountability. How Can Crypto Investors Protect Themselves? When you see an official AI16Z investment warning , it is a clear signal to pause and investigate. Do not ignore warnings from major platforms. They have access to more information than the average user. Here are actionable steps every investor should take: Review Official Announcements: Read the exchange’s full statement to understand the specific issues. Research the Project: Look for the missing disclosures. Check the project’s official channels for updates. Assess Your Risk: Decide if holding the asset aligns with your personal risk tolerance. Diversify: Never concentrate a large portion of your portfolio in a single, high-risk asset. Proactive research is your best defense in the crypto space. Relying solely on exchange listings is not enough. The Bigger Picture: Transparency in Crypto The AI16Z investment warning is part of a broader trend. Global regulators and exchanges are demanding higher standards. Projects must prioritize clear communication and robust governance. This is essential for building long-term trust in the blockchain ecosystem. For the market to mature, accountability is non-negotiable. Incidents like this, while concerning, push the entire industry toward better practices. They separate serious projects from those that may not have investors’ best interests at heart. Conclusion: Heed the Warning Signs The action by Bithumb and Coinone is a vital service to their users. It demonstrates a commitment to safety beyond mere trading volume. For investors, this AI16Z investment warning is a textbook case of why due diligence matters. In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, staying informed and cautious is not just advice—it’s a necessity for safeguarding your capital. Let this event reinforce the habit of looking beyond the hype and scrutinizing the fundamentals. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is the AI16Z token delisted now? A1: No, an investment warning is different from a delisting. Trading can continue, but the exchanges are flagging it as a high-risk asset. Q2: Should I sell my AI16Z tokens immediately? A2: This is a personal financial decision. The warning means you should urgently reassess the risk. Review the project’s response and make an informed choice based on your risk tolerance. Q3: Can other exchanges issue a similar warning? A3: Yes, other exchanges that list AI16Z may review their stance. However, each exchange operates independently and makes its own risk assessments. Q4: What happens if AI16Z fixes the transparency issues? A4: If the project satisfactorily addresses the exchanges’ concerns, the warning could potentially be lifted. This would require official communication and verification from Bithumb and Coinone. Q5: How often do major exchanges issue such warnings? A5: It is relatively uncommon. Exchanges typically reserve this action for situations where they identify significant, unresolved risks that could harm investors. Q6: Where can I find the official warning announcements? A6: You can find them in the official notice or announcement sections on the Bithumb and Coinone websites. Always refer to primary sources for accurate information.

56277899,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=883530,1766561419,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56277899.jpeg,Spain plans full rollout of MiCA and DAC8 crypto regulations by 2026,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/spain-prepares-to-fully-implement-eu-mica/,"Spain could fully embrace digital currencies in 2026, following a directive from the government to implement two pro-crypto European Union frameworks, MiCA and DAC8. Local news publications reported on Wednesday that Spanish authorities are creating a crypto regulatory national framework in line with European standards, Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), and the entry into force of the Administrative Cooperation Directive, or DAC8. Together, the two measures will expand the powers of tax authorities over crypto holdings and will add reporting requirements for users and virtual asset service providers (VASP). MiCA launch in Spain slated for mid-2026 EU-made crypto regulation MiCA became fully applicable in the trading bloc in December 2024, but Spain was among the countries that waited before enforcing its provisions in full. Spanish federal regulators now expect the regulation to be fully deployed in the country by mid-2026, making the decision in early December this year to apply the maximum transitional window allowed under EU law. The regulation will standardize rules governing the issuance and marketing of crypto assets in tandem with the EU’s demands, including clear classifications for different types of digital assets like utility tokens, security tokens, and stablecoins. Moreover, it will establish uniform compliance requirements for crypto-related service issuers in the country. Oversight of MiCA in Spain has been assigned to the National Securities Market Commission, known as the CNMV. At the time of writing, more than 60 companies are registered with the watchdog to operate in the digital asset industry, including Cecabank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, and Renta 4 Banco. Cryptopolitan reported in mid-December that the CNMV updated its rules to implement MiCA oversight, publishing a Q&A for citizens to understand how the rules work. According to the commission’s notice, the transitional period for companies to become MiCA compliant has been set to July 1, 2026, and only companies that have obtained full MiCA authorization will be permitted to operate in Spain thereafter. Crypto tax transparency addressed under DAC8 rules MiCA may cover how crypto markets and businesses function, but Spain’s second regulatory query is on taxation and transparency. The Administrative Cooperation Directive, or DAC8, was approved by Congress in October 2025 and is scheduled to enter into force on January 1, 2026. DAC8 says that crypto exchanges and service providers in the EU must automatically send precise information to tax authorities. The data comprises transaction histories, account balances, and user movements, encompassing sales, exchanges, and transfers of assets, which eliminates anonymity in regulated crypto operations. The government-backed tax enforcement grants the tax administration office, Agencia Tributaria, the power to seize cryptos to settle outstanding tax debts. According to the European Commission , transposing DAC8 into national law in all EU member states could raise an additional 2.4 billion euros in revenue. Spain’s implementation of DAC8 will see information collected by the Treasury during the 2026 fiscal year begin flowing to tax authorities in 2027. “We will have information on all the movements that have been made during 2026 … It will be almost complete information,” said tax laws consultant José Antonio Bravo Mateu in a recent interview. This information will be much greater than that requested from a bank.” He continued to say that while conventional financial institutions only report balances above 250,000 euros, watchdogs will keep track of everything in the crypto market, “even an exchange of two euros for a digital coin.” Spanish parliament approved MiCA and DAC8 in October The regulatory change to adopt crypto rules in Spain has been bashed by several analysts and economists, who insist Spain is imposing standards with heavier control on the industry compared with other jurisdictions. José Luis Cava, author of The Art of Speculating , blasted Spanish policymakers for ignoring the progress made in the West, where a US proposal seeks to allow taxpayers to pay federal taxes in bitcoin without capital gains taxes. He specifically mentioned the “Bitcoin for America Act,” a legislative initiative in which citizens can settle tax obligations directly in BTC. The Sumar Parliamentary Group held several discussions between October and November, when a minority partner in the governing coalition proposed amendments to the Measures for the Prevention and Fight against Tax Fraud bill. They asked policymakers and proponents of the proposed law to increase tax burdens on crypto earnings.

Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, has just announced a significant update to its trading roster. The platform will delist five specific spot trading pairs in a move that directly impacts users holding these assets. This decision underscores the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the crypto market, where exchanges routinely optimize their offerings for liquidity and user safety. If you trade BIO, ENS, INJ, TREE, or VTHO, you need to know the details. Which Spot Trading Pairs Is Binance Delisting? Binance has confirmed the removal of five spot trading pairs, effective at 03:00 UTC on December 26. The exchange made this announcement to give users ample time to adjust their positions. The affected Binance delist spot trading pairs are: BIO/FDUSD ENS/FDUSD INJ/ETH TREE/BNB VTHO/TRY This action means you will no longer be able to trade these specific combinations on the Binance spot market after the deadline. However, it’s crucial to note that this is a pair delisting, not necessarily a full token delisting. Many of these assets will likely remain tradeable against other major pairs like BTC or USDT on the platform. Why Do Exchanges Like Binance Delist Trading Pairs? You might wonder, why would an exchange remove trading options? This is a standard practice in the industry. Exchanges periodically review all listed pairs against a set of rigorous criteria. When a Binance delist spot trading pairs event occurs, it’s typically to ensure a healthy, secure, and efficient trading environment for all users. Common reasons include: Low Liquidity: Pairs with consistently low trading volume can lead to poor price discovery and high slippage. Project Health: Concerns about a token’s development activity, commitment, or regulatory compliance. Network Stability: Issues with the underlying blockchain, like frequent downtime or security problems. Strategic Refocus: Streamlining the exchange’s offerings to concentrate liquidity in more popular markets. Therefore, this move by Binance is a proactive measure to maintain its market quality standards. What Should Traders Do Before the Delisting Deadline? If you hold any of the affected pairs, don’t panic. You have a clear window to take action. First, check your Binance spot wallet for any open orders involving these pairs. You must cancel any open orders before the delisting time, as Binance will cancel them automatically, potentially at an unfavorable price. Next, decide your move: Sell or Trade: Convert your holdings into another cryptocurrency before December 26. Withdraw: Move the tokens to a private wallet or another supporting exchange. Hold (if applicable): If the token itself is not delisted, you can simply hold it in your Spot wallet, but you won’t be able to trade it via the delisted pair. Acting before the deadline is essential to avoid being stuck with an illiquid trading pair. How Does a Binance Delist Spot Trading Pairs Event Affect the Market? Such announcements often cause immediate, short-term price volatility for the involved assets. Traders may rush to sell, creating downward pressure. However, the long-term impact varies. For tokens that remain listed on other pairs, the effect is often minimal. The key takeaway is that regular exchange reviews are a sign of a mature market. They protect users from risky or failing projects and help consolidate liquidity into stronger markets. This Binance delist spot trading pairs action is a routine housekeeping measure, not necessarily a commentary on the long-term viability of every involved project. Conclusion: Stay Informed and Proactive The upcoming Binance delist spot trading pairs event is a critical reminder for every crypto participant. The landscape changes rapidly, and staying informed is your greatest asset. Always monitor official exchange announcements, understand the difference between a pair delisting and a token delisting, and manage your portfolio proactively. By taking the recommended steps before December 26, you can navigate this change smoothly and continue your trading strategy without interruption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is Binance delisting the tokens themselves or just the trading pairs? A: Binance is delisting these five specific spot trading pairs. The tokens (BIO, ENS, INJ, TREE, VTHO) may still be available for trading against other cryptocurrencies like BTC or USDT on the exchange. You should check Binance’s full trading list for each asset. Q: What happens to my tokens if I don’t sell before the delisting? A: The tokens will remain in your Spot wallet if they are not fully delisted from Binance. However, you will not be able to trade them using the delisted pair (e.g., VTHO/TRY). You would need to use a different available trading pair or withdraw them to another platform. Q: Will this affect the price of my tokens? A: It can cause short-term volatility due to traders adjusting their positions. The long-term price depends on the token’s fundamentals, overall market sentiment, and its availability on other trading pairs and exchanges. Q: Can I still withdraw the tokens after December 26? A> Yes, unless Binance announces a full token delisting with suspended withdrawals. For now, only the specific trading pairs are being removed. Withdrawal functions for the underlying blockchain networks should remain active. Q: How often does Binance delist trading pairs? A> Binance conducts periodic reviews and announces delistings several times a year. It’s a standard practice to ensure market quality and comply with regulatory standards. Q: Where can I get official updates from Binance? A> Always refer to the official Binance Announcements page for the most accurate and timely information regarding listings, delistings, and other platform changes.

The South Korean crypto exchange giant has just made a pivotal announcement that directly impacts your holdings. Bithumb will officially support the upcoming AI16Z token swap and rebranding to ElizaOS. This move is crucial for ensuring a smooth transition as the project evolves. If you hold AI16Z tokens, understanding the timeline and process is non-negotiable. What is the AI16Z Token Swap All About? The core of this announcement is a token migration. The AI16Z project is rebranding to ElizaOS, and its ticker will change to ELIZAOS. Consequently, every existing AI16Z token needs to be converted into the new ELIZAOS tokens. Bithumb’s support means they will handle this technical process for users who hold their tokens on the exchange, which significantly reduces complexity and risk for investors. This AI16Z token swap isn’t just a simple name change. It represents the project’s strategic shift and growth. The rebrand to ElizaOS suggests a broader focus, potentially moving beyond a single AI concept to a more comprehensive operating system or ecosystem. For holders, the swap is the mandatory bridge to participate in this new phase. Key Dates and Details for the Bithumb Swap Bithumb has outlined a clear, though partially pending, schedule. The first major milestone is a snapshot. Mark your calendar for 11:40 a.m. UTC on November 11 . This snapshot will record all AI16Z token balances held on Bithumb at that exact moment. Here are the critical action points for holders: First Snapshot: November 11, 11:40 a.m. UTC. Swap Ratio: Importantly, the swap ratio will differ based on how long you’ve held the tokens. Long-term holders may receive a more favorable rate. Second Snapshot: The timing for a second snapshot will be announced later. Trading & Withdrawal Halt: Bithumb will also suspend trading and withdrawals for AI16Z at a future date, which will be communicated separately. Why is Bithumb’s Role in This Swap So Important? For the average crypto user, managing a manual token swap can be daunting and prone to error. It often involves interacting with smart contracts directly, which carries risks. By supporting the AI16Z token swap on-platform, Bithumb provides a secure and user-friendly service. They automate the conversion, ensuring holders receive their correct allotment of ELIZAOS tokens without needing technical expertise. This support also adds a layer of legitimacy and reduces market uncertainty. A major, compliant exchange like Bithumb backing the process signals confidence in the project’s transition plan. It helps maintain orderly markets and protects users from potential scams that often arise during confusing migration periods. What Should AI16Z Holders Do Now? Your immediate action is simple: stay informed and do not panic. If your AI16Z tokens are already on Bithumb, you are in the right place. Ensure you understand the snapshot mechanism. The tokens in your Bithumb wallet at the specified time will be the ones counted for the swap. Do not move your AI16Z tokens off Bithumb if you wish for the exchange to handle the swap for you. Wait for official announcements from Bithumb regarding the second snapshot and the trading suspension. Relying on official exchange channels prevents you from falling for phishing attempts or misinformation. Navigating the Future as ElizaOS This AI16Z token swap is a gateway. Once completed, holders will be participants in the ElizaOS ecosystem. The success of this technical migration is the first step toward the project’s renewed goals. A smooth swap, facilitated by partners like Bithumb, builds strong community trust and sets a solid foundation for future development and adoption. In conclusion, Bithumb’s announcement provides a clear and secure path for AI16Z investors through this significant transition. By paying close attention to the snapshot dates and following official guidelines, holders can seamlessly convert their assets and look forward to the next chapter of the project as ElizaOS. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Do I need to do anything manually for the AI16Z token swap on Bithumb? A: No, if your tokens are on Bithumb at the snapshot times, the exchange will automatically handle the conversion to ELIZAOS tokens. Your action is primarily to ensure your tokens are on the platform and to stay updated. Q2: What happens if I miss the snapshot? A: Only tokens held on Bithumb at the moment of the snapshot will be eligible for the automated swap. If you deposit tokens after the snapshot, you may need to explore other, potentially more complex, migration methods provided by the ElizaOS team. Q3: Will the value of my tokens change after the swap? A: The market will determine the value of the new ELIZAOS token. The swap itself is a technical conversion based on a set ratio. Your portfolio’s value post-swap will depend on the new token’s market price. Q4: Why is the swap ratio different based on holding period? A: This is likely a reward mechanism to incentivize and compensate long-term, loyal supporters of the project who held through its earlier phase as AI16Z. Q5: When will I receive my new ELIZAOS tokens? A: Bithumb will announce the distribution timeline after the swap process is complete. This usually happens once all snapshots are finished and the technical conversion is executed. Q6: Can I trade AI16Z on Bithumb during this process? A: Trading will continue until a specific suspension date, which Bithumb will announce later. It is crucial to monitor their official notices to avoid getting caught in a trade when withdrawals are halted. Found this guide on the AI16Z token swap helpful?

Shares slid from just over $6 to an intraday low of $5.12. They were hovering around $5.35 during after-hours trading, according to Google Finance. Ethzilla has lost 21% in share value since the opening of the Nasdaq on Monday morning and is down 95% since it spiked over $100 in August. Pivot to RWA Tokenization The crypto treasury company sold approximately 24,291 ETH for $74.5 million at around $3,069 per token to repay convertible debt. The sale, disclosed to the SEC, leaves the company with roughly 69,800 ETH remaining. Ethzilla is now the tenth-largest Ether DAT, falling below BTCS Inc., which holds 70,000 ETH. “In the future, the company believes its value will be driven by revenue and cash flow growth from our RWA [real world asset] tokenization business,” the firm stated on Monday. As part of redeeming our outstanding senior secured convertible notes, ETHZilla sold 24,291 ETH for approximately $74.5 million.

Ethzilla had pivoted from biotechnology in July 2024, shifting to an Ether-focused strategy after its biotech shares plummeted. After an initial spike in August, its stock began to retreat again as crypto markets cooled and Ether prices fell hard. ETH has again fallen below $3,000 and is down 40% from its August all-time high, while many analysts have predicted the start of a bear market. DAT Stocks Dumping The world’s largest Ether DAT, Bitmine Immersion Technologies, also had a rough day on Tuesday, with stock (BMNR) falling 4.2% to end Tuesday below $30. Bitmine shares are down 78% from their July spike but remain up 280% since the beginning of the year. The firm remains one of the few DAT success stories this year. The Tom Lee-chaired DAT has remained bullish , buying the dips and accumulating more Ether while others have ceased purchases or offloaded.

But what about Bitcoin, the asset often called digital gold ? Right now, that nickname faces a serious test. While gold prices smash record highs, Bitcoin struggles to hold key support levels. This divergence raises crucial questions about Bitcoin’s role in a modern portfolio. Is Bitcoin Failing the Digital Gold Test? Recent market data paints a stark picture. Gold has surged an impressive 70% this year. Silver has jumped a staggering 150%. Meanwhile, Bitcoin battles significant profit-taking from investors. This performance gap emerges during a period of intense risk-off sentiment. According to analysis, bond yield volatility and sharp U.S. dollar fluctuations have strengthened risk aversion. These conditions typically benefit traditional safe havens like gold over speculative assets. If Bitcoin were truly digital gold , it should demonstrate resilience now. Instead, its price action suggests a different reality. The asset tends to perform best during periods of accommodative monetary policy and strong risk-on sentiment. This behavioral difference is critical for investors to understand. Why Gold and Bitcoin React Differently The core issue lies in their fundamental roles. David Miller, Chief Investment Officer at Catalyst Funds, offers clarity. He states Bitcoin remains a worthy long-term portfolio addition. However, he notes it plays a different role than physical gold. Gold’s Institutional Role: Central banks worldwide hold gold as a primary reserve asset. It serves as a bedrock of monetary stability. Bitcoin’s Retail Focus: Miller characterizes Bitcoin as a retail-investor-driven asset. Its adoption by large institutions as a reserve asset is still nascent. Hedge Functions: Both can hedge against fiscal expansion and currency devaluation, but through different mechanisms and with different volatility profiles. This distinction is powerful. Gold can functionally replace fiat as a reserve asset in a way Bitcoin currently cannot. This institutional bedrock provides gold with stability that a newer, retail-led asset lacks. What Does This Mean for Your Portfolio? This isn’t necessarily bad news for Bitcoin. It simply clarifies its position. Viewing Bitcoin strictly as digital gold might set unrealistic expectations. Instead, consider its unique value proposition. Bitcoin offers a decentralized, censorship-resistant store of value uncorrelated to traditional financial systems. Its digital nature allows for easy transfer and borderless transactions. These are advantages physical gold cannot match. The key is to allocate it appropriately within a diversified strategy, understanding its distinct risk and return profile. The Verdict on Digital Gold The recent market stress test reveals a nuanced truth. The digital gold narrative is compelling but incomplete. Bitcoin exhibits characteristics of a store of value, yet it marches to the beat of a different drum than its metallic counterpart. Its performance is tied more closely to liquidity cycles and technological adoption curves than to immediate geopolitical or inflationary fears. For the savvy investor, this divergence is an opportunity. It allows for more precise portfolio construction. You can hold gold for its proven crisis stability and Bitcoin for its asymmetric growth potential and digital utility. They are complementary, not mutually exclusive. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does Bitcoin’s recent performance mean it’s not a good investment? A: Not necessarily. It highlights that Bitcoin is a different asset class with different drivers. Its long-term thesis based on scarcity and adoption remains intact, but investors should expect high volatility. Q: Should I sell my Bitcoin to buy gold? A: That depends on your investment goals and risk tolerance. A diversified portfolio can include both. Gold offers stability, while Bitcoin offers high-growth potential. They serve different purposes. Q: Will central banks ever buy Bitcoin as a reserve asset? A> Some smaller nations have already started. Widespread adoption by major central banks would be a significant validation of the digital gold thesis, but it remains a future possibility, not a current reality. Q: What is the main advantage of Bitcoin over gold? A> Portability and verifiability. You can send Bitcoin anywhere in the world almost instantly. Its ownership and transaction history are transparently recorded on the blockchain, which is a form of digital gold standard for trust. Q: Can both gold and Bitcoin go up in value long-term? A> Absolutely. They are not in a zero-sum game. Global monetary expansion and search for non-sovereign stores of value can drive demand for both physical and digital gold assets simultaneously.

56278959,648226,1766563224,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56278959.jpeg,Russia Unveils New Crypto Framework For Retail And Qualified Investors,https://bitcoinist.com/russia-unveils-new-crypto-framework/,"Russia’s central bank has unveiled a new framework to regulate cryptocurrencies within its domestic digital asset market, with a deadline set for July 2026. This initiative aims to enable both retail and qualified investors to purchase cryptocurrencies. New Crypto Regulations In Russia According to a Bloomberg report , non-qualified investors will be permitted to buy the most liquid cryptocurrencies after successfully passing a knowledge assessment. However, their transactions will be limited to 300,000 rubles, roughly equivalent to $3,800 annually, and must be conducted through a single intermediary. In contrast, qualified investors will have the freedom to purchase unlimited amounts of any cryptocurrency, aside from anonymous tokens, although they too will have to pass a risk-awareness evaluation. Despite these regulatory steps, the Bank of Russia maintains a cautious stance towards cryptocurrencies, categorizing them as high-risk assets . The central bank has urged potential investors to consider the significant risk of losing their funds. Transactions will occur through already licensed entities such as exchanges, brokers, and trust managers, while additional requirements will apply to custodians and exchange services. Moreover, Russian residents will be able to buy cryptocurrencies abroad and transfer their holdings through licensed intermediaries within the country, with obligatory tax reporting requirements . Bitcoin’s Role In Strengthening The Ruble This regulatory shift follows President Vladimir Putin’s remarks last year regarding the potential use of Bitcoin (BTC) and the need for Russia to rethink its reliance on foreign currency reserves. Speaking at an investment conference in Moscow, Putin highlighted the geopolitical issues stemming from the West’s freezing of around $300 billion in Russian reserves due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. He questioned the prudence of holding state reserves in foreign currencies, considering how easily these assets can be confiscated for political reasons. In a significant development, Putin has also signed a law that creates a legal framework for taxing Bitcoin mining and transactions, officially classifying them as property. This new law recognizes digital currencies as property and encompasses those utilized for foreign trade settlements within the Experimental Legal Regime (EPR) designed for digital innovation. Notably, the legislation stipulates that Bitcoin mining and sales will be exempt from value-added tax (VAT), potentially spurring further investment in the cryptocurrency market. Recently, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina made an unexpected acknowledgment regarding Bitcoin mining, noting its small yet meaningful impact on supporting the Russian ruble. While she admitted that quantifying this influence is challenging, Nabiullina suggested that mining has emerged as an “additional factor” contributing to the currency’s recent strength—a noteworthy admission from a central banker traditionally cautious about the crypto landscape. When writing, Bitcoin was trading just above the $88,090 mark, recording losses of 1.5% in the 24-hour time frame.

Head And Shoulder Pattern Signals $2,400 Breakdown",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum-head-and-shoulder-pattern-signals-2400-breakdown/,"After being rejected from the $3,000 level, Ethereum (ETH) is trying to hold a key support zone and build a base around this area. Some analysts have suggested that the altcoin must reclaim the crucial resistance soon or risk potential drop to new multi-month lows. Related Reading: XRP ETFs Record 25-Day Streak As Price Eyes Key Resistance Level Ethereum Forms Head And Shoulder Pattern Amid the broader market volatility, Ethereum has been attempting to hold the recently reclaimed $2,900 level as support to potentially challenge higher resistance levels in the coming days. The cryptocurrency has been trading within the $2,800-$3,400 price range over the past month, hitting a high of $3,447 nearly two weeks ago. Since reaching the local high, ETH has struggled to hold the range’s high, falling to the lows again during last week’s market correction. Amid this performance, the King of Altcoins is currently registering its worst Q4 performance since 2019, with a negative performance of 28.76%. Moreover, it is also recording a red December so far, trading 1.3% below its monthly opening of $2,991. Some analysts have warned that ETH’s pain may not be over, as it appears to be forming a pattern that could spell trouble for the cryptocurrency. In a Tuesday X post, Ali Martinez suggested that Ethereum started forming a head and shoulder pattern following the massive corrections that the send most cryptocurrencies to multi-month lows. Per the chart, the altcoin formed the left shoulder between late November and early December after bouncing from the $2,780 support. Meanwhile, the pattern’s head was formed during the mid-December rebound that led to the $3,400 local high. Now, as price is rejected from the $3,000 area again, the cryptocurrency appears to be forming the right shoulder. This suggests that ETH’s price could drop to the $2,800 area to complete the pattern’s formation. Martinez noted that if the pattern is completed, it could lead to a 15% potential move toward $2,400, a level not seen since the start of the Q3 breakout. ETH Price In Trouble? Other market observers suggested Ethereum could be in trouble after being rejected from the $3,000 barrier again. Ted Pillows noted that the altcoin tried to reclaim this level but failed, closing Monday around the $2,948 area. To the analyst, If ETH doesn’t reclaim this key barrier soon, it could likely drop towards the $2,700-$2,800 support zone. On the contrary, a daily close above this level would set the base for a rally toward the $3,300 level. Similarly, Sjuul from AltCryptoGems affirmed that Ethereum “is a bit in trouble after that nasty bearish deviation on top of the range.” He highlighted the altcoin’s rejection from the mid-December highs, which sent the price the lower zone of its one-month range. Related Reading: Dogecoin’s 53,000% Surge Shows Renewed Interest, But Why Is DOGE Price Lagging? Based on this, the analyst suggested that investors could expect “the same to happen on the lower band,” which would see the price retest the $2,600-$2,700 area, and drop as low as $2,400, before bouncing toward the range highs again. Nonetheless, Sjuul declared that “bulls need to establish a proper uptrend here because losing $2700 would be a negative sign.” As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,933, a 2.53% decline in the daily timeframe.

His latest commentary argues that the true importance of the digital asset does not lie in who holds it, but in how effectively it links currencies, institutions, and payment corridors. In this framing, value is measured by utility at scale, not by speculative interest. Squire’s message presents XRP as part of the financial infrastructure rather than a vehicle for short-term trading. He draws a clear distinction between market noise and systems designed to move money efficiently across borders, positioning XRP on the side of real-world application. Connecting Liquidity Across Borders At the center of Squire’s remarks is the idea that XRP is designed to enable seamless movement of liquidity between different fiat currencies. The emphasis is on speed, efficiency, and the ability to operate across jurisdictions where traditional correspondent banking often introduces delays and added costs. This perspective aligns XRP with use cases that involve bridging currencies in real-time , particularly in scenarios where institutions need to move value from one currency to another without relying on multiple intermediaries. Squire frames this role as essential for modernizing cross-border payments, arguing that the asset’s relevance comes from its capacity to function within payment flows that operate continuously and at scale. Garlinghouse on Real-Time Payment Flows In a video captioned in the post, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse elaborates on how such a process works in practice. He describes a transaction path in which a participant holding U.S. dollars sells those dollars to acquire XRP, transfers the XRP across the XRP Ledger, and then converts it into Mexican pesos on the receiving side. According to Garlinghouse, this sequence enables liquidity to move from the US Dollar to the Peso in real time. He explains that this approach changes how value is transferred within correspondent banking by enabling funds to be settled quickly rather than passing through a chain of pre-funded accounts. Garlinghouse notes that the ability to move liquidity on demand can alter how institutions manage cross-border payment flows, particularly in corridors where speed and certainty are critical. XRP IS BUILT TO CONNECT Brad Garlinghouse knows it. $XRP isn’t about who holds it, but what it links across the financial system. Real value comes from moving money at scale, not speculation. That’s the line between noise and infrastructure. pic.twitter.com/nUYY1CQ0jg — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) December 20, 2025 Solving a Problem at Scale Garlinghouse also contrasts this payment-focused approach with what he characterizes as a broader environment of hype, experimentation, and speculation in digital assets. Within that context, he states that XRP stands out as being positioned to address a concrete global payments problem at scale. His remarks underline a belief that the asset’s primary role is tied to infrastructure rather than market narratives. Squire’s commentary reflects this viewpoint by supporting the idea that long-term relevance will depend on practical deployment in financial systems. The message is not about future promises, but about an existing design aimed at linking currencies and institutions through efficient settlement.

The focus remains on its capacity to move money across borders in real-time, offering an alternative to legacy processes that can be slow and capital-intensive. By highlighting infrastructure over speculation, Squire frames XRP as part of a broader effort to modernize global value transfer. In his view, that functional role, rather than market sentiment, defines its real value significance. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Market volatility, long holding horizons, and tax considerations often make liquidation inefficient. This is where crypto-backed borrowing comes in. Clapp solves this problem with a credit line model that prioritizes flexibility and cost control. Rather than issuing a fixed loan upfront, it allows users to unlock liquidity only when they actually need it. This guide explains how the Clapp credit line works and how it compares to a traditional crypto loan. What Clapp Offers Clapp provides a standby crypto credit line backed by digital assets. Users deposit crypto as collateral and receive a credit limit based on loan-to-value ratios. Funds can be withdrawn at any time, repaid freely, and reused later. The key point is that borrowing is optional. You can open a credit line and leave it unused until liquidity is required. Credit Line Instead of a Lump-Sum Loan Most crypto loans follow a familiar structure: collateral in, full loan amount out, interest starts immediately. This works when the exact amount is known and needed upfront. Clapp follows a different approach. You receive access to capital, not a forced disbursement. Interest applies only to the amount withdrawn. Any unused portion of the credit line carries a 0% APR. This keeps borrowing costs aligned with actual usage rather than theoretical needs. No Repayment Schedule Clapp does not impose fixed repayment dates or minimum payments. You can: Repay partially or in full Keep the balance open Restore available credit instantly after repayment This structure fits users whose cash needs fluctuate or who want to time repayments around market conditions rather than calendar deadlines. Multi-Collateral Support One of Clapp’s practical strengths is its multi-collateral system. Users can combine up to 19 cryptocurrencies into a single collateral pool. Instead of relying on one asset, diversified portfolios can be used more efficiently to unlock liquidity. For holders with BTC, ETH, SOL, and other assets, this often results in a higher credit limit and more balanced risk management. Instant Liquidity Through the Clapp Wallet All borrowing activity is handled through Clapp Wallet . Withdrawals in USDT, USDC, or EUR are available instantly and around the clock. Collateral management, repayments, and credit monitoring happen in real time. There are no approval queues or waiting periods once the credit line is active, which makes the product usable during fast market moves. How to Get a Crypto Loan on Clapp Opening a credit line follows a simple process: Create a Clapp account Deposit supported crypto assets Receive a credit limit based on collateral value Withdraw funds when liquidity is needed Repay on your own schedule There is no obligation to borrow once the credit line is open. Final Thoughts Clapp frames crypto borrowing as an access tool rather than a commitment. By combining a revolving credit line, low interest on used funds, multi-collateral support, and no deposit fees, it offers a practical way to unlock liquidity while staying exposed to the market. For users who value flexibility and cost efficiency over fixed loan structures, the Clapp credit line fits naturally into a long-term crypto strategy.

Today, users can choose between fixed crypto loans and revolving crypto credit lines . While both allow access to liquidity without selling assets, they operate on different assumptions about how capital is used. Understanding these differences helps avoid unnecessary costs and choose a structure that matches real borrowing behavior. Fixed Crypto Loans: How They Work A fixed crypto loan follows a traditional lending model. You deposit crypto as collateral and receive a predetermined amount upfront. Interest starts accruing immediately on the full balance. The loan typically has a set term and defined repayment expectations. This structure works when the borrower: Knows the exact amount needed Needs funds immediately Plans repayment on a clear timeline The trade-off is flexibility. Once the loan is issued, the terms rarely adapt to changing needs or market conditions. Revolving Crypto Credit Lines: How They Work A revolving crypto credit line uses a different logic. Instead of receiving a lump sum, the borrower gets a credit limit based on the value of the collateral. Funds can be withdrawn when needed, repaid at any time, and reused later. Interest applies only to the amount actually borrowed. Unused credit remains available without cost. This model suits users who: Want access to liquidity rather than immediate capital Borrow in smaller or irregular amounts Prefer interest efficiency Clapp’s Revolving Crypto Credit Line Model Clapp uses a revolving credit structure rather than issuing a fixed loan. Users deposit crypto and receive a standby credit limit. Funds are withdrawn only when liquidity is required. Interest applies solely to the amount used, while unused credit carries a 0% APR. Once repayments are made, the available credit restores automatically. The credit line remains open and reusable without reapplying. This approach matches how many users actually manage liquidity: intermittently rather than all at once. Crypto Credit Lines vs Fixed Loans Feature Fixed Crypto Loan Revolving Crypto Credit Line Fund access One-time disbursement On-demand withdrawals Interest accrual Full amount Used amount only Repayment Fixed or scheduled Flexible Reusability No Yes Cost efficiency Lower Higher Risk Management and Volatility Both models rely on loan-to-value ratios and liquidation thresholds. Market volatility affects them equally in principle, but flexibility changes how risk is managed. With a fixed loan, exposure is constant until repayment. With a credit line, borrowers can reduce risk by repaying portions quickly or avoiding unnecessary withdrawals during drawdowns. Choosing the Right Structure A fixed crypto loan may suit users who: Need a known amount immediately Prefer structured repayment Do not expect changing liquidity needs A revolving credit line may suit users who: Want ongoing access to capital Pay interest only when borrowing Manage liquidity dynamically Hold diversified crypto portfolios Final Thoughts Fixed loans and revolving credit lines solve different problems. Loans prioritize predictability. Credit lines prioritize efficiency and control. As crypto borrowing continues to evolve, revolving structures increasingly reflect how users actually manage liquidity rather than how traditional loans assume they do. Choosing between them depends less on headline rates and more on how capital is used in practice. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Key Takeaways: Upexi shares fell after the company filed to raise up to $1 billion to expand its Solana treasury. The firm holds 2.1 million SOL worth about $262 million but has paused purchases amid a broader market pullback. Declining Solana prices have cut the value of Upexi’s treasury by more than half from its peak. The stock closed down 7.5% at $1.84 following the filing, though it recovered some ground in after-hours trading, rising 4.3% to $1.92, according to Google Finance data. In a shelf registration statement filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Upexi said the offering could include common and preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units issued over time. Upexi Pivots to Solana Treasury Strategy With $262M in SOL Holdings The company said proceeds would be used for general corporate purposes, with a primary focus on accumulating Solana and staking the tokens to generate additional yield. Upexi currently holds 2.1 million SOL valued at about $262.3 million, making it the fourth-largest corporate Solana treasury, according to CoinGecko. The company adopted its Solana-focused strategy in late April, pivoting away from its previous consumer products and e-commerce business. However, Upexi has not added to its Solana holdings since July 23, reflecting a broader slowdown in corporate crypto treasury purchases in the second half of 2025. The pullback comes as digital asset prices have declined and investor confidence in treasury-driven crypto strategies has weakened. UPEXI $UPXI announces $23 million private placement priced at $3.04 per share with warrants, a 1.3x premium to NAV. $10 million upfront plus up to $13 million upon warrant exercise at $4.00.

At its peak in mid-September, the company’s SOL treasury was valued at roughly $525 million. At current prices, that figure has dropped by more than half, leaving Upexi with an estimated paper loss of about 19%. Solana was trading near $123.75 at the time of writing, down 57.5% from its all-time high of $293.31 set in January 2025, CoinGecko data shows. The filing underscores the risks facing companies that have tied their balance sheets closely to volatile digital assets, even as some continue to pursue aggressive accumulation strategies in anticipation of a market rebound. Solana Shrugs Off One of the Largest DDoS Attacks on Record As reported, Solana has successfully withstood a massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that peaked at nearly 6 terabits per second, ranking among the largest ever recorded on the internet. The attack, which lasted for more than a week, did not disrupt network activity, with Solana continuing to process transactions normally and maintaining sub-second confirmation times, according to data shared by SolanaFloor. The incident places Solana alongside major centralized infrastructure providers such as Google Cloud, Cloudflare and AWS, which have previously faced record-scale DDoS assaults. Despite the scale of the traffic, Solana’s validators and core infrastructure absorbed the load without performance degradation, highlighting improvements in the network’s resilience compared to earlier periods marked by congestion and outages.

As digital portfolios become more diversified, borrowers increasingly expect collateral systems that can reflect that diversity. This is where multi-collateral crypto loans come in, allowing users to combine several assets to support a single credit line or loan. Clapp has embraced this approach fully, introducing a dynamic collateral framework that lets borrowers use up to 19 different cryptocurrencies while adjusting and rebalancing their collateral in real time. For anyone serious about borrowing against crypto without exposing themselves to unnecessary volatility risk, understanding how multi-collateral lending works is essential. Why Multi-Collateral Matters Using a single cryptocurrency as collateral works during stable market conditions—but crypto markets rarely stay stable for long. When one asset drops sharply, single-collateral positions can quickly become vulnerable. Borrowers may face higher liquidation risk, margin calls, or sudden collateral top-up requirements. A multi-collateral structure changes that dynamic. Instead of depending on a single coin, borrowers secure their credit lines with a portfolio of assets. Volatility is spread out. Drops in one asset can be cushioned by stability or gains in others. Borrowers gain a more resilient foundation for accessing liquidity, especially during turbulent market cycles. Clapp’s system is built precisely around this principle: create a safer, more flexible borrowing experience by letting users combine assets according to their own strategy. How Clapp’s Dynamic Collateral System Works At Clapp, collateral is not a fixed deposit—it is a dynamic pool that can shift as markets move or borrower needs change. Users can mix BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, LINK, and even stablecoins, all contributing to a single credit limit. When a borrower deposits multiple assets, Clapp calculates the total collateral value and assigns a credit line accordingly. This limit does not lock the borrower into a specific repayment plan. Instead, it acts as a standby facility: liquidity is available instantly, and interest accrues only on the portion actually withdrawn. If a borrower does not use the credit line, the unused portion remains at 0% APR. As market conditions shift, the borrower can rebalance their portfolio—adding assets, removing stablecoins, or replacing volatile tokens. Clapp updates the collateral value in real time, ensuring the crypto credit line reflects the current state of the portfolio. This dynamic structure gives borrowers more control while reducing the probability of forced liquidations. The Benefits of Dynamic Collateral at Clapp The biggest advantage of Clapp’s dynamic collateral is risk distribution. A loan supported entirely by a volatile asset like SOL or LINK may be exposed to sharp drawdowns. But when those assets sit alongside BTC, ETH, and stablecoins, the total risk profile becomes more stable. Another important benefit is higher borrowing capacity. A diversified collateral pool typically increases the overall credit limit, giving borrowers more room to maneuver. Finally, dynamic collateral makes liquidity management smoother. Borrowers can adjust their collateral without interrupting access to their credit line. This flexibility is especially valuable during market volatility, when quick rebalancing can protect the entire position. Why Borrowers Are Moving Toward Multi-Collateral Systems The shift toward multi-collateral lending reflects how crypto portfolios have changed. Borrowers no longer hold just one or two major tokens. Their holdings may span several networks, stablecoins, and ecosystem assets. Being able to borrow against this entire portfolio—not just fragments of it—is becoming a baseline expectation. Clapp’s approach acknowledges this shift. By letting borrowers secure liquidity with a diversified portfolio, Clapp turns crypto collateral into a living financial tool, not a static deposit. Borrowers gain flexibility, resilience, and a better way to navigate market cycles without locking themselves into rigid or inefficient borrowing structures. Final Thoughts Multi-collateral crypto loans offer a more stable, flexible alternative to traditional single-asset collateral systems. By allowing borrowers to combine several cryptocurrencies into one loan structure, platforms reduce liquidation risks and allow users to borrow in a way that reflects the diversity of their portfolios. Clapp’s dynamic collateral model is one of the most advanced implementations of this idea. It adapts to market movements, supports portfolio rebalancing, and ensures that liquidity remains accessible at all times—while charging interest only when borrowers actually use their credit line. For crypto users seeking smarter, more resilient ways to borrow, multi-collateral lending at Clapp represents a significant step forward.

In a surprising trend, a growing wave of former top financial watchdogs is leaving their government posts to join the very sector they once supervised. This brain drain from the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) to major crypto exchanges signals a profound change in how the industry is perceived and operates. What does this mean for the future of crypto in one of the world’s most active markets? Why Are Former Regulators Flocking to the South Korean Crypto Industry? According to an exclusive report by Segye Ilbo, the movement of senior FSS officials into crypto has surged dramatically. Previously, only one or two such officials made the jump each year. However, the pace has accelerated sharply, with five moving in 2023 and a staggering eight making the switch in just the first eleven months of 2024. Over the past five years, 16 former senior regulators have joined the country’s two largest exchanges: nine at Dunamu (operator of Upbit) and seven at Bithumb. This trend isn’t random. It coincides directly with the formalization of South Korea’s cryptocurrency regulatory framework. The tipping point appears to be the Virtual Asset User Protection Act, which took effect in July 2023. This law brought the entire South Korean crypto industry under official regulatory oversight for the first time, creating a clear need for specialized legal and compliance expertise. What Does This Regulatory Brain Drain Mean for Crypto? The influx of former regulators provides crypto firms with invaluable insider knowledge. These officials understand the intricacies of financial law, compliance procedures, and the regulatory mindset. Their expertise helps exchanges navigate the new legal landscape, anticipate future policy shifts, and build more robust, trustworthy platforms. For the market, this trend signals several key developments: Enhanced Legitimacy: The participation of former high-level regulators lends credibility and signals that the industry is maturing beyond its wild-west phase. Stricter Compliance: With experts who helped write the rules now on staff, exchanges are better equipped to implement strong user protection and anti-money laundering measures. Intense Competition: The report notes a fierce “talent war” among exchanges to hire these officials, highlighting their strategic value. Is This a Positive Development for the South Korean Crypto Industry? This movement presents both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, it bridges a critical knowledge gap. Crypto companies gain the expertise needed to operate safely within the law, which ultimately protects investors and stabilizes the market. It fosters a more collaborative relationship between innovators and regulators. However, it also raises questions about the “revolving door” between regulators and the industries they police. Could this influence future policy-making? While common in traditional finance, it’s a new phenomenon for the South Korean crypto industry . The long-term impact will depend on how this expertise is used—whether to merely skirt regulations or to genuinely build a safer, more sustainable ecosystem. The Future of Crypto Regulation in South Korea The migration of regulatory talent marks a new chapter. It suggests that South Korea’s crypto market is transitioning from a regulatory gray area to a formally recognized financial sector. This evolution is crucial for attracting institutional investment and fostering mainstream adoption. As these former officials apply their knowledge, we can expect the South Korean crypto industry to develop more sophisticated internal controls and risk management frameworks. This professionalization is a necessary step for the market’s long-term growth and global competitiveness. Conclusion: A Sign of Maturing Markets The flow of former FSS officials into cryptocurrency firms is more than a career trend; it’s a barometer of market maturation. It demonstrates that the South Korean crypto industry has evolved from a niche interest to a significant, regulated sector of the economy requiring top-tier financial and legal expertise. This integration of regulatory knowledge is a powerful step towards building a more secure, transparent, and trustworthy digital asset ecosystem for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why are so many former South Korean regulators joining crypto companies? They are joining primarily due to the new Virtual Asset User Protection Act. This law created a sudden, high demand for experts who understand financial regulations to help crypto exchanges comply with the new rules. Which crypto exchanges are hiring these former officials? The two largest South Korean exchanges, Dunamu (which operates Upbit) and Bithumb, have hired the majority. Reports indicate 16 former senior FSS officials have joined these two firms over the last five years. Is this “revolving door” between regulators and industry a bad thing? It has pros and cons. It provides crypto firms with essential compliance knowledge, which can make the market safer. However, it requires careful oversight to ensure it doesn’t lead to unfair influence over future regulations. What does this trend mean for the average crypto investor in South Korea? It is likely a positive development for investor protection. Exchanges with deep regulatory expertise are better equipped to implement strong security measures, transparent operations, and proper consumer safeguards. Will this trend continue? As long as the regulatory environment for crypto in South Korea continues to evolve and become more complex, the demand for former regulators with specific expertise is likely to remain high.

56281816,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=883546,1766566866,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56281816.jpeg,South Korea’s BC Card enables stablecoin payments for foreign users,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/south-korean-bc-card-enables-stablecoins/,"South Korean payments company BC Card has concluded its pilot program testing how foreign consumers can pay domestic merchants using stablecoins. The initiative assessed the stability and practicality of integrating digital currencies into the Northeast Asian country’s payment ecosystem. According to a press statement published on BC Card’s website late Tuesday, the two-month-long pilot was conducted in partnership with blockchain financial firm Wavebridge, international digital wallet provider Aaron Group, and cross-border remittance company Global Money Express. BC Card completes testing phase for foreign stablecoin remittances locally In September, BC Card filed a patent for the technology to facilitate stablecoin payments, becoming the first company in the South Korean market to do so. The system calculates the exact number of coins to be deducted from a customer’s digital wallet, accounting for price fluctuations in exchanges, so consumers pay only the necessary amount. During a press briefing at the time of the patent filing, the president of BC Card, Choi Won-seok, said stablecoins are “a powerful paradigm that can transform existing payment processes.” “As the operator of Korea’s largest payment network, BC Card will lead efforts to create an environment where stablecoin payments can be used anywhere with ease,” Choi told reporters. The South Korean payment giant has now completed the program, saying it “verified whether foreign currency-based stablecoins held by foreigners could be used within the domestic payment environment.” The demonstration involved converting stablecoins held in overseas wallets into digital prepaid cards, then using the currency-pegged coins at local cafes and supermarkets through only a QR code, similar to its cross-border payment system with Thailand’s Bangkok Bank. In July, Bangkok Bank and South Korea’s BC Card partnered to launch cross-border QR payments between Thailand and South Korea. South Korean users of the Paybooc app can now make instant QR payments while in Thailand, with transactions processed using real-time exchange rates, according to the companies’ press release. The stablecoin pilot program also incorporated payments into BC Card’s existing card approval and settlement system. This allowed merchants and customers to complete transactions in the same manner as traditional card payments. According to BC Card executives, the technical verification test is a preparatory step for creating a stablecoin payment structure in preparation of changes in domestic laws and financial regulations. The company also mentioned it would continue collaborating with crypto-affiliated organizations to help develop a “Korean-style stablecoin payment infrastructure.” “BC Card is based on a card payment infrastructure and is in line with the domestic legal and institutional environment. We will prepare a stable stablecoin payment model step by step,” the firm’s president reiterated. South Korea stablecoin legislative debates on issuance continue While BC Card pushes forward with stablecoin adoption, South Korea’s government officials are still debating stablecoin regulation, the Digital Asset Basic Act, specifically who should be authorized to issue won-denominated stablecoins. The Bank of Korea (BOK) supports restricting issuance to consortia led by commercial banks holding at least 51% of stakes, but the Financial Services Commission (FSC) advocates for the inclusion of nonbank entities like fintech and blockchain firms, arguing this could boost innovation and expand the digital asset industry. Members of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), like Representative Ahn Do-geol, and most of the 20 external advisers in the discussions are worried about the proposed governance structure. The governing party had asked the FSC to submit a government-backed bill by the end of this year, but the disagreements between the BOK and the FSC have delayed the bill’s presentation until early next year. At a Monday meeting of the DPK’s task force, stablecoin issuance was profoundly discussed and the BOK’s proposal was the central topic of debate. “It is also hard to find global legislative precedents in which institutions from a specific sector are required to hold a 51 percent stake,” Ahn surmised, speaking to news publications after the meeting. Opponents believe the queries over financial stability should be answered by alternative regulatory and technological steps, not by restricting issuance to banks. “Issuers should be selected based on their ability to advance innovation rather than their institutional classification,” the member of the party’s digital asset task force concluded.

Here’s the Latest for XRP Army,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-in-late-stage-talks-for-2026-ipo-heres-the-latest-for-xrp-army/,"A fresh claim circulating among digital asset observers has renewed focus on whether Ripple could soon take a step toward the public markets. Crypto researcher SMQKE has pointed to what he describes as documented indications that the blockchain company is engaged in late-stage discussions for a potential initial public offering in 2026. The assertion, supported by images, frames the development as part of a broader shift in how mature crypto firms are approaching traditional finance. Rather than relying on speculation, the analyst’s post emphasizes that the information is grounded in research documents and market commentary, suggesting that Ripple is being grouped with other industry players preparing for or already entering public listings. RIPPLE REPORTEDLY IN LATE-STAGE TALKS FOR 2026 IPO Documented. https://t.co/RBxgDaJ7sU pic.twitter.com/7G1Aj23idD — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) December 21, 2025 Research Note Signals Ripple Among IPO Candidates The material referenced by SMQKE includes a highlighted excerpt from a Presto Research report examining the current IPO landscape for major crypto companies. The research notes that while Circle has already completed its debut on the New York Stock Exchange, several other firms, including Kraken, Grayscale, and BitGo, have filed registration statements. Within this context, Ripple and Consensys are purportedly in late-stage talks. The report’s framing presents public listings as an increasingly common milestone for established crypto businesses, positioning IPOs as a natural progression for firms seeking broader market validation and long-term growth. By associating Ripple with this group, the research implies that the company is being viewed alongside peers that are actively preparing for life as publicly traded entities. Market Backdrop Reinforces the Narrative One of the attached visuals highlights Circle’s market performance following its NYSE debut, underscoring the interest of institutional investors in the sector SMQKE’s inclusion of this chart appears intended to show that crypto-related listings are no longer theoretical but are already unfolding in real time, creating a backdrop against which Ripple’s reported talks gain additional relevance. The analyst’s framing suggests that Ripple’s potential move would not be isolated, but rather part of a wider trend in which established crypto infrastructure companies are seeking deeper integration with traditional capital markets. Community Sees Regulatory Implications The claim also drew a reaction from within the crypto community. Commenting on the report, X Finance Bull noted that, if accurate, such a move would represent a significant milestone, arguing that an IPO would reflect growing regulatory confidence more than market hype. The response highlights how some observers interpret a potential listing not just as a business decision, but as a signal about Ripple’s standing within the evolving regulatory environment. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Earlier Remarks from Ripple’s Leadership The report contrasts with comments made earlier this year by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. According to a Times Tabloid report, Garlinghouse stated during an appearance at the CfC St. Moritz conference that Ripple had no plans to pursue an IPO in 2025. He explained that companies often go public to raise capital, adding that this has not been a necessity for Ripple . He noted that the company has not needed to raise capital and that this has therefore not been a driving force behind any listing decision. Taken together, SMQKE’s claim and Garlinghouse’s earlier remarks suggest that, if discussions are indeed underway, they may reflect a longer-term shift in strategy aimed beyond 2025, aligning with a possible 2026 timeline.

Bitcoin was stuck below $90,000, while the market capitalization of all coins plunged to $2.94 trillion. This article provides a prediction of top tokens like Uniswap (UNI), Solana (SOL), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Uniswap price prediction The Uniswap token has remained on edge in the past few days despite some notable developments in the network. The most important one happened this week when the community members voted to the unification vote. This vote will merge Uniswap and Unichain , meaning that its network fees will be incinerated afterwards. Most importantly, the network will burn 100 million tokens from the treasury. A token burn removes the amount of tokens in circulation, a notable thing as the supply of tokens in exchanges has dropped in the past few months. The daily timeframe chart shows that the UNI price has dropped in the past few months moving from $12.25 in August to the current $5.60. Uniswap token is hovering near the important support level at $4.686, a level it failed to move below since April this year. The token has moved below the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) and is below the Supertrend indicator. It has also formed a head-and-shoulders pattern, a common bearish reversal sign. Therefore, the token will likely have a bearish breakout, a move that will be confirmed if it moves below the support at $4.686. A move below that level will point to more downside, potentially to the psychological level at $4. UNI price chart | Source: TradingView Solana price technical analysis Solana, like other altcoins, has dropped in the past few months, moving from a high of $252 in September to the current $121. The token has dropped as it continued to lose market share against Ethereum, a chain that has continued to dominate in key industries like decentralized finance and real-world asset tokenization. Solana has some bullish catalysts, including the rising ETF inflows and the upcoming Alpenglow upgrade, which will increase its performance significantly. The token has remained below all moving averages, a sign that bears are in control. Most importantly, it has formed a bearish flag pattern, which is made up of a vertical line and an ascending channel. Solana remains below the Supertrend and the Ichimoku cloud indicators. Therefore, the token will likely have a strong bearish breakdown in the coming weeks, potentially to the key support at $100. SOL price chart | Source: TradingView Shiba Inu Coin price prediction Shiba Inu Coin price slumped in the past few months and is now hovering near its lowest level in years. The token has plunged as demand for meme coins plunged. Indeed, a closer look shows that most of these tokens have plunged by over 60% from their peaks in 2025. Shiba Inu has remained below all moving averages, while top oscillators like the Relative Strength Index and the MACD indicators have continued falling this month. SHIB price chart | Source: TradingView On the positive side, the token has formed a falling wedge whose two lines are about to converge. Therefore, the token will likely rebound and possibly retest the key resistance level at $0.000010.

The stablecoin has joined the Binance ecosystem with a 20% yield product. USD1 expanded its supply in the past day, just after adding another yield product in the Binance ecosystem. The new supply entered the market just as USD1 was added to the Binance Booster program. The program is limited to 50,000 USD1 deposits and offers a 20% annualized yield. The yield is part of Binance’s usual Earn program, with a special addition of USD1. The stablecoin, minted by World Liberty Fi, will have a limited period for subscriptions, running from December 24 to January 23, 2026. USD1 is represented on Binance through the USD1/USDT pair. Additionally, Binance has suggested users can acquire the token through the P2P Express market. Existing holders can deposit the USD1 into their Binance account. Will USD1 expand its influence? USD1 already has most of its supply active on the BNB Chain, with an even higher total float of over $2.85B . The token has been added to multiple DeFi protocols, though with a much lower APY. The stablecoin is already active and can gain yield through PancakeSwap, Uniswap , and Venus Protocol. However, the addition to Binance’s official yield program will give the token more exposure. Just after the new token mint, USD1 trading volumes also grew to a one-month peak. The newly injected supply coincided with sudden investor interest, with $1.39B in daily volumes. USD1 expanded its supply by over 45M tokens, with a spike in trading activity. Over $150M in buy orders were placed on the Binance USD1/USDT pair just after announcing the 20% yield product. | Source: CoinGecko . On the USD1/USDT pair on Binance, more than $150M in buying volume emerged after the announcement. The centralized exchange also has the biggest share of USD1 spot trading. The increased trading interest is considered a signal of demand for secure yield. Yield-bearing stablecoins are becoming one of the staples in the crypto market. Large-scale investors and institutions have abandoned most other risky narratives, instead choosing the most liquid ecosystems. Can WLFI make a comeback? The increased influence of USD1 sparked a discussion on the eventual growth of the World Liberty Fi project. The platform is expected to launch an app in early 2026, potentially reviving the WLFI token. Before the latest yield product launch, USD1 was widely used in meme token pairs in the Binance ecosystem. For a brief period, those pairs were one of the liveliest meme token hubs. The extremely volatile behavior of memes led to a withdrawal of users. Now, USD1 may be used in a much more predictable way, with yield accrued daily into user accounts. As of December 24, WLFI tokens traded above $0.13, up from a local low of $0.12 in the past week. WLFI has not been instrumental to the ecosystem, and did not rise even after World Liberty Fi added buybacks. Get seen where it counts.

ETH dropped to a low of $2,935 on Wednesday, down sharply from the year-to-date high of $4,945. This article provides an ETH price prediction and what to expect in the near term. Ethereum price prediction The daily chart shows that the ETH price has plunged in the past few months. It has crashed from the year-to-date high of $4,945 to the current $2,2935. The token formed a death cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) crossed each other on November 23, confirming the ongoing bearish breakdown. ETH price has formed a bearish flag pattern, which is made up of a vertical line and an ascending channel. It has now moved below the lower side of the ascending channel. Ethereum token has also dropped below the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level. It has moved below the Ichimoku cloud and the Supertrend indicators. The token has moved below the Strong, Pivot, and Reverse level of the Murrey Math Lines. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where the token continues falling, potentially to the next key support level at $2,500. This is an important level as it was the ultimate support of the Murrey Math Lines and also the psychological level. A move below that level will point to more downside, potentially to the psychological point at $2,000. On the other hand, a move above the key resistance level at $3,437, the bottom of the trading range. Such a move will push it to the year-to-date high of $4,960. Ethereum price chart | Source: TradingView ETH price has bullish catalysts as headwinds remain Ethereum price is facing some major headwinds that may push it lower in the near term. One of them is the ongoing crypto market crash that has affected Bitcoin and other altcoins. Indeed, for the first time in year, Bitcoin has crashed as other assets like gold, silver, and the S&P 500 jumped. Ethereum is also facing the challenge of the ongoing altcoin season weakness. Data compiled by CMC shows that the Altcoin Season Index has dropped sharply in the past few months. Meanwhile, demand for Ethereum ETFs has waned in the past few weeks. These funds shed over $10.9 million in assets this week, bringing the cumulative monthly outflow to $510 million. The funds shed over $1.42 billion in assets last month. Additionally, the volatility may jump sharply in the coming days as investors prepare for a major options expiry. Over $3 billion worth of expiry will happen on Friday, and in most cases, this is usually accompanied by volatility. Still, despite all this, the Ethereum price faces some major tailwinds that may boost its performance in the long term. Its supply in exchanges has dropped to a multi-year low, while its market share in key industries like decentralized finance, stablecoins, and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization has grown. Its dominance has grown even as competition rose. Also, while the Ethereum ETFs have had outflows recently, the reality is that they have added over $12 billion in the less than 2 years, which iss an encouraging number.

According to local media reports , Spanish authorities are preparing to overhaul the country’s crypto regulations next year by fully implementing the two European Union frameworks, MiCA and DAC8, which will reshape how digital assets are governed and taxed. The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) was developed to establish a harmonised legal framework for crypto businesses and has now been enforced across the European Union. MiCA deadline extension Spain is extending its transition period for crypto firms to the maximum allowed 18 months, targeting full adoption of the regulation by July 1, 2026. As a result, crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) that were registered with the Bank of Spain or operating legally before December 30, 2024, can continue to serve customers until this new date. Initially, back in October 2023, Spanish authorities agreed upon a plan to fast-track MiCA implementation by enforcing the rules from December 30, 2025, in a bid to position the country as a leader in digital finance regulation. However, this timeline came with major challenges, as it has created a backlog of MiCA license applications , which is an extensive process requiring over 100 pages of detailed information on operations, governance, and risk management systems. To prevent a cliff-edge scenario where many non-compliant firms would be forced to cease operations overnight, the Spanish government has revised its stance. Once in force, the framework would require CASPs to obtain full authorisation and comply with strict operational, capital, and security standards, including anti-money laundering and customer verification obligations. MiCA also introduces passporting rights, wherein a CASP licensed in one EU country would be able to offer their services in other member states without having to secure separate national authorizations. Earlier this month, Spain’s national securities regulator, the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores, outlined its MiCA enforcement roadmap via a dedicated Q&A, highlighting various procedures such as the application process, transitional rules, and how cross-border services will be handled. Spain to adopt DAC8 rules Spain will also tighten its approach to crypto taxation starting January 1, 2026, under the DAC8 framework, which is the eighth amendment to the existing Directive on Administrative Cooperation and specifically extends EU tax transparency rules to cover crypto-assets and e-money. DAC8 has been designed to increase oversight and curb tax fraud and evasion by allowing tax administrations to access the necessary financial information on crypto users. Under this framework, CASPs that have EU-resident clients would be required to collect specific information about their users, such as names, addresses, and tax identification numbers, and report details of reportable transactions to the relevant tax authorities. The framework also allows various national authorities to automatically exchange this information with the tax authorities of the user’s country of residence, ensuring a unified view of crypto activity across the EU.

This planned Binance ETH suspension is scheduled to support essential network wallet maintenance, beginning at 5:55 a.m. UTC on December 25th. For traders and holders, understanding the details is crucial to avoid disruption. What Does the Binance ETH Suspension Mean for You? The announcement means that during the maintenance window, you will not be able to move your Ethereum tokens into or out of your Binance spot wallet. However, it’s vital to note what remains unaffected. Trading of ETH and all other cryptocurrencies on the Binance spot and futures markets will continue as normal. This Binance ETH suspension is specifically for the movement of the asset on-chain. Why Is This Maintenance Necessary? Regular network and wallet maintenance is a standard practice for any secure financial platform. For a blockchain like Ethereum, these updates can involve: Security Enhancements: Implementing the latest protocols to protect user funds. Infrastructure Upgrades: Improving node performance and synchronization for faster future processing. Wallet Optimization: Ensuring the internal systems handling ETH are running at peak efficiency. This proactive Binance ETH suspension for maintenance demonstrates the exchange’s commitment to operational security and stability, a key pillar of trust in the crypto ecosystem. How Should You Prepare for the Temporary Halt? With the timing confirmed, users have a clear window to prepare. Here are actionable steps to take before 5:55 a.m. UTC on December 25th: Plan Your Transactions: Complete any urgent ETH deposits or withdrawals well in advance of the deadline. No Need to Sell: Remember, your ETH holdings are safe. This is a temporary operational pause, not a fund freeze. Monitor Official Channels: Follow Binance’s official Twitter or check their announcement page for the latest updates on completion. By taking these simple precautions, you can ensure the Binance ETH suspension causes zero stress to your portfolio strategy. What Happens After the Maintenance Window? Once the wallet maintenance is complete, Binance will reopen ETH deposits and withdrawals. The exchange typically provides a follow-up announcement. Services are expected to resume smoothly, but users should be aware that high network demand post-maintenance could lead to slightly longer processing times for transactions, which is common across all platforms after such updates. Conclusion: A Routine Step for a Secure Future While any service interruption can cause concern, this planned Binance ETH suspension is a standard and responsible operational procedure. It underscores the complex, ongoing work required to maintain the secure infrastructure that powers the digital asset economy. For users, it’s a brief pause that prioritizes the long-term safety and efficiency of their Ethereum assets on the platform. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade ETH on Binance during the suspension? A: Yes. The suspension only affects deposits and withdrawals from the network. Trading of ETH and all other pairs on Spot and Futures markets will operate normally. Q2: Are my ETH funds safe during this time? A: Absolutely. Your funds remain securely held in your Binance wallet. The suspension is for on-chain movement only, not access to your account balance. Q3: Will this affect other Ethereum-based tokens (ERC-20)? A: The announcement specifies Ethereum (ETH). However, it is always prudent to check Binance’s official announcement page for any related updates concerning ERC-20 token services, as they often rely on the same network infrastructure. Q4: How long will the suspension last? A: Binance has announced a start time but not a specific end time. Maintenance durations can vary. Users should monitor Binance’s official channels for the completion announcement. Q5: What time zone is the 5:55 a.m. UTC deadline? A: UTC stands for Coordinated Universal Time. You can use online time zone converters to check what this equates to in your local time to ensure you don’t miss the cutoff. Q6: Do other exchanges do this kind of maintenance? A: Yes, periodic network wallet maintenance is an industry-standard practice for all major cryptocurrency exchanges to ensure security and upgrade systems.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-this-is-decision-time-for-xrp-heres-why/,"As digital asset markets search for a clear direction, a new chart shared by prominent cryptocurrency influencer Amonyx has drawn attention to a pivotal moment for XRP. Rather than focusing on short-term volatility, the post points readers to a broader timing structure that, in his view, places XRP at a point where a decisive move may soon emerge. The message frames the current period as one where the market must choose its next direction. Amonyx Points to a Repeating Historical Pattern In his update, Amonyx highlights a technical chart sourced from analyst TheBlockBull that maps XRP’s price action against major Bitcoin halving cycles. The emphasis is not on day-to-day fluctuations but on how XRP has behaved in the months following each halving event. According to the chart he shared, previous cycles show XRP forming extended consolidation phases before entering strong upward moves well after the halving dates. Amonyx characterizes the present setup as “decision time,” suggesting that XRP is again nearing a stage where historical patterns indicate a meaningful shift could occur. His focus is on whether the asset will follow the structure seen in prior cycles or diverge from it under current market conditions. Decision time for $XRP . Via @TheBlockBull pic.twitter.com/UHqw9PuRzB — Amonyx (@amonyx) December 21, 2025 Details from TheBlockBull’s Weekly Chart The attached image displays XRP/USD on a weekly timeframe, with Bitcoin halving dates in 2016, 2020, and 2024 clearly marked. Each cycle highlights a similar window of roughly 77 weekly candles, equivalent to about 539 days, between a halving and a notable peak in XRP’s price. The chart also references trading volume around those peaks, underlining the scale of activity during prior advances. Trendlines drawn across historical highs and subsequent consolidations suggest a long-term structure guiding price action over multiple years. By sharing this visual, Amonyx highlights that the current phase aligns closely with the time windows that preceded major moves for XRP. Where XRP Stands Now At the right edge of the chart, XRP is shown trading near the $2.02 region, following a recent high marked around $3.66. This positioning places the asset beneath prior cycle peaks but still within the broader structure outlined on the chart. The implication in Amonyx’s post is that XRP is compressing within a range that could soon resolve, either confirming the historical pattern or breaking away from it. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Rather than making an explicit price prediction, the message centers on timing and structure. The focus remains on whether XRP can build momentum similar to what followed earlier halving cycles. What “Decision Time” Signals for the Market By calling this period a decisive moment, Amonyx conveys that XRP may be approaching a point where market participants determine the next sustained trend. The chart he shared frames this as part of a longer narrative, where a sharp rally has historically followed patience through extended consolidation. His post leaves readers with the idea that the coming weeks and months could reveal whether XRP is prepared to mirror past behavior or chart a different course in the current cycle.

For only $0.035 in Phase 6 presale, MUTM is getting lots of attention as the next big cryptocurrency that market speculators are looking for seeking an early entry of a promising DeFi investment before others do. While Ethereum (ETH) is already leading on the decentralized space and favored by institutional investors, analysts have pointed out that MUTM is seen as a likely surprise leader of December since it is already boasting quite innovative tokenomics on top of a complete roadmap. MUTM aims to roll out their V1 lending and borrowing solution, their passive income solution for earning through mtTokens, and their stablecoin ecosystem among others that make it clear that this cryptocurrency is already a rare find. When considering the comparison and analysis related to investment choices for the emerging markets, the focus now revolves around what the ideal investment choice for the present time might be. It’s evident that the MUTM, being one of the upcoming cryptos that are already witnessing development and adoption levels, has attracted the notice of both small and whale wallets. Ethereum Consolidates Near Key Support, Awaits Next Move Ethereum (ETH) recently did a sweep of a sell-side liquidity level below the $2,850 area, which led to a strong bounce, signaling that buyers are ever-present to participate on the higher-timeframe levels. However, since then, it has been ranging around the $2,950-$3,000 area, a former equilibrium level, which has acted as a resistance level in the past, signaling that the market has paused for its next movement. In the 4-hour chart, the market momentum exhibited by the price actions is corrective, which holds below the latest major high, signaling that for the market to continue its bullish trend, there must be a breakout and hold above the $3,050-$3,100 area, which might help create a gateway for the market to touch the $3,250 area, apart from the former highs. Failure to hold on to the recently observed levels might take the market back to the former levels surrounding the $2,800-$2,750 area. Ethereum is undergoing a compression phase, which might soon enter its expansion phase, due to eagerness among the community. Despite being one of the biggest cryptos, investors are actualizing their focus on alternative coins, which might be the best cryptos to invest in. MUTM Presale Mutuum Finance is gathering pace and proving to be among the strongest prospects in the world of DeFi. Presale Stage 6 is already 99% sold out, with over 18,550 individuals participating and chipping in a staggering $19.5 million. The token is still available for $0.035, although this will not last for long as Stage 7 will witness an increase to $0.04, meaning by 20%. The fact that demand is overwhelming further accentuates the attractiveness of MUTM. Specifically, it is important to note that most altcoins are generally unsupported by their use case, which is a fact that is directly addressed by the unique case presented by Mutuum Finance and encapsulated by its tokenomics. Collateral Management and Risk Protection Mutuum Finance is built with strong security measures against the risks that may affect users and the protocol. Collateralization ratio targets, lending, and deposit limits work together to ensure Mutuum Finance remains stable. Under-collateralized positions are liquidated quickly via enforced penalties and liquidation guarantees. This protocol focuses on the conservative management of LTV ratios as well as highly collateralized loans that maximize capital efficiency. In reserve provisioning, reserve smoothing aims to mitigate risks associated with extreme market conditions by allocating extra reserves to more volatile assets. Ethereum (ETH) is still a leading blue-chip investment, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving to be a more attractive investment in December as a more promising early-stage opportunity. At phase 6, the project is already 99% sold out, generating $19.5M from over 18,550 participants. There is no doubt that Mutuum Finance is one of the most attractive investment choices as one weighs the best crypto investment opportunity.

Taking to TradingView, crypto analyst DomicChaina explains what is happening behind this phenomenon and why the Ethereum price is unlikely to see any meaningful recovery. As it stands, it seems the leading altcoin is more likely to suffer a rejection toward new monthly lows than actually stage a rebound. Technical Factors Drive Ethereum Price Further Down The crypto analyst highlights some technical developments that point to the Ethereum price being stuck in a bearish phase. One of the major ones has to do with both the EMA34 and the EMA89. According to the analyst, the price performance in relation to these two EMAs suggests that the downtrend will continue. Related Reading: Why This Market Analyst Is Advising XRP Investors Not To Sell Their Coins For one, the EMA39 had actually crossed below the EMA84, and at the same time, both of these moving averages have been moving downward. This means that despite recovery efforts, it still puts the Ethereum price in a medium-term downtrend. Chaina adds that this means that the current trend is sideways or a basing process, rather than pointing downward. For there to be any meaningful recovery, the Ethereum price would have to break out of this range. However, as long as it continues to maintain this structure, then the expectation is that the altcoin will continue to decline, moving toward the next major support at $2,500. Resistance Remains Strong In addition to the overall trend pointing downward, there is also the issue of mounting resistance at $3,090, coinciding with the EMA34. So far, this resistance has been the death of multiple recovery attempts, with the latest being stopped in its tracks earlier this week as well. With the EMA89 also pointing downward, it means that the price is likely to decline and then recover from here. Related Reading: Why This Friday Could Be Very Big For The Bitcoin Price The analysis also highlights the declining volume as evidence that capital inflows into the altcoin remain weak. With the holidays, this is not expected to change as investors move away from the market to focus on the celebrations. “This week falls into a holiday period, leading to reduced market liquidity, which makes price movements more sluggish and lacking breakout momentum,” the post read. Recovery candles also remaining very short and brief show a stifling of the recovery attempts so far, and those that could follow. For now, the Ethereum price continues to trend below $3,000, recording a 37% decline from its 2025 all-time highs.

First in line in the previous category, Gate.io has about 500 tokens trading in the loss column and just over 100 above.

Mid-tier exchanges Bitget is counting 250 tokens trading below listing price and only a few dozen above it, HTX and Bybit each record more than 100 tokens underwater, and lastly, Coinbase and Binance, though listing fewer tokens overall, still show a clear skew toward negative performance. Crypto market doom cloud came from Bitcoin’s uneven year The cryptocurrency market this year has once again been a story of a bad Bitcoin performance, sharing the spoils with altcoins. The largest coin by market cap has declined by almost 8% year-to-date, which is why a majority of traders believe we are in a bear market. BTC has only ended the year in the red in 2014, 2018, and 2022, all recognized as bear years. October 10’s liquidation doomsday caused Bitcoin prices to tank by 10%, losing over $14,000 in a single session. “Gold acting like Bitcoin. Bitcoin is acting like a boomer stock. Boomer stocks are acting like memecoins. This is the worst timeline possible,” joked trader CryptoUB on X. According to CryptoQuant contributor Woominkyu, Bitcoin’s cycle momentum BCMI index dropped to the 0.5 zone on October 21, which market watchers did not consider to be a cycle top. Since then, Bitcoin’s price and BCMI have gone down even further as markets reset price levels and sellers pour their coins back to the market. Woominkyu explained that during meaningful cycle bottoms like those in 2019 and 2023, the BCMI reached the 0.25–0.35 range. This could mean BTC will not likely sustain upward momentum till at least the first quarter of 2026. At the time of this update, Bitcoin is trading near $86,881 and is down just under 1% on the day. Early session attempts at recovery briefly pushed prices toward the $87,000–$89,000 range, but bulls failed to keep the charge going. A consolidation below the psychologically important $90,000 level is not what maxis asked for Christmas, and if downward pressure resumes, Bitcoin could test $84,000 or dip to the $82,000–$83,000 support levels. In other news, US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded net outflows of $188.64 million on Tuesday, according to data from SoSoValue.

This move, targeting a final goal of $500 million, underscores a strategic, long-term bet on the blockchain ecosystem’s infrastructure and its most scalable projects. For investors and builders in the digital asset space, this isn’t just news—it’s a roadmap for where smart money is flowing next. What is the HashKey Capital Crypto Fund Strategy? The newly launched HashKey Capital crypto fund isn’t chasing fleeting trends. Instead, it adopts a deliberate, multi-strategy approach. The firm plans to deploy capital across a spectrum of opportunities, with a laser focus on two critical areas: foundational blockchain infrastructure and applications demonstrating genuine, high scalability potential. This indicates a mature investment thesis aimed at strengthening the very pillars of the Web3 world. Capital for this ambitious fund was raised from a prestigious group of global institutions, sophisticated family offices, and high-net-worth individuals. This diverse backing highlights a crucial shift: major financial players are moving beyond mere curiosity to making substantial, calculated commitments to the crypto asset class through trusted, experienced gatekeepers like HashKey Capital. Why Does This Major Fundraising Matter for Crypto? This successful $250 million raise acts as a vital barometer for the health of the venture landscape in digital assets. After a period of market contraction, a fund of this scale and pedigree signals renewed institutional conviction. It provides essential fuel for innovators building the next generation of blockchain technology. The focus areas of the HashKey Capital crypto fund reveal key insights for the market: Infrastructure is King: Investment in core protocols, security solutions, and developer tools is seen as a priority, ensuring the ecosystem can grow robustly. Scalability is the Gateway: Projects that can handle mass adoption—through layer-2 solutions, efficient consensus mechanisms, or interoperable networks—are in high demand. Institutional Endorsement: The caliber of investors involved lends significant credibility and stability to the broader sector. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead? While the capital influx is a powerful positive signal, deploying a $500 million fund effectively comes with its own set of challenges. The team at HashKey Capital must navigate a competitive landscape to identify truly transformative projects amidst a sea of proposals. Furthermore, they must manage the expectations of their sophisticated investor base in a market known for its volatility. However, the opportunities are immense. This fund positions HashKey Capital at the forefront of financing the foundational technology that could power everything from decentralized finance (DeFi) to tokenized real-world assets. Their selective, infrastructure-first approach could accelerate the development of a more efficient, secure, and user-friendly blockchain internet. Conclusion: A Vote of Confidence for Blockchain’s Next Chapter The successful first close of HashKey Capital’s fourth crypto fund is more than a financial headline. It is a substantial vote of confidence from the traditional financial world in the enduring potential of blockchain technology.

Wintermute’s latest market update confirms what many traders feared. Retail investors are rotating out of altcoins and back into major assets, signaling the end of the anticipated altcoin rally that typically follows Bitcoin’s strong performance. The broader crypto market extended losses over the past 24 hours, with Bitcoin slipping 1.12% below $87,000 and Ethereum dropping 1.5% near $3,000. Several altcoins saw sharp pullbacks, with the NFT sector leading declines at over 9% as weak short-term risk appetite dominated trading activity. Source: Wintermute Bitcoin and Ethereum Absorb Market Pressure Crypto markets saw intense downside pressure early last week, with Bitcoin falling below $85,000 midweek and Ethereum breaching $3,000. Liquidations surged to approximately $600 million on Monday, followed by another $400 million each day on Wednesday and Thursday as choppy conditions forced leveraged positions out rapidly. Bitcoin gradually recovered toward $90,000 later in the week, but the price action remained constrained. Perpetual open interest dropped $3 billion for Bitcoin and $2 billion for Ethereum overnight, leaving markets vulnerable to sharp moves despite reduced leverage heading into the Christmas holiday period. Wintermute’s internal flow data reveals aggregate buying pressure returning to major assets, with institutional flow providing consistent support since the summer. Source: Wintermute The more notable shift involves retail traders rotating out of altcoins and back into Bitcoin and Ethereum, aligning with the growing consensus that Bitcoin must lead before risk appetite sustainably moves down the market cap curve. For now, Wintermute stood on the path that “ the market continues to trade choppy as liquidity continues to be thin and discretionary desks winding down into year end. ” Macro Headwinds Compound Altcoin Struggles Markets remain range-bound as liquidity thins and discretionary desks wind down into year-end. Downside moves stay abrupt but increasingly self-contained as leverage flushes quickly and capital retrenches into the most liquid assets. Bitcoin and Ethereum continue acting as primary risk absorbers while the broader market struggles under supply pressure and limited risk appetite. “ Funding and basis across majors remained relatively compressed through the sell-off, ” Wintermute said, with options markets continuing to price a wide range of outcomes as implied volatility stays elevated. Notably, a recent Galaxy Research analysis shows that Bitcoin never crossed $100,000 when adjusted for inflation using 2020 dollars, despite reaching an all-time high above $126,000 in October. “ If you adjust the price of Bitcoin for inflation using 2020 dollars, BTC never crossed $100,000 ,” Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy, said. “ It actually topped at $99,848 in 2020 dollar terms. “ Traditional Finance Entry Offers Medium-Term Support Traditional financial players continue entering the space despite recent market volatility, providing a more durable foundation for future growth. Bitmine added another 67,886 ETH worth $201 million to its treasury, bringing total December purchases to approximately $953 million. However, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF net flows have turned negative since early November, signaling reduced institutional participation and broader crypto-market liquidity contraction. Source: X/@Cointelegraph Bitcoin ETFs recorded $650.8 million in outflows over the past four days, led by BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), which recorded the largest single-day outflow of $157 million. Ethereum spot ETFs also recorded a net outflow of $95.52 million, with all nine ETFs posting no inflows, according to SosoValue . Farzam Ehsani, co-founder and CEO of VALR, outlined two plausible scenarios heading into 2026. “ Either the current drawdown reflects strategic positioning by large players ahead of renewed accumulation, or the market is undergoing a deeper reset driven by macro headwinds and Federal Reserve policy, ” he told Cryptonews. David Schassler, head of multi-asset solutions at VanEck, also maintained a constructive outlook despite current weakness. Bitcoin prices would recoup in 2026, setting it up to be a “top performer,” despite the current market downturn, VanEck manager predicts. #VanEck #Bitcoin2026 #BTCOutlook https://t.co/3t8TvlvWcj — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 24, 2025 “ Bitcoin is lagging the Nasdaq 100 Index by roughly 50% year-to-date, and that dislocation is setting it up to be a top performer in 2026, ” he wrote in the company’s 2026 outlook report. Ehsani sees scope for Bitcoin to revisit the $100,000–$120,000 range in the second quarter of 2026, though he cautioned that “ without the emergence of new major players, there will be no altcoin season ; at best, we can expect a market recovery to previous levels. “ The post Wintermute Warns: Altcoin Season Is Dead as Bitcoin Dominance Soars appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Ethereum|Wintermute,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-12-24 09:44:59

A veteran Bitcoin OG, an early and long-term holder, has moved a colossal 100,000 Ethereum (ETH) worth approximately $290 million into the Binance exchange. This single move by a market whale sends powerful ripples through the community and raises critical questions about strategy, risk, and market sentiment. Who Is This Bitcoin OG and What Did They Do? According to data from on-chain analytics provider Onchainlens, the address starting with ‘0x99E1E’ executed this massive deposit. The term ‘Bitcoin OG’ signifies more than just wealth; it represents an early adopter with proven staying power through multiple market cycles. Their actions are often scrutinized for clues about future price movements. This specific Bitcoin OG didn’t just move ETH. On-chain data reveals a high-risk, high-reward portfolio strategy currently in play. The address holds significant leveraged long positions, betting heavily on the future price appreciation of major cryptocurrencies. Decoding the Bitcoin OG’s High-Stakes Bet Beyond the deposit, the real story lies in the wallet’s active trading positions. This investor is not sitting on the sidelines. They are aggressively positioned for an uptrend, but this strategy comes with immense risk, especially in a volatile market. 5x Leveraged Long on Bitcoin (BTC): A bet that Bitcoin’s price will increase, magnified five times. 5x Leveraged Long on Ethereum (ETH): A similar magnified bet on Ethereum’s price rising. 20x Leveraged Long on Solana (SOL): An extremely aggressive, high-conviction bet on Solana, amplified twentyfold. However, these bets are currently underwater. The combined unrealized loss across these leveraged positions stands at a staggering $55 million. This context makes the $290 million ETH deposit to Binance even more significant. Why Would a Bitcoin OG Make This Move? What does a deposit of this scale signal? Several theories are circulating among analysts. The move could be strategic preparation for several outcomes, each with different implications for the market. First, the Bitcoin OG might be preparing to add more collateral to their leveraged positions. A large deposit can help avoid a margin call if prices dip further. Second, they could be planning to take some profits off the table by selling a portion of the ETH, potentially applying selling pressure. Alternatively, they might be rebalancing their portfolio or preparing to enter new, undiscovered positions. The Critical Lesson for Every Crypto Investor Watching a Bitcoin OG operate offers a masterclass in market psychology and risk management. While their capital allows for bold moves, the core principles are universal. The current $55 million paper loss on their leveraged bets is a stark reminder: leverage cuts both ways. For the average investor, this event underscores the importance of understanding on-chain data and the actions of major holders. However, it also highlights the dangers of over-leveraging, even for the most experienced players. The market offers no guarantees, and even OGs can face significant drawdowns. Conclusion: A Signal in the Noise The $290 million ETH deposit by a prominent Bitcoin OG is more than a large transaction; it’s a narrative-rich event that reveals the complex strategies at the highest levels of crypto investing. It combines a show of substantial asset ownership with a visible, high-risk trading strategy currently facing headwinds. This move will be closely watched as a potential indicator of whether this seasoned investor is shoring up defenses or preparing for a new offensive. It serves as a powerful reminder that in cryptocurrency, monumental wealth and monumental risk often travel hand in hand. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‘Bitcoin OG’ mean? A: ‘Bitcoin OG’ stands for ‘Original Gangster’ and is a term of respect in the crypto community for early adopters who have held Bitcoin since its early days and have weathered multiple market cycles. Q2: Why is a deposit to an exchange significant? A: Large deposits to centralized exchanges like Binance often precede a trade—either to sell (creating selling pressure) or to use as collateral for other financial activities like borrowing or securing leveraged positions. Q3: What is an unrealized loss? A: An unrealized loss is a decrease in the value of an open investment that has not yet been sold. It becomes a realized loss only if the position is closed at that lower price. Q4: Is it common for Bitcoin OGs to use high leverage? A: While not all do, some large holders (whales) use leverage to amplify potential returns. This strategy is extremely risky and can lead to rapid, significant losses, as seen in this case. Q5: Should I follow what Bitcoin OGs do? A> While their actions provide valuable market intelligence, they should not be your sole investment guide. Their risk tolerance, capital, and strategy are vastly different from most retail investors. Always conduct your own research. Found this deep dive into the Bitcoin OG’s massive move insightful?

56284122,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=252257,1766570410,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin’s Sluggish Performance: 4 Key Reasons the Santa Rally Fizzled,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-sluggish-performance-santa-rally/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Sluggish Performance: 4 Key Reasons the Santa Rally Fizzled As the holiday season approaches, many Bitcoin investors anticipated a classic ‘Santa rally’ to cap off the year. Instead, the market is witnessing a surprisingly sluggish performance . What’s causing this unexpected downturn? A recent analysis by DL News points to four critical factors putting the brakes on Bitcoin’s momentum as we head into the new year. Why is Bitcoin’s Performance So Sluggish Right Now? This sluggish performance isn’t random. It results from a perfect storm of market mechanics and shifting sentiment. Understanding these forces is crucial for any investor navigating the current crypto landscape. Let’s break down the four primary reasons identified by experts. 1. The Pressure from Long-Term Holders One major factor is mechanical selling from long-term holders. These are investors who have held their Bitcoin for over 155 days. When prices reach certain levels, these holders often take profits, creating consistent downward pressure on the market. This selling is a natural part of the cycle but contributes significantly to the current sluggish performance . 2. The Four-Year Halving Cycle Effect Bitcoin’s ecosystem operates on a predictable four-year halving cycle, which cuts the mining reward in half. In the periods leading up to and following a halving, historical selling patterns often emerge. Investors who bought in anticipation of the last event may now be redistributing their assets, further dampening price action and extending the sluggish performance . 3. Investor Sentiment Shifts to AI Broader market sentiment plays a huge role. Currently, excitement and capital are flowing heavily into the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. Some analysts express concern about a potential bubble in AI stocks. This fear, whether valid or not, can pull investment away from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. When big money gets cautious or distracted, it leads to the kind of sluggish performance we’re seeing. 4. The October Liquidation Fallout Markets have a long memory. The largest-ever forced liquidation event, which occurred in October, created a massive shockwave. Such events erode confidence and increase risk aversion among traders and institutions. The aftermath includes: Reduced leverage: Traders are using less borrowed money to speculate. Heightened caution: Everyone is watching for the next domino to fall. Slower capital inflow: New money is hesitant to enter a recently volatile market. This environment naturally suppresses volatility and growth, cementing the sluggish performance . What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? While the current Bitcoin sluggish performance is disappointing for bulls, it’s not necessarily a long-term bear signal. Historically, Bitcoin has weathered similar periods of consolidation. These phases often shake out weak hands and build a stronger foundation for the next rally. The key for investors is to look beyond short-term noise and focus on Bitcoin’s fundamental adoption trajectory. Conclusion: Patience in a Sluggish Market Bitcoin’s year-end sluggish performance is a complex puzzle with clear pieces: profit-taking by veterans, cyclical patterns, competing asset hype, and past market trauma. For the savvy investor, this period represents a moment for research and strategic planning, not panic. Markets are cyclical, and today’s stagnation often sets the stage for tomorrow’s acceleration. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is Bitcoin’s sluggish performance a sign it’s going to crash? A: Not necessarily. This could be a healthy consolidation phase after previous gains. Markets often move in cycles, and periods of low volatility or slight decline are common. Q: Should I sell my Bitcoin because of this sluggish performance? A: Investment decisions should be based on your long-term strategy and risk tolerance, not short-term price action. Many investors view periods of lower prices as accumulation opportunities. Q: How long might this sluggish performance last? A> It’s impossible to predict precisely. It could last weeks or months, depending on broader economic conditions, regulatory news, and shifts in institutional investor sentiment. Q: Does the missing ‘Santa rally’ predict a bad year for crypto? A> Historical year-end performance is not a reliable indicator for the following year. Bitcoin has had strong years after weak Decembers and vice versa. Q: Are the factors causing this slump unique to Bitcoin? A> The specific halving cycle is unique to Bitcoin. However, the themes of profit-taking, shifting sector sentiment, and fallout from liquidations affect the broader cryptocurrency and asset markets. Q: What should I watch to see if the sluggish performance is ending? A> Key indicators include a sustained increase in trading volume, positive net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs (if applicable), and breaking key resistance levels on price charts with conviction.

It was a test tranche of 25kg gold bar, but everything went well and we are scaling this operations up with a plan to trade physical silver, platinum and cotton.Following @DWFLabs vision to play a substantial part of RWA market — Andrei Grachev $FF (@ag_dwf) December 22, 2025 That limited disclosure means outside observers only have the basic facts: a settled physical bar, a claim from DWF Labs, and social posts dated Dec. 22–23, 2025 that flagged the move. Settlement Through Conventional Channels DWF Labs said the transaction used traditional bullion-market plumbing for custody and settlement instead of an on-chain transfer. That suggests the firm relied on existing industry rails — vaults, auditors and established settlement processes — to complete the deal. Based on reports, the choice highlights a cautious approach: test the mechanics of buying and holding metal while keeping the legal and operational pieces in familiar territory. Company Background And Product Plans DWF Labs is known for market making, liquidity services and venture investments across crypto . According to the company’s statements, the gold trade is part of a broader push into real-world assets. The firm has said it plans to expand beyond gold into silver, platinum and cotton. Numbers are sparse in the initial disclosure; the single 25-kilogram bar appears to be a proof point intended to validate logistics rather than signal a fixed trading program. What Comes Next For DWF Labs Based on reports, the company intends to scale its physical-commodity efforts if the test proves workable. Observers will watch for filings, formal partner announcements, or more detailed updates that name vaults, brokers or logistics partners. Any future moves that include multiple bars, varied metals, or a disclosed price would give a clearer picture of how DWF aims to mix crypto capital markets with physical commodity markets.

Analysts Watch This $0.035 Altcoin Closely,https://timestabloid.com/best-cheap-crypto-right-now-analysts-watch-this-0-035-altcoin-closely/,"In DeFi, real growth rarely starts with hype. It usually starts quietly, with systems being built, tested, and refined long before prices react. Lending protocols in particular must solve complex problems early. Liquidity logic, risk controls, pricing models, and user incentives all need to work before adoption can scale. Only after this base is in place does broader attention arrive. That is why many observers are now watching one new crypto closely. Mutuum Finance appears to have crossed that invisible line where infrastructure is no longer theoretical. At this stage, attention often begins to catch up to what has already been built. Why Infrastructure Always Comes Before Price Expansion DeFi lending is not simple. Protocols must manage collateral risk, interest flows, and user behavior at the same time. If any part fails, confidence breaks fast. This is why serious projects spend long periods building quietly. Before price expansion can happen, several things must exist. Borrowing rules must be clear. Liquidation logic must work under stress. Yield must come from real activity, not temporary rewards. Without this foundation, early price spikes often fade. Historically, lending protocols that survive their early stages do so because infrastructure was prioritized over attention. Price tends to react later, once users trust the system and begin using it consistently. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Has Already Put in Place Mutuum Finance is an Ethereum based DeFi crypto focused on lending and borrowing. Its design centers on structure rather than speed. Users can supply assets to earn yield, while borrowers access liquidity by locking collateral. This creates repeat usage instead of one time demand. The protocol uses dual lending markets. In pooled lending, users deposit assets and receive mtTokens. These mtTokens grow in value as interest accrues. They are tied directly to protocol usage, not market noise. Mutuum Finance also supports direct borrowing agreements. Borrowing terms are defined upfront. Loan to value ratios are set to manage risk. If collateral value drops too far, liquidations occur automatically. This protects lenders and keeps the system balanced. At a high level, these systems show that the protocol is designed for real usage. It is built to function even during volatile conditions, which is critical for long term DeFi growth. How Infrastructure Progress Shows Up in Participation Infrastructure progress often appears in data before it shows up in headlines. In the case of Mutuum Finance, participation has grown steadily over time. The project has raised over $19.4M and has attracted more than 18,600 holders. These figures did not spike overnight. They increased gradually, which often signals accumulation rather than speculation. This type of growth usually happens when participants understand the system they are entering. Instead of chasing fast moves, they position early and hold through multiple stages. In DeFi, this behavior often appears before wider market attention. The pace of allocation has also remained consistent. Tokens have continued to move through phases without extreme volatility. This suggests demand is spread across many holders rather than concentrated in a few wallets. Supply Positioning as Infrastructure Meets Demand Mutuum Finance has a fixed total supply of 4B tokens. About 45.5% of this supply, roughly 1.82B tokens, was allocated to early distribution. A large portion of this allocation is already distributed. The token is now priced at $0.035 and has surged about 250% since Phase 1. Each phase introduced a higher price as allocation progressed. This structure limits sudden dilution and helps align supply with growing demand. Importantly, supply tightening usually matters most after infrastructure is ready. Before that point, demand is uncertain. Once systems are in place and usage is close to going live, remaining supply becomes more visible. This is the stage where price behavior often changes. New participants face fewer available tokens at earlier prices, while existing holders are already positioned. Security as the Final Infrastructure Layer For lending protocols, security is not optional. It is the final layer that serious users look for before committing capital. Mutuum Finance completed a CertiK audit with a reported score of 90 out of 100. This provides an external review of the protocol’s code and risk points. In addition, Halborn Security has conducted further analysis. The project also runs a $50k bug bounty program. This encourages ongoing testing from independent researchers. Together, these layers reduce unknown risks and improve confidence. In DeFi, security reviews often mark the transition from build phase to usage phase. Once audits are complete, attention tends to increase. Why Attention Is Catching Up Now Several factors are aligning at the same time. V1 is approaching, which will activate core lending features. This moves Mutuum Finance from preparation into live operation. The 24 hour leaderboard adds another signal. It tracks consistent participation rather than one time activity. This encourages ongoing engagement and highlights active users. Payment access has also expanded, making participation easier for a wider group of users. These details matter because they reduce friction at the moment usage begins. Taken together, these signals suggest infrastructure is no longer the bottleneck. Systems are built, security is reviewed, and participation is already forming. At this point, attention often follows. In the broader market, this is how many successful DeFi projects first became visible. Not through sudden hype, but through steady progress that eventually could not be ignored.

The public launches are expected to continue in 2026. Crypto companies are no longer raising funds through token sales. Instead, in 2025, a new trend emerged, where major entities completed initial public offerings. Some of the companies even had previous token launches, though the assets did not achieve sufficient exposure. One of the reasons for the shift to IPO is the loss of trust in fundraising. The biggest 2018 IPO season created projects with significant treasuries, which never delivered a product. Afterward, public sales, IDO, and other raises also failed to create value. New tokens faced decreased trust and liquidity. The tokens raised by VC-backed projects also suffered from insider selling, inflating the token float through unlocks. An IPO, on the other hand, granted more legitimacy to the project while exposing the company to the much larger stock market liquidity. Which were the biggest IPOs in 2025? The 2025 IPO series reflected the recent trends in the crypto market. CoreWeave was the biggest IPO for the year, reaching a $23B valuation, and a $42B valuation after months of trading. The sale reflected the ability of mining companies to shift to AI infrastructure. The most notable crypto native company to perform an IPO was Circle, raising over $18B at the IPO, and valued over $20B toward the end of 2025. Figure Technology was the third-largest and most successful IPO, raising $5.3B, with a current valuation of $9.7B . Both Circle and Figure tapped into the trend of joining blockchain solutions with traditional finance. Crypto platforms eToro and Gemini were the two major IPO to sink below their offer price. The exchanges reflected the slowdown of retail trading and the shift to other sources of gains, including decentralized activity and fee-generating services. Centralized exchanges to continue IPO trend in 2026 Crypto companies have not abandoned the path to IPO. Overall, the expectations for a strong IPO year in 2026 are setting the pace for crypto companies as well. One of the company categories will be crypto exchanges. The next wave of IPO candidates comes from exchanges that have adapted to new regulations, turning into strong trading hubs. Centralized Exchanges exploring IPO in 2026 As crypto matures, the next wave of #IPO candidates ( #CEX ) is shifting from hype to infrastructure. #CEXs with deep liquidity and regulatory footing are positioning themselves for 2026 listings. pic.twitter.com/wSHFoLgWbd — 🇺🇦 CryptoDiffer – StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 (@CryptoDiffer) December 23, 2025 Crypto exchanges are also extending the reviving European IPO market, which is operating with cautious optimism. The exchanges and crypto companies are seen as a source of rapid gains, in a more legitimate manner compared to token trading. However, an IPO is not an automatic solution for all platforms. After months of speculation, Ripple announced it had no plans for an IPO in the near future. IPOs are seen as a sign of a maturing crypto industry. The sector also learned some harsh lessons in launching a token instead of a stock, as multiple projects were caught in expensive, years-long lawsuits.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-fed-just-opened-xrp-floodgates-heres-what-happened/,"In a market often driven by regulatory signals as much as price charts, a new claim from crypto commentator Ripple Bull Winkle has shifted XRP Army’s attention to developments in the United States banking system. In his latest post, he argues that a quiet move by the Federal Reserve has materially altered the outlook for XRP, suggesting that conditions for broader institutional participation may now be falling into place. According to the commentator, this is not a routine update but a change with immediate implications for how banks can interact with digital assets. He frames the moment as one that could reshape expectations for XRP in the near and medium term, particularly as larger financial players reassess their ability to engage with crypto infrastructure. FED JUST OPENED THE #XRP FLOODGATES!! pic.twitter.com/ssO6QEKc3q — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) December 21, 2025 Withdrawal of 2023 Guidance Highlighted At the center of his commentary is the Federal Reserve’s reported decision to withdraw guidance issued in 2023 that discouraged or limited uninsured banks from engaging with crypto-related activities. Ripple Bull Winkle explains that this guidance had effectively constrained parts of the banking sector from holding digital assets or connecting directly to crypto payment and settlement systems. With that barrier removed, he contends that a wider group of banks can now participate in what he describes as crypto rails, allowing them to custody digital assets and integrate blockchain-based settlement into their operations. In his view, this is a shift away from retail-driven activity toward the potential entry of institutional liquidity, which he sees as more significant for long-term market structure. He emphasizes that such liquidity would not come from individual traders but from the balance sheets of financial institutions that were previously sidelined by regulatory uncertainty. Ripple’s Trust Bank and Institutional Readiness Ripple Bull Winkle further links this regulatory change to Ripple’s recent approval for a National Trust Bank , which he says is positioned to operate within this evolving framework. He presents the approval as timely, arguing that the structure of such a bank aligns with the needs of institutions seeking compliant access to digital asset settlement and custody. In his assessment, as more banks connect to these systems, settlement volumes could rise accordingly. He ties this directly to XRP, noting that increased usage for settlement would interact with a fixed supply, a dynamic he believes could influence market behavior if institutional demand materializes as expected. Supply Dynamics and Market Impact The commentator also outlines how he expects institutions to source liquidity, starting with private over-the-counter markets before turning to public order books. He suggests that this progression could place visible pressure on the available supply if participation grows. While his remarks are forward-looking, Ripple Bull Winkle presents them as a logical outcome of regulatory easing combined with infrastructure readiness. He encourages followers to pay close attention to policy signals, arguing that they often precede shifts in market activity. Overall, his message frames the Federal Reserve’s move, as he describes it, as a foundational change that could open the door for deeper bank involvement in crypto and, by extension, a new phase for XRP within institutional finance .

Price movements are expected to be gradual, resistance is treated as permanent, and prolonged consolidation phases are interpreted as a sign of failure. In crypto, this mindset becomes even more rigid because most participants entered through speculative trading, not through an understanding of financial infrastructure. As a result, imagining a rapid repricing of an asset like XRP feels unrealistic to many , even when historical and structural precedents suggest otherwise. The Trading Lens That Limits Perspective According to Xena XRP, a well-known commentator within the XRP community, the core issue lies in how people frame XRP’s value. Most view it exclusively through a trader’s lens. Candles, patterns, and short-term momentum dominate their thinking. While these tools have their place, they are poorly suited for evaluating an asset designed to support large-scale payment flows, institutional liquidity, and regulatory-compliant settlement. The reason why people can't picture XRP at a high price in a short time is because they see it from a trading perspective. After all, this is all they know and it's hard for the average person to detach from this. Yet some people get it. I watched a new YouTuber, a woman, who… pic.twitter.com/63oYBjZO2B — Xena XRP (@XenaXrp) December 23, 2025 Infrastructure assets rarely move the way retail traders expect. They tend to remain undervalued until adoption, legal clarity, and utility align. When that alignment occurs, repricing is often sharp and compressed, not slow and linear. History across traditional finance supports this pattern. Utility Assets Do Not Behave Like Speculative Tokens XRP was designed to serve as a bridge asset for cross-border payments, thereby reducing friction, costs, and settlement times. This use case places it closer to financial plumbing than speculative narratives. Assets tied to core systems often endure long periods of price frustration before markets reassess their role. The inability to detach from daily price noise prevents many from recognizing this distinction. Xena XRP highlights that constant complaints about price are not signs of awareness but indicators of emotional unreadiness. In professional markets, investors focused on short-term price swings in long-term projects often sell before the real value of the project becomes clear. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Wealth Creation Versus Wealth Sustainability Another critical point raised is the difference between accumulating wealth and sustaining it over time. Financial history shows that sudden wealth often disappears without discipline, education, and emotional control. Crypto accelerates this risk. Rapid gains without preparation frequently lead to poor decisions during both rallies and downturns. Within the XRP ecosystem, long-term holders who quietly accumulate during dips and remain composed during pumps mirror institutional behavior. This patience is not passive. It reflects a deeper understanding of cycles, risk management, and delayed gratification. Why Not Everyone Will Win Markets are selective by nature. Xena XRP does not suggest that all XRP holders will succeed. In fact, she argues the opposite. Many participants will repeat the same mistakes, ignore lessons, and revert to their starting point over time. Social media confidence rarely translates into long-term outcomes. As XRP’s regulatory overhang has largely cleared and institutional interest continues to mature, the market is slowly transitioning from uncertainty to positioning. Whether repricing happens abruptly or in stages, those who understand the asset’s role, rather than obsess over daily fluctuations, are more likely to endure. Ultimately, XRP’s story is as much about mindset as it is about valuation. Success in this opportunity requires being prepared, patient, and humble. How that opportunity is managed will determine who truly benefits when perception finally shifts. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Recent claims circulating among crypto observers suggest the company could be engaging in late-stage discussions for a potential public offering in 2026. These claims come despite clear statements from Ripple’s leadership that the company has no immediate plans to go public. Ripple IPO rumours resurface Crypto researcher SMQKE recently shared findings that point to what he describes as documented indications of Ripple exploring a public listing. Images and excerpts from Presto Research have been cited as evidence that Ripple is being grouped alongside other crypto companies preparing to enter public markets, including Kraken, ConsenSys, and BitGo. SMQKE @SMQKEDQG · Follow ‼️RIPPLE REPORTEDLY IN LATE-STAGE TALKS FOR 2026 IPO‼️Documented.📝👇 6:25 PM · Dec 21, 2025 799 Reply Copy link Read 26 replies The research frames IPOs as a growing trend for mature crypto firms, positioning public listings as a natural progression for businesses seeking broader validation and long-term growth. Supporters of the narrative highlight the performance of companies like Circle, which recently debuted on the NYSE. SMQKE referenced these developments to illustrate that crypto-related public offerings are no longer theoretical, implying that Ripple’s potential move could follow a similar path. The assertion has sparked interest within the crypto community, with some interpreting a possible IPO as a signal of regulatory confidence rather than a market-driven decision. Ripple’s president says “no plan” for an IPO Despite the speculation, Ripple’s President Monica Long has repeatedly stated that the company has “no plan, no timeline” for an IPO. Speaking at the Swell conference in New York in November, Long emphasised that Ripple is well-capitalised and does not require public markets to fund its growth. Earlier remarks from CEO Brad Garlinghouse echoed this sentiment, noting that the company has not needed to raise capital through public listings and that any discussions about an IPO would likely be a long-term consideration rather than an immediate strategy. This cautious approach stands in contrast to other crypto firms that have moved into public markets. Companies like Coinbase, Robinhood, and Circle have experienced mixed results following their listings, with market volatility and regulatory scrutiny affecting their performance. Ripple appears intent on avoiding these pitfalls, shielding itself from the pressures of quarterly earnings expectations and the influence of equity investors unfamiliar with crypto token dynamics. Ripple’s strategic growth without going public Ripple’s decision to remain private also aligns with its ongoing expansion efforts. In recent months, the company raised $500 million at a $40 billion valuation , not out of necessity, but as a means to secure strategic partnerships. Ripple has also pursued a series of acquisitions, including prime broker Hidden Road, stablecoin platform Rail, treasury management software GTreasury, and crypto custody provider Palisade. These moves have been designed to complement its payments focus and expand into new market frontiers, while CEO Garlinghouse indicated that acquisition activity may slow in 2026. Remaining private allows Ripple to manage its significant XRP reserves and maintain flexibility in its governance. Public markets would impose additional scrutiny on token management and could create tension between shareholders and the crypto community, a challenge Ripple currently avoids. Furthermore, regulatory uncertainty remains a concern; although Ripple won its landmark case against the SEC in 2023, broader legislation is still unsettled, and going public would necessitate increased disclosure.

The Polymarket team has officially acknowledged the incident that several users had been reporting over the past week, prompting renewed concerns about account safety. Polymarket users report suspicious login attempts Initial reports of suspicious activity began surfacing earlier in the week, where multiple Polymarket users were seen detailing accounts of their losses across platforms like X and Reddit. According to one user going by the username Sandwich_1337, their account was drained without any major red flags from their end. “Today I woke up and see 3 attempts to login to polymarket. My device isn’t compromised, google found nothing suspicious, all other services are fine,” the user wrote . In the comments, another Reddit user reported a similar experience where they received several login attempt notifications, after which their account balance was emptied. “I am not a crypto bro clicking on airdrop links or connecting my wallet to random sites. I haven’t even logged into Polymarket for two months My email security is locked down. I have 2FA on my email account that requires a physical confirmation on my phone to authorize a new login. It is borderline impossible to access my email without my physical device, which was in my pocket all day,” the user wrote. Meanwhile, some users on social media speculate that the breach may be affecting a subset of users who had signed up for the platform through Magic Labs, a service that allows email-based access and automatically generates non-custodial Ethereum wallets. While Polymarket acknowledged the issue on its official Discord channel, it said the incident was linked to a “third-party authentication provider.” However, it did not provide any additional information other than the fact that the incident only affected a “small number of users.” Further, it did not disclose the extent of the financial damage caused by the incident and noted that the issue had since been resolved, adding that no other risks remain. “We will be in contact with impacted users,” Polymarket added. Details regarding the next steps for affected users were not available at the time of writing. Not the first time This is not the first time Polymarket users have been targeted in security-related incidents. Last year, in August, multiple users reported that their USDC balances had been drained shortly after logging in via their Google accounts. The attackers reportedly exploited a “proxy” function call to siphon funds to a recurring phishing address, targeting those who used the Magic Labs SDK. Polymarket support confirmed at least five such attacks by late September. More recently, in November, a major phishing operation unfolded when hackers exploited Polymarket’s comment section to post phishing links that pushed malicious scripts onto user devices once clicked. Losses, at the time, were estimated to exceed $500,000.

The financing is flowing through special purpose vehicles, known as SPVs, allowing the companies to secure computing power while keeping large debts out of their core financial statements. The deals have pulled in private capital from Pimco, BlackRock, Apollo, Blue Owl Capital, and major US banks, including JPMorgan, according to the Financial Times. The money sits inside SPVs that own land, buildings, and chips, so the tech companies are leasing the assets. Private capital absorbs massive AI data center borrowing Silicon Valley companies once relied on cash and low debt, but that changed as the race for AI computing power intensified and building data centers now requires tens of billions of dollars at a time. Meta set the pace in October with a $30 billion private credit deal for its planned Hyperion data center in Louisiana , putting the project inside an SPV called Beignet Investor, created with Blue Owl Capital. The investment vehicle raised about $27 billion in loans from Pimco, BlackRock, Apollo, and other investors, alongside $3 billion in equity from Blue Owl. None of the debt appeared on Meta’s balance sheet, and that allowed the company raise another $30 billion in corporate bonds in November. Meanwhile, Oracle leases compute to OpenAI, so it has partnered with builders and financiers such as Crusoe, Vantage, Related Digital, and Blue Owl to develop multiple data centers, each owned by separate SPVs. One vehicle backing the Abilene, Texas facility received about $13 billion from Blue Owl and JPMorgan, including $10 billion in debt. Other arrangements include a $38 billion debt package for sites in Texas and Wisconsin and an $18 billion loan for a New Mexico location. In every case, Oracle leases the facilities while lenders hold claims on the assets. Risk spreads across Wall Street as SPVs multiply Investors often believe the real risk is still with the tech company leasing the site, as exemplified by Meta’s Beignet Investor deal. Meta owns 20% of the SPV and provided a residual value guarantee, meaning it would repay investors if the data center value drops below a set level at lease end and Meta does not renew. Elon Musk’s xAI is pursuing a similar approach. The startup is raising $20 billion, including as much as $12.5 billion in debt. An SPV will use the funds to buy Nvidia graphics processing units and lease them back to xAI. CoreWeave has followed the same path. In March, the company created an SPV to meet an $11.9 billion contract to supply computing power to OpenAI. In July, it borrowed $2.6 billion to finance those obligations. Private capital interest remains strong. UBS said tech companies had borrowed about $450 billion from private funds by early 2025, up $100 billion from the prior year. Around $125 billion flowed into project finance deals this year alone. Data center construction now depends heavily on the $1.7 trillion private credit market, where concerns around valuation, illiquidity, and borrower concentration are growing. But the risk is getting bigger as more companies adopt the same structures, because OpenAI alone has committed more than $1.4 trillion in long-term computing contracts across the industry. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have avoided SPVs so far, funding data centers with cash and traditional bonds.

In a detailed social media post, CrediBULL Crypto argued that with BTC near $90,000, its potential return no longer justifies the risk compared to fundamentally sound alternatives trading at deep discounts. Bitcoin Still Leads, But Alts Offer Better Upside CrediBULL opened the analysis by stressing their history of bullish Bitcoin calls from as low as $3,000 in 2017 through $15,000 and $30,000 in later cycles. However, with the OG cryptocurrency now hovering near $90,000, the analyst argued that the math has changed for investors planning to take profits before the cycle ends. They contended that while Bitcoin typically leads the market out of a bear phase, the most explosive altcoin rallies historically occur later in the cycle, often after Bitcoin has peaked. With the number one cryptocurrency now 30 times higher than its last cycle low, CrediBULL believes the “risk vs. reward” profile for new Bitcoin investments has diminished significantly. “After finally cracking 100k+, and despite my belief that we still have higher to go for Bitcoin in this cycle, the reality is that R/R and expected ROI from current levels does not favor buying $BTC over alts at these levels,” they wrote on X. The analyst used XRP as a primary example, highlighting that the Ripple token underperformed Bitcoin for over 460 days before exploding with a 7x gain in just 23 days in mid-2025. This move, CrediBULL argued, erased all prior underperformance and resulted in greater returns for XRP holders than for those who bought BTC above $25,000 during that same window. The lesson, according to the post, is that high-quality altcoins can lie dormant for extended periods before making their major moves in a fraction of the time, rewarding patient accumulation. “The real opportunity at this point in time is in high quality, fundamentally sound, and structurally solid alts,” CrediBULL summed up. Market Context: Bitcoin Stuck Near $90K as Pressure Builds Bitcoin’s price action helps explain why this argument is gaining traction. At the time of writing, it was trading around $87,000, down about 1% in the last 24 hours and roughly 6% over the past two weeks, after repeated failures to hold above $90,000. Major altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH), followed Bitcoin lower in a widespread pullback, with data showing the recent pullbacks came with about $250 million in liquidations, most of them tied to long positions. Options markets are also shaping near-term behavior. On-chain technician Wise Crypto said on X that Bitcoin has been confined between $85,000 and $90,000 by a large options structure, with hedging activity keeping volatility muted until a major expiry later this week. Meanwhile, XRP was trading near $1.85, down close to 50% from its July peak of $3.65 and weaker across weekly and monthly timeframes. While sentiment around the token has turned negative, analysts have noted that similar pessimism in the past has often preceded sharp rebounds. Taken together, Bitcoin’s stalled momentum and growing focus on relative value are keeping the rotation narrative alive, even as traders wait for clearer direction into year-end.

ETH fell roughly 1% to $2,920 over the past day, extending its consolidation below the psychological $3,000 level. The move aligns with subdued market activity as investors await the U.S. jobless claims report, scheduled for December 24, which may shape expectations around interest rate policy and liquidity conditions. While traders study resistance and support zones to anticipate the next move, Outset PR monitors performance metrics of media outlets to align campaigns with market momentum. By tracking these shifts, this crypto PR agency ensures that its stories fit the moment. ETH slips below short-term support amid macro uncertainty Source: coinmarketcap Ethereum has broken below its 30-day simple moving average (SMA) at $3,030, weakening its short-term technical structure. The inability to hold this level suggests bears remain in control, as risk appetite across crypto markets stays muted. On the upside, ETH faces resistance near the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,264, a zone that has capped recent recovery attempts. Until price regains this area, upside momentum remains constrained. Mixed momentum reflects market indecision Technical indicators point to hesitation. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering near 44, signaling neutral momentum and a lack of extreme positioning on either side of the market. This suggests selling pressure exists but has not reached capitulation levels. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram has turned modestly positive at +1.35, hinting at a tentative bullish divergence. While not a confirmation of reversal, it indicates that downside momentum may be slowing as ETH consolidates. How Outset PR shapes market positioning through macro-driven narratives Periods of compressed price action ahead of major economic releases often lead to shifts not only in price direction, but also in how market narratives form. Data-driven signals such as macroeconomic factors and technical signals guide both trading decisions and media focus. Beyond tracking these technical and macro indicators, Outset PR watches media trendlines through the lens of its Outset Data Pulse intelligence to identify moments when market developments carry the highest informational value. By aligning coverage timing with macro events and measurable market signals, data-led communication strategies aim to reflect actual market conditions rather than speculative sentiment. This approach mirrors a broader shift in crypto markets, where relevance and timing have become as important as price levels themselves. What comes next for Ethereum In the short term, ETH traders will watch whether price can stabilize above the $2,900–$2,950 range. A breakdown below this zone could expose Ethereum to deeper retracements, while a recovery above $3,030 would mark the first step toward rebuilding short-term strength. With macro uncertainty still in play, direction is likely to remain constrained until fresh data provides clarity. Until then, Ethereum appears locked near $3,000 — balancing cautious positioning with early signs that downside momentum may be easing.

For over a week now, the author of ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ has not mentioned the leading cryptocurrency on his X (formerly Twitter) account. This silence follows his November 15th declaration that he would buy more Bitcoin if its price fell. What does this unexpected pause mean, and why has his attention shifted to warnings about AI stocks and market hype? Let’s unpack the situation. What Sparked Robert Kiyosaki’s Bitcoin Silence? Robert Kiyosaki built a reputation for advocating hard assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin as hedges against economic instability. His recent silence is particularly striking because it comes directly after a specific promise. On November 15, he publicly stated his intention to purchase more BTC during price dips. However, his social media feed tells a different story for the past seven days. Instead of crypto commentary, his posts have focused on other financial warnings. He reminded followers of Warren Buffett’s caution regarding a potential bubble in AI-related stocks. Furthermore, he suggested the U.S. stock market might be running on hype rather than solid fundamentals. This pivot raises immediate questions about his current stance on digital assets. The Controversial Sale That Preceded the Quiet To understand the full context of Robert Kiyosaki’s Bitcoin silence, we must look at the week before it began. His vow to buy the dip on November 15 was followed by a significant action on November 22. Reports indicate he sold approximately $2.25 million worth of Bitcoin at an average price of $90,000. This move attracted criticism from some followers who saw a contradiction between his words and actions. The sale and subsequent social media shift create a narrative worth examining. Key points from this period include: Public Buying Intent: Clear statement to increase Bitcoin holdings during declines. Substantial Asset Sale: Executing a multi-million dollar sale shortly after. Abrupt Topic Change: Moving focus to AI stock bubbles and market hype. This sequence naturally leads investors to wonder about his true conviction and strategy. Analyzing the Shift: From Bitcoin to Broader Market Warnings Robert Kiyosaki’s recent content highlights a classic investment concern: market euphoria. By citing Warren Buffett’s AI bubble warning, he taps into a timeless fear of overvalued sectors. His suggestion that the stock market is driven by hype aligns with his long-held skepticism of traditional financial systems. However, this focus marks a distinct departure from his recent Bitcoin advocacy. It presents a potential interpretation: his silence on Bitcoin might not indicate abandonment but rather a tactical pause. He could be waiting for clearer signals or a more advantageous entry point, all while cautioning followers about risks elsewhere. This behavior underscores a critical lesson for all investors: prominent figures can and do change their public emphasis based on evolving market views. What Can Investors Learn from This Episode? The situation with Robert Kiyosaki and Bitcoin serves as a practical case study in navigating financial commentary. First, it reinforces the importance of distinguishing between public statements and personal portfolio actions. Second, it highlights that even strong advocates diversify their attention and concerns. For the crypto community, a single voice going quiet is not a fundamental indicator. The health of Bitcoin relies on broader adoption, technological development, and macroeconomic factors. Actionable insights from this event include: Conduct your own research rather than following any single influencer blindly. Understand that market commentators often have complex, evolving strategies. Use periods of silence or shifted focus as opportunities to reassess your own thesis. Conclusion: Decoding the Silence in a Noisy Market Robert Kiyosaki’s week without mentioning Bitcoin is a intriguing footnote in the ongoing narrative of crypto adoption. It reminds us that public figures balance multiple investment themes and risk assessments. His shift to warning about AI and market hype does not necessarily negate his belief in Bitcoin; it may simply reflect a broader risk-off sentiment. For savvy investors, the key takeaway is to maintain a disciplined, independent strategy. The market’s noise—whether it’s loud promises or sudden quiet—should inform but not dictate your financial decisions. Ultimately, the story of Robert Kiyosaki and Bitcoin this month is a lesson in watching actions, interpreting silence, and staying focused on long-term fundamentals.

The current technical analysis indicates that sellers remain dominant in the market, keeping Solana below $120 even while attempting to bounce back. At the same time, investors searching for the best cryptocurrency to invest are turning their backs on stagnant recoveries in favor of investment in projects at the infancy stage. In this regard, Mutuum Finance deserves mention as it has reached Presale Phase 6 with nearly all slots filled at 99%. As time goes by, in circulation, it has become the hot crypto as the investment to buy first. Solana Faces Increasing Pressure Through Year-End Current Solana price activity is bearish. After numerous failed attempts at breaking out above the low-to-mid-$120s, SOL is once again in an area where sell pressure is prevalent. Momentum aspects agree that the trend is slowing. Looking at shorter charts, purchase momentum is losing strength, and rallies lack conviction. The Relative Strength Index is below the center. For longer-term timeframes, the outlook remains prudent. Solana is still locked inside a channel of lower highs and lower lows. Selling pressure is substantial, and trend analysis shows that bears are in control of the ship. The Fibonacci levels suggest that support lies around $116, while firmer levels of resistance lie far higher. Until such a time when volume makes a substantial shift, it is expected that SOL will remain below $120. There are mixed feelings and caution among analysts. While some of them see further corrections as levels of interest to buy, others think that if current levels are not supported, it may lead the prices lower. Therefore, some holders are tempted to explore crypto selections beyond the market leaders and focus on a new crypto offering attractive entry levels and tremendous growth potential. Mutuum Finance Skyrockets in Presale Solana’s pace is slowing down, but Mutuum Finance is growing in popularity. Presale Phase 6 is almost full at 99%, which means that the window to acquire at this price is closing fast. Since the presale started, approximately $19.5 million has been raised, and the number of holders of the MUTM token has increased to 18,560. Current Phase 6 pricing is at $0.035, which is an increase of 250% from Phase 1’s pricing of $0.01. Phase 6 is selling out quickly, and the opportunity to buy the tokens at this price is passing by rapidly. Once Phase 7 is opened, the price is bound to increase by approximately 20% to $0.04. Launching at a price of $0.06, investors can expect an increase of approximately 410% at the time of trading. It is this scenario of price increase that makes many speculators consider Mutuum as the best crypto to invest in at the time. Mutuum is doing everything right to gain trust. They have already begun an independent audit, where a security review of the lending and borrowing Smart Contracts is being performed by Halborn Security. This is improving investment confidence in their underlying infrastructure. Mutuum has also laid out its plans for development. Through an official update, the team revealed that the launch of the V1 protocol will be completed on the Sepolia testnet during Q4 of 2025 . With this development, users will enjoy core functionality such as the Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token, and even the Liquidator Bot. Currently, just ETH and USDT will be supported, which will allow for live testing to take place. All in all, such plans ensure that Mutuum is among the next big cryptos that have actual utility. With Solana under pressure and Mutuum Finance’s Phase 6 almost sold out, it all boils down to timing. When this phase disappears, those who miss it will be missing out on the best crypto to invest in.

The current trend suggests that investors are leaning more toward selling as the altcoin’s price is now almost 92% below its 2021 all-time high. Even as the year draws to a close, the prognosis for the meme coin has not changed, with a machine learning algorithm predicting that the SHIB price will continue to fall. Expect The Shiba Inu Downtrend Into The New Year Shiba Inu is already down by more than 14% this month, and it looks like the decline is far from over. The algorithm at the CoinCodex website has predicted that the meme coin will see further decline into the end of the year, amplifying the already brutal losses . The 5-day prediction puts the Shiba Inu price somewhere around $0.000007038, pushing its monthly losses toward 20%. This comes as the sentiment around the Shiba Inu altcoin hovers in Extreme Fear, meaning investors are still scared to put money into the digital asset. In addition to the downtrend, volatility is also expected to spike during this time. The website rates it at 5.62%, which is a high percentage, putting investors in Shiba Inu at a higher risk of losing their money. Thus, it might be better to wait for the downtrend to play out before getting into the cryptocurrency. Over the medium to longer term, though, the expectations begin to lean toward the bullish end . The 1-month prediction expects a 15.89% surge to push the price above $0.000008. Then, the 3-month prediction also expects that Shiba Inu will continue to trend above $0.000008. Why SHIB Decline Could Continue In January While January has usually been a bullish month for the likes of Bitcoin, Shiba Inu has usually gone in a much different direction . In the last four years, the meme coin has only closed the month of January in the green one time. This also coincides with its performance from December, usually ending in the red and carrying over into the new year. If this trend holds, then it is likely that the Shiba Inu price will see another double-digit decline in January 2026. Usually, it is by the month of February that the SHIB price begins to pick up, making it one of its most bullish months since the meme coin first launched back in 2020, as shown by data from CryptoRank.",Shiba Inu|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-24 11:30:01

This is the stark reality facing many blockchain startups today. Recent data reveals an alarming trend: once highly valued blockchain startups are seeing their market caps plunge dramatically. A liquidity crunch has exposed the fragile gap between venture capital hype and real-world market performance, leaving investors and founders grappling with a harsh new reality. What Caused the Blockchain Startups Market Cap Collapse? The numbers tell a sobering story. According to data from CryptoRank reported by Cointelegraph, several blockchain startups valued at over $1 billion by venture capital firms have experienced severe market cap declines. This isn’t just a minor correction; it’s a fundamental reassessment of value in a tightening market. The liquidity crunch has acted like a pressure test, revealing which projects have sustainable models versus those built on speculative hype. For example, Humanity Protocol (H) received a $1 billion valuation from venture capitalists. However, its current market cap sits at just $285 million. That represents a staggering 71.5% drop from its VC valuation. Similarly, Fuel Network (FUEL) was valued at nearly $1 billion but now trades with a market cap of only around $11 million. Even projects with smaller initial gaps haven’t been spared. Which Startups Suffered the Worst Market Cap Drops? Let’s examine specific cases to understand the severity of this trend. The disparity between venture capital valuations and actual market performance reveals much about current market conditions. Humanity Protocol (H) : VC valuation $1 billion → Current market cap $285 million Fuel Network (FUEL) : VC valuation ~$1 billion → Current market cap ~$11 million Plasma (XPL) : VC valuation $500 million → Current market cap $220 million These examples demonstrate that no project is immune. The liquidity crunch has affected blockchain startups across different sectors and with varying initial valuation gaps. The common thread is the dramatic compression between private funding rounds and public market performance. Is Venture Capital Still Investing in Blockchain Startups? The report adds crucial context about the broader investment landscape. Venture capital investment in the cryptocurrency sector has been sluggish throughout the second half of the year. While a few large deals have propped up total capital raised numbers, overall investment activity remains low. This creates a challenging environment for blockchain startups seeking funding. The combination of declining market caps and reduced venture capital interest creates a perfect storm. Startups must now demonstrate real utility and sustainable business models rather than relying on hype and speculation to attract investment. What Does This Mean for Future Blockchain Startup Valuations? The current situation suggests several important shifts in how we value blockchain projects. First, there’s likely to be increased scrutiny of venture capital valuations versus actual market performance. Second, liquidity will become a more important factor in investment decisions. Finally, projects with clear utility and revenue models may fare better than those built primarily on technological promises. This market correction, while painful for some, could ultimately strengthen the blockchain ecosystem. It separates serious projects from speculative ventures and encourages more sustainable growth strategies. The focus may shift from pure technological innovation to practical applications and user adoption. How Can Investors Navigate This Changing Landscape? For investors watching blockchain startups market cap fluctuations, several strategies emerge. First, pay closer attention to the gap between private valuations and public market performance. Second, consider liquidity as a key metric when evaluating investments. Third, look for projects with demonstrated user adoption and revenue generation rather than just technological promises. The current liquidity crunch serves as a reminder that all investments carry risk, especially in emerging sectors like blockchain. However, it also creates opportunities to identify fundamentally strong projects that may be undervalued in the current market sentiment. In conclusion, the alarming plunge in blockchain startups market cap reveals important truths about our current market environment. The liquidity crunch has exposed valuation gaps and prompted a necessary market correction. While challenging in the short term, this period of reassessment could lead to a healthier, more sustainable blockchain ecosystem. The projects that survive this pressure test will likely emerge stronger and better positioned for long-term success. Frequently Asked Questions What is causing the market cap plunge for blockchain startups? A liquidity crunch in the broader cryptocurrency market is exposing the gap between venture capital valuations and actual market performance. Reduced investment activity and changing market sentiment are contributing factors. How severe are the market cap declines? Some blockchain startups have seen declines of over 70% from their venture capital valuations. For example, Fuel Network dropped from nearly $1 billion valuation to approximately $11 million market cap. Is venture capital still investing in blockchain startups? While a few large deals continue, overall venture capital investment in the cryptocurrency sector has been sluggish in the second half of the year, with reduced activity across the board. Will this affect all blockchain startups equally? No, projects with stronger fundamentals, clearer utility, and sustainable business models are likely to weather this period better than those built primarily on hype and speculation. What should investors look for during this period? Investors should pay closer attention to the gap between private valuations and public market performance, consider liquidity as a key metric, and focus on projects with demonstrated user adoption. Is this market correction ultimately positive for the blockchain ecosystem? While painful in the short term, this correction could strengthen the ecosystem by separating serious projects from speculative ventures and encouraging more sustainable growth strategies.

(NYSE: CANG) (“Cango” or the “Company”) with a buy rating and US$4.00 target price, noting that Cango appears to be “mispriced and overlooked by the market given its market leading Bitcoin mining status and asset-light model for entry into the high-performance computing (HPC) market.” According to the Greenridge Capital report, Cango is trading below the value of its assets, which include liquid holdings in cash and over US$600 million in BTC held under a strict HODL strategy, a 50 EH/s globally distributed mining portfolio, and a 50MW data center in the U.S. state of Georgia (acquired in Q3 of 2025). The report also points out ongoing cost reduction measures, suggesting operational discipline, and Cango’s ability to capitalize on future opportunities with its strong financial position. Looking ahead, Cango’s strategy to diversify revenue and enhance profitability focuses on securing control over its own power supply, a key strategic step for future AI data center or Bitcoin mining operations. The report highlights Cango’s “Energy + HPC” plan, which targets expansion into flexible energy and data infrastructure projects with higher margin opportunities and cash generation potential. Supporting this expansion are two pilot projects already underway: a pilot solar generation and storage project in Oman and a 150MW power generation facility in Indonesia, which it is developing with a partner and could potentially be expanded to 300MW in future. Further updates from management are expected in coming months. Greenridge Capital’s US$4.00 price target is based on a blended valuation approach using two methodologies: (1) an EV/Adjusted EBITDA multiple of 7x applied to a 2026 adjusted EBITDA estimate of US$335.4 million, and (2) a P/E multiple of 15x applied to a 2026 diluted EPS estimate of US$0.34. Both multiples are conservative relative to industry peers. Notably, this valuation does not yet assign value to Cango’s developing energy infrastructure projects, which could unlock substantial value in the future as project milestones are achieved. About Cango Inc. Cango Inc. (NYSE: CANG) is primarily engaged in the Bitcoin mining business, with operations strategically deployed across North America, the Middle East, South America, and East Africa. The Company entered the crypto asset space in November 2024, driven by advancements in blockchain technology, the growing adoption of digital assets, and its commitment to diversifying its business portfolio.

In a recent post on X, Aljarrah framed XRP not as a speculative instrument to be judged solely by daily price action, but as a technology whose long-term worth lies in what it enables within global payment infrastructure. His remarks challenged readers to reconsider how value in the digital asset space should be measured and why patience remains central to the view. People obsess over price, but XRP’s value is in its utility. A higher price strengthens liquidity, efficiency, and adoption. Let the tech and leadership do the work, short-term noise doesn’t matter. — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) December 21, 2025 Utility as the Core of Value Aljarrah argued that XRP’s importance is rooted in its role as a tool for liquidity and efficiency rather than in its immediate market valuation. He suggested that while a higher price can support stronger liquidity conditions and make large-scale transactions more effective, the price itself is not the primary driver of relevance. Instead, he pointed to the underlying technology and the direction set by leadership in the ecosystem as the factors that ultimately shape adoption. According to his perspective, as utility expands, improved liquidity follows, reinforcing XRP’s ability to function in real-world financial use cases. In this framework, short-term volatility becomes secondary, described as background noise when compared to the broader objective of building infrastructure that institutions and payment providers can rely on. The message was clear: sustainable growth comes from execution and real integration, not from reacting to every market trend. Community Responses and Ongoing Debate The post drew reactions from other users who engaged with the ideas while offering their own interpretations. One commenter acknowledged the strength of the technology behind XRP but cautioned that liquidity does not emerge automatically. From that perspective, price still plays a key role in how liquidity can be accessed and how attractive the asset becomes to market participants. The response reflected a more balanced stance, accepting the utility argument while emphasizing that market dynamics cannot be ignored. Another user took a more optimistic position, describing XRP as offering one of the strongest value propositions in the digital asset sector due to its overall utility. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 That commenter expressed confidence that time would ultimately determine whether this belief holds and indicated a personal commitment to that outlook, even if regulatory clarity takes longer to arrive. The sentiment underscored a willingness among some supporters to wait for legal and policy developments while maintaining conviction in the asset’s long-term role. Together, these reactions highlighted how Aljarrah’s framing resonates with a segment of the community that prioritizes infrastructure and use cases, while also inviting scrutiny from those who see price and liquidity as inseparable elements. What remains central in his message is a call for perspective: that XRP’s trajectory should be judged by the progress of its technology and adoption rather than by short-term movements on a chart.

With about a week left on the calendar, the numbers are already locked in. The $13 trillion ETF industry smashed records across flows, product launches, and trading activity. Inflows alone hit $1.4 trillion, beating last year’s all-time high. New funds crossed 1,000 launches. Trading volume also set a fresh peak. This run did not come quietly. The ETF world moved higher as US stocks kept grinding up. The S&P 500 logged a third straight year of double-digit gains. That happened even as the index chopped sideways from October. Markets dealt with doubts around massive AI spending plans and open questions on when the Federal Reserve cuts rates. Still, demand stayed strong, and ETF trading volume kept climbing into year-end. Stock gains and product launches drive historic growth US-listed funds pulled in cash at a speed that surprised even long-time watchers. ETF inflows broke last year’s record before December even ended. More than 1,000 products hit the market in a single year. That has never happened before. Bloomberg data shows the last time flows, launches, and volume all peaked together was 2021. The S&P 500 helped push the surge. The index gained for a third year in a row, even after slowing in recent months. Since October, the benchmark moved in a tight range. Investors stayed cautious as questions grew around AI spending by large tech firms and the future path of interest rates. Despite that, money kept moving into new and existing funds. History still hangs over the market. After the strong run in 2021, risk assets fell hard the next year. The S&P 500 dropped 19% in 2022. Government bonds did not protect investors as the Federal Reserve raised rates fast. During that stretch, trading volume stayed high, but flows and launches cooled as volatility hit portfolios. Some expect a repeat of that pattern. Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Eric Balchunas said, “We think there’s going to be some reality check next year. Because of how perfect the year seemed to be for ETFs, you kind of want to brace for it.” Crypto funds see outflows as markets eye year-end rally Cracks already showed up in crypto-linked products late in December. On December 23 ET, Bitcoin spot ETFs posted a net outflow of $189 million. That marked the fourth straight day of redemptions. BlackRock’s IBIT led the move, logging a single-day outflow of $157 million. Ethereum spot ETFs also slipped, with $95.52 million leaving the group. All nine products reported zero inflows that day. Even with those outflows, investors stayed focused on the final trading days of the year. Many watched for the Santa Claus rally, which runs from the last five trading sessions of December through the first two sessions of January. That window spans from December 24 to January 5 this year. LPL Financial data shows the S&P 500 averages a 1.3% gain during that stretch. Positive results happen 78% of the time. Outside that period, the index averages a 0.3% return over seven days, with gains showing up 58% of the time. Markets ended Tuesday on a firm note. The S&P 500 closed up about 0.5% at 6,909.79, setting a new record close. Futures later traded near flat. Dow futures slipped 25 points, or 0.05%. S&P 500 futures dipped 0.05%, while Nasdaq 100 futures stayed little changed. Tech stocks led the session, with Alphabet, Nvidia, Broadcom, and Amazon pushing indexes higher for a fourth straight day.

On December 24, on-chain data on Arkham analysed by Outset PR shows a whale address increased its holdings to more than 224,000 SOL, worth approximately $27 million, with purchases executed around the $121 price level. Another day of whale watching 🐋👀On Dec 24, a large holder accumulated 224K $SOL (~$27M) near $121 as price broke below $124 support. $SOL trades under key MAs, RSI sits near 37 (oversold), and MACD shows slowing downside momentum.Whale conviction meets potential rebound. pic.twitter.com/cKhFVn0Z6j — Outset PR (@OutsetPR) December 24, 2025 The accumulation comes as SOL trades below key technical support and remains under all major moving averages. SOL breaks key support as price trades below major averages SOL recently fell below the $124 support zone, a level that previously acted as short-term price support. Following the breakdown, the token is now trading beneath both its 30-day simple moving average (SMA) at $132.72 and its 200-day SMA at $174.5, reflecting a broader bearish structure. Trading below long-term and short-term averages typically indicates sustained downside pressure, especially when combined with declining momentum. However, such conditions can also precede relief rallies when selling becomes exhausted. Momentum remains weak, but downside pressure is slowing Momentum indicators continue to show weakness, though signs of stabilization are emerging. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) remains in negative territory, with the MACD line at -4.69 slightly above the signal line at -4.88. While this still reflects bearish momentum, the narrowing gap suggests that downward pressure may be losing strength rather than accelerating. More notably, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering near 37, approaching the oversold threshold. Historically, RSI readings in this range often coincide with reduced selling intensity and can precede short-term rebounds, particularly when accompanied by large spot accumulation. Whale accumulation and the role of Outset PR’s data-driven approach Large-scale accumulation during periods of technical weakness is often interpreted as a sign of conviction at current price levels. Beyond its on-chain implications, such activity also plays a role in shaping how market narratives form across crypto media. According to industry observers, data-driven communication strategies increasingly focus on aligning coverage with verifiable market signals rather than speculative price predictions. Firms such as Outset PR , founded by PR strategist Mike Ermolaev, track both on-chain activity and media trendlines to determine when specific developments are most likely to resonate with audiences. By analyzing traffic distribution and publication timing through internal analytics systems, including tools designed to map syndication across aggregators like CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, data-led PR approaches aim to connect market events with measurable visibility. This methodology reflects a broader shift in crypto communications toward relevance and timing, rather than volume-based exposure. What to watch next For a sustained bullish reversal, SOL would need to reclaim the $124–$130 range and establish acceptance above short-term moving averages. Failure to do so could keep price action range-bound or expose the token to further downside. In the near term, traders will likely monitor whether RSI enters oversold territory and whether volume confirms any bounce attempt. Whale accumulation provides a supportive signal, but confirmation from price structure remains critical. As SOL continues to consolidate below resistance, the market faces a familiar question: whether current weakness marks continuation — or the early stage of a broader recovery.

Avian Labs, the innovative force behind the cryptocurrency payment service Sling Money, has successfully obtained a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This pivotal approval marks a major step in the company’s strategic expansion, following its recent license acquisition in the Netherlands. For users and businesses alike, this development signals a more accessible and regulated future for using digital currencies in everyday transactions. What Does This UK License Mean for Sling Money? The FCA’s authorization is not merely a formality; it’s a rigorous seal of approval. Obtaining a UK license allows Avian Labs to legally operate its cryptocurrency payment service for British customers. This includes facilitating crypto transfers, exchanges, and potentially broader payment solutions under the watchful eye of one of the world’s most respected financial regulators. The license demonstrates Avian Labs’ commitment to compliance, security, and building trust within a framework that protects consumers. This achievement is part of a clear pattern. Securing the UK license shortly after gaining Dutch regulatory approval shows a deliberate strategy to establish a compliant footprint across key European markets. Therefore, users can expect more seamless cross-border payment experiences powered by cryptocurrency. Why is Regulatory Compliance a Game-Changer for Crypto? For years, the crypto industry operated in a regulatory gray area, which deterred mainstream adoption. Services obtaining licenses like this one from the UK FCA help bridge that gap. Here’s how compliance benefits everyone: Enhanced User Trust: Operating under a recognized regulator means the service must adhere to strict anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) standards. Mainstream Accessibility: Regulatory clarity encourages more businesses and individuals to use crypto for payments without fear of legal ambiguity. Financial System Integration: Licensed services act as a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset ecosystem. Moreover, this move by Avian Labs places Sling Money alongside a growing cohort of fintech companies proving that innovation and regulation can coexist. It answers a critical question for the industry: can crypto businesses scale responsibly? The answer, increasingly, is yes. How Will Sling Money’s Expansion Impact European Crypto Users? With licenses now in both the UK and the Netherlands, Avian Labs is poised to significantly expand its cryptocurrency payment service reach. This expansion isn’t just about geography; it’s about scope and utility. Users in these regions may soon experience: Faster and cheaper cross-border transactions between the UK and EU. More merchant adoption, as businesses gain confidence in using a regulated payment rail. Potential new product features tailored to comply with and leverage European financial regulations. The broader implication is a more interconnected European market for digital assets. As compliant services like Sling Money grow, they create a network effect, making cryptocurrency a more practical tool for commerce and remittances across the continent. What Challenges Remain for Crypto Payment Services? Despite this progress, the path forward is not without hurdles. Regulatory frameworks differ across European nations, creating a complex patchwork for companies to navigate. Additionally, achieving widespread merchant adoption requires demonstrating clear advantages over existing payment systems in terms of cost, speed, and ease of use. However, each new license granted acts as a precedent, smoothing the way for other services and contributing to a more standardized regulatory environment. The success of early adopters like Avian Labs provides a blueprint for the entire sector. Conclusion: A Step Toward a Regulated Crypto Future Avian Labs securing a UK FCA license for its Sling Money platform is more than a corporate milestone. It is a tangible sign of the cryptocurrency market’s maturation. This development strengthens the infrastructure for legitimate cryptocurrency payment service options, moving digital assets closer to becoming a normalized part of the global financial toolkit. For investors, users, and observers, it underscores a powerful trend: the future of finance is being built on a foundation of both innovation and compliance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is Sling Money? A1: Sling Money is a cryptocurrency payment service operated by Avian Labs. It allows users to send, receive, and potentially pay with digital currencies. Q2: Why is the UK FCA license so important? A2: The FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) is a top-tier UK financial regulator. Its license permits Avian Labs to offer its services legally in the UK, ensuring they meet high standards for security, anti-money laundering, and consumer protection. Q3: Can I use Sling Money in the United States? A3: Based on the current announcement, the new licenses are for the UK and the Netherlands. Availability in the US would require separate regulatory approval from bodies like state regulators or the SEC. Q4: How does this benefit an average crypto user? A4: It leads to more trusted, secure, and widely available options for using cryptocurrency for real-world payments and transfers, especially within Europe. Q5: Does this mean cryptocurrency is now fully regulated? A5: Not fully, but it’s a major step. Regulation is evolving country by country. Licenses like this one show specific services are becoming regulated, which helps legitimize the overall ecosystem. Q6: What other regions might Sling Money expand to next? A6: While not confirmed, the company’s European focus suggests other EU nations with clear crypto regulations, such as Germany or France, could be logical next targets for expansion.

Over the years, Strategy issued large amounts of convertible debt and other loans to stack more BTC. Strategy performed well during bull markets; however, it makes people nervous during price drops. Crypto investors worry that the company could face pressure from debt obligations, higher interest costs, or refinancing risks. Data shows that since Bitcoin’s all-time high in July, Strategy (MSTR) stock has plummeted approximately 65% from $456 to $158 per share. Saylor’s BTC publicity puts Strategy in trouble Over time, Strategy’s identity has become more and more tied to Bitcoin itself. Under Michael Saylor, the company has evolved into a more Bitcoin-centric entity, rather than a traditional software business. Traders are concerned about whether the core software revenue is strong enough to support the company if Bitcoin enters a long bear market. When Bitcoin’s price swings more, investors on X and Reddit often speculate about the worst-case situations, such as having to sell Bitcoin or having shareholders lose money, even though these things don’t always happen. The company also appears to be having cold feet. As reported by Cryptopolitan, this week Strategy achieved a weekly raise, but this time dedicated the funds to its USD reserve instead of Bitcoin. Strategy added 748M to its reserve, bringing the total to $2.19B. The decision to stop buying BTC and raise the USD reserve was aimed to ease refinancing and dividend stress in the short term. It also to directly address worries about forced Bitcoin sales. Odds of Strategy becoming the worst-performing company on the Nasdaq 100. Source: Polymarket The looming MSCI index decision has added to the anxiety. Recently, Polymarket showed that 61% of traders believed that Strategy would be delisted by March 31 from the MSCI index. The company is also ranked second as the worst performer among the Nasdaq 100. Saylor claims that Bitcoin is a living network that can adapt when needed. If quantum computing ever becomes powerful enough to threaten current security methods, Bitcoin developers and users would respond by upgrading the network. There is also a growing distrust of powerful figures in crypto and finance, particularly during this two-and-a-half-month downturn. Saylor’s influence is also decreasing. Some people worry that Saylor’s influence encourages others to take risks they don’t fully understand. Bitcoin investors increase long positions Bitcoin is still stable today, with a small drop of almost 1% after a time of tumultuous trading. The dip comes after $952 million was taken out of crypto funds by institutions. This includes $460 million from Bitcoin alone, which is due to worries about regulatory delays and the possibility of whales selling more. At the start of the week, Bitcoin ETFs saw $142 million in outflows. The Bitcoin ETF market cap, on the other hand, is still strong at $114.99 billion. Then, the $111 million surge in Solana and XRP inflows shows that institutional investors are moving into other assets as Bitcoin’s price dips. Meanwhile, perpetual futures are showing increasing long positions. The open interest rose by 2% to 310,000 BTC, which is approximately $27 billion. The funding rate has hit 0.09%, the highest in two weeks. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

DeFi leverage is fading. AAVE borrowing is down ~70% since August as risk appetite fell with prices. But on @Nexo , borrowing rebounded +155% WoW during the drawdown. Users are choosing to borrow against collateral, not sell. pic.twitter.com/paqjLMeq5L — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 24, 2025 New research from CryptoQuant highlights how changing risk appetite and liquidity needs are reshaping borrowing behavior across the crypto ecosystem. DeFi Borrowing Contracts as Risk Appetite Fades According to CryptoQuant’s latest dashboard decentralized borrowing has fallen in line with declining crypto prices. Since August borrowing volumes on major DeFi protocols have dropped as traders reduce leverage and exposure. CryptoQuant reports on Aave which is one of the largest DeFi lending platforms, weekly borrowing of stablecoins USDT and USDC has fallen by 69%, declining from a peak of $6.2 billion to just $1.9 billion by the end of November. This contraction also closely mirrors the broader market downturn suggesting that users are actively unwinding leverage rather than deploying fresh capital. Despite the sharp pullback in new borrowing Aave still maintains $16.3 billion in outstanding loans, showing the scale of DeFi credit markets even during periods of stress. The decline in incremental borrowing points to a clear reduction in speculative risk-taking across decentralized markets, reports CryptoQuant. CeFi Borrowing Shows Early Signs of Rebound Centralized borrowing activity initially followed a similar downward trajectory during the market correction, but recent data suggest a divergence may be emerging. CryptoQuant also notes that CeFi platforms are beginning to see renewed borrowing demand even as prices continue to weaken. On Nexo weekly retail credit withdrawals dropped sharply from $34 million in mid-July to $8.8 million by mid-November. However, the following week saw a strong rebound to $23 million — a 155% week-on-week increase. This behavior also indicates that users may be increasingly opting to borrow against their crypto holdings rather than selling assets at depressed prices. The rebound suggests CeFi platforms are serving as a liquidity backstop during market drawdowns, allowing investors to access cash while maintaining long-term exposure to crypto. Centralized Lenders Play a Structural Role in Downturns CryptoQuant’s analysis highlights the structural importance of centralized lenders during periods of market stress. While DeFi borrowing tends to contract rapidly as leverage is reduced, CeFi platforms often absorb liquidity demand when investors seek flexibility and capital preservation. Nexo’s cumulative credit withdrawals reached $817 million in 2025, positioning it as one of the most active venues for crypto-backed lending this year. The latest data also suggests that centralized lenders complement DeFi markets by offering alternative borrowing channels with different risk profiles and user behavior.

The reason sits in plain sight. These companies own large data centers that burn huge amounts of power, and those sites are now in demand for computer work tied to artificial intelligence. Competition has crushed margins across mining operations, while the cost of electricity and equipment keeps climbing. At the same time, big tech groups need ready-to-use sites with land, cooling, and long-term power contracts. That overlap has pushed several miners to rent out their facilities to Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and other hyperscalers chasing more computing capacity. Data centers draw tech giants as miners chase new revenue Bitcoin mining once stood on its own as a high-return business that relied on raw computing force to solve equations and release new coins. That edge faded as more players joined and rewards tightened. Just as that slowdown set in, demand for AI-related computing surged and pulled attention toward assets miners already controlled. These conversions are not simple.AI workloads need stronger cooling and faster networks. They also require swapping Bitcoin machines for graphics processing units. Still, signing leases with miners lets tech companies grow faster and spend less than building new sites from scratch. Many miners continue Bitcoin work while bringing in longer contracts from customers with deep pockets. “The opportunity for miners to convert to AI is one of the greatest opportunities I could possibly imagine,” said Adam Sullivan, chief executive of Core Scientific. Adam led the company toward AI-focused centers while keeping some Bitcoin activity running. That move has lifted share prices across the sector. The CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF is up about 90% this year, even as Bitcoin erased its gains for 2025. The fund holds companies such as Cipher Mining and IREN, both of which jumped after signing long-term deals with Amazon and Microsoft. Core Scientific’s shares quadrupled in 2024 after its first AI contract in February and are up another 10% this year. The company plans to exit bitcoin mining by 2028. Power flexibility keeps some miners tied to Bitcoin operations For other companies, AI plans act as protection against the limits baked into mining itself. Bitcoin supply is capped at 21 million coins, and the halving every four years cuts rewards again. Price swings add more pressure, making steady income harder to find. CleanSpark raised $1.15 billion to expand data-center infrastructure but kept its Bitcoin mining business intact. One reason lies with utilities. Power companies want partners that can quickly reduce usage when grids strain. Bitcoin sites can shut down fast, something always-on AI centers cannot do. Matthew Schultz, chief executive of CleanSpark, explained the appeal. “If and when there’s a weather-related event or anything else, we can curtail a portion of the portfolio to help stabilize the grid,” Matthew said. “And what we found is the demand for that type of load is much greater.” CleanSpark shares are up 25% this year. Not every miner fits the bill. Moving from Bitcoin mining to high-performance computing costs serious money, and upgrades run deep. “Bitcoin miners have an advantage in understanding power and its use but there’s a night and day difference between mining and HPC support,” said Kevin Dede, senior research analyst at H.C. Wainwright. “It’s more than an order of magnitude of intensity and complexity.” The push into AI also carries risk. Some investors worry valuations are stretched, and spending is heavy. Another outcome could hit closer to home. As more companies redirect capacity, U.S. Bitcoin mining output could fall and move overseas, clashing with President Trump’s goal of keeping Bitcoin “mined, minted and made in the United States.” Get seen where it counts.

You Need to See This,https://timestabloid.com/turning-1000-to-5-million-xrp-holding-you-need-to-see-this/,"Crypto has always bred extreme narratives. From overnight millionaires to eye-watering price targets , the industry thrives on bold claims that promise financial freedom with minimal effort. XRP, given its long-standing association with institutional finance and global payments, often finds itself at the center of these discussions. Such projections grab attention, but they raise an important question: how many of these claims are actually grounded in reality? That question gained renewed attention after crypto commentator Levi Rietveld highlighted a striking example of influencer inconsistency in a recent video shared on X. Rather than debating XRP’s long-term potential directly, Rietveld focused on exposing how contradictory messaging continues to circulate unchecked within crypto media, often to the detriment of retail investors. Turning $1000 To $5 Million Holding $XRP ?! Comment “knowledge” and I’ll DM you access to my community! Like & repost to spread awareness!! pic.twitter.com/a3dnAnNz8S — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) December 23, 2025 The $1,000 to $5 Million Narrative The claim under scrutiny suggested that investing $1,000 into XRP today—roughly equivalent to acquiring about 500 XRP—could turn into $5 million if XRP reaches $10,000 by 2030. Framed as a simple waiting game, the argument relied heavily on emotional appeal rather than financial logic. On paper, the numbers appear enticing. In practice, they unravel quickly. A $10,000 XRP price would push the asset’s market capitalization into the hundreds of trillions of dollars , a level that far exceeds the combined valuation of global equity markets and rivals the total value of the world’s money supply. No verified institutional model, liquidity framework, or adoption forecast currently supports such an outcome within the stated timeframe. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Flip-Flop That Raised Eyebrows What made the situation particularly notable, as Rietveld pointed out, was the influencer’s sudden reversal. Just days before promoting the $10,000 XRP scenario, the same individual urged followers to sell XRP, insisting it was not integrating with SWIFT and would never reach such valuations. The contradiction was not nuanced; it was complete. Rietveld’s response showed the community’s growing frustration: people often adjust narratives to fit engagement trends rather than facts. When influencers can swing from extreme optimism to outright dismissal within days, credibility becomes the real casualty. What the Verified Facts Show At present, XRP trades below $2, supported by spot XRP ETFs that have improved institutional access and liquidity. Ripple is positioning its technology in cross-border payment discussions , but it hasn’t integrated XRP into SWIFT’s core settlement infrastructure. While interoperability conversations exist across the financial sector, no confirmed pathway justifies exponential price assumptions detached from realistic market constraints. The Bigger Takeaway for XRP Holders This episode is less about dismissing XRP’s future and more about emphasizing disciplined analysis. Long-term valuation depends on adoption depth, regulatory clarity, liquidity dynamics, and actual utility—not viral promises. As Levi Rietveld’s critique illustrates, skepticism is not bearishness; it is due diligence. In a market driven by narratives, consistency and facts remain the most valuable assets an investor can hold.

More products tied to crypto and private credit are about to be offered to everyday people in the United States as the Trump administration and Paul Atkins’ Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) push for wider market access. The problem is that regular investors could be left with all the risk and no safety net. Both the White House and the SEC say they want to give people more ways to invest. They believe asset classes like private equity and crypto could bring higher returns. But some advisors are worried that individuals won’t fully understand what they’re buying into, especially when it comes to retirement savings . Washington moves to open markets as regulators push new products The SEC says it’s still focused on protecting people. Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said “Chairman Atkins is committed to making sure that the SEC maintains fair, orderly, and efficient markets while protecting everyday investors.” But let’s be for real: the door is already being pushed wide open. The Department of Labor confirmed it’s working on new rules for how private assets can be offered to retirement investors. In August, the Trump administration told the Secretary of Labor to team up with the SEC and other agencies to make it easier for individuals to invest in private credit and private equity. Atkins said in November that most retirement plans don’t offer access to these assets, which puts people at a disadvantage. Right now, retirement plans like 401(k)s mostly stick to stocks and bonds through mutual funds or ETFs. Sure, letting these plans include private credit sounds like a way to diversify, but it also makes one wonder; how will these assets be valued? Can they be sold quickly? Are people even being given decent choices? These are not small issues for someone trying to retire. The SEC is also moving fast to unlock more crypto access. In September, it dropped a key hurdle by releasing generic listing standards that speed up the launch of spot crypto ETFs . Since then, new crypto ETFs have been rolling out, and Bitwise Asset Management says another hundred could drop in 2026. New ETFs and funds raise pressure on retail investors But with more products comes more risk. Robert Persichitte, a financial planner at Delagify Financial in Colorado, said these new tools might hurt the people with the least experience. “The little guy… doesn’t have a team of advisors on their side,” he said. He warned that these products aren’t simple, and average investors won’t know how to price or exit them. Morningstar data confirms the trend. After the SEC’s new rules, crypto ETF launches have jumped. And that’s not the only thing. Interval funds, which invest in private assets, are also rising. These funds are especially being pitched as a fit for retirement plans. Bryan Armour, a Morningstar analyst, said, “I expect an influx of funds that hold private assets in 2026.” Just to be clear, ETFs, interval funds, and even target-date mutual funds aren’t risky on their own. No, what matters is what they’re holding inside, and once you start loading them with volatile assets like crypto or hard-to-sell things like private credit, the whole game changes. Some market players are cheering the changes. Duncan Moir, president of 21Shares, which has launched six crypto ETFs recently, said crypto has “a meaningful role to play in investor portfolios.” But that’s only true if the investor knows what they’re doing. And let’s be honest, most don’t.

MSTU is suitable only for daily trading; holding longer risks compounded losses, value decay, and unrecoverable capital erosion. MSTR's financial strain stems from declining bitcoin prices, high leverage (1.40x assets/equity), and $8.2b in debt, pressuring MSTU further. Potential catalysts for further downside include bitcoin volatility, debt servicing challenges, and risk of MSTR delisting from MSCI indices. The T-Rex 2X Long MSTR Daily Target ETF ( MSTU ) is a leveraged exchange-traded fund designed to provide investors with 2x the daily performance of Strategy ( MSTR ) shares. MSTU can be utilized by traders seeking to amplify their exposure to MSTR shares, though may be exposed to substantial volatility in doing so, making this strategy only appropriate for seasoned traders with strict risk management. Given the risks associated with the underlying MSTR shares, I am recommending MSTU with a Sell rating. MSTU should only be considered for daily exposure; investing in MSTU for longer than a single trading day may expose investors to significant risks, including compounded returns, value decay, and unrecoverable losses. About T-Rex 2X Long MSTR Daily Target ETF MSTU was launched by Rex Shares on September 18, 2024 on the CBOE Exchange. MSTU was designed to provide traders with 2x the daily performance of MSTR shares through the use of total return swaps [TRSs]. Using the TRSs, MSTU has the ability to leverage exposure to achieve the 2x daily performance target. MSTU takes both the payer and receiver position across its strategy, balancing exposure across both ends of the trade. As the receiver, MSTU will receive total return exposure to MSTR shares’ performance in exchange for a fixed rate. As the payer , MSTU will receive a fixed rate in exchange for MSTR shares’ performance. Swaps are generally settled daily in cash, exchanging the daily performance for the fixed rate. Corporate Filings MSTU shares have been under significant pressure in recent months as Strategy’s financial position weakens. The underlying cause of the financial challenges is the declining price of bitcoin. This has directly impacted Strategy given its leveraged bitcoin strategy, in which Strategy would issue debt in order to purchase additional bitcoin to be held in the treasury. Though the strategy has gained interest by retail investors as an alternative bitcoin investment vehicle, the strategy has since faced hardship with the price of bitcoin declining by -8% in the last year, which has pressured MSTR shares to decline by -50%. TradingView As a result of the significant selling in the last year, MSTU shares have declined by over -91%. For long-term investors, the price decline may have led to significant value decay and unsalvageable losses. TradingView As a result of the price decline in bitcoin, Strategy has been increasing its liquidity in order to remain in good standing for its preferred shares and debt. Accordingly, Strategy has increased its cash position to $2.19b. As of q3’25, Strategy had $8.2b in total debt on the balance sheet with a financial leverage ratio of 1.40x assets/equity. I believe the biggest challenge presented is that Strategy used conventional debt in order to gain leveraged bitcoin exposure as compared to using TRSs like leveraged funds. The critical challenge is that Strategy is investing in non-interest-bearing assets using debt with the intention of employing a buy-and-hold strategy on the bitcoin purchased. This means that Strategy will need to raise cash in order to cover interest and dividend payments on debt and preferred shares, adding certain risks to its leveraged bitcoin holdings, particularly during periods of market decline. MSTU shares have been reflective of the significant price decline faced by MSTR shares at an amplified rate. Looking at daily performance, MSTU shares may be set for further decline relative to MSTR shares. TradingView Despite the generally positive fund flows into MSTU, shares have faced a sharp decline as a result of pricing, resulting in a -$2b change in net assets in the last year. ETF Database ETF Database Taking into consideration fund flows in the last few months, investors may be expecting a reversal in the underlying share price. The challenge presented is that MSTR faces a number of factors that may influence the share price, including the price of bitcoin, remaining in good standing on its debt, and the possibility of MSTR being delisted from MSCI indices , all of which may pressure the share price. ETF Database Risks Related to MSTU MSTU is a leveraged ETF designed to provide traders with 2x the daily performance of MSTR shares, exposing traders to certain risks that should be considered prior to making a final investment decision. MSTU may expose investors to substantial risk related to the price of bitcoin, particularly when considering MSTR shares as a leveraged bitcoin strategy. MSTU employs leverage that may result in enhanced exposure to MSTR shares and may result in compounded returns, value decay, and significant losses if held for longer than a single trading day. Actively trading MSTU may expose investors to higher capital gains taxes, trading fees, and management fees; MSTU charges a 105bps expense ratio and has an average bid/ask spread of 0.11%. You can review additional risks here and the SEC bulletin here . Given the substantial risks associated with trading leveraged funds, investors should adhere to strict risk management policies, particularly when it comes to sell discipline. Final Thoughts MSTR shares may face additional selling pressure with operational and stock-related catalysts coming into play, particularly related to making interest and dividend payments on its debt and preferred shares, the price of bitcoin, and the possibility of being delisted from MSCI indices. Given these risks, as well as the substantial exposure gained while trading leveraged funds, I am recommending MSTU with a Sell rating.",MSTR|MSTU,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-24 12:06:04

It is also changing how people approach philanthropy. For many donors – especially those holding appreciated crypto – donor-advised funds (DAFs) have emerged as one of the most flexible and powerful tools for charitable giving. This article explains what DAFs are, how they work, and why they are particularly well suited for crypto-based philanthropy. What is a donor-advised fund? A donor-advised fund is a charitable giving account administered by a registered nonprofit sponsor. When you contribute assets to a DAF: You make an irrevocable charitable contribution You generally become eligible for an immediate tax deduction You can then allocate donations to qualified charities over time In simple terms, a DAF allows you to separate the timing of the charitable deduction from the timing of the grant recommendation. You give now, lock in the tax benefit, and decide later which charities to support (and when). Why DAFs are especially attractive for crypto holders Donate crypto, get tax benefits One of the most significant advantages of donating crypto through a DAF is tax efficiency. Capital gains are avoided because the asset is donated in-kind and never sold by the donor. When you donate appreciated crypto directly to a DAF: You avoid paying capital gains tax on the difference between your cost basis (purchase cost) and the current fair market value of the appreciated crypto asset . You are eligible for a charitable contribution deduction, subject to deduction limitations, based on the fair market value of the crypto that is donated. Donating the appreciated cryptoasset directly to charitable causes allows more of the asset’s value to go to charitable causes instead of taxes. For long-term crypto holders, this can materially increase charitable impact compared to selling crypto and donating cash. Support thousands of charities from a single account DAFs are designed for flexibility. Most support a broad universe of U.S.-registered charities, one-time or recurring grants, and multi-year giving strategies. Instead of coordinating separate donations, receipts, and records across many organizations, donors can centralize giving through one account and distribute funds over time . Invest contributions while you plan your giving Many DAFs allow donated assets to be invested after contribution but before they are granted out to charities. This means assets may continue to grow tax-free inside the charitable account , donors can take a longer-term, strategic approach to philanthropy , and market timing pressure is reduced. The growth maximizes the charitable impact. For crypto-native donors accustomed to portfolio management, this investment flexibility is a natural fit. Simplified recordkeeping and tax documentation Charitable giving can become administratively complex, especially when donations span multiple assets and organizations. DAFs simplify this by consolidating donation records, providing year-end tax documentation, and reducing paperwork and operational overhead. This is particularly helpful for donors who contribute crypto, stocks, and cash throughout the year. Flexible giving, without time pressure With a DAF, there is no requirement to immediately distribute funds to charities . Donors can respond to urgent needs when they arise, plan grants around personal or market milestones, and build a long-term philanthropic strategy. This flexibility aligns well with the volatility and opportunity cycles common in crypto markets. A natural fit for the crypto community Crypto has always been about more than financial innovation. It has been about expanding access, transparency, and global coordination. Donor-advised funds extend those principles into philanthropy by giving donors greater control, better capital efficiency, broader reach, and lower friction. As crypto adoption grows, so does the opportunity to use digital assets not just as investments, but as tools for meaningful, long-term impact. Crypto gains translating into lasting impact Donor-advised funds are not new, but their relevance has increased significantly in a world where wealth is increasingly held in digital assets. For crypto holders who want to give thoughtfully, efficiently, and at scale, DAFs offer a proven and powerful framework. As charitable infrastructure continues to evolve alongside crypto, understanding options like DAFs is an important first step toward maximizing both financial and social impact. How to get started The following are three established providers for consideration, if you’re looking to further explore DAFs: Daffy Daffy is a modern, low-cost donor-advised fund that makes charitable giving simple and accessible. With a $25 signup bonus, It lets you contribute crypto, stocks, or cash from its iOS app or web platform, then donate to nearly any 501(c)(3) public charity from local schools to global aid organizations, without triggering capital gains on appreciated assets or creating extra hassle for the over 1.7 million nonprofits supported. Endaoment Endaoment is a nonprofit, technology-powered donor-advised fund that enables donors to give more efficiently and with greater flexibility, all onchain. It supports cash, crypto, and other complex assets, offers robust grantmaking tools, and focuses on modernizing charitable infrastructure through donor-centric design. Givepact Givepact is a donor-advised fund purpose-built for crypto philanthropy, enabling seamless, tax-efficient giving of digital assets. It is designed for crypto-native donors who want a streamlined way to support verified nonprofits while aligning charitable giving with onchain innovation and global impact. Turning crypto philanthropy into global financial empowerment Kraken’s mission is to accelerate the global adoption of cryptocurrency so that individuals around the world can achieve greater financial freedom and inclusion. At its core, this mission reflects a belief that open, accessible financial systems can expand opportunity, reduce barriers, and empower people who have historically been excluded from traditional finance. Philanthropy plays a critical role in this vision by helping fund education, infrastructure, advocacy, and direct support for organizations working to build a more equitable global economy. Donor-advised funds are an internationally available, uniquely powerful way for crypto holders to contribute to that progress. They enable tax-efficient giving of digital assets, support long-term and strategic philanthropy, and lower friction in how capital is deployed. DAFs allow crypto-native donors to turn innovation-driven wealth into sustained real-world impact. In doing so, they help align personal generosity with our broader mission – using cryptocurrency not just as a financial tool, but as a catalyst for positive, global change.

The analysis focuses on Mantle’s deepening exchange integration, expanding real-world asset infrastructure, and the emergence of a modular financial stack spanning capital, applications, and user access. Deepening Distribution Through Bybit Integration Messari highlights Mantle’s evolving relationship with Bybit, which has progressed from a standard token listing to a deep platform-level integration where MNT functions as a core asset across trading, fee payments, VIP programs, and institutional products. Following a joint roadmap announced in August 2025, Bybit expanded MNT-quoted trading pairs, enabled discounted MNT-denominated fees, and introduced MNT-based benefits for VIP and institutional users. During this period, MNT’s circulating market capitalization reached approximately $8.7 billion on October 8, 2025, reflecting expanded access, improved liquidity, and broader participation across Bybit’s distribution channels. Capital Formation Anchored for DeFi Hubs The report notes that Mantle’s capital base is anchored by mETH Protocol, which remains one of the network’s largest sources of onchain liquidity. As of late 2025, mETH holds $791.7 million in ETH and cmETH holds $277 million, representing approximately $1.07 billion in underlying assets. On the application layer, Mantle’s DeFi TVL reached $242.3 million as of September 30, 2025, reflecting continued growth in onchain activity across the network. Expanding Institutional Stack Across RWAs, DeFi, and Infrastructure Messari also underscores Mantle’s progress in building institutional-grade onchain infrastructure through its Tokenization-as-a-Service (TaaS) platform, which provides end-to-end support for compliant RWA issuance. Institutional activity expanded through issuances such as Ondo Finance’s USDY, which reached approximately $29 million tokenized on Mantle, alongside broader ecosystem initiatives including global RWA hackathons and scholarship programs. “Institutions don’t adopt isolated execution layers, but they adopt ecosystems that coordinate capital, liquidity, and distribution,” said Emily Bao, Key Advisor at Mantle. “Mantle’s focus has been on closing those gaps and making onchain finance usable at institutional scale, rather than optimizing for throughput alone.” “Mantle’s development reflects a broader shift among Layer 2s toward coordinating capital, applications, and distribution rather than optimizing execution in isolation,” said Evan Zakhary, Protocol Research Analyst at Messari. “Its growing capital stack and exchange-led distribution position it as a network focused on institutional onchain activity.” Messari’s analysis positions Mantle as a Layer 2 evolving beyond execution to coordinate capital, infrastructure, and distribution. As the network deepens exchange integration and institutional adoption, Mantle is increasingly defined by its role as a distribution layer for institutional onchain finance. About Mantle Mantle positions itself as the premier distribution layer and gateway for institutions and TradFi to connect with onchain liquidity and access real-world assets, powering how real-world finance flows. With over $4B+ in community-owned assets, Mantle combines credibility, liquidity, and scalability with institutional-grade infrastructure to support large-scale adoption. The ecosystem is anchored by $MNT within Bybit, and built out through core ecosystem projects like mETH, fBTC, MI4 and more. This is complemented by Mantle Network’s partnerships with leading issuers and protocols such as Ethena USDe, Ondo USDY, OP-Succinct and EigenLayer.

Meta is already facing a probe by the EU for possible breach of the bloc’s competition rules after the social media company announced in October a policy that prohibited AI providers from using a tool allowing businesses to reach customers via WhatsApp when AI is the main service offered. Meta’s conduct may threaten competition The Italian Competition Authority, known as AGCM revealed on Wednesday that the order follows an investigation to assess the integration of Meta’s own services into WhatsApp. The investigation is still ongoing, according to the AGCM. The authority expressed concerns that Meta’s behavior might threaten competition. As such, the interim order is meant to preserve access to the WhatsApp platform for the social media giant’s AI competitors as investigations into the matter continue. Meta has previously indicated that it was liaising with the authority on the investigation, adding that the WhatsApp application programming interface was never designed to be used for AI chatbots. But the authority is positive that Meta’s conduct may pose a serious threat to competition with the social networking giant abusing its dominant position . “Meta’s conduct appears to constitute an abuse, since it may limit production, market access or technical developments in the AI chatbot services market, to the detriment of consumers.” AGCM. Earlier this year, the AGCM launched an investigation to evaluate whether AI features that Meta had introduced on WhatsApp amounted to an abuse of a dominant position. Last month, the authority widened the scope of the probe to include a change in WhatsApp’s business terms excluding general purpose AI chatbots from the platform, adding that the social media firm’s new rules could call for interim measures. The AGCM also revealed on Wednesday that the conditions for adopting interim measures had been met. The authority also added that it was coordinating with the EU antitrust officials on the issue. Meta is already under EU probe over the matter, in one of the several antitrust cases against US tech giants, including Google and Apple. As previously reported by the Cryptopolitan , Google was earlier this year slapped with a €2.95 billion fine in an ad case, in which the EU alleges the tech giant abused its dominant position. The case is considered one of Brussels’ biggest punishments. During the same month, Meta was also fined €200 million for breaching obligations to give consumers the choice of service that uses less of their personal data. Fines for breaking the EU’s antitrust rules can be as much as 10% of the company’s annual revenue. For this current case, there are reportedly no dates set for the antitrust investigation to close, but prior cases have run for years.

Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad , has consistently argued that gold , silver , Bitcoin ( BTC ), and Ethereum ( ETH ) help protect against inflation, currency debasement, and systemic financial risk, though these represent only some of his publicly known investments. Kiyosaki’s top investments As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at about $87,182, down roughly 5% year-to-date; Ethereum was near $2,928.34, off about 12% year-to-date; gold was trading around $2,928.34, up roughly 71% year-to-date; and silver was near $72, higher by about 148% year-to-date. Using year-to-date performance figures and assuming an investor allocated $1,000 equally across Bitcoin, Ethereum, gold, and silver at the beginning of 2025, the aggregate portfolio value would now be approximately $1,505, representing a cumulative gain of about 50%. The overall return was driven overwhelmingly by precious metals, which more than offset losses recorded in cryptocurrencies. A $1,000 investment in Bitcoin at the start of 2025 would now be worth about $950, with the price at $87,182, as the asset grappled with volatility, tighter financial conditions, and a shift toward traditional safe havens. Despite this, Kiyosaki has continued to back Bitcoin as digital insurance against fiat currency collapse. Bitcoin one-week stock price chart. Source: Finbold Ethereum underperformed further, with a $1,000 investment falling to roughly $880 at a press-time price of $2,928.34, reflecting broader risk aversion in crypto markets, rising competition, and sensitivity to global liquidity conditions. Precious metal returns Gold ranked among the strongest performers, with a $1,000 investment rising to around $1,710 at a price near $2,928.34, supported by inflation concerns, geopolitical tensions, easing policy expectations, and steady central bank demand. Kiyosaki has long described gold as real money and a hedge against currency debasement. Gold YTD price chart. Source: TradingView Silver delivered the standout return, with a $1,000 investment climbing to about $2,480 at a price near $72. Gains were driven by safe-haven flows and strong industrial demand tied to the energy transition. Kiyosaki has repeatedly argued that silver offers greater upside than gold due to its dual monetary and industrial role, a view reinforced by 2025’s price action. Silver YTD price chart. Source: TradingView When combined in an equally weighted portfolio, strong gains in gold and silver more than offset cryptocurrency losses, underscoring the diversification benefits of Kiyosaki’s favored assets. However, this analysis reflects only some of his publicly known investments, as he has also highlighted real estate, private businesses, and other commodities that could materially alter overall performance if included.

This transaction, involving thousands of Bitcoin and Ethereum, isn’t just a large trade—it’s a powerful declaration of institutional faith in digital assets. What does this mean for the future of crypto, and why should every investor pay close attention? What Exactly Did BlackRock Deposit to Coinbase Prime? According to data from on-chain analytics, BlackRock transferred a significant cache of digital assets. The breakdown is precise and substantial: 2,292 Bitcoin (BTC) : Valued at approximately $200 million. 9,976 Ethereum (ETH) : Worth around $29.23 million. This BlackRock Coinbase Prime deposit wasn’t sent to a standard exchange wallet. Coinbase Prime is a specialized, white-glove platform designed for institutions. It offers secure custody, deep liquidity, and advanced trading tools that meet the stringent requirements of large-scale investors. Therefore, this action goes beyond simple asset movement; it represents a strategic allocation using professional-grade infrastructure. Why is the BlackRock Coinbase Prime Move a Game-Changer? BlackRock managing over $10 trillion in assets makes its every move a market signal. This deposit provides several key insights into the current state of institutional crypto adoption. First, it demonstrates a mature operational approach. By using Coinbase Prime, BlackRock shows it prioritizes security and compliance, addressing common concerns about the crypto ecosystem. Second, the sheer size of the deposit to Coinbase Prime validates cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class for portfolio diversification. Other institutional players watching this may feel increased confidence to follow suit. Finally, this action likely relates to BlackRock’s successful spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), which requires a robust mechanism for acquiring and safeguarding the underlying Bitcoin. This deposit could be part of the operational backbone supporting that massively popular fund. What Are the Immediate Market Implications? When a whale like BlackRock makes a splash, the ripples are felt everywhere. This deposit has several potential consequences. Price Stability Signal : Large, custodial deposits to prime brokerages are often seen as a longer-term hold strategy, not an imminent sell-off. This can be interpreted as a bullish, stabilizing signal for Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. Infrastructure Validation : The choice of Coinbase Prime reinforces the critical role of regulated crypto-native institutions in bridging traditional finance (TradFi) with decentralized finance (DeFi). Competitive Pressure Other asset managers and institutional banks will likely accelerate their own crypto custody and product offerings to keep pace with BlackRock’s aggressive strategy. In essence, this BlackRock Coinbase Prime deposit acts as a massive vote of confidence, potentially lowering the perceived risk for other institutions still on the sidelines. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Crypto The narrative that cryptocurrencies are a speculative fringe asset is now irrevocably outdated. BlackRock’s $229 million deposit to Coinbase Prime is a landmark event, proving that the world’s most sophisticated financial institutions are not just dipping a toe but diving headfirst into the digital asset ocean. This move provides unparalleled legitimacy, showcases the maturity of crypto infrastructure, and sets a new benchmark for institutional involvement. The fusion of TradFi and crypto is no longer a prediction; it is our present reality. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Coinbase Prime? A1: Coinbase Prime is a full-service, institutional-grade brokerage platform offering secure custody, advanced trading tools, and prime services tailored for hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations. Q2: Why would BlackRock use Coinbase Prime instead of holding assets themselves? A2: Coinbase Prime provides specialized security, insurance, and regulatory compliance that can be complex and costly to build in-house. It allows BlackRock to leverage expert infrastructure.

Q4: How does this deposit affect the average crypto investor? A4: It signals strong institutional demand and long-term confidence, which can positively influence overall market sentiment and stability, benefiting all participants.

In a Dec. 23 interview with CoinStories host Nathalie Brunell, Le said the conversations start with the most basic building blocks, custody and exchange because banks have already watched meaningful flows move to crypto-native and quasi-crypto incumbents. “They’re all trying to catch up with just the base of custodying Bitcoin and providing exchange services,” Le said. “They’ve seen, for example, Coinbase or Fidelity, and what they’re doing. And they want to be able to offer their customers native services with BTC so they don’t take the money off the platform out to somewhere else.” Large US Banks Begin Bitcoin Conversations Le described this baseline in familiar banking language, positioning BTC as an account-type object inside existing distribution rather than an external asset clients self-custody elsewhere. “So I’ll just start that as a baseline. I call it a checking account and a savings account for Bitcoin, right?” he said. “And then on top of that, what do they want to do?” His answer was a laddered product roadmap that increasingly resembles the capital-markets “stack” Strategy has spent the last several years industrializing: credit, yield, structured exposure, and eventually something close to money-like instruments backed by BTC collateral. “Then they want to offer things like the coin lending, which means you get loans against Bitcoin,” Le said. “And we know a lot of folks are doing that on a one-to-one private loan basis, but they should provide it in general. Perhaps offering instruments that give you yield off of Bitcoin. That will be the next sort of step above that.” From there, Le said, banks start converging on Strategy’s own playbook , not necessarily copying it line-by-line, but arriving at the same conclusion that Bitcoin can be used as balance-sheet collateral to manufacture investable products. “And then a set of Bitcoin-backed products, not too much different than what we do,” he said. “An investment bank would want to be able to underwrite Bitcoin-backed securities like MSTR or like any of our preferreds. That would be the next step.” The “underwrite” comment is the tell. This is not merely about giving wealth clients a custody button. It is about turning exposure into fundable, tradable paper that sits comfortably inside existing bank distribution: preferreds, structured notes, and credit instruments that look like what clients already buy, just with BTC as the collateral story. Le then moved into what he called “digital credit,” explicitly tying it to preferred-style issuance and bank-native variants of the same idea. “And then you get into offering digital credit, right? Which would be our preferreds or a bank preferred based off of Bitcoin,” he said. “And then the last thing, which is what Mike talked about at Bitcoin in the Middle East, which is digital money, right? How do you give somebody essentially access to something that looks like money backed by Bitcoin that gives them a steady yield that’s better than what they would get otherwise called eight, nine percent?” That “digital money” framing is aligned with what Saylor has been signaling on stage: BTC as collateral that can support a broader credit superstructure. At Bitcoin MENA 2025 in Abu Dhabi, Saylor argued the shift is already underway and, in his telling, the largest names in US finance are no longer keeping their distance, as Bitcoinist reported . “In the past six months I have noted and been approached by BNY Mellon, by Wells Fargo, by Bank of America, by Charles Schwab, by JP Morgan , by Citi,” Saylor said. “They are all starting to issue credit against either Bitcoin or against derivatives like IBIT.” At press time, BTC traded at",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-24 13:00:56

Coincodex data shows XRP trading near $1.87, almost 50% below its $3.65 all-time high set earlier this year. While the pullback has sparked short-term pessimism, Coach JV contends the disconnect between price and strengthening fundamentals may signal a rare opportunity. He argues that markets often misprice assets during transitional phases, and XRP could be in the midst of one now. Strengthening Fundamentals Amid Price Weakness Despite muted price action, XRP’s ecosystem continues to strengthen behind the scenes. Ripple is steadily expanding its global footprint through strategic partnerships with banks, financial institutions, and payment providers, all aimed at enhancing cross-border payments. These solutions offer faster settlement and lower costs than traditional systems, reinforcing XRP’s real-world utility. This accelerating institutional adoption underpins the bull case for XRP. As demand grows for efficient, blockchain-based payment infrastructure, XRP’s proven network, deep liquidity, and established use case position it as a practical financial tool—not merely a speculative asset. Regulatory Progress Boosts Confidence Another key pillar of Coach JV’s thesis is growing regulatory clarity. For years, XRP’s price and sentiment were weighed down by legal uncertainty. That overhang is now easing, following Ripple’s courtroom win against the SEC and the emergence of clearer regulatory frameworks. As risk perception declines, confidence among institutional and long-term investors is steadily returning. Regulatory clarity is especially crucial for institutional capital, which typically stays on the sidelines until compliance risks are clearly defined. With clearer rules on the horizon, such as the anticipated Clarity Bill, XRP could be well positioned to attract larger, more stable capital inflows. Price Models Suggest Untapped Upside Adding to the bullish outlook, multiple price-prediction models point to substantial upside that XRP’s current valuation has yet to reflect. These models incorporate key fundamentals such as adoption growth, rising transaction volumes, and expanding network utility, signals that suggest XRP’s market price may be trailing its long-term potential. While no forecast is certain, the convergence of accelerating institutional momentum, improving regulatory clarity, and supportive model projections reinforces the case that XRP may be undervalued at current levels. Conclusion Coach JV’s claim that XRP could become this generation’s greatest missed investment opportunity is a call to look past short-term price fluctuations. Regardless of whether his prediction materializes, the combination of strengthening fundamentals and significant price weakness has positioned XRP as one of the most closely watched and debated assets in today’s crypto market.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-24 13:01:37

The pullback comes amid broad weakness across major assets, while trading activity remains elevated, with 24-hour volume at $98.49 billion. TLDR: Crypto market cap fell 1.1% to $3.02T, with broad losses across major assets; Galaxy Research says Bitcoin has not truly cleared $100K when adjusted for inflation; BTC is consolidating near $87K, with key support at $85K–$86K and downside risk toward $80K; Market sentiment remains weak, with the Fear & Greed Index at 27 (fear); US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $188.6M in net outflows on Dec. 23, led by BlackRock’s IBIT; US spot Ether ETFs also recorded outflows of $95.5M, reversing the prior day’s inflows; Institutional activity continues, with Bitmine adding nearly $1B worth of ETH in December. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, most of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are in the red over the past day. Bitcoin (BTC ) is trading at $86,780, down 0.8% over the last 24 hours, though it remains slightly higher on the weekly timeframe. Bitcoin’s market cap stands at approximately $1.73 trillion, maintaining its dominant position despite the broader downturn. Ethereum (ETH) has fallen 1.5% to $2,919, with its market capitalization sitting near $352 billion. Among the largest declines in the top 10, Solana (SOL) dropped 2.3% to $121.36, while BNB (BNB) slipped 1.6% to $835.76. XRP (XRP) also declined 1.8%, trading at $1.85. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down 2.2% on the day, changing hands at $0.1274, while Cardano (ADA) recorded one of the sharpest losses among large caps, falling 2.3% to $0.3554. Outside the majors, select tokens posted gains. SQD led the market with a 43.7% surge, followed by Quantum Resistant Ledger , which climbed 31%, and pippin, up 21.8%, standing out as notable outperformers amid an otherwise risk-off session. Meanwhile, Galaxy Research has said Bitcoin may have printed new highs in nominal terms, but it has yet to truly clear the $100,000 mark once inflation is taken into account. Bitcoin may have printed new highs in nominal terms, but it has yet to truly clear the $100,000 mark once inflation is taken into account. #Bitcoin #Inflation https://t.co/dsCimbcLQG — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 24, 2025 Galaxy’s head of research, Alex Thorn, said Tuesday that Bitcoin never crossed six figures when adjusted for inflation using 2020 dollars, despite the asset reaching an all-time high above $126,000 in October. Bitcoin Dominance Rises as Altcoins Face Year-End Pressure Bitcoin’s share of the crypto market continues to climb as trading activity slows toward year-end, keeping altcoins under sustained pressure, according to Wintermute’s latest market update. The report said capital rotating is out of smaller tokens and back into Bitcoin and Ethereum, dampening expectations for an altcoin rally typically seen after strong Bitcoin moves. The broader market remains weak, with Bitcoin slipping below $87,000 and Ethereum trading near $3,000 over the past 24 hours. Altcoins posted steeper losses, led by the NFT sector, which fell more than 9% as risk appetite faded. Earlier in the week, heavy volatility triggered roughly $600 million in liquidations on Monday, followed by another $400 million on both Wednesday and Thursday. Wintermute data confirms retail rotation from altcoins to Bitcoin and Ethereum as dominance climbs and supply pressure mounts into year-end. #Bitcoin #Ethereum https://t.co/NFbUk9dKHx — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 24, 2025 Despite a partial rebound toward $90,000 , Bitcoin’s price action has stayed constrained. Open interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetuals dropped by a combined $5 billion, reducing leverage but leaving markets exposed to sharp moves amid thin liquidity. Traditional financial players continue entering the space despite recent market volatility, providing a more durable foundation for future growth. Bitmine added another 67,886 ETH worth $201 million to its treasury, bringing total December purchases to approximately $953 million. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Tuesday, Bitcoin is trading near $86,926, down roughly 0.6% on the day. Earlier in December, BTC attempted a rebound toward the $92,000–$94,000 zone but failed to hold momentum, resuming its broader downtrend that began after peaking above $120,000 in October. Over the past several weeks, Bitcoin has moved within a declining range, with repeated rejections below $90,000 and growing selling pressure on rallies. The chart shows BTC breaking below several short-term support levels in November, with buyers now defending the $85,000–$86,000 area. A sustained move below this zone could expose downside toward $82,000, with a deeper pullback opening the door to the $80,000 psychological level. On the upside, BTC would need to reclaim $90,000 to signal stabilization, with further resistance near $95,000. Ethereum is trading around $2,926, down roughly 1.2% over the past 24 hours. The chart shows ETH continuing to underperform after losing the $3,200–$3,300 range earlier in November. Since then, price action has remained heavy, with lower highs and limited follow-through on rebounds. ETH briefly dipped below $2,900 in recent sessions before finding short-term support, but momentum remains fragile. If selling resumes, the next key downside level sits near $2,800, followed by stronger historical support around $2,650. On the upside, a recovery above $3,000 would be the first step toward stabilizing price action, with additional resistance near $3,200. Meanwhile, crypto market sentiment remains firmly in the fear zone, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index reading 27 at the time of writing . The index has shown little improvement in recent days, reflecting continued caution among market participants. While sentiment has recovered slightly from last month’s extreme fear low of 12, it remains well below neutral levels, suggesting investors are still hesitant to take on risk. US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded net outflows of $188.64 million on Dec. 23, extending the recent cooling in institutional demand. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the outflows, shedding $157.34 million on the day. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $15.30 million in outflows, while Grayscale’s GBTC saw $10.28 million leave the fund. Bitwise’s BITB also recorded a smaller outflow of $5.72 million. Cumulative net inflows across all US spot Bitcoin ETFs stand at $57.08 billion. Total value traded across the products reached $3.16 billion, while total net assets stood at $114.29 billion, equivalent to roughly 6.5% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. US spot Ether ETFs reversed course on Dec. 23, posting net outflows of $95.53 million after a day of inflows earlier in the week. Grayscale’s ETHE accounted for the largest share of the outflows, shedding $50.89 million on the day. BlackRock’s ETHA followed with $25.04 million in net redemptions, while Bitwise’s ETHW saw $13.98 million exit the fund. Franklin’s EZET also recorded outflows of $5.61 million. Cumulative net inflows across US spot Ether ETFs remain at $12.43 billion.

Gox move 1,300 Bitcoins ($114M) to unidentified platforms",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/aleksey-bilyuchenko-addresses-1300-bitcoins/,"Wallets tied to Aleksey Bilyuchenko moved 1,300 Bitcoins worth about $114 million to unidentified platforms over the past week, according to Arkham analyst Emmett Gallic. Aleksey is connected to the Mt. Gox breach and the operation of BTC-e, and these same wallets still control 4,100 Bitcoins valued near $360 million, while 2,300 Bitcoins have already been sold as of press time. This latest development adds to a case that stretches back more than a decade, as Aleksey faces U.S. charges tied to the laundering of crypto connected to these historic exchange crimes. Source : Arkham/X BTC-e handled billions while running outside U.S. rules The US Secret Service records from June 7, 2023 said Aleksey worked with Alexander Vinnik and others to operate BTC-e from 2011 until its shutdown by US DOJ in July 2017. During those 6 years, BTC-e was one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, serving more than one million users worldwide. Prosecutors say BTC-e received proceeds tied to computer intrusions, hacking incidents, ransomware events, identity theft schemes, corrupt public officials, and narcotics distribution rings. The exchange operated without a license and without required controls. Aleksey is charged with money laundering conspiracy and operating an unlicensed money services business, according to court filings by the DOJ. From September 2011 through at least May 2014, the group caused the theft of roughly 647,000 Bitcoins, which is most of the Bitcoins held for Mt. Gox customers . Prosecutors say that the stolen Bitcoin was laundered mainly through addresses linked to accounts Aleksey and his group controlled at two other online exchanges identified in the filings as Exchange-1 and Exchange-2, along with a specific Mt. Gox user account. In April 2012, Aleksey and Verner negotiated a fraudulent Advertising Contract with a Bitcoin brokerage based in the Southern District of New York. Under the contract, the brokerage made large wire transfers to offshore bank accounts, including accounts held by shell companies controlled by the group. Between March 2012 and April 2013, the broker sent more than $6.6 million overseas. In return, the brokerage received credit on Exchange-1. Through that access, the group laundered more than 300,000 Bitcoins taken from Mt. Gox . The Advertising Contract served as a cover that allowed the stolen Bitcoin to be concealed and liquidated. Former U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said , “As alleged, Alexey Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner thought they could outsmart the law by using sophisticated hacks to steal and launder massive amounts of cryptocurrency, a novel technology at the time, but the charges unsealed demonstrate our ability to tenaciously pursue these alleged criminals, no matter how complex their schemes, until they are brought to justice.” Get seen where it counts.

The decentralized prediction market platform said the issue has now been fixed and that there is no ongoing risk, though it has not disclosed how many users were affected or the total value of funds lost. Polymarket said that multiple user accounts recently suffered fund losses due to a security vulnerability in a third-party authentication service. The issue has been fixed and no ongoing risk remains. Some users reported on social media that their funds were drained after… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 24, 2025 Login Emails, Empty Accounts: Polymarket Users Describe Sudden Fund Losses Reports of suspicious activity began circulating earlier this week on X and Reddit, where several users described receiving multiple login notification emails despite not attempting to access their accounts. In multiple cases, users said they logged in hours later to find their positions closed and balances nearly zero. One Reddit user wrote that three login attempts were flagged while their email and other online accounts showed no signs of compromise, adding that their Polymarket funds were drained at the same time the login emails were sent. Another user provided a detailed account suggesting the breach may have involved weaknesses in the platform’s one-time password system at the time of the incident.

Several said they had signed up through Magic Labs, a popular onboarding service that allows users to log in with email addresses and automatically creates non-custodial Ethereum wallets. Magic Labs is widely used by newer crypto users who do not already manage their own wallets. While Polymarket did not name the authentication provider involved, it acknowledged in a message posted to its official Discord channel that the vulnerability originated from a third-party service. Source: Polymarket Discord The platform said it would contact impacted users directly but did not offer details on reimbursements or recovery options. Third-Party Breaches Keep Haunting Crypto Platforms The incident is not the first time Polymarket has faced security-related concerns tied to external services. In September 2024, users who logged in through Google accounts reported wallet drains involving unauthorized proxy transactions that moved USDC funds to phishing addresses. At the time, Polymarket investigated the events as potentially targeted exploits linked to third-party authentication tools. More recently, a phishing campaign that abused the platform’s comment sections resulted in losses exceeding $500,000 after users were redirected to fake login pages. The breach comes amid a broader rise in third-party security failures across the crypto and technology sectors. This week, crypto tax software firm Koinly warned users that email addresses may have been exposed following a breach at Mixpanel, an analytics provider it previously used. @KoinlyOfficial warns a third-party breach may have exposed user emails but stresses that no wallet, transaction, tax, or portfolio data was shared with Mixpanel. #CryptoSecurity #CryptoTax #Koinly https://t.co/ASDxMchfyg — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 23, 2025 Koinly reported that no financial/tax information had been breached and that it no longer uses the service. Elsewhere, Swiss crypto platform SwissBorg released a report of a loss of 41 million earlier this year following a compromise by attackers of an API provider, and Discord and a number of DeFi protocols have also reported attacks related to external vendors.

While short-term charts continue to reflect hesitation and compressed volatility, higher-timeframe indicators are beginning to tell a very different story. For seasoned market watchers, it is often these quiet moments that precede the most consequential phases of a cycle. A recent observation shared by STEPH IS CRYPTO on X has drawn renewed focus to XRP’s long-term technical structure. Steph highlighted a rare signal on the three-week chart that has appeared only once before in XRP’s trading history, making it a development that long-term holders cannot easily ignore. A Rare Signal on a High Timeframe On the three-week timeframe, XRP’s Stochastic RSI has dropped to 0.00. This is an extreme reading that rarely occurs on such a high timeframe, where indicators move slowly and reflect broad market forces rather than short-term sentiment. According to Steph, the last time this exact condition appeared was at the 2022 bear market bottom. At that point in the cycle, XRP was not entering a speculative rebound. Instead, it transitioned into a prolonged accumulation phase, where price stabilized, volatility faded, and supply gradually shifted into stronger hands before the next major move higher. This $XRP chart is interesting for one reason. On the 3-week timeframe, the Stochastic RSI has dropped to 0.00. That’s extremely rare and has only happened once before — at the 2022 bear market bottom. On such a high timeframe, this indicator only reaches zero when… pic.twitter.com/vNhoTXNewi — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 23, 2025 What a Zero Stochastic RSI Actually Means A Stochastic RSI reading at zero does not imply that price must reverse immediately. Rather, it signals that selling momentum has been fully exhausted. On higher timeframes, this exhaustion reflects a structural slowdown in downside pressure, not a temporary pause caused by oversold conditions on lower charts. Steph emphasized that when this indicator reaches zero on a multi-week timeframe, it usually indicates that bearish momentum has dried up. Price may continue to consolidate, but the probability of aggressive downside continuation becomes increasingly limited. Accumulation Over Distribution One of the most important implications of this signal is what it suggests about market behavior beneath the surface. Rather than widespread distribution, the data points toward long-term holders absorbing available supply. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Historically, this type of environment tends to form near cycle lows, when speculative interest is muted, and conviction-driven accumulation quietly increases. This pattern has been a defining feature of XRP’s previous major bottoms, where extended consolidation ultimately laid the groundwork for explosive upside once broader market conditions improved. A Cycle-Level Indicator, Not a Trading Signal It is critical to view this development through a long-term lens. Signals like this are not designed for short-term trades or precise market timing. Instead, they help define where an asset sits within its broader cycle. As Steph noted, these conditions tend to mark structural lows rather than short-lived opportunities. As XRP continues to trade within a compressed range, the reappearance of this rare high-timeframe signal suggests the market may be closer to exhaustion than to renewed decline, reinforcing the case for patience over prediction.

Although the momentum has slowed, data sources indicate continued buying by high-capital participants. Large ETH Holders Increase Positions On-chain data shows a rapid rise in ETH balances held by wallets controlling between 10,000 and 100,000 tokens. Combined holdings for this group rose from roughly 17–18 million coins to more than 21 million ETH within a short period. The speed of the increase stands out when compared with earlier market phases. Crypto analyst Joseph Young noted that “ whale accumulation of ETH is at an ALL-TIME HIGH. ” The data suggests this accumulation is taking place outside of peak price conditions. This group of holders is typically linked to funds, long-term entities, and high-net-worth participants rather than short-term traders. gm whale accumulation of ETH is at an ALL-TIME HIGH. conviction capital sees ethereum: > securing 68.2% of all DeFi TVL > DATs aggressively stacking ETH > issuing 64.44% of all stablecoins > institutions like JPM building directly on ethereum believe in ETH. pic.twitter.com/h99psHjHQR — Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) December 24, 2025 Meanwhile, Ethereum continues to account for most on-chain financial activity. Conviction Capital data shows the network holds 68% of total DeFi value locked and issues over 64% of all stablecoins. Large financial firms, including JPMorgan, are also building infrastructure directly on Ethereum, adding to long-term usage of the network. Recent disclosures point to growing institutional exposure to Ethereum. Tom Lee’s firm, Bitmine Immersion Technologies, added 98,852 ETH to its balance sheet over the past week. According to Maartunn, ETH purchases linked to Lee totaled approximately $953 million this month, exceeding the amount recorded in November. ETH Supply on Exchanges Keeps Falling CryptoQuant data shows Ethereum exchange reserves declined from about 20.8 million tokens to around 16.4 million over the past year. This reflects net outflows of roughly 4.4 million ETH from centralized trading platforms. Ethereum Exchange Reserve 24.12. Source: CryptoQuant The reduction in exchange balances continued even during recent price pullbacks. This suggests ETH is being moved into self-custody, staking contracts, or long-term storage rather than prepared for immediate sale. When viewed alongside rising whale balances, the data points to steady supply absorption. Price Holds Near Key Technical Levels Ethereum is trading at about $2,940, with modest weekly gains and lower daily momentum. Analysts note that the price is approaching the 200-week exponential moving average, a level often watched during extended consolidations. CryptoPulse stated that “a strong bounce from that level would help maintain the structure,” while a loss could open a move toward the $2,000–$2,100 range. Separately, CryptoWZRD also noted that holding above $3,060 could allow short-term upside, while $2,800 remains a key support zone.

The platform stated it has resolved the issue and that no lingering risks remain. According to user reports on social media, the issue appears to have affected users who signed up for Polymarket through Magic Labs, which lets users sign in via email addresses and creates non-custodial Ethereum wallets. Magic Labs sign-up is widely used by first-time crypto users who do not already have digital asset wallets. Polymarket users confirm that their wallets have been hacked The compromise news came last month. One of the senior traders stated that hackers have been using the Polymarket comment section to run a scam. As reported by Cryptopolitan, he claimed that users have lost over $500,000. During the weekend, 23pds, SlowMist’s Chief Information Security Officer, retweeted a warning from a community user about a malicious code in a Polymarket copy-trading bot on GitHub, posing security risks. Reports of account hacks surfaced again earlier this week on X and Reddit, as affected users took to social media to detail their losses. “Today I woke up and see 3 attempts to login to polymarket — My device isn’t compromised, google found nothing suspicious, all other services are fine. “So I went to Polymarket and realized that all my deals were closed and balance is $0.01,” the victim wrote . Polymarket trader’s explanation of the bleach. Source: Reddit Another user in the comment section claimed to have experienced a similar security breach, receiving three attempted login notifications before funds were drained from their Polymarket account. The victim claims that he did not click any links and had two-factor authentication enabled on their email. In response, Polymarket acknowledged the security issue on its official Discord channel. “We recently identified and resolved a security issue affecting a small number of users The issue was caused by a vulnerability introduced by a third-party authentication provider […] We will be in contact with impacted users,” Polymarket wrote . Polymarket’s AI support blames Polygon According to one user, when he reached out to the Polymarket team, they answered that Polygon was responsible. “First line AI support told me it’s issue with Polygon what is obviously a bullshit. Then human gave me instructions how to check where my funds went to,” the trader wrote. This follows news from Mustafa, a member of the Polymarket team, that the company plans to migrate from Polygon and launch an Ethereum Layer 2 network called POLY, which is the project’s current top priority. Polymarket is gradually growing into a new behemoth with its entrance into the US market. The platform has recorded 419,309 active users this month , a total number of transactions is at 19.63 million, and the total trading volume sits at $1.538 billion. Additionally, in 2025, the Polygon mainnet experienced 15 different network anomalies, maintenance events, or outages, some of which caused delays in Polymarket’s order matching. The most recent outage occurred on December 18. Also, the relatively weak ecosystem has objectively become a limitation. This, however, will affect the Polygon network. Defillama data shows that all positions on the Polymarket platform are worth about $326 million right now. This is a quarter of the $1.19 billion that is locked up on the Polygon network. Additionally, Coin Metrics stated that Polymarket transactions used about 25% of Polygon’s overall network gas. Statistics on Dune also show that transactions related to Polymarket used about $216,000 in gas in November. Token Terminal statistics show that Polygon used about $939,000 in gas in the same month, which is approximately 23%.

Generally, SHIB has had a difficult year, dropping nearly 70%, with technical indicators adding to the bearish outlook. Notably, the token formed its first-ever weekly death cross this year, signaling potential downside risks. As of press time, SHIB was trading at $0.00000711, down 0.2% over the past 24 hours, while losses on the weekly timeframe exceeded 10%. SHIB seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At its current valuation, Shiba Inu is trading below its 50-day Simple Moving Average ( SMA ) of $0.000008648, pointing to short-term bearish pressure and continued downside momentum. However, the token remains well above its 200-day SMA of $0.000001155, indicating that the longer-term trend remains positive when viewed against earlier low-price periods. The 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 34.56, placing SHIB in neutral territory but with a bearish tilt. This suggests the asset is neither overbought nor oversold, though it is approaching levels that could precede either a rebound or further weakness. SHIB price prediction Looking ahead to the first day of 2026, the Finbold AI model projects a cautiously optimistic price path based on short-term predictive analytics and technical indicators. The model forecasts SHIB trading at an average price of $0.0000072933, representing a potential upside of about 2.6% from the reference price at the time of the forecast. While the projection window covers late December, it is intended as an early directional signal for SHIB’s performance heading into 2026. It’s worth noting that the Finbold AI model aggregates forecasts from several large language models. Among these, Claude Sonnet 4 offered the most bullish outlook, projecting SHIB at $0.00000768, implying upside of just over 8%. Gemini 2.5 Flash presented a more conservative scenario, forecasting a slight dip to $0.00000705, while GPT-4o pointed to a modest increase toward $0.00000715. SHIB AI price prediction. Source: Finbold From a technical standpoint, the model factored in indicators such as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence and the Relative Strength Index. These signals point to subdued momentum but suggest signs of stabilization following recent weakness. Overall, the Finbold AI model indicates that Shiba Inu may enter 2026 with a mild upward bias rather than a strong breakout. However, the token’s trajectory will largely depend on broader crypto market sentiment, which remains under pressure as prices stay in the red and bullish participation remains muted.

The man had never met President Donald Trump. He wasn’t part of the tech leaders parade that flew in to make nice with the White House. But none of that mattered by August. Trump woke up angry, opened Truth Social, and posted : “The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately.” The attack came at 4:39 AM Washington time, and the target was a man with more than 600 investments in China, some allegedly tied to the military. Within weeks, Lip-Bu was in the Oval Office, flipping that insult into a $5.7 billion deal. The U.S. would become Intel’s largest shareholder . “Make Intel great again,” he said after the meeting, repeating Trump’s signature line, on camera no less. What happened in those 40 minutes changed everything for Intel. Tan used connections to flip the narrative Born in Muar, Malaysia, and raised by a newspaper editor dad and university warden mom, Lip-Bu built his life with a weird mix of physics, nuclear engineering, and venture capital, not exactly the usual recipe for leading one of America’s most broken chipmakers. Before his big sit-down with Trump, Lip-Bu called in favors. Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang spoke to Trump or his aides to vouch for him. Reuters alleges Lip-Bu also huddled with his team to craft a strategy: show his American loyalty, explain his Malaysian-Chinese roots, walk through his U.S. education, and address his China ties head-on. A spokesperson from Celesta Capital, one of Lip-Bu’s companies, confirmed it had made one China investment, exited in 2020. But Walden International and Walden Catalyst, his other firms, stayed silent. Intel’s own spokesperson claimed Lip-Bu had always engaged with Washington: “Lip-Bu Tan has a long, and well-established history of engagement in Washington, both before and after joining Intel.” Still, he had left Intel’s top government affairs role unfilled for months. The previous policy lead, a Democrat, had quit. Inside the Oval Office, Trump wasn’t alone. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent joined the meeting. Trump grilled Lip-Bu about Intel’s turnaround plan. A person familiar with the meeting alleged that Lip-Bu told them he didn’t want cash handouts from the CHIPS Act , even though Intel qualified for billions. Instead, when Trump floated the idea of the government getting equity in exchange for CHIPS Act money, Lip-Bu agreed. That turned into a $5.7 billion investment and a nearly 10% stake. Howard later said in a video, “Equity made the exchange fair.” Trump posted a fake image of himself watching Intel’s stock climb and wrote that the U.S. stake had already jumped 50% after the Nvidia partnership was announced. Inside Intel, Tan is cutting hard and fast Lip-Bu is not trying to be popular inside Intel. According to filings, he’s cutting 15% of Intel staff, mostly managers. He bypassed middle layers to speak directly with engineers. He made Pushkar Ranade, a long-time Intel engineer, his chief of staff and then interim CTO. Lip-Bu also kept one foot in his investment world. He still checks with his venture teams when Intel’s venture arm looks at deals, according to one former employee. Intel’s board clashed with him over one recent deal because of conflicts tied to his portfolio, Reuters reported. Intel updated his contract to require only “such time as is necessary,” unlike his predecessor’s full-time clause. Celesta Capital says his time with them is now “minimal.” Lip-Bu joined Intel’s board in 2022. When he took over as CEO, the company had about 100,000 workers and was bleeding money to build chip factories. That buildout had started under Pat Gelsinger, the previous CEO. Intel needed more than $20 billion to stay competitive in chip manufacturing. Sources allegedly said Lip-Bu called Amazon and Google to ask what kind of chips they needed. He even floated buying SambaNova, a startup that makes specialized AI chips, but some execs pushed back, saying the market favored general-purpose chips. Still, Intel says Lip-Bu is deep in the tech. “Lip-Bu is deeply involved in technical decisions, including product roadmaps,” the company said. “He’s helping to restore speed, accountability, and create an engineering-centric, customer-focused culture.” The U.S. bet gives Intel new leverage in the chip war The U.S. investment turned Intel into a political chip. Trump’s administration said, “The deal with Intel is one of many initiatives to reshore semiconductor and other critical manufacturing back to the United States.” That might not comfort foreign chipmakers who fear the U.S. will pressure buyers to work with Intel. Howard now picks up every call about Intel, and he believes that Americans “have skin in the game” for Intel’s foundry deals to succeed. Intel got more than just the White House check. In the same week, SoftBank, led by Masayoshi Son, announced a $2 billion investment. Lip-Bu had previously sat on SoftBank’s board. Intel’s 18A process, a next-gen manufacturing tech, still isn’t working well enough. Nvidia tested it but didn’t move forward, two sources said. “We are focused on collaborations,” Lip-Bu told reporters during the announcement of the Nvidia deal. Intel claims its next node, 14A, is on track and getting attention from customers. But Intel needs more than attention. It needs orders. Uncle Sam’s bet on Intel is both industrial policy and political gamble. But for now, it’s working: Intel’s stock is up 80% since Lip-Bu stepped in, outpacing the S&P 500 and even Nvidia.",OP-ED|Intel|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-24 13:30:08

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-just-got-handed-a-compliance-cheat-code-heres-the-latest/,"A section of the U.S. tax policy draft has caught the attention of the pseudonymous Financial expert X Finance Bull, who believes it could mark an important step toward mainstream adoption of blockchain-based payments. The image of the document captioned in the post outlines the proposed treatment for small digital asset transactions. While technical in nature, X Finance Bull argues that its implications could reshape how regulated stablecoins and XRP fit into the evolving financial system. BOOM! $XRP just got handed a compliance cheat code U.S. tax draft removes capital gains under $200 for regulated stablecoins, perfect setup for $RLUSD as spendable cash With Ripple rails beneath it and XRP as bridge asset, this puts TradFi directly on crypto rails LFG! https://t.co/jDTUJot5RX pic.twitter.com/LPQJfnQrua — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) December 21, 2025 The $200 Threshold for Stablecoin Transactions According to the draft language cited in the images, policymakers are considering a per-transaction de minimis threshold of $200 for regulated payment stablecoins. Under this framework, capital gains below that amount would not be recognized for tax purposes. The intent, as described in the explanatory note, is to eliminate the burden of tracking low-value gains arising from routine consumer payments, similar to existing treatment for small foreign currency transactions. X Finance Bull presents this as a practical compliance pathway that could remove one of the biggest obstacles to everyday crypto usage in the United States. He stresses that by simplifying tax treatment for small purchases, regulators would make it more feasible for stablecoins to function as true payment instruments rather than purely speculative assets. RLUSD and Ripple’s Payment Rails Building on this policy direction, X Finance Bull connects the proposal to RLUSD, Ripple’s regulated stablecoin . He argues that a framework designed specifically for compliant payment stablecoins creates an ideal environment for RLUSD to operate as a digital cash equivalent. In his view, this would allow consumers and institutions to transact on-chain while remaining within established regulatory boundaries. He further points to Ripple’s payment infrastructure as the foundation that could support this model. By providing the rails for settlement and liquidity, Ripple’s network, he suggests, enables traditional financial institutions to access blockchain technology without abandoning the structures they already rely on. XRP’s Role as a Bridge Asset Within this setup, X Finance Bull highlights XRP as the bridge asset that connects liquidity between different currencies and networks. Rather than focusing on market price, he emphasizes utility, arguing that XRP’s purpose in facilitating efficient transfers becomes more relevant as regulated stablecoins move across compliant rails. From his perspective, this positions XRP as a functional link between traditional finance and digital asset ecosystems. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Toward TradFi on Crypto Infrastructure The draft also references future regulations and guidance, including anti-abuse rules, recordkeeping standards, and treatment of mixed transactions. X Finance Bull interprets this as evidence that U.S. policymakers are laying the groundwork for a structured, long-term framework for digital payments. While acknowledging that the language remains under technical review, X Finance Bull frames the proposal as a signal that traditional finance may soon operate more directly on crypto infrastructure.

A striking new trend suggests it might. Recent data reveals a dramatic shift: Bitcoin whale deposits to major exchange Binance were cut in half during December. This significant slowdown in large-scale investor movements could be the hopeful signal the market has been waiting for, hinting at a potential period of stabilization for BTC. What Do the Bitcoin Whale Deposit Numbers Actually Show? CryptoQuant analyst Darkpost provided a clear snapshot of the change. In a detailed market analysis, they noted that monthly Bitcoin whale deposits to Binance plummeted from a staggering $7.88 billion to $3.86 billion. This 50% reduction is not just a minor fluctuation; it’s a substantial decline in the volume of BTC being moved by large holders onto a platform where it is typically sold. Think of these deposits as a gauge of potential selling supply. When whales move coins to an exchange, it often precedes a sale. Therefore, a sharp drop in these inflows suggests there is less BTC waiting in the exchange’s queue to hit the market. This directly translates to reduced immediate sell pressure. Why Is This Slowdown in Whale Activity So Significant? For months, the crypto market has watched whale movements with a mix of anxiety and anticipation. Large transactions can cause sharp price volatility. The current trend, however, points toward calmer waters. The analyst explained that this slowdown indicates a corresponding decrease in the supply of BTC poised for sale. This development is crucial for several reasons: Market Sentiment: It suggests large investors may be adopting a ‘hold’ strategy rather than a ‘sell’ strategy. Price Stability: With fewer massive sell orders looming, the market has more room to find a stable footing. Reduced Volatility: Fewer large, unexpected deposits mean fewer triggers for sudden price dips. Should We Still Be Cautious About Bitcoin Whale Movements? While the overall trend is positive, the analysis offers a note of caution. Darkpost pointed out that whales holding between 100 and 10,000 BTC still deposited a notable $466 million worth of Bitcoin in December. This means the possibility of large-scale movements remains on the table. However, the key takeaway is one of proportion and trend. The analyst concluded that while significant deposits can still trigger volatility, the current, broader trend of reduced inflows is relatively favorable for the market in the short term . In the world of crypto analysis, fewer coins moving from cold wallets to hot exchanges is generally interpreted as a bullish, or at least stabilizing, signal. What Does This Mean for the Average Bitcoin Investor? For everyday investors, this shift in Bitcoin whale deposits is an important piece of the puzzle. It doesn’t guarantee a price surge, but it does suggest one major source of downward pressure may be lessening. This can create a more predictable environment. Consider these actionable insights: Monitor the Trend: Watch if this reduction in exchange inflows continues into the new year. Context is Key: Combine this data with other metrics like trading volume and macroeconomic factors. Avoid Reactionary Moves: This is a positive signal, not a surefire prediction. Maintain a disciplined investment strategy. A Hopeful Horizon for Bitcoin’s Market Stability The halving of Bitcoin whale deposits to Binance is a compelling development. It paints a picture of large holders potentially settling in, which could allow the market to breathe and build a stronger foundation. While the specter of whale sales will always exist, the current data provides a hopeful glimpse of easing sell pressure and the potential for a more stable period ahead for Bitcoin. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What are Bitcoin whale deposits? A: Bitcoin whale deposits refer to large transfers of BTC, typically from private wallets to cryptocurrency exchanges, made by entities holding substantial amounts (often thousands of coins). These movements are closely watched as they can signal intent to sell. Q: Why does a decrease in whale deposits to Binance matter? A: Binance is a major trading platform. A decrease in large deposits means less Bitcoin is being moved into a position where it can be easily sold immediately, suggesting reduced imminent selling pressure from major players. Q: Does this mean the Bitcoin price will definitely go up? A> Not necessarily. While reduced sell pressure is a positive factor, price is influenced by many elements like demand, global regulations, and macroeconomic trends. This is one indicator among many. Q: Who is a ‘whale’ in cryptocurrency terms? A: A ‘whale’ is an individual or organization that holds a large enough amount of a cryptocurrency that their trades can significantly influence the market price. For Bitcoin, this often means holders of 1,000 BTC or more. Q: Where can I track Bitcoin whale activity? A: Several blockchain analytics platforms like CryptoQuant, Glassnode, and Whale Alert provide data and alerts on large cryptocurrency transactions.

Large projects grow, mature, and slow. At the same time, new protocols begin building quietly before broader attention arrives. Analysts often look for these early transition moments, when fundamentals improve faster than price reflects. This is why comparisons to early AAVE and early XRP are starting to appear again. Both assets delivered their strongest growth when they were still small, utility was forming, and market expectations were low. Today, a new DeFi crypto is being discussed in similar terms. That project is Mutuum Finance. Ripple (XRP) Ripple remains one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the market. Its market cap is still above $30B, placing it among the most established digital assets. XRP’s early years were defined by rapid price expansion, strong narratives, and wide exchange adoption. Many early holders benefited from that phase. However, market size changes behavior. XRP now faces repeated resistance around the $3 level. Each attempt to move higher requires very large capital inflows. Liquidity is deep, but upside is capped compared to smaller assets. Because of this, many analysts describe XRP’s near term outlook as limited. Price models into 2026 often suggest moderate upside rather than explosive growth. This does not make XRP weak, but it does change its role. It is now seen more as a mature asset than a high growth crypto. Aave (AAVE) Aave is one of the most respected DeFi protocols in the market. Its market cap remains in the multi billion dollar range. Early AAVE investors saw massive gains when lending was still new and DeFi adoption was accelerating. That early surge came when Aave was building its core lending utility and attracting users before becoming a dominant platform. Today, AAVE is far past that stage. Growth is stable, but price expansion is slower. Resistance zones have formed as valuation has increased. For AAVE to deliver another major breakout, it would require a new wave of users or a major shift in market structure. Because of this, some investors are no longer looking at AAVE for early stage growth. Instead, they are searching for a new crypto that resembles AAVE before it became large. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is an Ethereum based DeFi crypto focused on lending and borrowing. The protocol allows users to supply assets to earn yield while borrowers access liquidity by locking collateral. This creates a cycle of usage tied to real demand. What makes MUTM stand out in comparisons is timing. The token is currently priced at $0.04 and has progressed through multiple early distribution phases. Since Phase 1, MUTM has recorded a 300% increase. Phase 6 is now over 99%, and allocation continues to tighten. Over $19.4M has been raised, and the holder base has grown to more than 18,600 wallets. The total supply is capped at 4B tokens, with 45.5% or 1.82B tokens allocated to early distribution. A large portion of this allocation is already distributed. Presale data is often overlooked, but analysts see it as crucial for trust. It shows how demand developed over time, how supply was released, and how participation expanded. In MUTM’s case, growth has been steady rather than sudden, which often signals accumulation instead of short term speculation. V1 is approaching , according to official project updates. This matters because it marks the shift from preparation to live usage, a stage where many DeFi protocols see changes in valuation behavior. How MUTM’s Mechanics Create Contrast One key difference lies in mtTokens. When users supply assets to Mutuum Finance, they receive mtTokens that grow in value as interest accrues. These tokens are designed to encourage holding and long term participation. They are not built for fast trading. The protocol will also use a buy and distribute model. A portion of protocol revenue is used to buy MUTM from the market and redistribute it to mtToken holders. This links token demand directly to usage, not hype. Oracles play a role as well. Accurate price feeds are essential for lending protocols. They support fair liquidations and predictable borrowing terms. This reduces risk and supports stable growth over time. In contrast, XRP does not have built in mechanisms that tie token demand to protocol revenue. AAVE does, but at a much larger scale where growth is slower. MUTM sits between these two stages, early enough to grow but structured enough to manage risk. Analysts who compare these assets often point to this difference. MUTM resembles early AAVE in structure, but with a smaller valuation profile. Compared to XRP, it does not require massive liquidity to move. Stablecoin and Layer 2 Plans and Why They Matter Mutuum Finance also plans to introduce a stablecoin backed by borrower interest. This could expand usage by offering a predictable asset within the ecosystem. Stable assets often increase daily activity in lending protocols. Layer 2 expansion is another important factor. Lower fees and faster transactions make lending more accessible. This can increase participation and reduce friction for users. Together, these elements matter because they prepare the protocol for scale. Many early DeFi projects struggled because they grew before infrastructure was ready. MUTM is building these layers first. Why Analysts See a Familiar Setup When analysts reference early AAVE or early XRP, they are not suggesting identical outcomes. They are highlighting similar stages in the lifecycle. Small market cap, expanding participation, defined utility, and approaching activation. With Phase 6 active, V1 approaching, and usage mechanics already defined, Mutuum Finance is entering the part of the cycle where expectations often shift. This is why some describe it as a top crypto to watch or a new crypto with asymmetric potential. Whether MUTM delivers a 750% move will depend on adoption and execution. What is clear is why it is now being compared to earlier growth phases of AAVE and XRP, rather than their current forms.

For the week ending December 20th, new applications for unemployment benefits fell to 214,000, decisively beating economist forecasts of 224,000. This unexpected strength sends a powerful signal about the economy’s resilience as we head into the new year. For investors and everyday Americans alike, understanding this data is crucial for navigating the financial landscape ahead. What Do These Initial Jobless Claims Numbers Actually Mean? Let’s break it down simply. Initial jobless claims are a weekly report that counts the number of people filing for unemployment benefits for the first time. Think of it as a real-time pulse check on the labor market’s health. When this number falls, as it just did, it indicates fewer people are being laid off. Employers are holding onto their workforce, which is a strong sign of economic confidence. Therefore, the drop to 214,000 is more than just a statistic; it’s a testament to underlying economic stability. Why Should You Care About This Labor Market Data? You might wonder how a weekly unemployment figure impacts you. The answer lies in its far-reaching implications. This data is a key input for the Federal Reserve when making decisions about interest rates. A strong labor market, signaled by low initial jobless claims , gives the Fed less reason to cut rates quickly, as it fights to control inflation. This, in turn, affects everything from mortgage rates and car loans to the returns on your savings account and the performance of your investment portfolio. Moreover, this report contradicts narratives of an imminent economic slowdown. The consistent low level of claims suggests businesses are not battening down the hatches, which bodes well for: Consumer Spending: Employed people spend money, driving economic growth. Corporate Earnings: Stable workforces support productivity and profits. Market Sentiment: Strong data can bolster investor confidence. How Does This Impact the Federal Reserve’s Next Move? This is where the rubber meets the road. The Federal Reserve has been walking a tightrope, trying to cool inflation without freezing the job market. The latest initial jobless claims data shows the labor market remains remarkably tight. For the Fed, this is a double-edged sword. It’s positive that the economy isn’t cracking, but it also means wage pressures could persist, making the “last mile” of inflation fighting more challenging. Consequently, this report supports the case for the Fed to maintain a “higher for longer” stance on interest rates in the near term. Actionable Insights: What Can You Do With This Information? Knowledge is power, but only if you use it. Here’s how you can apply this understanding of the initial jobless claims trend: For Savers: With interest rates likely to stay elevated, high-yield savings accounts and CDs remain attractive. For Investors: A resilient economy supports corporate earnings. Consider sectors that benefit from sustained consumer strength. For Job Seekers: The data indicates employers are still hiring. It’s a favorable environment to explore new opportunities or negotiate. For Homebuyers: Be prepared for mortgage rates to potentially remain volatile, as the Fed’s path is still data-dependent. The Bottom Line: A Labor Market Defying Expectations The unexpected drop in initial jobless claims to 214,000 is a clear economic bright spot. It underscores a labor market that continues to defy recession fears and demonstrates foundational strength. While this complicates the Federal Reserve’s immediate policy decisions, it ultimately paints a picture of an economy on solid footing. For everyone from policymakers to Main Street, this data is a reminder of the U.S. economy’s enduring capacity for resilience. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What are initial jobless claims? A: Initial jobless claims are the number of people who file for unemployment benefits for the first time each week. It’s a key leading indicator of labor market health. Q: Why is the number 214,000 significant? A: It was significantly lower than the 224,000 forecast by economists, indicating far fewer layoffs than expected and pointing to stronger labor market conditions. Q: How does this data affect the stock market? A: It can have a mixed effect. Strong data suggests a healthy economy, which is good for corporate profits. However, it can also lead to fears that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates high for longer, which can pressure stock valuations. Q: What does this mean for future interest rates? A: A strong labor market reduces the urgency for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. This data supports the view that rate cuts may come later rather than sooner. Q: Where can I find this data each week? A: The U.S. Department of Labor releases the report every Thursday morning at 8:30 AM Eastern Time. It is widely covered by financial news outlets. Q: Has the trend been consistently low? A> Yes. Despite some weekly volatility, initial jobless claims have remained historically low for an extended period, highlighting the unusual strength of the post-pandemic labor market recovery.

Meanwhile, these tokens have seen a heavy dump in 2025. Over the past week, Hayes purchased around 1.22 million ENA, the native token of Ethena. He went long on Pendle and bought 137,117 tokens of it. The governance token of EtherFi stood out to be his other choice as he added 132,730 ETHFI to his bag. The combined value of those purchases stood under $650,000. The timing is notable as all three tokens are down between 80% and 90% from their respective highs. ENA price is down by a huge 78% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis. It is trading at an average price of $0.199 at press time. Pendle price shows a similar pattern and is down by 65% on YTD. The same is with ETHFI, it is running down by 69% in the same period. Arthur Hayes builds $48M USDC war chest Hayes has been open and out about the rationale behind the shift. In recent posts, he said he is rotating out of Ether and into what he described as “high-quality DeFi names.” He argued that these assets stand to outperform if global liquidity conditions ease. This view stands totally apart from his bullish outlook on Ethereum. He has publicly suggested that ETH could eventually trade as high as $20,000. However, Hayes also had claimed that holding 50 Ether could be life-changing by the next US presidential election. Ethereum price has slumped by more than 25% over the last 60 days.

Recent technical analysis has focused on specific price levels that could influence future movement. They suggest that a shift in broader crypto momentum, combined with a crucial Fibonacci level reclaim, may set the stage for a renewed, explosive upside for DOGE. Dogecoin Price Faces Key Test At $0.138 Dogecoin has been trending downwards for months now, as it faces pressure from ongoing volatility and an overall market slowdown. Although DOGE’s price remains below $0.13 after declining consistently over the past few months, crypto market analyst Kevin has outlined conditions under which the meme coin’s price could recover and see a strong upside soon. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Bitcoin Make Or Break Level Amid Campaign For $90,000 In an X post on Tuesday, Kevin pointed to the $0.138 level as a critical area that must be reclaimed on a strong higher time frame three-day to one week closes. According to his view, such a move would mark a meaningful shift in Dogecoin’s momentum and signal renewed strength after an extended period of consolidation. He also disclosed that a recovery would open the door to a potentially massive price rally for the meme coin. The analyst explained that reclaiming the $0.138 level would place Dogecoin back above a key macro Fibonacci retracement around 0.382. This Fibonacci level has acted as an important dividing line between bearish and bullish market phases in the past. As a result, a move above it could suggest that long-term buyers are regaining control. Kevin also emphasized the significance of the 200-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the chart, noting that it often serves as a key support or resistance level during significant trend changes. A decisive move above this key level would validate the analyst’s bullish perspective, signaling that Dogecoin could be nearing the end of its correction and preparing to transition into a stronger market phase. Notably, once this structural change occurs, Kevin’s chart points to the next major liquidity and resistance zone, which sits around $0.46. Dogecoin Price Rally Tied To Bitcoin’s Momentum In his accompanying chart, Kevin shows that Dogecoin is currently trading sideways within what appears to be a DCA zone. This range reflects extended consolidation where price has failed to make a decisive move in either direction. Related Reading: Analyst Shares ‘Cold, Hard Truth’ For Bitcoin Investors As Price Struggles The chart setup suggests that any meaningful breakout in Dogecoin’s price would likely coincide with renewed strength in Bitcoin. Kevin notes that Bitcoin reclaiming the $88,000 to $91,000 region could support bullish momentum across the crypto market and influence a potential price rally for Dogecoin. A move toward this range would require the leading cryptocurrency to rally by approximately 2-6% from its present price level. Without that confirmation, the analyst believes that DOGE may continue consolidating within its current narrow range.

As price action compresses and volatility lingers, the market is once again testing the patience of both traders and long-term holders. History shows that XRP often makes its most consequential moves when confidence is split, and at such moments, acting too early can be just as costly as acting too late. This is why confirmation, not anticipation, is increasingly becoming the dominant theme among technical observers. That perspective was recently reinforced by ChartNerd, a technical analyst widely followed for XRP and altcoin market structure analysis. His latest assessment focuses on XRP’s interaction with a long-standing price level that has repeatedly shaped the asset’s trend behavior over multiple market cycles. $XRP : Wait For Confirmation FIRST pic.twitter.com/a6Pjaf8LSW — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) December 23, 2025 A Key Support Level Under Pressure On the daily XRP/USD chart, price is currently testing a clearly defined horizontal support zone around $1.89. This level has served as a structural pivot since late 2022, repeatedly acting as both resistance and support during major market transitions. Following a dip below $1.90 on December 23, 2025, XRP has hovered tightly around this zone, placing the market at a decisive technical junction. The importance of this level lies not only in its price value but in its historical consistency. Each prior interaction with this zone has produced a meaningful directional move , making it a reference point for both buyers and sellers. As a result, the market’s response here is unlikely to be inconsequential. Why Confirmation Is Critical Right Now According to ChartNerd’s analysis, the current environment is particularly vulnerable to false signals. Year-end trading conditions are typically defined by reduced liquidity, tax-related positioning, and broader market de-risking. These factors often create exaggerated intraday moves that lack follow-through, trapping traders who react to price alone without confirmation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 From a technical standpoint, confirmation comes through a strong daily candle close that decisively holds above support or breaks below it with continuation. Without such validation, price action remains unresolved, and any move may simply reflect temporary volatility rather than a true shift in trend. Bullish Reclaim or Structural Breakdown If XRP successfully reclaims the $1.89 level with a firm daily close and follow-up strength, it would reinforce the support’s validity and potentially open the door to a recovery toward the low-to-mid $2 range. This outcome would suggest that buyers are still defending key structure despite broader market pressure. On the other hand, a sustained breakdown below this zone would signal a loss of structural support, increasing the probability of further downside as price searches for the next demand area. In that scenario, waiting for confirmation becomes even more essential, as failed support often accelerates sell-side momentum. Discipline Over Prediction The broader message from ChartNerd’s outlook is clear: this is not a moment for impulsive positioning. In a market shaped by uncertainty and thin liquidity, confirmation acts as protection against emotional decision-making. For XRP holders navigating this critical phase, patience may ultimately prove to be the most strategic choice.

This move, reported by Cointelegraph, goes beyond a simple market transaction; it strikes at the heart of what makes decentralized finance trustworthy. The core question now is whether this action strengthens alignment with the community or represents a dangerous concentration of Aave governance power. What Does the $10 Million AAVE Purchase Really Mean for Aave Governance? Stani Kulechov framed his substantial purchase as a move to align his interests with those of AAVE token holders. However, critics and experts like DeFi analyst Robert Mullins see a different motive. They argue the timing suggests an effort to bolster voting power ahead of critical proposals. This situation exposes a potential flaw where those with significant capital can disproportionately influence the Aave governance process, potentially at the expense of smaller holders. Why Is Concentrated Voting Power a Problem in DeFi? True decentralized governance relies on distributed decision-making. When voting power becomes too concentrated, the system risks becoming centralized in practice, even if it’s decentralized in name. This incident raises several critical concerns for Aave governance and similar DeFi projects: Fairness: Does one entity’s financial capacity give them an unfair advantage in steering the protocol’s future? Resilience: Is the protocol’s design robust enough to withstand what some call “governance attacks” or strategic voting accumulation? Trust: Can the community trust that proposals are evaluated on merit rather than the weight of a few large wallets? Mullins describes this as a clear example of a token’s design failing to adequately defend against such scenarios, highlighting a need for structural safeguards. Can Aave Governance Be Fixed? Exploring Potential Solutions This controversy is not an endpoint but a crucial learning moment. It forces the community to examine how to build more resilient and fair governance models. The path forward likely involves innovative mechanisms to balance influence. Potential solutions the Aave governance community might consider include: Time-locked voting power: Weighting votes based on how long tokens have been staked, not just the raw amount held. Quadratic voting models: Making the cost of additional voting power increase exponentially, reducing the impact of massive purchases. Enhanced delegation systems: Encouraging broader participation by making it easier for small holders to delegate votes to trusted experts. The goal is to design systems where commitment and long-term alignment matter more than momentary financial firepower. The High-Stakes Future of Decentralized Decision-Making The debate over Kulechov’s purchase is a microcosm of a larger struggle in DeFi: the quest for legitimate, decentralized authority. How Aave and other protocols navigate these Aave governance challenges will set a precedent. The outcome will determine whether DeFi can mature into a system truly governed by its many users or if it will quietly revert to control by a wealthy few. The community’s response to this event will be a defining test of its principles. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly did the Aave founder do? A: Stani Kulechov purchased $10 million worth of AAVE tokens. While he stated it was to align with token holders, critics believe it was to increase his voting power on upcoming governance proposals. Q: Why is this purchase controversial for Aave governance? A: It raises concerns about “governance attacks,” where individuals or entities can buy significant voting power to influence decisions, potentially undermining the decentralized and fair nature of the protocol. Q: What is a “governance attack”? A: It refers to a situation where an actor accumulates enough governance tokens to single-handedly or disproportionately sway the outcome of community votes, often to serve their own interests rather than the protocol’s health. Q: Are there ways to prevent this in DeFi governance? A: Yes, potential solutions include implementing vote delegation, time-locked voting (where longer-held tokens have more weight), or quadratic voting models to reduce the power of large, sudden purchases. Q: Does this mean Aave governance is broken? A> Not necessarily. It highlights a vulnerability that exists in many token-based governance systems. The incident is a stress test that will likely lead to discussions and improvements in the protocol’s governance design. Q: What should AAVE token holders do now? A> Stay informed, participate in governance discussions, and vote on proposals. Community engagement is the best defense against centralized control and ensures the protocol evolves in a direction that benefits all stakeholders. This discussion about the future of Aave governance affects everyone in DeFi. Did you find this analysis insightful?

This came as the analyst provided a bullish outlook for the top meme coin and indicated that this was a good time for investors to buy DOGE. Dogecoin Cycle Fractal Shows DOGE’s Bull Run Is Imminent In an X post, Cryptollica indicated that Dogecoin was at the point before it begins its bull run, with the accompanying chart showing that the meme coin could still rally above $1. The analyst noted that the cycle fractal has repeated itself at the macro level, with their chart highlighting four distinct structural points. Related Reading: Dogecoin’s 53,000% Surge Shows Renewed Interest, But Why Is DOGE Price Lagging? Cryptollica revealed that Dogecoin is currently at Point 4 and that the structure is rhyming perfectly with the pre-bull run accumulation phases of the past. The analyst then broke down the patterns observed in this cycle fractal. The first is the ‘Rounding Bottoms,’ with Zones 1 and 2 being the “boredom phases” in which volatility died and smart money accumulated. Zone 2 is said to be the launchpad for the massive 2021 parabolic run for Dogecoin. Meanwhile, Zone 4 is the current price action, with Cryptollica noting that the same rounding-bottom formation is playing out. The analyst added that the DOGE price is stabilizing and forming a heavy base just like it did before the previous explosions. Cryptollica then highlighted Dogecoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), noting that the 32 level acts as a historical floor. The analyst explained that the DOGE price has formed a macro bottom every single time the weekly RSI touched or hovered near this baseline. The RSI is said to have reset back to this critical support level, indicating that sellers are exhausted and the momentum is primed to flip. DOGE Is In The “Golden Pocket” For Accumulation Cryptollica stated that the cycle fractal isn’t just random noise but a cyclical reset, as the chart suggests that Dogecoin is in the Golden Pocket for accumulation. The analyst further remarked that if the fractal plays out as it did in 2020, in Zone 2, then the current DOGE price action is simply the calm before the storm. Related Reading: Dogecoin Reclaiming $0.128 Support Could Signal The Perfect Chance For Long Positions Cryptollica again highlighted the technical structure, noting that a bullish rounding bottom was forming for Dogecoin while the RSI was at a historical oversold support level, which is a buy zone. The analyst declared that the spring is loading and that patience is required, but that the setup points to a major impulsive move that is on the horizon. In line with this, Cryptollica urged investors to “buy Dogecoin.” At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.127, down almost 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

According to data from Bloomberg, the ruble is trading close to levels last seen before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, and over the past twelve months, the gain is the biggest annual rise for the currency since at least 1994. Moscow had projected an average exchange rate of 91.2 per dollar for this year, instead, the ruble stayed strong even as oil prices weakened and new U.S. and European sanctions landed. That strength is now squeezing exporters because foreign revenue converts into fewer rubles. It is also tightening state finances at a time when war spending remains heavy. A major reason behind the rally is the collapse in demand for foreign currency inside Russia. Sanctions have reduced access to dollars and euros, cutting demand sharply. At the same time, the central bank kept borrowing costs extremely high. The key rate stayed at a record level from October last year through June before being cut by a total of five percentage points to 16%. Those rates pushed residents toward ruble deposits and bonds. Tight policy and state FX sales push the currency higher The Bank of Russia has also been active in the market, as its foreign exchange sales mirrored moves by the Finance Ministry, specifically when it started selling yuan and gold from the National Wellbeing Fund. The goal has been to replace lost energy income. Oil and gas revenues dropped 22% in the first eleven months of the year, according to data from Russia’s Finance Ministry, though despite that, the ruble is among the five best-performing global assets by spot return this year, behind platinum, silver, palladium, and gold. Inside the central bank, the strength has been welcomed as a tool against inflation. Elvira Nabiullina, Governor of the Bank of Russia, said the disinflationary impact of the stronger currency has not yet run its course. Her comments signaled that policymakers are not rushing to weaken the ruble, even as concerns build elsewhere in the economy. Economists warn a strong ruble risks stagflation as oil slides Economists at the Stolypin Institute for the Economy of Growth see growing danger. In a report released this month, they warned that a firm ruble combined with expensive credit could push the economy toward stagflation. The central bank now expects economic growth to slow to 0.5% to 1% this year, down sharply from 4.3% in 2024. The institute said the currency is now overvalued and damaging competitiveness. The report said Russia is “losing its natural advantages as an energy power, offering foreign consumers better conditions than domestic producers and worsening the country’s investment appeal.” The warning added pressure to a debate already underway in Moscow. Business leaders echoed that view. Alexander Shokhin, head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, said a weaker ruble would help exporters, the federal budget, and the wider economy. “A weaker ruble would benefit not only exporters and the budget, but the entire economy,” Alexander said in comments to RBC. The lobby group is scheduled to meet President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday to discuss economic issues. Oil markets remain a key risk. Brent crude rose for a sixth straight day on Wednesday, climbing 14 cents to $62.52 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate gained 23 cents to $58.61. Both contracts are up about 6% since December 16, when prices fell to near five-year lows. Still, oil has had a rough year. Brent is on track for a 16% annual decline, while WTI is down about 18%, marking their steepest yearly losses since 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic crushed global demand.

Here’s the Implication,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-enters-a-high-stakes-technical-phase-heres-the-implication/,"Markets rarely announce major trend shifts loudly. Instead, they whisper through higher-timeframe structures that only become obvious in hindsight. For XRP, that whisper is now coming from a chart timeframe that has historically defined its most consequential moves. As price action tightens and volatility compresses, a long-observed technical behavior is beginning to resurface—one that has repeatedly shaped XRP’s broader market cycles. A Repeating Pattern on the 3-Day Chart Recent analysis shared by STEPH IS CRYPTO has refocused attention on the 3-day XRP chart, where the EMA ribbon has acted as a reliable trend filter across multiple cycles. According to the data Steph highlighted, every instance where the EMA ribbon flipped bearish and price consistently held below it led to a sustained market decline rather than a brief pullback. These were not sharp downside wicks quickly reclaimed by buyers, but extended corrective phases that unfolded over several months. On the 3-day $XRP chart, every time the EMA ribbon flips bearish and price holds below it, a major drawdown follows. These moves weren’t quick wicks — they were multi-month trend declines, ranging from −27% to −66%, with deeper losses occurring when the ribbon stayed… pic.twitter.com/AASMM9eP5V — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 23, 2025 Historical Drawdowns Tell a Consistent Story Looking across XRP’s full trading history, the pattern has remained strikingly consistent. Once the EMA ribbon turned bearish on the 3-day timeframe, downside continuation followed with drawdowns ranging from roughly 27% to as deep as 66%. The severity of each decline closely correlated with how long the ribbon stayed bearish. Short-lived flips produced more modest corrections, while prolonged bearish alignment preceded XRP’s most aggressive multi-month downtrends. Importantly, this behavior has appeared across different market environments, including both broader crypto bear markets and mid-cycle corrections. To date, the signal has shown no confirmed exceptions, reinforcing its relevance as a structural trend indicator rather than a reactive trading tool. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why the EMA Ribbon Matters on Higher Timeframes The EMA ribbon on a 3-day chart filters out short-term volatility and speculative noise, making it especially useful for identifying dominant market control. When XRP trades below this ribbon, it suggests sellers are dictating market structure, often overpowering bullish narratives, partnerships, or isolated momentum bursts. This is why reclaiming the ribbon historically mattered more than short-term bounces that occurred beneath it. Unlike oscillators that reset frequently, this signal evolves slowly, giving it greater weight for investors tracking macro trend direction rather than day-to-day price fluctuations. What This Means for XRP Going Forward XRP now sits at a technically sensitive juncture. A decisive recovery above the EMA ribbon, followed by sustained acceptance, would weaken the bearish historical precedent and suggest a structural shift back toward trend stability. However, continued trading below the ribbon would align with past conditions that preceded prolonged corrective phases. While no indicator guarantees outcomes, the consistency of this signal across XRP’s history makes it difficult to ignore. At minimum, it signals that the market is entering a phase where patience, confirmation, and higher-timeframe awareness matter more than short-term optimism.

The European Union is implementing new crypto tax reporting rules , a move that will fundamentally change how digital asset transactions are monitored. This directive, known as DAC8, aims to bring transparency to the crypto space and ensure tax compliance across all 27 member states. If you hold or trade crypto in the EU, understanding these rules is crucial. What Are the New EU Crypto Tax Reporting Rules? The EU’s new framework, the DAC8 directive, mandates that all Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) report detailed user and transaction data to national tax authorities. This includes exchanges, wallet providers, and other platforms facilitating crypto transactions. The goal is to create a standardized system for tracking crypto gains and preventing tax evasion, similar to existing rules for traditional financial assets. However, the compliance deadline gives the industry time to adapt. While the rules take effect on January 1, 2025, CASPs have until July 1, 2026, to fully implement the necessary reporting systems. This phased approach acknowledges the technical challenges involved. How Do DAC8 Rules Differ from MiCA Regulation? It’s easy to confuse DAC8 with the EU’s other major crypto framework, MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets). However, they serve distinct purposes. Think of MiCA as the rulebook for how crypto companies can operate and offer services safely within the EU market. In contrast, the crypto tax reporting rules under DAC8 are solely concerned with financial transparency for tax collection. MiCA governs market conduct, licensing, and consumer protection. DAC8 focuses exclusively on tax reporting and information exchange between authorities. Both will run in parallel, creating a comprehensive regulatory environment for digital assets. What Powers Do Tax Authorities Gain Under DAC8? One of the most powerful aspects of the new crypto tax reporting rules is the extended reach granted to tax authorities. DAC8 empowers them to act against suspected tax evasion with new tools. Crucially, authorities can now freeze or seize crypto assets linked to unpaid taxes, even if the assets are held on a platform outside the user’s home country. This cross-border enforcement capability closes a significant loophole. Previously, users could potentially shield assets by using foreign exchanges. Under DAC8, if a tax authority in France detects evasion, it can request action against assets held on an exchange in Germany or beyond, provided the platform falls under the EU’s jurisdiction. What Does This Mean for Crypto Users and Businesses? For everyday crypto users in the EU, the main change will be increased paperwork for their service providers. You can expect platforms to request more detailed identification and transaction information to comply with these crypto tax reporting rules . Your trading and holding data will be shared with tax authorities, making it imperative to report gains accurately on your tax returns. For Crypto-Asset Service Providers, the next two years will involve significant operational overhaul. They must develop systems to: Collect and verify enhanced user data. Automatically report transaction details. Securely transmit this data to relevant national authorities. This creates a compliance burden but also pushes the industry toward greater maturity and legitimacy. Conclusion: A New Era of Crypto Transparency The implementation of the EU’s DAC8 directive marks a pivotal moment. It signals the end of the crypto “wild west” in Europe and the beginning of its integration into the formal, regulated financial system. These crypto tax reporting rules are not just about taxation; they are about establishing trust, legitimacy, and a clear legal framework. While it introduces new compliance steps, this move could ultimately foster greater institutional adoption and long-term stability for the crypto market in the EU. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: When do the EU crypto tax rules start? A: The DAC8 directive officially takes effect on January 1, 2025. However, the deadline for full compliance by Crypto-Asset Service Providers is July 1, 2026. Q: Do I need to report my crypto to the taxman myself? A> Yes, you are still responsible for declaring your crypto gains on your personal tax return. DAC8 means exchanges will also report your activity to authorities, making accurate self-reporting even more critical. Q: What if I use a non-EU crypto exchange? A> The rules primarily target EU-based service providers. However, if you are an EU resident, your tax liability remains based on your location, not the exchange’s. Authorities may still pursue unpaid taxes through other means. Q: How is DAC8 different from MiCA? A> MiCA regulates how crypto companies operate (like a business license). DAC8 is specifically about tax reporting—it dictates what financial information must be shared with tax authorities. Q: Can the tax office really seize my crypto? A> Yes. DAC8 grants tax authorities the power to freeze or seize crypto assets identified as related to tax evasion, even if held on a platform in a different EU country.

Meanwhile, ETF outflows and tight price ranges keep traders focused on near term liquidity. Options positions cluster near key strikes ahead of Dec. 26 expiration More than $23.6 billion in Bitcoin options are set to expire Friday, Dec. 26, according to an analysis shared on X by NoLimitGains, as traders track how dealer hedging could shift once contracts roll off. Options give traders the right, not the obligation, to buy or sell Bitcoin at a set “strike” price by a set date. Calls generally profit if Bitcoin finishes above a strike, while puts generally profit if it finishes below. As expiration approaches, market makers and dealers often hedge their exposure in spot or futures markets, and those hedges can change quickly as price moves around large strike concentrations. Bitcoin Options Open Interest by Strike Price. Source: NoLimitGains (X) The shared chart showed total open interest near 268,695 contracts, with call open interest around 195,079 and put open interest around 73,617, implying a put to call ratio near 0.38. The graphic also listed a notional value of about $23.63 billion and marked a “max pain” level near $96,000, a commonly used reference point that estimates where option holders would lose the most value at expiry. NoLimitGains said the Dec. 26 event would be the largest Bitcoin options expiry to date, while arguing that holiday week conditions can amplify price swings because thinner liquidity can make each large order move the market more than usual. The post added that traders often see choppy price action into expiration, then a clearer directional move after hedges unwind and the open interest concentration disappears. Bitcoin ETF outflows deepen as past reversals draw attention Meanwhile, US spot Bitcoin exchange traded fund flows have dropped to one of their weakest levels of the year, based on a chart shared on X by GordonGekko that tracks a 30 day moving average of net flows alongside Bitcoin’s price. BTC US Spot ETF Net Flows 30 Day Moving Average. Source: GordonGekko (X) The chart shows sustained negative ETF flows through late November and December, with red bars expanding as price moved lower toward the mid to high $80,000 range. These outflows reflect more capital leaving spot Bitcoin ETFs than entering, signaling reduced institutional demand through regulated products over the past month. Historically, similar drawdowns in ETF flows have coincided with periods of market stress rather than immediate trend reversals. However, the chart highlights that the last time ETF outflows reached comparable lows earlier in the year, Bitcoin later staged a sharp recovery as selling pressure eased and flows stabilized. The relationship between ETF flows and price remains indirect. ETF outflows do not automatically trigger price declines, but they often align with broader risk off behavior, reduced liquidity, and hedging activity in derivatives markets. Once outflows slow or turn neutral, price volatility can increase as marginal selling pressure fades. As of late December, the data shows ETF flows still negative, while price remains under pressure. Whether the current drawdown marks a continuation of weakness or a setup for a reversal depends on how flows evolve after the holiday period, when market participation typically returns to normal levels. BTC holds a narrow range after the drop, while traders track $90,647 and $83,986 Bitcoin traded near $87,106 on the BTCUSD chart shared by rbswingtrader on Dec. 23, after a steep selloff pushed price into a tight consolidation range. The chart shows Bitcoin sliding from the $108,519 area before stabilizing below a cluster of resistance levels. Price repeatedly failed under $90,647, while the next marked resistance sits around $91,932 and $92,202. Above that zone, the chart highlights a Fibonacci level near $92,718 and mid range levels around $95,758, with the 0.5 retracement labeled near $96,836 and $96,690. BTCUSD Price Range and Key Levels. Source: rbswingtrader (X) On the downside, the chart frames support around $86,169, then $83,986. A deeper support band appears near $80,427, while a lower target sits near $74,185. The candles during December show sharp swings inside the range, which signals active two way trading rather than a clean trend. The volume panel highlights a shaded “accumulation volume” area during the base building phase, while the RSI panel sits near the high 20s. The RSI also shows a rising trend line from the late November low, which indicates improving momentum even as price stays compressed. In his post, rbswingtrader said “smart money” is buying in the current area and suggested the market could briefly push to a new low before reversing. The chart itself shows the key question as whether Bitcoin reclaims the $90,647 to $92,202 zone or breaks below $83,986 and forces another leg down.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-24 15:38:06

The data showed fewer Americans filing for unemployment support at a moment when economic nerves remain high. Seasonal hiring and temporary layoffs around Christmas have pushed claims up and down for weeks, as early December saw a surge after claims touched a three-year low around Thanksgiving. The latest BLS reading then showed that filings were cooling again, fitting the usual year-end pattern. The Labor Department data was released during a period of persistent uncertainty, as inflation remains above the Federal Reserve’s target, hiring has slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged higher. Still, the flow of new jobless applications has stayed relatively contained through 2025, even as businesses face higher costs and tighter financial conditions, according to the Labor Department. Meanwhile, the Conference Board reported its consumer confidence index fell to 89.1 in December from 92.9 in November, a fifth straight monthly decline, matching the longest losing streak since 2008. The report explained that concerns about the labor market and business conditions are seriously weighing on households. The gauge tracking current conditions dropped to 116.8, the lowest reading since February 2021. Expectations for the next six months held steady, showing no improvement. The Conference Board said, “The impact of high prices and concerns about the labor market have weighed on consumers all year.” That pressure has kept confidence near levels last seen during the pandemic period. U.S. consumer confidence is at its lowest level since April Economists had expected sentiment to recover after the record-long government shutdown ended. Instead, worries about inflation, tariffs, and politics lingered. Job growth remained slow. Unemployment continued to rise. Price pressures stayed elevated. Economists projected hiring would remain soft next year, with little relief on the unemployment front. Wage growth is also expected to cool further in 2026, widening spending gaps between income groups. More respondents said jobs were hard to find, while fewer said jobs were plentiful. The gap between those views narrowed to its lowest level since early 2021, a key signal economists track closely, which dragged down assessments of household finances. For the first time in nearly four years, families described their current financial situation as negative, the report said. Views on the future were slightly better, but still cautious. Spending plans weakened across the board. Fewer consumers planned to buy major appliances, homes, or cars. Vacation plans also slipped. The Conference Board’s index focuses heavily on employment conditions. A separate sentiment gauge from the University of Michigan, which leans more toward personal finances and living costs, showed a similar trend. Both measures remain depressed in December.

The Central Bank of Russia released a draft regulatory concept in late December that marks one of its most detailed attempts to formally structure crypto access. While the proposal does not legalize crypto payments, it outlines how Russians could legally buy, sell, and hold digital assets through regulated channels. The plan is open for discussion and would require legislative approval before taking effect. Still, it signals a shift from broad restrictions toward controlled participation. Different Rules for Qualified and Retail Investors Under the draft, unqualified investors would gain limited access to cryptocurrencies deemed “most liquid.” These assets would be defined later in law and likely include large-cap tokens with established trading volumes. Before investing, retail users would need to pass a mandatory knowledge and risk test. Even after qualifying, their purchases would be capped at 300,000 rubles per year and routed through a single licensed intermediary. Qualified investors would face fewer limits. They could buy a wider range of cryptocurrencies, except for so-called anonymous coins, and would not be subject to volume caps. However, they would still need to complete a risk assessment before trading. The central bank said the testing requirement aims to ensure investors understand volatility, custody risks, and the absence of state guarantees. Trading Structure, Payments Ban, and Timeline The draft keeps Russia ’s long-standing ban on using cryptocurrencies and stablecoins as a means of payment inside the country. Crypto would remain classified as a financial asset rather than money. Trading would take place through licensed Russian infrastructure, including brokers, exchanges, and trustees. Additional rules would apply to specialized crypto intermediaries, such as exchangers and custodians. The plan also addresses cross-border activity. Russian residents could buy crypto using foreign accounts and transfer assets abroad, but they would need to notify tax authorities. Crypto bought earlier could also be moved overseas through approved Russian intermediaries. The central bank aims to see the legal framework finalized by July 1, 2026. Separate liability rules for illegal crypto service providers are scheduled to take effect from July 1, 2027. If adopted, the proposal would place Russia among jurisdictions allowing crypto investment while maintaining tight controls over payments, intermediaries, and investor exposure.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-24 15:41:55

HashKey Capital has completed the first closing of Fund IV with $250 million in commitments. This multi-strategy fund will focus on blockchain infrastructure, mass adoption use cases & emerging markets. Wishing everyone happy holidays as we look forward to an innovative… — HashKey Capital (@HashKey_Capital) December 24, 2025 In a press release the firm said the first close exceeded expectations and attracted interest from a broad base of global institutional investors. The firm is targeting a final fund size of $500 million. Fund IV’s general partner is HashKey Capital Investment part of the broader HashKey Group. The investor base comprises institutional allocators, family offices, and high-net-worth individuals, reflecting continued institutional appetite for selective digital asset exposure despite evolving macro and market conditions. The firm adds that its inaugural fund achieved a distributed-to-paid-in (DPI) multiple of over 10x, reinforcing its track record in high-conviction blockchain investing. Multi-Strategy Approach Across Public and Private Markets Fund IV will pursue a multi-strategy investment mandate designed to support digital asset initiatives with a focus on infrastructure, scalability, and mass-adoption use cases. The fund combines public-market strategies with liquidity-generating crossover opportunities, aiming to capitalize on structural inefficiencies within the digital asset ecosystem. In addition to public and crossover investments, the strategy includes selective private-market allocations to emerging technologies and platforms expected to enhance risk-adjusted returns. According to HashKey Capital, this blended approach is intended to provide flexibility across market cycles while maintaining exposure to long-term thematic growth in blockchain and fintech innovation. Institutional Expansion and Regional Focus Founded in 2018, HashKey Capital has grown into a major participant in the global blockchain investment landscape, managing more than $1 billion in assets and overseeing a portfolio of over 400 projects worldwide. The firm was an early institutional backer of Ethereum and maintains offices in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan. HashKey Capital has also played a role in the development of regulated digital asset products in Hong Kong, including participation in the launch of the city’s first spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Commenting on the fund close Deng Chao, CEO of HashKey Capital, said the new capital positions the firm to capture growth in emerging markets, where blockchain applications are being tested at scale. Dr. Xiao Feng, Founder of HashKey Group comments that the convergence of artificial intelligence, blockchain and institutional finance is creating new investment opportunities, with Fund IV intended to support projects demonstrating both technical capability and commercial viability. Fund IV is designed to provide investors with institutional-grade exposure across infrastructure, tooling, and application layers of the blockchain ecosystem, with an emphasis on projects positioned for broad adoption.

FIGR's capital-light model boosts Q3 2025 adj. EBITDA margin to 55.4%, with loan volume surging to $2.4B since June 2024. The addressable market expands as FIGR's HELOCs capture refinancing demand, reducing reliance on housing cycles. The 'Democratized Prime' blockchain equity initiative offers massive upside optionality, potentially transforming FIGR into a financial infrastructure platform. Summary I gave a buy rating to Figure Technology Solutions ( FIGR ) before, with my key thesis being that FIGR has a structurally better solution to originate loans, one that is supported by its proprietary blockchain. Two months later today, the pivot to Figure Connect is driving real margin inflection, balance sheet risk is coming down, and adoption is accelerating faster than I expected. At the same time, FIGR is quietly expanding its addressable market beyond traditional HELOCs. Figure Connect is doing its job When I last wrote about FIGR, one of my key views was that the pivot to Figure Connect (a capital-light model) would derisk its balance sheet and allow margins to scale. At that time, my confidence level was not super high because we could only rely on early adoption traction. But today, I think we have a strong data point to prove that margins can indeed inflect. In the most recent quarter ( Q3 2025 ), adj. EBITDA margin went up more than 10 points to 55.4% (vs. 44.9% in Q3 2024). As for adoption, it was even more surprising. Since launching in June 2024, the platform has facilitated ~$2.4 billion in HELOC volume through September 2025. Remember that as of 1H25, the platform only processed ~$1.3 billion in loan volume (the first year). Which means in Q3 alone, FIGR processed $1.1 billion of loans, which is close to the entire first-year record. This tells me that the pace of adoption is accelerating, and the beauty is none of them requires FIGR’s capital. At the current pace, we are talking about FIGR potentially processing close to $4.5 billion of loans (and it is still growing), of which FIGR earns a high-margin transaction fee. If this momentum continues, it gives confidence that FIGR can hit management’s long-term EBITDA margin target of >60%. Redefining the TAM One of the biggest risks I highlighted back in October was product concentration. My view was that FIGR was heavily exposed to HELOCs, which meant FIGR’s performance was still linked to the housing cycle. I no longer think this is a big risk. While HELOCs still account for 99% of originations, my view has changed because I underestimated how flexible this product really is. FIGR is not just competing in home equity lending. It is also able to capture demand from refinancing. This is a very interesting dynamic that expands on what TAM FIGR addresses. What’s happening here is known as the “first-lien HELOC” use case. Instead of drawing equity for renovations or discretionary spending, borrowers are using FIGR’s HELOC to pay off their existing mortgage entirely. This is a much bigger market than I thought. To put things in perspective, based on the Nasdaq London Investor Conference and the GS Financial Conference , this use case is ~20% of total volume. I do believe FIGR can continue to capture share in this part of the market because FIGR's cost advantage works here as well. Like I have said before, traditional mortgage refinances are slow and expensive , often taking more than 40 days to close. They rely on paper-heavy processes and multiple handoffs, which drive up both time and cost. For recap, FIGR operates differently. FIGR records transactions on the Provenance blockchain and automates a significant portion of the workflow, driving down processing days to ~10 days. For the borrower, it makes a lot of sense to use FIGR since they can get the money faster. This “new” TAM angle also means that even if discretionary spending slows and the traditional HELOC (for new homes) disappears, FIGR still has a durable source of growth coming from the need to refinance mortgage debt. The ""Blue Ocean"" Call Option What happened was that in November, FIGR filed an S-1 to register a new class of blockchain-native equity, in which the important part is the “Democratized Prime.” The simplest way to think about it is this. The way public equity is being handled in the market today is that it just sits idle in brokerage accounts. From time to time brokers may lend it out, but for the owner, there really isn’t much of an upside during this idle period (returns not related to the value of the equity). FIGR’s proposal changes that dynamic in a good way. By issuing equity natively on the blockchain, it means that the asset itself can be used in real time (i.e., when used as collateral to borrow via stablecoins or as lendable inventory that earns yield). This upside potential is huge because the addressable market is larger than the lending market. Per the S-1 filing, the market for asset tokenization is expected to reach $16 trillion by 2030. If FIGR captures even a fraction of this volume, the revenue implications are massive. Even with a modest 50 bps take rate, the revenue opportunity for asset tokenization alone could be >$80 billion. For context, FIGR's total net revenue for the 9M 2025 was $347 million. We are talking about a revenue potential that is orders of magnitude larger than their current business. The interesting part here is the optionality this creates. If this platform launches successfully, FIGR is no longer just a capital-light lender or a loan marketplace. It effectively becomes a hybrid of an exchange, clearing system, and custodian for tokenized financial assets. I believe this warrants a massive re-rating. For comparison, lenders typically trade at single-digit earnings multiples (e.g., Synchrony Financial, OneMain Holdings, and PennyMac Financial Services), but financial market infrastructure (like exchanges) trades at much higher multiples (think MSCI, S&P Global, Intercontinental Exchange, etc.). Also, unlike new crypto startups, FIGR already holds the necessary Alternative Trading System ((ATS)) and broker-dealer licenses and has already processed more than $60 billion in transactions on the Provenance Blockchain. As such, there are fewer hurdles to clear, de-risking the path ahead. There is also a cost angle that increases the probability of success. Management noted that using the Provenance Blockchain has reduced third-party due diligence costs by ~80% because counterparties can rely on trusted data. This, then, creates a self-reinforcing loop. Lower operating friction should attract more partners to Figure Connect, which increases liquidity, which makes the ecosystem more useful, pulling in even more participants. To be clear, regulatory approval for tokenized equity is not guaranteed, and this initiative should not be underwritten as the base case. Valuation Own math The pace of Figure Connect adoption, a larger TAM, and the optionality tied to the “Democratized Prime” led me to upgrade my growth assumptions. The way I did it was to increase the exit year growth rate to 25% (it was 20% previously). As for valuations, I have upgraded to 14x forward revenue. I don’t think a compression to 10x would make sense since FIGR is evidently growing well, its products are working, processed loans from Figure Connect are scaling very quickly, and the “Democratized Prime” could drive a huge upwards multiples re-rating. Together, this led me to upgrade my share price target to $78. Investment Risk Although Figure Connect reduces balance sheet risk, it increases the risk of dependence since the model relies entirely on third-party liquidity. If institutional buyers on Figure Connect stop taking risks (i.e., don’t lend), growth could come to a halt. Furthermore, the ""Democratized Prime"" upside is contingent on regulatory approvals. If the SEC blocks the tokenized equity S-1, that ""call option"" expires worthless. Conclusion I maintain a buy rating on FIGR. Figure Connect is scaling faster than expected, margins are inflecting, and the business is becoming less exposed to housing cyclicality. On top of that, the “Democratized Prime” initiative introduces upside optionality that is not reflected in current valuation. If all things go well, in my view, FIGR is going to transition from a fintech into a broader financial infrastructure platform.",FIGR,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|ZRX,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-24 15:45:24

At the same time, charts showed ETH failing again near $3,000, with traders watching the $2,800 area as the next key zone. Ethereum EIP 7864 Targets Contract Size Limit Ethereum co founder Vitalik Buterin backed a proposal that would remove the network’s long standing smart contract size limit, according to reporting published late Dec. 23. The proposal, known as EIP 7864, would scrap the current cap by changing how Ethereum stores and accesses contract code. That shift would let developers deploy larger and more complex contracts without splitting code across multiple contracts. Supporters say the change aims to expand design options while still protecting the network from denial of service risks that the existing limit helps reduce. Layer 2 Activity Concentrates Around Major Rollups Meanwhile, Ethereum’s Layer 2 usage in 2025 kept clustering around a small group of rollups, as recent dashboards and research tracked daily activity across the scaling sector. Base ranked among the leaders on several activity metrics, including transactions and user engagement, based on live tracking that compares rollups side by side. The same data shows a wide gap between the most used networks and the long tail of smaller rollups. At the same time, multiple reports said many newer Layer 2 networks struggled to hold users once short term incentive programs faded. Research groups described “mercenary” activity rotating between chains, while value and usage stayed concentrated around a few established ecosystems, including Base and Arbitrum.

With the digital landscape shifting constantly, key indicators are being closely watched. Delve into an analysis of these metrics to uncover which digital assets may be poised for future gains. XRP's Battle: Eyeing Key $2.14 Resistance for a Boost Source: tradingview XRP is currently trading between a dollar seventy-nine and just over two dollars. It faces its closest struggle to break above the two-dollar and fourteen cents mark. If it succeeds, the next goal could be two dollars and thirty-nine cents. Despite a slight dip of almost nine percent over the past month, XRP holds potential. Its price could jump by more than ten percent if it breaks the nearest resistance. While the coin shows steady behavior with an RSI around fifty, its six-month decline hints at a need for a positive catalyst. Investors are watching closely to see if XRP can break through to new highs. TRX Eyes Growth Amid Steady Climb Source: tradingview TRON (TRX) currently trades between just above 28 cents and a bit below 30 cents. Its price is moving upwards slowly. The coin has shown a gentle rise of nearly 3% over the past month. TRX is closely approaching its nearest resistance of almost 30 cents, with a chance to climb past this mark. If it manages to break past the second resistance around 31 cents, TRX could see further growth. Over the last six months, TRX has increased roughly 4.5%. Investors watching TRX are hopeful about its potential to continue this steady climb and break past these barriers for more gains. XDC Network Eyes Potential Growth After Bumpy Ride Source: tradingview XDC Network's price hovers between a little over four cents and five cents. Though recent monthly performance shows a dip by just over five percent, the last week's trend indicates a small rise just under two percent. With the price nearing a key resistance point of just above five cents, there's room for movement if sentiment shifts. An upwards breach could push it to nearly six cents, marking over a twenty percent increase. Meanwhile, key support at just over three cents suggests a fallback cushion. Short-term averages suggest stable but cautious optimism, hinted by an RSI nearing the typical overbought threshold and high stochastic readings. Overall, XDC has potential, depending on market mood. Conclusion XRP, TRX, and XDC have shown resilience while the market is volatile. These coins present promising technical factors. They are leading the charge and could be key players in the sector. Their steady performance highlights their potential. As the market searches for stability, XRP, TRX, and XDC stand out. The data indicates their strength and possible future growth. These coins are worth watching as they navigate the market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The latest Arkham Intelligence data as of Wednesday, December 24, shows that the fund deposited 2,292 Bitcoin ( BTC ), valued at around $200 million, and 9,976 Ethereum ( ETH ), worth about $30 million, to Coinbase Prime earlier today. A few hours later, however, BlackRock began repurchasing its stake from Coinbase, adding back 499 BTC ($43 million) and 1,511 ETH ($4.39 million). BlackRock crypto moves. Source: Arkham Intelligence Currently, BlackRock holds approximately $77.6 billion in crypto, the majority of it split between Bitcoin ($67.4 billion) and Ethereum ($10.2 billion), and the remaining $1,000 or so shared among assets such as Binance Coin ( BNB ) and Arbitrum ( ARB ). BlackRock offloads as the crypto market bearish The ongoing moves come just as Bitcoin and Ethereum are struggling to break above their major respective resistance levels. Specifically, BTC the “digital gold” is failing to live up to its nickname, trading below $87,000 as other major assets, including precious metals , rally. Ethereum itself is still below $3,000, probably affected by institutional outflows, which sit at nearly $160 million over the past seven days. While the latest transfers have left the market debating whether to view it as a sign of ETF weakness, the fact that BlackRock is starting to record inflows just hours following the initial sale suggests restructuring.

These are not the tokens that trend every week. They are the ones that build quietly, attract steady participation, and only gain wider attention once the foundation is complete. This pattern is starting to surface again. A new DeFi crypto that spent most of its early life outside mainstream discussion is now drawing stronger interest. Analysts note that visibility is beginning to catch up with progress. Mutuum Finance appears to be entering that phase where quiet growth becomes visible growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is an Ethereum based DeFi crypto designed around lending and borrowing. At its core, the protocol allows users to supply assets to earn yield while borrowers access liquidity by locking collateral. The system is built around structure rather than speed. Dual lending markets allow the protocol to handle different asset profiles. Borrowing terms are defined upfront. Collateral requirements are clear. Interest flows follow predictable rules. This matters for long term capital because it reduces uncertainty around how value is created. For most of its early lifecycle, this work happened with limited exposure. Development milestones were met, but without aggressive promotion. According to official updates, the upcoming V1 launch is the point where this quiet work becomes public. Once lending markets go live, usage replaces speculation as the main driver of attention. Growth That Happened Before the Crowd Noticed One of the reasons analysts are paying attention now is how participation has grown. Mutuum Finance did not experience sudden spikes driven by hype. Instead, funding and holder numbers increased steadily over time. More than $19.4M has been raised, and the holder base has expanded to over 18,600 wallets. This type of growth pattern is often described as accumulation. Capital enters gradually, and participants tend to hold rather than flip quickly. This behavior matters. It suggests that early participants are positioning around long term usage, not short term price swings. In DeFi, this often appears before wider market discovery. Token Economics and Why Supply Is Now in Focus Mutuum Finance is currently in Phase 6, with the token priced at $0.035. From Phase 1 to now, MUTM has surged 250%. This move happened while the project remained relatively under the radar. The total supply is capped at 4B tokens. Of this, 45.5% or 1.82B tokens were allocated for early distribution. A large portion of this allocation has already been sold. As phases progress, available supply tightens. When supply tightens at the same time visibility increases, behavior often changes. Buyers become more selective. Holding periods extend. Late participants face higher entry prices. Analysts view this stage as a transition point rather than an early experiment. System Level Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) develops mtTokens as a core mechanic. When users supply assets, they receive mtTokens that grow in value as interest accrues. These tokens reflect real protocol activity. They are designed to reward patience rather than fast trading. Another layer is the buy and distribute model. A portion of protocol revenue can be used to buy MUTM from the market and distribute it to mtToken holders. This links demand to usage instead of attention. Oracles play help ensure pricing accuracy. Reliable data feeds are critical for lending protocols. Accurate pricing reduces liquidation risk and supports stable borrowing conditions. Together, these elements create system level demand rather than narrative driven demand. Security is often the last box serious users wait to see checked. Mutuum Finance has completed a CertiK token scan with a 90/100 score. A Halborn Security review is also part of the security framework. In addition, a $50k bug bounty is active to identify potential issues. Why This Moment Feels Different Phase 6 is nearing full allocation (over 99% completed). Whale sized allocations have appeared, including recent six figure entries. The 24 hour leaderboard highlights ongoing engagement rather than one time buys. Card payment options lower barriers for new participants. All of these signals tend to cluster near visibility shifts. The project is no longer an early concept, but not yet fully live. Infrastructure is built. Supply is tightening. Usage is about to begin. Analysts often describe this stage as the moment where perception catches up to reality. For Mutuum Finance, that moment appears to be forming now, positioning it as one of the new crypto projects closely watched heading into 2026.

This breakout is about a high-timeframe setup where market structure is on the verge of shifting. It is also the potential resolution of a multi-year structure that has compressed prices, absorbed supply, and conditioned participants to underestimate what comes next. Why Volatility Has Collapsed Ahead Of Expansion At the least expected time, XRP will print a legendary candle that will set a structural foundation and never move down. A crypto investor known as 24HRSCRYPTO noted on X that this move that is coming won’t be powered by retail hype, but by real economic activity on the XRP Ledger. When the altcoin begins to function as a settlement asset, volatility will become a liability, rather than a feature. Related Reading: Banks Could Favor A Higher XRP Price, Finance Expert Says Additionally, the payment rails, liquidity provisioning, and institutional settlement system will require price stability. A bridge asset referred to as a vehicle currency cannot swing 30-40% and still clear trillions in value. As volume and utility increase, XRP begins to transition from a speculative instrument into market infrastructure. Liquidity depth would be key to absorb shocks, while the price becomes anchored by demand. This is why the first candle isn’t a top, but the market repricing XRP’s role from a tradeable asset into a financial primitive. With new initiatives, XRP’s adoption is set to increase. Analyst X Finance Bull has revealed that RLUSD is the first US trust-regulated stablecoin launched by Ripple, issued natively on the XRP Ledger and extending across Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains for broader institutional access. Any banks that would integrate with RLUSD will be automatically onboarded into the XRP rails. This isn’t just about stable payments, but about demand generation for the altcoin as the default bridge asset. From BlackRock funds flow to global repo markets, that’s where the real volume begins to flow. This flips the game, allowing RLUSD to provide the liquidity, while XRP captures the movement. Why XRPL Meets Institutional Due Diligence Standards For the first time, XRP Ledger has now processed over 4 billion transactions since its launch in 2012. Co-founder of Tedlabsio, a crypto trader and investor, Niels, has pointed out that the real-world usage across the network has sustained more than 13 years of uninterrupted operation. Related Reading: Here’s How Many Transactions XRP Must Process To Reach A $2,000 Price Tag The XRPL consistently handles around 1.5 million transactions per day, with regular peaks exceeding 5 million, and settles in 3 to 5 seconds. All of this happens at fractions of a cent per transaction. Over time, more than 13 million XRP have been burned in transaction fees, a metric that reflects continuous demand in network activity. This is why institutions pay attention to XRPL.

Today, thousands of football fans place bets using USDT, Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, attracted by faster payouts, fewer restrictions, and access to global markets. Football remains the centerpiece of this shift. With matches running daily across dozens of leagues and constant opportunities for in-play wagering, crypto betting platforms are especially well suited to football betting. Live odds update rapidly, markets stay open longer, and winnings can be withdrawn without relying on banks. This guide reviews how crypto football betting works in practice. We break down football betting markets, explain live odds, explore practical betting strategies, and show how crypto-native platforms improve the overall betting experience — especially for live football betting. What Is Crypto Sports Betting and How It Works Crypto sports betting follows the same core logic as traditional online betting, but replaces fiat payments with cryptocurrencies. Instead of depositing via bank transfer or card, users fund their betting account with digital assets such as USDT, BTC, or ETH. Once deposited, bets are placed in the usual way — pre-match or live — and winnings are credited back to the crypto balance. Withdrawals are processed on-chain, often significantly faster than fiat payouts. From a practical standpoint, crypto betting offers several clear advantages: Faster deposits and withdrawals compared to banks Access to global football markets without regional payment limits Stablecoin options like USDT to avoid price volatility Fewer intermediaries between the bettor and their funds For football bettors who rely on live betting odds and react to events during matches, these advantages are especially important. Delayed deposits or withdrawals can easily mean missed value during fast-moving games. Crypto platforms are built to support this pace, which is why online crypto sports betting has become increasingly popular among active football bettors. Why Football Is the Most Popular Sport for Crypto Betting Football dominates crypto sports betting for a simple reason: it offers the best balance between volume, liquidity, and betting flexibility. Matches take place every day, across dozens of leagues, time zones, and competition levels. For crypto platforms, this constant flow of events is ideal. At a glance, football fits crypto betting better than almost any other sport: High match frequency, from top leagues to lower divisions Deep betting liquidity, even on secondary markets Strong live betting demand throughout the match Global fan base, not limited by region or payment systems But the appeal goes deeper than availability. Football markets are structurally diverse. A single match can generate dozens of betting opportunities before kickoff and even more once play begins. This diversity works especially well with crypto, where bettors can move funds quickly and react without friction. Another key factor is live betting. In football, momentum shifts constantly. A red card, an injury, a tactical substitution, or a sudden goal can completely change the outlook of a match. Crypto platforms are better equipped to handle these moments because they are not slowed down by banking rails or manual payment checks. Live football betting thrives on: Rapid odds updates Continuous market availability Immediate balance adjustments For bettors focused on live football betting odds, crypto platforms offer a clear advantage. They allow users to stay active throughout the match rather than planning everything before kickoff. There is also a psychological aspect. Football betting tends to be more intuitive than betting on less familiar sports. Most bettors already understand basic dynamics like home advantage, form, and motivation. Crypto simply removes friction from the process, making it easier to act on that knowledge in real time. This combination — familiarity, volume, and speed — explains why football remains the backbone of sports betting with crypto. Dexsport — Crypto-Native Football Betting Platform for Live Odds Dexsport is built specifically for crypto sports betting, with football and live markets playing a central role in its offering. Instead of adapting a traditional sportsbook to accept crypto, Dexsport approaches betting from a crypto-first perspective — which becomes especially noticeable during live matches. For football bettors, this matters. Dexsport offers broad coverage across leagues and competitions, including: Major European leagues and international tournaments Regional and lower-division matches Friendly games and qualifiers Ongoing live matches with continuously updating odds Markets remain accessible deep into the match, allowing bettors to react to events rather than being locked out after sudden momentum shifts. Football Betting Features on Dexsport Dexsport focuses on functionality that supports both pre-match planning and in-play decision-making. Key football betting features include: Full pre-match markets (1X2, totals, handicaps, BTTS) Live football betting with real-time odds updates Event-based live markets such as next goal, cards, and corners Fast bet confirmation during high-action moments The interface stays clean even when multiple live markets are open. Odds are readable, market changes are clearly signaled, and the bet slip behaves predictably — all critical details during live football betting. Crypto Advantages for Football Bettors One of Dexsport’s biggest strengths is how smoothly crypto integrates into the betting flow. At different stages of the betting process, crypto delivers practical benefits: Before the match: instant deposits without banking delays During live play: stable balance updates and fast execution After settlement: withdrawals without waiting periods or paperwork USDT support is particularly valuable for football bettors who want to avoid volatility while tracking live football betting odds across current matches. Bonuses and Promotions on Dexsport Dexsport offers bonuses designed to support active betting rather than restrict it. Depending on current promotions, users can access: Deposit bonuses across initial top-ups Free bets applicable to football markets Cashback offers that reduce downside during active sessions These incentives are structured to complement regular betting activity, including live football wagers, rather than forcing long wagering cycles. Why Dexsport Fits Crypto Football Betting Dexsport works best for bettors who value speed, flexibility, and control. It is especially well suited for users who: Bet on football regularly, not occasionally Actively use live betting during matches Prefer crypto and stablecoins over fiat Want fast withdrawals without unnecessary checks Start Betting on Football with Crypto on Dexsport Football Betting Markets Explained Football betting offers one of the widest selections of markets in sports betting. This flexibility is exactly why football works so well with crypto — bettors can switch between markets quickly, adjust positions during a match, and react to changing odds without friction. To understand how to use these markets effectively, it’s best to separate them into pre-match and live betting. Pre-Match Football Betting Markets Pre-match markets are available before kickoff and allow bettors to plan their strategy in advance. These markets are generally more stable and easier to analyze. The most common options include: Match Result (1X2) — home win, draw, or away win Double Chance — covers two outcomes instead of one Over / Under Goals — total goals scored in the match Both Teams to Score (BTTS) — yes or no Handicaps — including Asian handicap variants Pre-match betting suits users who rely on research, statistics, and team news rather than real-time momentum. It’s also where many bettors prefer to place single, lower-risk bets. Live Football Betting Markets Live betting opens once the match begins — and this is where crypto betting truly shines. During live play, markets update constantly. Odds shift based on possession, shots, cards, goals, and tactical changes. Popular live football betting markets include: Live match odds Next goal scorer / next goal team Live totals and handicaps Cards and corners Time-based props (goals in next 10 minutes, etc.) Because these markets are dynamic, access speed and execution reliability matter more than ever. This is why live football betting odds for current matches are one of the most searched topics in crypto betting. Why Crypto Makes Football Betting Better Crypto doesn’t change football itself — it changes how efficiently you can bet on it. Traditional betting platforms are often slowed down by payment systems, withdrawal queues, and verification steps. Crypto betting removes much of that friction, which is especially noticeable during live matches. The practical advantages become clear quickly: Faster payouts — winnings can often be withdrawn shortly after settlement No banks involved — fewer delays and fewer restrictions Better access to live betting odds — especially during current matches Stablecoin options — USDT allows bankroll control without volatility Global access — no dependence on local payment providers For bettors who focus on online crypto betting, this efficiency translates into better control. Funds move when needed. Bets are placed when value appears. Withdrawals don’t interrupt momentum. Crypto also aligns well with live betting psychology. When users know they can access their funds freely, they are less likely to overextend or panic during volatile match moments. In short, crypto doesn’t guarantee profits — but it removes unnecessary obstacles between the bettor and the market. Risks and Responsible Football Betting Football betting — especially live betting — can be engaging and fast-paced, but it also comes with real risks. Crypto betting amplifies both the positives and the downsides, which makes discipline essential. Some risks are structural: Emotional live betting after goals, red cards, or missed chances Overstaking, especially during losing streaks Accumulator chasing, driven by the appeal of big payouts Speed bias, where fast execution leads to rushed decisions Responsible football betting starts with awareness. Crypto makes betting faster — it does not remove variance or uncertainty. A few practical guidelines help maintain control: Set a fixed betting budget and stick to it Avoid increasing stakes to recover losses Treat live betting as a tactical tool, not constant action Take breaks during volatile sessions The best bettors focus on longevity, not single outcomes. Used correctly, crypto betting platforms offer flexibility and efficiency. Used carelessly, they can accelerate losses just as quickly as wins. Final Verdict Sports betting with crypto has become a natural evolution of online football betting. Faster payouts, stablecoin support, and constant access to live markets make crypto especially well suited for football — a sport defined by momentum, timing, and volume. From pre-match analysis to in-play decision-making, crypto platforms remove many of the traditional barriers that slow bettors down. Live football betting odds remain accessible, balances update instantly, and withdrawals are no longer tied to banking delays. Among the available options, Dexsport stands out as a strong choice for crypto football betting. Its focus on live odds, clean user experience, fast execution, and crypto-native infrastructure makes it particularly effective for bettors who actively engage with matches rather than placing occasional wagers.",More News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-12-24 16:01:34

The company announced Tuesday it will update its automated software to better manage similar situations in the future. Waymo vehicles froze at intersections across the city on Dec. 20 when traffic lights went dark following a fire at a PG&E Corp. substation. Videos posted on social media showed several cars sitting motionless in the middle of streets with their hazard lights on, backing up traffic behind them. The Waymo Driver system treats traffic lights that have gone dark the same way it handles four-way stops. But sometimes a vehicle will “request a confirmation check to ensure it makes the safest choice,” according to a company statement released Tuesday. The cars managed to deal with 7,000 traffic signals that stopped working during the blackout. However, the widespread outage “created a concentrated spike in these requests,” the company explained. This surge in requests slowed down how quickly Waymo could respond to its stuck vehicles. The company stopped its service after city officials asked drivers to stay off the roads. Massive outage disrupts holiday weekend with abandoned Waymo cars The power failure affected roughly 130,000 customers at its peak. It shut down stores and disrupted public transportation during one of the busiest shopping weekends of the year. Many Waymo cars, which are part of Alphabet Inc.’s robotaxi business, were caught up in the chaos. Michele Riva, 30, was riding home in a Waymo on Saturday evening when the lights went out. His car kept going through a less busy part of the city, even as people walked across the street. But when he was just a minute from his destination, the vehicle stopped at a “very dense intersection” where the traffic lights had gone dark. He got no warning. “I stayed in the Waymo for a couple of minutes, just to see,” Riva, who works as an engineer in artificial intelligence, told Bloomberg. “The problem was that, at the beginning, there were a lot of people crossing the streets because there were no traffic lights. So I believe Waymo just didn’t know what to do.” Riva tried reaching customer support for about three minutes while stuck inside the car. He gave up after the wait became too long, as the service was swamped with calls from other passengers. He stepped out and walked the remaining few blocks home. PG&E, which blamed the blackout on a substation fire, started bringing power back Saturday evening. By Sunday morning, the utility said it had restored electricity for 110,000 customers, though 21,000 remained in the dark. On Sunday, the Waymo app displayed a message telling some customers that service was on hold in the Bay Area. At least seven cities were affected. Emergency software updates in the works “Our teams are working diligently and in close coordination with city officials, and we are hopeful to bring our services back online soon,” a Waymo spokesperson said Sunday. Riva tried to book another Waymo ride on Sunday before seeing the notice. “At the end of the day, I know it was an unpleasant situation for the other drivers, but I believe it really was all about safety — I believe it’s better safe than sorry,” Riva said. “I hope they will account for that in the future, because it’s truly a good service.” Waymo said it is now working to add more information to its software about the “context” of regional power outages. This should help the vehicles “navigate these intersections more decisively.” The company is also teaming up with San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie on emergency response plans and updating training for first responders.

At critical moments, narratives pushed by influential financial institutions can shape sentiment just as powerfully as price action itself. Recently, a wave of reduced Bitcoin price targets from major Wall Street players has unsettled retail investors, even as broader indicators suggest the digital asset sector is entering a new structural phase. Against this backdrop, Ripple Bull Winkle offered a pointed interpretation of what is unfolding. In a video clip shared on X, he urged XRP holders and crypto investors to look beyond the surface of bearish revisions and examine the incentives driving them. Wall Street Is Lowering Bitcoin Targets on Purpose #XRP !!! pic.twitter.com/7OlvQkrexw — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) December 23, 2025 Wall Street’s Strategic Reset of Expectations According to Ripple Bull Winkle, the repeated lowering of Bitcoin price targets by well-known financial institutions is not accidental. He argues that this is the third notable instance in which prominent market voices have scaled back projections, creating an atmosphere of caution rather than enthusiasm. Historically, such shifts in tone have often preceded periods of quiet accumulation by institutions rather than prolonged downturns. Lower expectations, in this framework, serve a strategic purpose. When optimism fades, competition thins, volatility cools, and large players can position themselves without chasing euphoric price action. For institutions managing massive pools of capital, entry conditions matter more than short-term headlines. Retail Psychology and the Cost of Fear A key element of Ripple Bull Winkle’s argument centers on retail behavior. He notes that many individual investors rely heavily on mainstream commentary and headline forecasts rather than independent research. When influential firms temper their outlook, fear tends to spread quickly, leading to panic selling and shaken conviction. This dynamic, he suggests, consistently results in retail participants exiting positions at inopportune moments. Once confidence erodes and positions are sold, re-entry becomes psychologically difficult—especially if prices begin to recover alongside institutional accumulation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Infrastructure Growth Beneath the Surface While sentiment cools, Ripple Bull Winkle highlights that foundational progress continues largely out of public view. Blockchain infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, and institutional-grade systems are advancing steadily. These developments rarely generate immediate excitement, but historically they have laid the groundwork for sustained adoption rather than speculative spikes. He also points to upcoming regulatory clarity in the United States as a pivotal factor. Clearer rules reduce risk for institutions and often act as a catalyst for deeper engagement, even if market narratives remain subdued in the short term. Same Cycle, Different Asset Ripple Bull Winkle frames the current environment as a familiar chapter in a long-running market cycle. Similar strategies, he notes, have played out in technology stocks, commodities, and precious metals. Each time, lowered expectations preceded major shifts in participation and valuation. For XRP holders and crypto investors, the takeaway is not a promise of immediate upside, but a reminder to distinguish between narrative-driven fear and structural reality.

According to a report by CryptoBasic, this latest buy means Trend Research now holds more Ethereum than almost any publicly listed company tracked by CoinGecko. This action raises a critical question: why is a major investment firm doubling down on ETH in such a significant way? The purchase likely signals a strong long-term belief in Ethereum’s fundamental value proposition. This includes its role as the primary platform for decentralized applications (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. For investors, this kind of institutional validation can be a compelling data point. Breaking Down the Impact of Growing Institutional ETH Holdings When a firm like Trend Research amasses such a large position, the effects are felt across the market. Let’s explore the key implications: Supply Shock Potential: Large-scale accumulation by institutions can reduce the amount of ETH readily available on exchanges, potentially creating upward pressure on price if demand remains steady or increases. Enhanced Credibility: Major investments lend legitimacy to the asset class, potentially encouraging other traditional finance entities to explore cryptocurrency allocations. Network Security & Value: Significant holdings, especially if staked, contribute to the security and stability of the Ethereum network, reinforcing its value for all users. However, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. While bullish, concentrated ownership also introduces questions about market influence. The health of a decentralized network ultimately benefits from a broad, distributed base of holders. How Does Trend Research’s Strategy Compare? Trend Research’s parent company, LD Capital, is known for its focused investments in blockchain and crypto ventures. This aggressive accumulation of ETH aligns with a strategy of securing foundational assets within the digital economy. They are not merely trading; they are building a strategic reserve. This move places them in an elite category of institutional holders. While companies like MicroStrategy are famous for their Bitcoin treasuries, Trend Research is making a definitive bet on the Ethereum ecosystem’s future. This divergence highlights how sophisticated investors are now differentiating their crypto portfolios beyond a single asset. Actionable Insights for Crypto Observers What can everyday investors and market watchers learn from this news? First, monitor the behavior of major holders like Trend Research as a gauge of sophisticated market sentiment. Second, understand that ETH holdings at this scale are about long-term infrastructure betting, not short-term price swings. Finally, this underscores the importance of conducting your own research (DYOR). Institutional moves provide context, but they are not a direct investment signal for individuals. The crypto market remains volatile, and strategies must align with personal risk tolerance. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Ethereum Adoption The decision by Trend Research to expand its Trend Research ETH holdings past the 580,000 mark is a defining moment. It represents a profound vote of confidence in Ethereum’s roadmap and its enduring role in the future of finance and the internet. This isn’t just an investment; it’s a strategic positioning for the next era of the digital economy. As institutions continue to allocate capital in this manner, the line between traditional finance and crypto continues to blur, signaling a new phase of maturation for the entire asset class.

Reportedly, Nvidia had tested the 18A process and chose not to move forward, dealing a smack at Intel during a very sensitive moment as it continues trying so hard to prove it can manufacture leading-edge chips inside the United States while rebuilding credibility after years of lost ground. An Intel spokesperson allegedly responded to the Reuters report and said the company’s 18A manufacturing technologies are “progressing well.” The development followed the recent opening of Fab 52 at Intel’s Ocotillo site in Arizona. The facility is the first Intel factory to enter mass production using the 18A technique. The company has said the technology represents the most advanced production process ever developed and deployed in the United States. Intel’s domestic manufacturing push is meant to challenge Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the global leader in contract chip production. The effort also aims to restore US leadership in advanced semiconductor manufacturing after years of reliance on overseas facilities. In September, Nvidia agreed to invest $5 billion into Intel after the US government decided to take roughly a 10% stake in the chipmaker. The investment drew attention because Nvidia is the world’s most valuable chip company and a key supplier to the artificial intelligence boom. The deal did not include any commitment for Intel to manufacture Nvidia chips, a detail that remains unchanged after the halted test. Intel’s 18A technology underpins Panther Lake as losses continue In October, Intel introduced two major changes to chip construction, with the first one focusing on transistors, the tiny switches that power modern processors. This is reportedly because typically, chips have tens of billions of transistors packed into small spaces, meaning convenient on and off control is critical for performance and power use. Intel has long said that chips made with 18A will be the first to use gate-all-around transistor technology, which allows tighter control over electrical flow. The approach supports higher transistor density, stronger data handling, and lower energy consumption. The second change involves how power is delivered across the chip, with the goal of allowing more transistors without sacrificing efficiency. In October, Intel said its Panther Lake processors had entered full production and are scheduled to go on sale in laptops early next year, all built using the 18A process that the company vows improves on earlier generations and better balances heavy workloads like AI software with battery life. Sadly, though, despite all that, Intel remains in its second straight year of losses, and analysts do not expect a return to profitability before 2027, as Cryptopolitan previously reported during Q3 earnings season. Revenue has fallen as Intel lost market share and failed to benefit from the surge in data center demand tied to artificial intelligence. Nvidia moved faster in that market and now dominates it. At the same time, Intel is carrying the heavy cost of factory upgrades. Fab 52 alone required more steel than the Eiffel Tower and houses machines that cost hundreds of millions of dollars each.

Among the platforms affected were Coinbase and Gemini, two of the largest U.S.-based crypto exchanges, which users reported became inaccessible across multiple Philippine ISPs as of Tuesday. Independent checks confirmed the disruptions. Philippine Crackdown Leaves Traders Scrambling After Platforms Are Blocked The blocks followed a directive from the National Telecommunications Commission, which instructed ISPs to immediately restrict access to 50 online trading platforms identified by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas as operating without authorization. The NTC said the order was issued after a formal request from the central bank to disable the websites and applications of unlicensed virtual asset service providers as part of an ongoing effort to enforce local registration and licensing rules. According to the NTC, the action is grounded in updated financial regulations under BSP Circular No. 1206, which outlines how virtual asset providers must operate within the country. The framework places emphasis on consumer protection, financial stability, and the central bank’s authority to supervise entities involved in money services and digital assets under the New Central Bank Act. By cutting access to noncompliant platforms, regulators said they are seeking to prevent continued exposure of the public to financial risks tied to unregistered services. While the commission did not publish a complete list of the affected platforms, it acknowledged the public attention surrounding the blocking of large international exchanges and stated that additional global platforms could be impacted as enforcement continues. To the investors, the short-term effect has been disastrous, with most users being caught unawares, with account and order cancellations and money withdrawals from frozen accounts not being possible on frozen platforms. Local traders were reporting temporary asset liquidity freezes and attempts to transfer assets to foreign locations in a rush. The regulators have made it clear that funds lost, stolen, or trapped due to enforcement measures have no legal redress to users of unregistered platforms. Philippine Regulators Push Crypto Toward Licensed Channels In addition to the temporary disturbance, the crackdown as described by authorities has been one of the larger changes in regulated crypto activity. The Securities and Exchange Commission has underlined that licensed platforms must comply with regulations on fund segregation, disclosures, cybersecurity, and anti-money laundering controls. Authorities believe that directing users to legitimate transactions would hamper their exposure to fraud, manipulation of the market, and unlawful financial transactions. The most recent enforcement initiative is based on a sequence of regulatory measures in the last two years. Towards the end of 2023, the Philippines started a 90-day grace period during which Binance could comply or face the blockage of the exchange by the ISPs in March 2024 and the removal of the exchange by major app stores . The Philippines’ Securities and Exchange Commission is working to remove Binance-linked applications from Apple and Google app stores. #Binance #Philippines https://t.co/pH0hbgkZEn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 23, 2024 More recently, at least 10 other unregistered platforms, such as OKX, Bybit, and Kraken, were warned by the SEC due to unauthorized operations and threatening investors and national security. Meanwhile, regulators have been busy formulating new formal regulations in the sector. In December 2024, SEC published the draft Crypto-Assets Service Provider rule and made it available for public consultation, including licenses, disclosure policies, capital requirements, and cybersecurity requirements. Philippines SEC has proposed new rules for crypto service providers, focusing on transparency, public offerings, and marketing practices. #CryptoRegulations https://t.co/4pCGmJgWaG — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 24, 2024 The commission has also introduced a regulatory sandbox that registered firms can use to test novel crypto products and be supervised. Regulated crypto activity has been growing in spite of the crackdown against unlicensed platforms. The PDAX local exchange has launched remote worker stablecoin payroll services, and the crypto digital bank GoTyme has recently launched in-app crypto services on a licensed basis.

This isn’t science fiction—it’s the next frontier for autonomous vehicles . According to new findings, Waymo is covertly testing the integration of Google’s powerful Gemini AI as an in-car companion for its robotaxis , signaling a major leap from mere transportation to an interactive, AI-powered experience. For tech enthusiasts and investors watching the convergence of AI and mobility, this move reveals where the real value in autonomous tech is headed. How Did We Discover Waymo’s Gemini AI Assistant? The discovery came from researcher Jane Manchun Wong , known for uncovering hidden features in app code. By digging into the Waymo mobile app, Wong found a massive, 1,200-line system prompt titled ‘Waymo Ride Assistant Meta-Prompt.’ This document isn’t just a simple script; it’s a detailed blueprint for how the AI assistant should behave inside a Waymo vehicle. A company spokesperson confirmed the team is “always tinkering” but shared no official launch details. This finding proves the project is in an advanced testing phase, designed to be far more than a basic chatbot. What Can the Gemini-Powered AI Assistant Actually Do? Based on the system prompt, the Gemini AI assistant is engineered with a clear mission: to be a friendly, helpful companion that enhances the rider’s journey. Its capabilities are carefully scoped to balance usefulness with safety. Conversational Intelligence: It can answer general knowledge questions, from weather updates to sports scores, using clear, simple language. In-Cabin Control: The assistant can manage certain vehicle functions like interior temperature, lighting, and music playback directly. Rider Reassurance: A key function is to provide calm, reassuring responses to passenger queries or concerns during the ride. Personalized Greetings: It can access contextual rider data, like a passenger’s first name and trip history, to offer a tailored welcome. However, its powers are intentionally limited. It cannot change the route, control windows, or perform real-world actions like ordering food. For unavailable functions, it’s programmed to use “aspirational phrases” like, “It’s not something I can do yet.” Why is This a Strategic Move for Waymo and Robotaxis? Integrating a sophisticated AI assistant like Gemini addresses a critical challenge for robotaxis : the human experience. A driverless car can feel impersonal or even unsettling. A conversational AI bridges that gap, providing interaction and control, which can boost public trust and adoption. Furthermore, Waymo has already used Gemini’s “world knowledge” to train its autonomous vehicles on rare driving scenarios. Extending this AI into the cabin creates a unified, intelligent ecosystem. This isn’t just about convenience; it’s about making the technology feel accessible, safe, and truly autonomous in every sense. Gemini vs. Grok: How Do AI Assistants in Autonomous Vehicles Differ? Waymo isn’t alone. Tesla is integrating xAI’s Grok into its vehicles. The approaches, however, reflect different philosophies. Feature Waymo’s Gemini Assistant Tesla’s Grok Assistant Primary Focus Pragmatic, ride-focused assistance Conversational “buddy” with personality Core Function Answer queries, control cabin features, reassure Handle long conversations, remember context Identity Clearly separated from the driving system (Waymo Driver) Integrated as part of the car’s personality Key Limitation Cannot comment on real-time driving actions Designed for broader, more open-ended chat This contrast shows the industry exploring whether the in-car AI should be a utilitarian tool or an entertaining companion. What Are the Challenges and Safety Protocols for an In-Car AI? The system prompt reveals meticulous safety and behavioral guardrails for the AI assistant : No Driving Commentary: The assistant must not speculate on, explain, or comment on specific driving events. If asked about an incident, it must deflect. Clear Identity Separation: It must always distinguish itself from the Waymo Driver. For example, it says “The Waymo Driver uses sensors…” not “I use sensors…” Handling Competitors: It has specific instructions for how to respond if riders mention rivals like Tesla or Cruise. Controlled Responses: Replies are kept succinct (1-3 sentences) to avoid overwhelming the rider. These rules are crucial for managing liability, maintaining clear system boundaries, and ensuring the AI remains a helpful aid, not a source of confusion or misinformation. The Future of AI in Autonomous Vehicles: What’s Next? The integration of Gemini AI into Waymo robotaxis is a pivotal experiment. Its success could set the standard for human-AI interaction in shared mobility. The next steps likely involve expanding its actionable capabilities—perhaps integrating with calendar apps for smarter drop-offs or local business APIs for recommendations. As this technology matures, the AI assistant could become the primary interface for all passenger needs, transforming the cabin into a productive or relaxing mobile space. The race is no longer just about who has the best self-driving tech, but who can create the most compelling and trustworthy autonomous vehicle experience. Conclusion: A New Era for Rider Experience Waymo’s covert testing of the Gemini AI assistant marks a significant evolution for robotaxis . It moves the value proposition beyond the technical feat of autonomy to the quality of the passenger journey. By addressing the human element—curiosity, comfort, and control—through intelligent conversation, Waymo is crafting a more complete and appealing future for transportation. This powerful fusion of large language models and autonomous vehicles is where true innovation lies, turning every ride into a seamless, assisted, and perhaps even delightful, experience.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Waymo? Waymo is an autonomous driving technology company, originally a project within Google and now a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. It operates a commercial robotaxi service in several U.S. cities. What is Gemini AI? Gemini is a family of multimodal large language models developed by Google DeepMind . It can understand and process text, code, audio, images, and video. Who discovered the Gemini integration in Waymo? The integration was discovered by researcher and reverse engineer Jane Manchun Wong , who found the system prompt within the Waymo app’s code. How is Tesla’s approach different? Tesla is working on integrating xAI’s Grok assistant, which is designed to be more of a conversational companion with a distinct personality, compared to Waymo’s more pragmatic, ride-focused Gemini assistant. When will this feature be available to the public? Waymo has not announced a release date. A spokesperson stated the team is “tinkering” and that such features “may or may not come to our rider experience.” This post Waymo’s Secret Weapon: How Gemini AI is Transforming Robotaxi Rides with a Powerful New Assistant first appeared on BitcoinWorld .",AI News|AI Assistant|Autonomous Driving|GEMINI|Robotaxis|Waymo,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-12-24 16:40:11

New technology is changing everything, and advertising money is drying up. The numbers don’t look good. Media and entertainment companies are expected to grow earnings by 6.9% next year. The broader market? Projected to hit 10% growth. Tom Ward at Bloomberg Intelligence says advertising problems and artificial intelligence uncertainty aren’t going anywhere. Stock prices in the sector already took a beating in 2025. Trade disputes and political mess have made European businesses nervous. Advertising budgets get cut first when companies worry about the future. Media firms that depend on ad revenue are feeling the squeeze. There’s a direct link between ad spending and economic confidence, Ward says. When things look bad, businesses pull back on campaigns. The damage is real. In October, advertising giant WPP Plc slashed its outlook. It has seen a 60% drop this year, as reported by Cryptopolitan previously. Clients were leaving, and demand evaporated. A month later, British broadcaster ITV Plc said anxiety over the UK budget crushed advertising demand. The company needs to find £35 million ($47 million) in savings to offset lost revenue. TV networks saw ad sales drop by mid-single-digit percentages on average last year, according to Ward’s calculations. When will it turn around? Nobody knows. Advertising troubles are just part of the story Artificial intelligence has become another big worry. Silvia Cuneo from Deutsche Bank AG says AI emerged as a new threat right when trade issues seemed to be settling down. Companies like Informa Plc and online platforms Rightmove Plc and Scout24 SE are caught in the middle. AI could make their tools more efficient and create new revenue. But it could also replace their main products and wipe out entire parts of their business. Some areas face more risk. John Davies at Bloomberg Intelligence points to Pearson Plc’s digital college courses as particularly vulnerable. Academic publishers like Springer Nature AG & Co KGaA have another problem. Cuts to US research funding hurt them because they make significant money from academic journals. Not everyone thinks AI is such a big threat. Daniel Kerven and Lara Simpson at JPMorgan Chase & Co. say the fears are overblown. They expect a “more nuanced” market response this year. Companies that don’t adapt will struggle The situation is still changing, Cuneo notes. It could take years to understand AI’s real impact across different sectors. Companies that started early will win. The ones treating AI as both opportunity and risk. Scout24, a German property website, is doing it right. The company built AI tools for real estate agents to create listings and improve photos. These features let Scout24 charge more for business services, says Doyinsola Sanyaolu at Citigroup Inc. The company’s data also creates partnership possibilities with AI language model providers. Sanyaolu calls Scout24 “among the most innovative” in the space. Investor confidence will probably stay low this year while everyone watches how AI plays out for these companies. Economic conditions remain weak, Cuneo says, and AI disruption keeps dominating the conversation. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

On Wednesday, USD1’s market value rose by about $150 million, climbing from roughly $2.74 billion to $2.9 billion, according to figures cited alongside Binance’s announcement of its new “USD1 Boost Program.” USD1 Daily MarketCap Source: CoinGecko The increase followed Binance’s decision to offer enhanced yields of up to 20% annual percentage rate on USD1 held in its Simple Earn Flexible products. The promotion, which runs from December 24, 2025, to January 23, 2026, is structured to combine Binance’s standard real-time APR with additional bonus tiered rewards. Binance Targets Passive Yield Seekers With Limited-Time USD1 Boost Binance said the campaign is designed to help USD1 holders increase passive returns during the limited-time window, with subscriptions allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Under the program’s mechanics, users who subscribe to USD1 Flexible products can earn rewards through two streams. The real-time APR accrues minute by minute and is automatically added to users’ Earn accounts, while the bonus tiered APR is calculated separately and credited daily to users’ Spot accounts, starting the day after rewards begin accumulating. Source: Binance Binance set a minimum subscription amount of 0.01 USD1 and capped participation at 2 million USD1 per user. Bonus APR tiers apply to balances up to 50,000 USD1, with any amount above that threshold earning only the standard real-time rate. Participation requires navigating to the Simple Earn section, selecting USD1, choosing the Flexible option, and completing the subscription process. The USD1 Boost is part of Binance’s broader lineup of “Boost” programs, which the exchange uses to drive engagement across different parts of its platform. Other Boost offerings include BNB Boost, which allows users to borrow BNB at preferential rates to qualify for higher VIP tiers, and LiquidityBoost programs that reward market makers with fee rebates on selected trading pairs. Incentives, Airdrops, and Deals Fuel USD1’s Rapid Ascent on Binance Binance has positioned these initiatives as time-limited incentives designed to optimize capital usage and encourage activity within its ecosystem. The latest promotion comes amid a series of developments that have steadily expanded USD1’s footprint. In June, World Liberty Financial announced that it had airdropped about $4 million worth of USD1 to holders of its WLFI token, distributing roughly $47 in USD1 to each eligible wallet outside certain jurisdictions. The Trump-affiliated World Liberty Financial airdropped an estimated $4 million worth of USD1 to holders of its native token this week. #WorldLibertyFinancial #USD1 https://t.co/maLUNfTIuz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 4, 2025 The airdrop was carried out on Ethereum and was framed as a live test of the project’s distribution infrastructure. Binance has also taken steps to deepen its support for the stablecoin. On Dec. 11, the exchange added fee-free USD1 trading pairs against major cryptocurrencies and said it would convert collateral backing its Binance USD product into USD1 at a one-to-one ratio. @Binance has widened access to the Trump family–linked USD1 stablecoin, adding new fee-free trading pairs. #Binance #Trump https://t.co/s0vD9yk357 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 12, 2025 Earlier this year, USD1 was used to settle MGX’s $2 billion investment into Binance , a transaction disclosed by Eric Trump during a panel at Token2049 in Dubai. These integrations have helped push USD1 into the ranks of the world’s largest stablecoins by market capitalization, placing it seventh globally, behind PayPal’s PYUSD. Source: CoinGecko World Liberty Financial’s crypto activities, including USD1, have been reported to generate about $802 million in income during the first half of 2025. At the same time, the project has drawn scrutiny. A July Bloomberg report cited anonymous sources claiming Binance contributed code to USD1’s development, a claim Binance founder Changpeng Zhao disputed, saying the report contained factual errors. Separately, U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jack Reed have urged federal authorities to investigate World Liberty Financial’s alleged ties to illicit actors, allegations the company has denied.

56301263,https://bitzo.com/2025/12/bitcoin-casinos-in-europe-2026-trusted-btc-gambling-sites-reviewed,1766595054,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/56301263.jpeg,Bitcoin Casinos in Europe 2026: Trusted BTC Gambling Sites Reviewed,https://bitzo.com/2025/12/bitcoin-casinos-in-europe-2026-trusted-btc-gambling-sites-reviewed,"Bitcoin casinos have become a major part of online gambling in Europe, driven by faster payouts, fewer banking restrictions, and growing demand for privacy. Players are increasingly choosing BTC gambling sites that offer transparent gameplay, reliable withdrawals, and access across borders without relying on traditional payment systems. In this review, we take a close look at trusted Bitcoin casinos available to European players, compare key features, and highlight platforms that combine security, speed, and a modern crypto-native experience. Why Bitcoin Casinos Are Growing in Europe Bitcoin casinos are gaining traction across Europe not because they are trendy, but because they solve practical problems that traditional online casinos struggle with. Players want faster access to their winnings, fewer payment hurdles, and the ability to play across borders without dealing with local banking friction. At a structural level, BTC gambling fits the European market well: Europe is highly fragmented in terms of banking and regulation Cross-border players often face card declines or payment blocks Traditional payouts can take days, sometimes longer Privacy expectations are higher than in many other regions Bitcoin bypasses most of these issues. Another important factor is speed. Bitcoin casinos typically process withdrawals faster than fiat-based platforms, especially when players are already comfortable managing their own wallets. For many users, the ability to withdraw BTC directly — without waiting for bank approval — is a major reason to switch. There is also a trust component. European players have become more selective after years of aggressive bonus terms, hidden limits, and slow cashouts at traditional casinos. Bitcoin casinos tend to be more transparent about: Withdrawal limits On-chain transactions Game fairness mechanisms Bonus conditions When payouts are visible on-chain, trust shifts from promises to verifiable actions. Finally, Bitcoin has matured as a payment method. What once felt experimental is now widely accepted, familiar, and easy to use. Wallets are simpler, transaction fees are more predictable, and BTC has become a standard option rather than a novelty. All of this explains why Bitcoin casinos are no longer niche platforms in Europe — they are increasingly the preferred alternative for players who value speed, autonomy, and control. Are Bitcoin Casinos Legal in Europe? The short answer is: it depends on the country. Europe does not operate under a single, unified gambling law, and Bitcoin casinos sit in a grey area between traditional online gambling and crypto-based services. That said, most Bitcoin casinos used by European players operate legally under international gambling licenses. Here’s how it usually works in practice: No single EU-wide regulationEach European country regulates online gambling independently. Some allow offshore casinos, others restrict or partially block them, but enforcement varies widely. International licenses are the normTrusted Bitcoin casinos typically operate under licenses such as: Curaçao Malta (MGA, less common for pure BTC casinos) Other offshore jurisdictions These licenses allow platforms to legally offer services to players from multiple European countries. Bitcoin itself is legal in most of EuropeWhile gambling laws differ, Bitcoin ownership and usage are legal across the majority of European countries. This makes BTC a viable payment method even when local gambling regulation is strict. Player responsibility mattersIn most cases, responsibility falls on the player to ensure that online gambling is permitted in their jurisdiction. This is not unique to Bitcoin casinos — the same applies to many fiat-based platforms. There is also the question of KYC. Some Bitcoin casinos require full identity verification, others operate with minimal or no KYC unless certain thresholds are reached. This does not automatically make a platform illegal — it reflects different compliance models and risk policies. Legality and trust are not the same thing.A licensed casino can still be a poor choice if payouts are slow or terms are unclear. For European players, the safest approach is to focus on reputation, transparency, and payout history, rather than relying solely on licensing labels. This is exactly why reviews and comparisons of trusted Bitcoin casinos matter. How to Choose a Trusted Bitcoin Casino Not all Bitcoin casinos are created equal. Some focus on fast onboarding but fail on withdrawals. Others look reputable but hide restrictive terms deep in the fine print. For European players, choosing the right BTC casino comes down to a mix of transparency, technology, and reputation. Before signing up, it’s worth checking a few core criteria. What Really Matters When Choosing a Bitcoin Casino Bitcoin Withdrawal SpeedFast deposits are common. Fast withdrawals are not.A trusted Bitcoin casino should process BTC payouts within a clear and reasonable timeframe, without unexplained delays. Transparency and FairnessLook for platforms that clearly explain: Bonus terms Withdrawal limits Game mechanics Provably fair games or verifiable results are a strong plus. Licensing and ReputationWhile licensing alone is not a guarantee, reputable casinos usually: Operate under a known international license Have a visible track record Are discussed positively in player communities KYC PolicyBitcoin casinos follow different compliance models. Some require KYC upfront Others only request verification after large withdrawals A few operate with minimal checks What matters most is that the policy is clearly stated, not introduced unexpectedly. Withdrawal Limits and FeesPay attention to: Daily or weekly withdrawal caps Network fees passed to the player Minimum cashout amounts Hidden limits are one of the most common complaints among BTC casino users. Game Providers and VarietyA strong Bitcoin casino should offer: Recognized slot providers Live casino games Fair RNG-based titles A thin game library is often a sign of a short-term operation. User Experience and SupportEven crypto-native platforms need responsive support. Clean navigation, clear balance tracking, and fast help when needed all contribute to long-term trust. A trusted Bitcoin casino doesn’t rely on hype — it relies on consistency. For European players, the safest approach is to choose platforms that combine crypto-friendly features with proven operational stability. Speed, clarity, and predictable payouts matter far more than flashy bonuses. Trusted Bitcoin Casinos in Europe Reviewed Dexsport — Bitcoin Casino with Sports & Live Betting Dexsport stands out among European-facing Bitcoin casinos by combining casino gameplay with a full sportsbook and live betting. Rather than positioning itself as a pure slots platform, Dexsport is built as a crypto-native gambling ecosystem where BTC is not an afterthought, but a core payment method. From the first interaction, the platform feels designed for speed and flexibility. Deposits in Bitcoin are processed quickly, balances update without friction, and players are not pushed through unnecessary steps before they can start playing. What makes Dexsport particularly attractive for BTC players is the breadth of use cases: Bitcoin casino games (slots, live dealer games) Sports betting with BTC Live betting across multiple markets Seamless switching between casino and sportsbook This matters because many Bitcoin casinos limit BTC usage to casino games only. Dexsport does not. Casino and Games with Bitcoin Dexsport offers a solid casino section that covers: Popular slot titles from established providers Live casino games such as roulette and blackjack Fast-loading games that work smoothly across devices Gameplay feels responsive, and BTC balances integrate naturally without conversion friction. For players who value simplicity, this creates a smoother experience than juggling multiple wallets or platforms. Bitcoin Sports and Live Betting Where Dexsport clearly separates itself is in sports and live betting with Bitcoin. BTC can be used to: Place pre-match sports bets Bet live during ongoing events Cash out winnings without switching currencies Live betting, in particular, benefits from Dexsport’s crypto-first design. Odds update smoothly, markets stay open longer, and bet execution remains fast even during high-action moments. Bonuses, Transparency, and Trust Dexsport offers bonuses and promotions that are designed to support active play rather than trap users in long wagering cycles. Terms are clearly explained, and there are no hidden conditions tied specifically to Bitcoin withdrawals. Key trust signals include: Clear bonus rules Predictable withdrawal behavior Transparent platform mechanics Dexsport feels less like a “casino with crypto” and more like a platform built around crypto from day one. For European players looking for a Bitcoin casino that combines casino games, sports betting, and live wagering in one place, Dexsport sets a strong benchmark. Stake — Feature-Rich Bitcoin Casino with Live Betting Stake is a high-liquidity Bitcoin casino and sportsbook widely used by European players. The platform combines casino games, sports betting, and live betting in a single interface, with Bitcoin fully supported alongside other cryptocurrencies. Stake is best known for: Competitive odds and deep sports markets Advanced live betting features and statistics Strong overall liquidity across games and bets At the same time, it follows a more traditional compliance model. KYC is required for withdrawals, and bonus wagering conditions can be demanding. Stake suits players who value features and volume over anonymity. Bitcasino — Established Bitcoin-Only Casino Bitcasino is one of the longest-running Bitcoin casinos and focuses almost entirely on casino gambling with BTC. It does not try to blend sportsbook features or hybrid products, instead prioritizing a stable and predictable casino experience. Bitcasino stands out for: Casino-first design with strong slot and live dealer selection Bitcoin-native payments without unnecessary conversions Long operational history and consistent payouts The platform is best suited for players who want a classic Bitcoin casino environment rather than sports or live betting options. BC.Game — High-Volume Bitcoin Casino Platform BC.Game is designed for high-volume play and attracts a global audience, including many European users. The platform focuses heavily on casino gaming, with Bitcoin as a primary payment option and a strong VIP-oriented ecosystem. BC.Game is known for: Large game selection and high betting limits Bitcoin-first deposits and withdrawals Frequent bonuses and loyalty rewards However, the experience is clearly casino-driven. Sports and live betting exist, but they are not the platform’s main strength. For players who prioritize casino volume and frequent promotions over a balanced gambling setup, BC.Game fits well. Comparison Table — Bitcoin Casinos for European Players Below is a simplified comparison of trusted Bitcoin casinos commonly used by European players. The focus is on BTC usability, trust factors, and overall positioning rather than minor feature differences. Casino BTC Support KYC Policy Main Focus Withdrawal Speed Best For Dexsport Yes No mandatory KYC Casino + Sports + Live Betting Fast All-around BTC gambling Stake Yes KYC for withdrawals Sportsbook + Casino Fast–Medium Liquidity & features Bitcasino Yes Limited / selective Casino-only Medium Classic BTC casino play BC.Game Yes Minimal / conditional High-volume casino Medium VIP & high rollers This comparison highlights an important distinction. Most Bitcoin casinos in Europe specialize in one core use case — either casino play or sports betting. Dexsport stands out by offering both in a crypto-native environment, without forcing players to switch platforms or payment methods. Final Verdict — Best Bitcoin Casino for European Players Bitcoin casinos have firmly established themselves as a serious alternative to traditional online gambling platforms in Europe. Faster payouts, fewer banking restrictions, and greater transparency have made BTC gambling especially attractive to players who value control and flexibility. That said, not all Bitcoin casinos serve the same purpose. Some focus almost exclusively on casino games, others lean heavily into volume and promotions, and many still rely on traditional custodial models that introduce KYC friction at the withdrawal stage. In this landscape, Dexsport stands out as the most balanced option for European players. It combines a Bitcoin casino with a full sportsbook and live betting, all built around a crypto-native infrastructure. BTC is not treated as a secondary payment method — it is fully integrated into gameplay, betting, and withdrawals. Dexsport is particularly well suited for players who: Want to gamble and bet with Bitcoin on a single platform Value fast payouts and predictable withdrawal behavior Prefer clear bonus terms without hidden restrictions Enjoy both casino games and live sports betting Rather than excelling in just one narrow category, Dexsport delivers a consistent experience across casino play, sports betting, and live wagering — which is still rare among Bitcoin casinos available to European users. For players looking for a trusted Bitcoin casino in Europe that prioritizes speed, transparency, and real usability over hype, Dexsport represents a strong and reliable choice.",More News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-12-24 16:50:54

According to the model, all three assets are entering a period of heightened volatility, with the potential for sharp price movements beginning around Christmas and extending into early 2026, a window historically marked by thin liquidity and exaggerated market reactions. Claude AI Projects SOL $275–$400 Bull Case vs $110–$150 Bear Range Claude AI’s bullish outlook for Solana aligns closely with projections from Bitwise and other institutional analysts who expect SOL to set new all-time highs by 2026, with upside targets ranging between $275 and $400. This thesis is anchored on three core drivers: accelerating ETF adoption, improving technical infrastructure, and growing real-world asset tokenization. Source: Claude AI By mid-2025, Solana-linked ETFs had already attracted more than $2 billion in inflows, with JPMorgan estimating that figure could reach $6 billion by mid-2026. Source: TradingView On-chain fundamentals further reinforce this optimism, as Solana’s total value locked surged to $4.6 billion, while the network processes tens of millions of daily transactions across DeFi, gaming, and NFT ecosystems. However, Claude’s bearish scenario highlights technical fragility and macro risks. Key support at $116–120 remains critical, with a breakdown potentially opening a move toward $110–150. Claude AI Says XRP Targets $5–$8 Upside With $1.40–$2.15 Downside Risk Claude AI identifies regulatory clarity and ETF-driven institutional demand as the backbone of XRP’s bullish case. Following Ripple’s settlement with the SEC, XRP ETFs reportedly attracted over $1 billion within weeks, with projections of $4–8 billion in inflows by late 2026. This surge has removed roughly 15% of the circulating supply from exchanges, introducing structural scarcity. The launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin adds another layer, as increased stablecoin activity could drive XRP liquidity demand. Tokenized real-world assets on the XRP Ledger reached $394.6 million, while Ripple has stated ambitions to capture 14% of SWIFT’s $20+ trillion payment volume over the next five years. Under supportive macro conditions and continued regulatory clarity, Claude projects XRP could reach $5–8 by the end of 2026. The bearish outlook, however, centers on declining on-chain usage. Monthly transaction volumes have trended downward for two years, raising doubts about XRP’s role as a bridge currency. Competition from stablecoins like USDC and high-performance chains such as Solana and Cardano further pressures adoption. XRP remains 48% below its July 2025 high of $3.66, and failure to break resistance near $2.35 could see it consolidate between $1.40 and $2.15 through 2026. Anthropic’s Claude AI Says SUI Targets $4–$7 Growth Despite $1.10–$1.70 Consolidation Risk Claude AI assigns SUI a bullish target range of $4–7, driven by explosive DeFi growth and rising institutional interest. Sui’s TVL has surged from $25 million at launch to over $2.6 billion, making it the fastest-growing non-EVM Layer-1 . Daily DEX volumes reached $367.9 million, while stablecoin market capitalization surpassed $415 million following native USDC integration. Institutional momentum is building, with Grayscale launching SUI Trust products and 21Shares filing for a spot ETF. Still, SUI trades 67% below its $4.33 all-time high and below its 200-day moving average, signaling technical damage. Despite strong ecosystem metrics, price weakness reflects investor caution. Claude’s bearish scenario places SUI in a $1.10–1.70 consolidation range if macro conditions deteriorate post-2025. Maxi Doge (MAXI) Presale Draws $4.4M in Early Capital While Claude’s analysis focuses on large-cap assets, early-stage presales can offer asymmetric upside. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has raised nearly $4.4 million and positions itself as a next-generation Dogecoin alternative on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network. The presale offers staking rewards of up to 71% APY, with the token currently priced at $0.0002745 ahead of scheduled stage increases.

The draft, known as “ The Cat ,” would mark millions of dust-sized outputs containing NFT data as permanently unspendable through a consensus-level soft fork. The proposal targets what its author, Claire Ostrom, describes as an unprecedented explosion in Bitcoin’s UTXO set. Between 2009 and early 2023, the UTXO database grew gradually to roughly 80-90 million entries. Source: Bitcoin Development Mailing List Within just one year, it doubled to over 160 million entries, with analyses suggesting nearly half of all UTXOs now contain less than 1,000 satoshis. The Cat would identify these outputs using external indexers like Ord and Stamps, then render them permanently unspendable while allowing nodes to prune them from the UTXO set entirely. Maxwell Calls Proposal “Outright Theft” Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell delivered harsh criticism, calling the proposal a “ total non-starter ” that would constitute theft. “ The proposal would intentionally and knowingly confiscate millions of dollars in funds, ” Maxwell wrote in response to the Bitcoin development mailing list. Maxwell disputed claims that spam filters are ineffective, arguing that the current setup already blocks most pointless data storage, except for uses that are more valuable because of Bitcoin’s limitations. He warned the proposal would likely trigger a flood of evasion transactions while failing to stop NFT trading , since indexers operate independently of consensus rules. “ NFTs are just an imaginary parallel world that don’t depend on the network to validate their activity, ” Maxwell explained. Source: Bitcoin Development Mailing List The legendary developer also criticized the proposal’s length and technical complexity, suggesting it should have been floated as a simple question about discouraging NFTs rather than dense technical documentation. He pointed to the potential misuse of language models , leading to unnecessarily complex proposals that waste participants’ time. Supporters See Essential UTXO Cleanup Bitcoin Mechanic, a prominent anti-spam advocate, offered cautious support despite acknowledging philosophical concerns about UTXO deletion. “ I don’t consider it unreasonable for Bitcoin users to do this if they see fit as the UTXO set is something that they must contribute resources to maintaining in perpetuity, ” he wrote. The proposal’s supporters emphasize that between 40-50% of the UTXO set consists of spam outputs with dust amounts. Removing these would provide substantial disk space savings, particularly for maximally pruned nodes. Developer Nona YoBidnes argued the proposal would send a strong signal to discourage future spam activity. “ Less spam is the objective here. I’m not concerned with the price of spam, only the quantity, ” Nona stated. However, supporters acknowledge the unprecedented nature of consensus-level UTXO deletion. Bitcoin Mechanic noted that while spam filters can be easily fixed if misconfigured, mistaken UTXO deletion would be catastrophic. The proposal addresses this by imposing extensive verification requirements and encouraging the community to independently validate snapshots of the targeted outputs. Alternative Proposal Emerges A competing proposal called “ Lynx ” by Matteo Pellegrini takes a different approach, suggesting periodic cleanup tied to Bitcoin’s halving schedule rather than targeting specific protocols. At each halving, UTXOs below 999 satoshis that remained unspent for 4 years would become permanently unspendable. Pellegrini argues this threshold-based method avoids The Cat’s reliance on external indexers and protocol-specific targeting. “ By using a threshold rather than a list, Lynx requires no external indexers, makes no judgment about why a UTXO is small, and applies equally to all participants, ” the proposal states. Maxwell also rejected Lynx, noting that dust thresholds aren’t consensus parameters and that predictably inactive outputs have minimal performance impact. He suggested the mailing list should ban future proposals to confiscate coins for a year, warning that they risk undermining public confidence in Bitcoin. Escalating Battle Over Bitcoin’s Purpose The controversy follows months of escalating tensions over Bitcoin’s role. Earlier this year, Ordinals leader Leonidas threatened to fund a Bitcoin Core fork if developers attempted censorship, claiming support from miners controlling over 50% of the hash rate and startups that contributed over $500 million in transaction fees since 2023. Ordinals ecosystem leader Leonidas threatened to fund a Bitcoin Core fork if developers attempt to censor Ordinals transactions ahead of the controversial v30 upgrade. #Bitcoin #Ordinals https://t.co/bYYY1ZKR3i — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 8, 2025 The same month, Developer Jimmy Song also criticized the earlier Taproot upgrade for creating a “ social attack surface ” that enabled spam-like activity, arguing it failed to deliver on privacy promises while opening the door to nonfinancial transactions. Meanwhile, the October Bitcoin Core v30 upgrade removed the 80-byte OP_RETURN limit, enabling data payloads of up to 4MB per transaction. The change also sparked an exodus to Bitcoin Knots, an alternative implementation that now represents 28% of the network.

The admission, shared publicly on X, has reignited debate over discipline, timing, and emotional control in long-term crypto investing. XRP’s Perfect Entry, Failed Exit The investment began with a disciplined entry. In early 2017, two participants collectively invested $1,200 into XRP at approximately $0.007, accumulating 171,428 tokens. From a market timing perspective, the entry was near optimal. XRP later surged during the cycle, briefly trading close to its peak and lifting the position’s value to roughly $770,000. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Bitcoin Make Or Break Level Amid Campaign For $90,000 At this stage, the trade had already achieved what most investors aim for: asymmetric upside realized within a single market cycle. However, the position was never exited. Despite clear signs of market euphoria and a dramatic expansion in price, the gains remained unrealized. The analyst later acknowledged that hesitation and emotional attachment prevented decisive action, effectively transforming a winning trade into a missed opportunity. This hesitation exposed a structural weakness in the strategy: there was no enforced exit discipline. While the entry was carefully planned, the decision to sell depended on the moments when emotional pressures are strongest and risk perception is most skewed. The scenario highlights a recurring issue in crypto markets, where many investors focus heavily on asset selection and timing entries, yet underestimate how psychologically demanding exits can be during periods of rapid price growth. The Missed Rotation And Compounding Effect Of Inaction The second failure compounded the first. The analyst explained that selling XRP near its peak would have freed capital to redeploy into Bitcoin while BTC traded around $1,000. That move could have converted the XRP proceeds into roughly 771 Bitcoin, effectively positioning the portfolio to benefit from the next major phase of the market cycle. Related Reading: Analyst Shares ‘Cold, Hard Truth’ For Bitcoin Investors As Price Struggles Holding those Bitcoin through later highs—approaching 170,000 CAD—would have resulted in total proceeds exceeding $130 million. The strategy was simple and systematic: take profits from an outperforming asset and rotate into another with asymmetric upside potential. It required no leverage, no complex instruments, and no precise market timing beyond a broad understanding of overall market cycles. However, hesitation, second-guessing, and attachment to the original position prevented decisive action. By delaying the rotation, the investor forfeited the compounding advantage, leaving the portfolio largely static while the broader market continued to advance. The analyst’s reflection highlights how the crypto market consistently rewards preparation and disciplined execution but punishes hesitation. This experience serves as a stark reminder that the ability to act decisively at critical moments is often the true determinant of long-term success in crypto investing.

After reaching a crucial peak in network performance, the leading blockchain could be on the verge of another major achievement. Another Incoming Record For Ethereum In a significant development, the on-chain momentum of Ethereum is growing quietly, but convincingly. With rising network performance and utilization, the network is poised to make history, as revealed in a recent research from Leon Waidmann, a market expert and head of research at The On-Chain Foundation. Even while the Ethereum price has fallen, its ecosystem has managed to handle an increasing amount of activity throughout the year. In the post on X, Waidmann highlighted that the ecosystem is on track to close 2025 with another transaction all-time high in this month of December. As seen on the chart, the leading network is drawing dangerously close to challenging and beating its previous all-time high once again in the remaining days of this month. Interestingly, this strong performance highlights the ongoing role of ETH as the foundation of on-chain commerce. Waidmann noted that aggregate Ethereum, with the total transaction count of Layer 2s, is persistently pushing higher. Several other major chains, such as Base, Arbitrum, Optimism (OP), World Chain, and the ETH mainnet, are all contributing meaningfully to the sharp surge in on-chain activity. In the midst of the growing Ethereum ecosystem, the growth is not fueled by a single outlier, but rather is distributed throughout the stack. These include Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Layer 2 networks, and Real-World Applications (RWA) . ETH Network Is Dominating The DeFi Sector Ethereum’s network performance extends into the DeFi sector and seems to be leading the charge, surpassing other major blockchains. Following an examination of the dynamic sector, Joseph Young, an Ethereum narrator, disclosed that the blockchain currently controls over 68.2% of all pure DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL). Related Reading: Ethereum Takes The Lead In DeFi Lending Revenue, Leaving Rivals Behind – See How To put it in value, over $69.3 billion has been deployed on smart contracts on ETH. The achievement highlights a fresh surge in capital concentration around the fundamental protocols of the blockchain. This is possible with liquidity, developer activity, and institutional conviction still favoring the network over other chains. Young stated that the figure is more than the DeFi capital of Solana, Tron, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Bitcoin, Avalanche, and every other chain put together. As a result of this growing dominance, the expert has declared ETH the most trusted settlement layer of finance. At the time of writing, the price of Ethereum was trading at $2,931, indicating a 1% decline in the last 24 hours. As the price flips negative, trading volume has also turned bearish, falling by over 7% over the past day.",Ethereum|Arbitrum|avalanche|Base|Binance Smart Chain|bitcoin|BSC|decentralized finance|DeFi|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum Mainnet|Ethereum network|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Joseph Young|Leon Waidmann|nfts|Non Fungible Tokens|On-Chain Foundatio|OP|Optimism|solana|Total Value Locked|tron|TVL|World Chain,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|TRADING|ARB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-24 17:00:54

As the number of crypto casinos grows, licensing has turned into a key differentiator — affecting payouts, transparency, and long-term platform stability. In this review, we focus on licensed Bitcoin casinos that combine BTC gambling with clear rules, proven infrastructure, and a modern crypto-native experience. What Makes a Bitcoin Casino “Licensed” and Why It Matters A licensed Bitcoin casino operates under a recognized gambling authority that grants it the legal right to offer casino games and related services. While crypto casinos differ from traditional online casinos in how payments and wallets work, licensing still plays a crucial role in accountability. For players, a license usually means: The casino follows basic operational standards Games and software providers are vetted There is a formal framework for disputes and complaints Withdrawal rules and bonus terms must be disclosed Most licensed crypto casinos serving international and European players operate under jurisdictions such as Curaçao or Anjouan. These licenses are commonly used by cryptocurrency online casinos because they allow global access while supporting crypto payments. It’s important to understand one nuance:a license does not automatically guarantee quality, but it does create a baseline level of responsibility. Unlicensed platforms may function well in the short term, but they offer little recourse if problems arise. This is why licensing is often the first filter when choosing a best cryptocurrency casino. Licensed Crypto Casinos vs Unlicensed Platforms At first glance, licensed and unlicensed crypto casinos may look similar. Both can offer Bitcoin deposits, live casino games, and large bonuses. The difference becomes clear over time — especially when it comes to withdrawals, disputes, and platform consistency. Licensed crypto casinos typically provide: Clearly stated bonus and wagering terms Defined withdrawal limits and processing rules Ongoing operational oversight A stronger incentive to protect long-term reputation Unlicensed platforms, on the other hand, may offer more freedom initially but often lack transparency once issues appear. Licensing doesn’t make a casino perfect — it makes it accountable. Licensed Bitcoin Casinos Reviewed in This Guide Below are the licensed crypto casinos covered in this review: Dexsport CoinCasino Wild.io BetMode Cybet BC.Game Stake In the next section, we’ll compare these platforms side by side using key criteria such as licensing, BTC support, KYC policies, game variety, and withdrawal speed — before diving into detailed reviews of each casino. Comparison Table — Licensed Bitcoin Casinos Reviewed The table below compares licensed Bitcoin casinos based on the factors that matter most to crypto players: licensing, BTC support, transparency, game variety, and withdrawal behavior. Casino License BTC Support KYC Policy Casino & Live Games Withdrawal Speed Best For Dexsport Curaçao Yes (BTC + multi-crypto) No mandatory KYC Casino, Live Casino, Sports & Live Betting Fast All-in-one crypto gambling CoinCasino Curaçao Yes No KYC (most users) Casino, Live Casino, Provably Fair Fast Privacy-focused players Wild.io Curaçao Yes Conditional KYC Large Casino, Live Casino Fast Game variety & bonuses BetMode Anjouan Yes Minimal KYC Casino, Live Casino, Web3 Originals Fast On-chain transparency Cybet Anjouan Yes Conditional KYC Casino, Sportsbook, Esports Fast Hybrid casino + betting BC.Game Curaçao Yes Minimal / conditional Massive Casino, Live Casino, Originals Fast VIP & long-term rewards Stake Curaçao Yes KYC for withdrawals Casino, Live Casino, Sportsbook Fast Liquidity & brand trust This comparison highlights an important pattern. Most licensed crypto casinos excel in one specific area — game volume, bonuses, privacy, or sportsbook liquidity. Very few offer a balanced experience across casino gaming, live tables, and sports betting without adding friction at the withdrawal stage. That balance is where Dexsport positions itself most clearly: as a licensed crypto casino that integrates casino games, live casino, and sports betting into a single BTC-friendly platform. Dexsport — Licensed Crypto Casino with Sports & Live Betting Dexsport is a licensed crypto-native casino designed for players who want to use Bitcoin across casino games, live tables, and sports betting without friction. BTC is fully integrated into the platform rather than added as a secondary payment option. Deposits are fast, balances update instantly, and players can move freely between casino and sportsbook sections. This makes Dexsport suitable for both casual casino play and more active betting. Casino, Live Casino, and Sports Betting Dexsport covers the core areas expected from a modern cryptocurrency online casino: Slot games from established providers Live casino tables such as roulette and blackjack Sports and live betting with Bitcoin Live betting is particularly smooth, with stable odds updates and reliable bet execution during active events. Crypto Integration and Bonuses Bitcoin withdrawals follow clear rules, and bonus terms are transparent. Promotions are designed to complement regular play rather than lock users into overly complex wagering requirements. Dexsport works as an all-in-one licensed crypto casino, combining BTC gambling, live casino, and sports betting in a single environment. For players looking for a casino with cryptocurrency that balances licensing, usability, and flexibility, Dexsport stands out as a strong benchmark. CoinCasino — Privacy-First Crypto Casino CoinCasino is a licensed Bitcoin casino focused on fast gameplay and player privacy. The platform operates without mandatory KYC for most users and supports major cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, USDT, and DOGE. CoinCasino offers a large game library with slots, live casino tables, and provably fair games. Withdrawals are typically fast, and the interface remains lightweight and mobile-friendly. Best suited for players who value anonymity and a straightforward casino experience over complex features. Wild.io — High-Volume Licensed Crypto Casino Wild.io stands out for its extensive game selection and aggressive bonus structure. With thousands of slots, live dealer games, and frequent promotions, it appeals to players who prioritize variety. Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals are processed quickly, and the platform includes a tiered VIP system for active users. Wagering requirements are higher than average, which makes Wild.io better suited for experienced players rather than casual ones. BetMode — Web3-Native Casino with On-Chain Transparency BetMode introduces a more technical approach to crypto gambling. Licensed and built around blockchain transparency, BetMode allows players to verify results on-chain and earn real-time rakeback. The casino blends traditional slots and live tables with Web3 mechanics, including staking and token-based rewards. It’s a good fit for users who are comfortable with DeFi concepts and want deeper crypto integration. Cybet — New Licensed Crypto Casino & Sportsbook Cybet is a newer licensed platform combining a casino, sportsbook, and esports betting in one interface. While still building its long-term reputation, Cybet already offers a clean layout, competitive bonuses, and fast crypto transactions. Its mobile experience is smooth, and BTC withdrawals are generally processed quickly. Cybet suits players looking for a modern, all-in-one crypto gambling platform with growth potential. BC.Game — Large-Scale Crypto Casino Ecosystem BC.Game is one of the largest licensed crypto casinos on the market, offering an enormous game library and multiple reward systems. Bitcoin is deeply integrated alongside many other cryptocurrencies. BC.Game is known for its provably fair games, daily rewards, and strong VIP program. It works best for long-term players who enjoy loyalty mechanics, high volume play, and community-driven features. Stake — Established Crypto Casino & Sportsbook Leader Stake is a well-established licensed platform combining casino games, live casino, and a large sportsbook. It offers high liquidity, polished UX, and instant crypto payments. Stake follows a more traditional compliance model, including KYC at withdrawal stages. It’s best suited for players who prioritize brand reputation, liquidity, and feature depth over privacy. Crypto Casino Software and Integration Explained Behind every licensed crypto casino sits a technology stack that determines how smoothly deposits, games, and withdrawals actually work. For players, this part is invisible — until something goes wrong. Modern cryptocurrency online casinos rely on specialized casino software that supports blockchain payments, wallet integration, and real-time balance updates. Unlike traditional platforms, crypto casinos must handle on-chain transactions while keeping gameplay seamless. At a high level, cryptocurrency casino software typically includes: Wallet integration for BTC and other coins Game aggregation from multiple providers RNG or provably fair verification systems Bonus and wagering logic tied to crypto balances Cryptocurrency Casino Integration: Why It Matters Not all crypto casinos integrate blockchain in the same way. In well-built platforms: Deposits are credited automatically after network confirmation Withdrawals are processed without manual review delays Game balances sync instantly with crypto wallets In weaker implementations, players may face slow cashouts, forced conversions, or unclear transaction tracking. Licensed platforms like Dexsport, BC.Game, and Stake invest heavily in cryptocurrency casino integration because poor backend performance directly impacts trust. When BTC withdrawals are predictable and verifiable, players feel more confident keeping funds on the platform. Provably Fair and Blockchain Transparency Many crypto casinos now offer provably fair games, allowing players to verify outcomes independently. This feature does not replace licensing, but it complements it. Provably fair systems typically allow users to: Check hashes before and after gameplay Verify RNG results on-chain Confirm that outcomes were not altered For experienced crypto users, this level of transparency is a major advantage over traditional online casinos. Cryptocurrency Live Casino and Mobile Crypto Gambling Live casino games are one of the fastest-growing segments in crypto gambling. Players want real dealers, real-time interaction, and instant payouts — without switching to fiat. Cryptocurrency Live Casino Experience Licensed crypto casinos now offer full live casino sections that include: Live roulette and blackjack Game shows and interactive tables BTC-supported betting at live tables The key difference lies in execution. On crypto-native platforms, wagers are placed directly from crypto balances, and winnings are credited without currency conversion or banking delays. This makes cryptocurrency live casino games more fluid, especially for players who switch frequently between slots, live tables, and sports betting. Cryptocurrency Mobile Casino Features Mobile play is no longer optional. A strong cryptocurrency mobile casino should offer: Full game access via mobile browser Fast loading times on weaker connections Stable wallet interaction on small screens Clear navigation between casino sections Most leading licensed crypto casinos are now mobile-first, allowing players to deposit BTC, play live games, and withdraw winnings entirely from a smartphone. If a crypto casino doesn’t work well on mobile, it’s already behind. Bonuses at Licensed Bitcoin Casinos — What to Check Bonuses can add real value to a crypto casino experience, but only when their terms are clear. Licensed platforms tend to be more transparent here, yet conditions still vary significantly. Before claiming any bonus, it’s worth paying attention to a few key points: Wagering requirements — how many times the bonus must be played through Eligible games — not all games contribute equally to wagering BTC vs multi-crypto bonuses — some offers apply only to specific coins Cashback and rakeback — often more flexible than large match bonuses High welcome bonuses may look attractive, but smaller bonuses with lower wagering requirements are often easier to convert into real Bitcoin withdrawals. Licensed casinos usually disclose these details upfront, which helps avoid misunderstandings later. A good bonus supports gameplay — it doesn’t block withdrawals. Risks and Limitations of Licensed Crypto Casinos Licensing improves trust, but it does not eliminate risk entirely. Even at regulated crypto casinos, players should remain aware of potential limitations. Common risks include: Overuse of bonuses with high wagering requirements Volatility when playing with non-stable cryptocurrencies Conditional KYC requests after large withdrawals Losses amplified by fast-paced gameplay Crypto casinos also place more responsibility on the player. Wallet security, transaction accuracy, and bankroll discipline all matter more when payments are irreversible. Licensed platforms reduce uncertainty — they do not replace personal responsibility. Final Verdict — Best Licensed Bitcoin Casino Licensed Bitcoin casinos represent the most mature segment of the crypto gambling market. They combine blockchain payments with regulatory oversight, creating platforms that are faster than traditional casinos while still offering structure and accountability. Across the platforms reviewed, each serves a different type of player. Some focus on massive game libraries, others on privacy, rewards, or Web3-style transparency. Among them, Dexsport stands out as the most balanced option. It successfully combines a licensed crypto casino , live casino games, and a full sportsbook into a single Bitcoin-friendly platform. BTC integration is seamless, bonus terms are clear, and withdrawals follow predictable rules. For players looking for a best cryptocurrency online casino that prioritizes usability, transparency, and flexibility — without sacrificing trust — Dexsport represents a strong and reliable choice.

On the XRP Ledger (XRPL), this challenge is even more pronounced. Designed for speed, determinism, and large-scale value transfer , XRPL was never built to mirror Ethereum-style DeFi. Instead, lending on XRPL is evolving along a more disciplined, risk-aware path—one that aligns closely with traditional financial principles. That framework was recently clarified by Vet, a respected XRPL validator and long-standing ecosystem contributor, who outlined how a lending protocol can function on XRP without compromising depositor safety or ledger integrity. His explanation offers a rare look into how yield generation on XRPL can be both sustainable and accountable. Vault-Based Deposits and Asset Structure The protocol begins with depositors placing XRP or XRPL-issued IOUs—such as Ripple’s RLUSD—into a vault. These assets remain transparently accounted for on the ledger, leveraging XRPL’s native support for trustlines and issued currencies. Lending Protocol on XRP 1. Depositor put XRP or IOU like RLUSD into a vault. 2. Loan Broker gives out one or multiple XRP loans out to Borrowers 3. Borrowers pay interest to Loan Broker 4. Loan Broker puts collected interest into vault 5. Vault value increases -> Depositors… pic.twitter.com/DfYN4TObgx — Vet (@Vet_X0) December 23, 2025 Rather than interacting directly with borrowers, depositors gain exposure to yield through the collective vault, simplifying risk distribution and asset management. The Loan Broker as Intermediary A central feature of the design is the Loan Broker. This entity draws liquidity from the vault and issues one or multiple XRP-denominated loans to borrowers. Borrowers repay these loans over time with interest, which is collected by the broker. Crucially, the interest is not retained as profit alone; it is routed back into the vault, steadily increasing its value and generating yield for depositors. This intermediary-based structure mirrors conventional credit markets more closely than peer-to-peer DeFi, prioritizing credit assessment, borrower selection, and capital discipline. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Buffer Mechanism and Default Protection What truly distinguishes this model is how it handles default risk. Vet emphasized that the Loan Broker must provide a buffer—its own capital locked specifically to absorb losses. If a borrower defaults, losses are covered by this buffer first, shielding depositors from immediate harm. Only if defaults exceed the buffer would depositor funds be affected. This requirement forces the broker to maintain “skin in the game,” aligning incentives and discouraging reckless lending. It also addresses one of DeFi’s most persistent weaknesses: risk being socialized while profits remain private. Why This Model Fits XRPL’s Design Philosophy The lending structure Vet described works within XRPL’s architectural constraints rather than against them. It avoids complex on-ledger smart contracts, preserves XRPL’s performance guarantees, and leverages its strengths in settlement, transparency, and asset issuance. As the XRPL ecosystem expands —driven by stablecoins like RLUSD and broader institutional adoption—this approach demonstrates that DeFi on XRP is evolving with intention. Rather than chasing experimental yield, it is building financial infrastructure designed to last. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Gox hacker Aleksey Bilyuchenko transferred another 1,300 BTC worth approximately $114 million to unknown exchanges over the past week, according to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence. The wallets still hold 4,100 BTC , valued at around $360 million, and have now sold a total of 2,300 BTC since distribution activity began in October. Arkham analyst Emmett Gallic reported that the deposits mark an acceleration of a controlled selloff that started months ago. “ The entity related to Aleksey Bilyuchenko has deposited another 1.3K $BTC ($114M) to the unknown exchanges in the past 7 days, ” Gallic stated, adding that total sales have now reached 2,300 BTC while substantial holdings remain intact. The entity related to Aleksey Bilyuchenko has deposited another 1.3K $BTC ($114M) to the unknown exchanges in the past 7 days. They still hold 4.1K $BTC ($360M). They have sold a total of 2.3K $BTC . https://t.co/GtzPKLb5AC pic.twitter.com/asoaz1wBgL — Emmett Gallic (@emmettgallic) December 23, 2025 Controlled Distribution Follows Months-Long Pattern The recent transfers continue a systematic distribution that Gallic first flagged in October when roughly 8,000 BTC connected to the WEX/BTC-e case appeared to be controlled by Russian authorities, specifically the third department of the second service of the CSS of the FSB. Bitcoin belonging to BTC-e co-founder Bilyuchenko had been slowly liquidated through unknown exchanges since mid-October, with 110 BTC deposited in just two days during early November alone. Gallic noted uncertainty about whether Bilyuchenko remains jailed in Russia or continues to control these funds, though Moscow courts have seized most of his other assets. However, the structured nature of the transfers suggests deliberate positioning rather than panic selling, with each deposit carefully routed through exchanges that obscure the final destination of proceeds. So it seems that almost 8K $BTC ($867M) related to the WEX/BTCE case are controlled by Russian authorities (3rd department of the 2nd service of the CSS of the FSB) including the 6.5K $BTC that moved earlier today. pic.twitter.com/9LwhZxvAFb — Emmett Gallic (@emmettgallic) October 17, 2025 Criminal Background Spans Mt. Gox Hack and BTC-e Operations The U.S. Department of Justice unsealed charges against Bilyuchenko and co-conspirator Aleksandr Verner in June 2023, alleging they conspired to launder approximately 647,000 bitcoins stolen from Mt. Gox between September 2011 and May 2014. “ Armed with the ill-gotten gains from Mt. Gox, Bilyuchenko allegedly went on to help set up the notorious BTC-e virtual currency exchange, which laundered funds for cyber criminals worldwide, ” Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. stated at the time. Court documents revealed that Bilyuchenko and Verner gained unauthorized access to Mt. Gox’s servers that held crypto wallets in September 2011, when the exchange was the world’s largest Bitcoin platform, servicing thousands of users. The stolen bitcoins represented the vast majority of Mt. Gox customer holdings and were primarily laundered through bitcoin addresses at two other online exchanges controlled by the conspirators. Bilyuchenko also allegedly operated BTC-e from 2011 until law enforcement shut down the platform in July 2017, working alongside Alexander Vinnik, who was recently returned to Russia in a February prisoner swap with the United States. Alexander Vinnik, the former operator of the now-defunct BTC-e exchange, has been returned to Russia as part of a prisoner swap. #BTC -e #Russia https://t.co/c0nOqfxQuu — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 14, 2025 BTC-e processed over $9 billion in transactions and served approximately one million users worldwide, receiving criminal proceeds from computer intrusions, ransomware events, identity theft schemes, and narcotics distribution rings, according to Justice Department estimates. Whale Selling Compounds Bitcoin’s Year-End Weakness The Bilyuchenko-linked distribution adds another layer of supply pressure to Bitcoin markets already struggling under broader whale selloffs and thinning holiday liquidity. Bitcoin slipped 1.12% below $87,000 today as perpetual open interest dropped $3 billion overnight, leaving markets vulnerable to sharp moves despite reduced leverage heading into Christmas. Wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 BTC collectively reduced their positions by 36,500 BTC, worth approximately $3.37 billion, since early December, contributing to what analysts call Bitcoin’s “ weakest year-end performance in seven years. “ Bitcoin stuck in consolidation as holiday liquidity drains and $23.7 billion options expiry looms, with analysts targeting recovery in 2026. https://t.co/q4BE5awX8t — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 23, 2025 Bitcoin ETFs recorded $650.8 million in outflows over four days, led by BlackRock’s $157 million single-day withdrawal, while Ethereum spot ETFs posted $95.52 million in net outflows. Bitfinex analysts warned that Bitcoin now faces “ a substantial headwind in the form of a dense overhead supply cluster accumulated by top buyers between $94,000 and $120,000. “ The concentration of supply has created a top-heavy market structure in which rebound attempts are increasingly capped by sell pressure, reminiscent of early 2022, when recoveries during bearish phases repeatedly failed to gain traction. Amid the turbulence, most asset managers expect 2026 to be the year in which Bitcoin recovers and regains its strength. However, the ongoing Bilyuchenko selloff, with 4,100 BTC still available for distribution, threatens to extend consolidation through early 2026 as markets absorb both legitimate whale profit-taking and illicit funds being methodically liquidated through unknown channels.

56302045,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=254142,1766596212,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary: How Operating Room AI Solves Healthcare’s $2 Billion Coordination Crisis,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/operating-room-ai-healthcare-automation/,"BitcoinWorld Revolutionary: How Operating Room AI Solves Healthcare’s $2 Billion Coordination Crisis Imagine a world where surgical delays vanish, operating rooms run with precision, and hospitals save millions annually. While cryptocurrency markets capture headlines with their volatility, another technological revolution is quietly transforming healthcare infrastructure. The operating room, long considered the pinnacle of medical expertise, is now becoming the frontier for artificial intelligence implementation. According to Akara CEO Conor McGinn, the real bottleneck in healthcare isn’t surgical skill or medical technology—it’s the chaotic coordination between procedures that costs hospitals up to four hours of valuable OR time daily. This inefficiency represents a multi-billion dollar problem that AI is uniquely positioned to solve. Why Operating Room AI Represents Healthcare’s Next Frontier The statistics are staggering. Hospitals lose between two to four hours of operating room time every single day, not during surgeries themselves, but in the transitions between them. This coordination chaos—from manual scheduling errors to unpredictable room turnover—creates a domino effect of delays, canceled procedures, and frustrated medical staff. While robots in surgery have captured public imagination, the infrastructure supporting these procedures remains surprisingly analog. Akara’s pivot from cleaning robots to ambient sensing technology reveals a crucial insight: the most valuable AI applications in healthcare might not be in the surgery itself, but in optimizing everything around it. The Thermal Sensor Breakthrough in Healthcare Automation Privacy concerns have long hampered digital transformation in operating rooms. How do you monitor surgical procedures without violating patient confidentiality or creating surveillance concerns? Akara’s solution is elegant in its simplicity: thermal sensors. These devices can track movement, occupancy, and procedural stages without capturing identifiable images or personal data. “Think of it as air traffic control for hospitals,” explains McGinn. The system uses heat signatures rather than visual data, allowing hospitals to document surgical workflows, predict room turnover times, and optimize scheduling without privacy violations. This approach has proven particularly valuable as healthcare systems face increasing pressure to digitize while maintaining strict privacy standards. Operating Room Efficiency: Before and After AI Implementation Metric Traditional System AI-Optimized System Daily OR Time Lost 2-4 hours 30-60 minutes Room Turnover Prediction Accuracy 40-60% 85-95% Staff Coordination Time 45 minutes per procedure 15 minutes per procedure Annual Cost Impact (Medium Hospital) $1.2-2.4 million $300-600,000 Solving Hospital Coordination Chaos with Ambient Intelligence The real innovation in Akara’s approach isn’t just the technology itself, but how it integrates into existing hospital workflows. The system functions as an ambient intelligence layer that requires minimal staff training and no changes to surgical protocols. This has allowed for surprisingly rapid adoption, including through what McGinn calls “the NHS backdoor”—using validation from the UK’s National Health Service to gain credibility with US hospital systems. The coordination problem extends beyond scheduling to include: Instrument sterilization and preparation timing Staff availability and shift transitions Patient transport and pre-op preparation Post-operative cleaning and room reset Supply chain management for surgical materials The Infrastructure Bottleneck Holding Back Medical Robotics Here’s the surprising truth: the limitation for advanced medical robotics isn’t the robots themselves. “The spoiler isn’t the robots, it’s the infrastructure,” McGinn emphasizes during his Equity podcast interview. Even the most sophisticated surgical robots require: Precisely timed staff availability Properly prepared and sterilized equipment Accurate patient scheduling and preparation Efficient room turnover between procedures Coordinated supply chain for specialized components Without these foundational elements in place, even billion-dollar robotic systems operate at a fraction of their potential efficiency. This infrastructure gap represents both a challenge and an opportunity for healthcare automation. The Nursing Crisis and Healthcare Automation Imperative The timing for operating room AI couldn’t be more critical. Healthcare systems face what McGinn describes as an “existential workforce crisis,” with projections suggesting 40% of the nursing workforce could leave within five years. This exodus isn’t just about retirement—it’s about burnout, administrative burden, and the frustration of spending more time on coordination than patient care. Automation in healthcare isn’t about replacing medical professionals; it’s about removing the administrative friction that drives them away. By automating scheduling, documentation, and coordination tasks, hospitals can: Reduce administrative burden on clinical staff Improve job satisfaction and retention Allow medical professionals to focus on patient care Create more predictable and manageable workloads Enable better work-life balance for healthcare workers From Concept to Reality: Akara’s Path to Time’s Best Inventions Akara’s recognition on Time’s Best Inventions of 2025 list validates a crucial shift in healthcare technology priorities. The company’s journey—from cleaning robots to operating room intelligence—mirrors a broader industry realization: sometimes the most valuable technology isn’t the most visually impressive. The thermal sensor system represents what might be called “invisible infrastructure”—technology that works so seamlessly in the background that users barely notice it, yet whose absence would create immediate chaos. This approach has allowed for rapid scaling, with systems now deployed in multiple healthcare networks. FAQs: Understanding Operating Room AI Implementation What specific problem does Akara’s technology solve? Akara addresses the coordination chaos in operating rooms that costs hospitals 2-4 hours of valuable time daily through manual scheduling errors, unpredictable room turnover, and inefficient staff coordination. How do thermal sensors address privacy concerns in healthcare settings? Thermal sensors detect heat signatures rather than visual images, allowing the system to track movement, occupancy, and procedural stages without capturing identifiable patient data or violating privacy regulations. Who is Conor McGinn and what’s his background? Conor McGinn is the co-founder and CEO of Akara , a startup focused on healthcare automation. He previously worked on robotics and AI applications before pivoting to healthcare infrastructure optimization. What validation has Akara received for its technology? Akara was named to Time’s Best Inventions of 2025 list and has gained validation through NHS (National Health Service) adoption, which provided credibility for expansion into US hospital systems. How does this technology relate to broader trends in medical robotics? Akara’s work addresses the infrastructure bottleneck that limits advanced medical robotics. Even sophisticated surgical robots require efficient coordination, scheduling, and room management to operate effectively. What percentage of nursing staff might leave healthcare, and why does this matter for automation? Industry projections suggest 40% of the nursing workforce could leave within five years due to burnout and administrative burden, creating an urgent need for automation that reduces coordination tasks and allows medical professionals to focus on patient care. The Future of Healthcare: Intelligent Infrastructure as Competitive Advantage The operating room represents just the beginning. As healthcare systems embrace digital transformation, the principles behind Akara’s approach—ambient intelligence, privacy-preserving sensors, and infrastructure-first automation—will likely expand to emergency departments, inpatient units, and outpatient clinics. The companies that succeed in this space won’t necessarily create the most advanced surgical robots, but rather the most intelligent coordination systems that make everything else work better. The transformation happening in operating rooms today offers a blueprint for healthcare’s digital future. By focusing on the unglamorous but critical infrastructure of coordination and scheduling, AI can deliver immediate, measurable improvements in efficiency, cost savings, and staff satisfaction. As healthcare faces unprecedented workforce challenges and financial pressures, this type of practical, infrastructure-focused automation may prove more valuable than any single medical device or surgical innovation.

This is the shocking reality in operating rooms worldwide, where 2-4 hours of valuable surgical time vanish daily due to scheduling inefficiencies and manual processes. Now, a new wave of AI in healthcare startups is tackling this billion-dollar problem head-on, promising to transform how hospitals manage their most critical resources. What’s Really Causing Operating Room Chaos? The problem isn’t the surgeries themselves – it’s everything that happens between them. Traditional operating room efficiency suffers from multiple pain points that drain hospital resources and impact patient care: Manual scheduling systems that require constant phone calls and emails Last-minute changes that cascade through the entire surgical day Equipment and staff coordination failures Room turnover delays between procedures Poor visibility into real-time OR status These inefficiencies don’t just waste time – they cost hospitals millions annually. When an operating room sits idle for even 30 minutes between surgeries, that’s lost revenue that can never be recovered. How AI is Revolutionizing Surgical Coordination The breakthrough comes from applying artificial intelligence to the complex puzzle of surgical coordination . Unlike traditional software that simply digitizes existing processes, AI systems can: Traditional Approach AI-Powered Solution Manual scheduling by administrators Automated optimization algorithms Reactive problem-solving Predictive analytics and prevention Separate systems for different departments Integrated platform connecting all stakeholders Static schedules Dynamic, real-time adjustments These AI systems analyze historical data, current conditions, and multiple variables simultaneously to create optimal surgical schedules. They can predict how long procedures will actually take, anticipate equipment needs, and coordinate staff movements – all in real time. The Tangible Benefits of Healthcare Automation The impact of implementing healthcare automation in operating rooms goes far beyond simple time savings. Hospitals that have adopted these solutions report: 30-40% reduction in turnover time between surgeries 15-20% increase in daily surgical volume Significant reduction in staff overtime costs Improved patient satisfaction through fewer delays Better utilization of expensive surgical equipment Perhaps most importantly, these systems free up clinical staff to focus on what they do best – patient care – rather than administrative coordination. Real-World Examples of Hospital Optimization Success Several pioneering institutions have already demonstrated what’s possible with AI-driven hospital optimization : One major academic medical center implemented an AI scheduling system and recovered over 1,000 hours of OR time in the first year alone. Another hospital network reduced their average turnover time from 45 minutes to under 30 minutes, allowing them to perform additional surgeries each day without extending staff hours. These aren’t theoretical improvements – they’re concrete financial and operational gains that directly impact hospital bottom lines and patient access to care. Overcoming Implementation Challenges Despite the clear benefits, implementing AI solutions in healthcare settings presents unique challenges: Integration with existing hospital IT systems Staff training and change management Data privacy and security concerns Initial investment costs Regulatory compliance requirements Successful implementations typically involve careful planning, stakeholder engagement, and phased rollouts that demonstrate quick wins to build organizational support. The Future of AI in Surgical Environments Looking ahead, the potential for AI in healthcare extends far beyond scheduling optimization. We’re moving toward: Predictive maintenance for surgical equipment AI-assisted surgical planning and simulation Real-time analytics during procedures Integration with robotic surgical systems Personalized surgical workflows based on patient data These advancements promise to create operating rooms that are not just efficient, but intelligent – environments that actively support surgical teams and improve patient outcomes. FAQs About AI in Operating Rooms Which companies are leading in AI for surgical coordination? Several startups are pioneering this space, including companies like CareSyntax and LeanTaaS . Larger medical technology companies are also entering this market through acquisitions and internal development. How do these systems handle emergency surgeries? Modern AI scheduling systems are designed to be dynamic and can immediately adjust schedules when emergencies arise. They can quickly identify the least disruptive way to accommodate urgent cases while minimizing impact on scheduled procedures. What data do these AI systems need to work effectively? They typically integrate data from multiple sources including electronic health records, staff scheduling systems, equipment management databases, and historical surgical logs. The more comprehensive the data, the better the system performs. Are there privacy concerns with AI in healthcare settings? Yes, and reputable companies address these through HIPAA-compliant architectures, data anonymization techniques, and strict access controls. Patient privacy remains a paramount concern in all healthcare AI applications. Conclusion: The Inevitable Transformation The operating room of the future isn’t just about better equipment or more skilled surgeons – it’s about intelligent coordination that maximizes every precious minute. As healthcare costs continue to rise and patient demand increases, the pressure to optimize surgical operations will only grow stronger. AI solutions offer a practical, proven path to recovering lost time, reducing waste, and improving both financial performance and patient care. The question is no longer whether AI will transform operating rooms, but how quickly hospitals will embrace this inevitable transformation.

This move comes as the country’s regulators start to implement local licensing regulations, especially for crypto-related services. This announcement was made public on Tuesday, December 23, when users reported being unable to access several major cryptocurrency trading platforms in the Philippines, including Coinbase and Gemini. Their statement sparked a heated debate in the industry. In an attempt to address this controversy, a reliable source confirmed that both crypto platforms were inaccessible via several local ISPs. A major daily newspaper and media company in the Philippines, the Manila Bulletin, on the other hand, released a report clarifying that these ISP blocks were established following the National Telecommunications Commission’s issuance of an order for their setup. Philippine regulators shift their focus towards stringent regulations in the crypto industry According to the report , the NTC instructed ISPs to restrict access to around 50 online trading platforms operating in the country without proper authorization from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. The order alleged that these trading platforms were carrying out their operations unauthorized. Notably, the BSP is the central bank of the Philippines. What cryptocurrency trading platforms are waiting for is a complete list of the online trading platforms set to be impacted by the order, which is yet to be released. Meanwhile, as they continue to wait for the complete list, analysts have anticipated that this sudden regulatory change demonstrates that local regulators are shifting their focus from informal tolerance to implementing regulations strictly. This change has positioned local licensing as a crucial requirement for effective access to the Philippines’ cryptocurrency market. Considering the intense nature of the situation, sources revealed that although the country has recently halted the operations of Coinbase and Gemini, it had earlier implemented tough measures against crypto exchanges that were declared to be unlicensed. To support this claim, reports dated December 2023 mentioned that the Philippine government began imposing a 90-day countdown at that time for Binance to comply with local regulations before executing a ban on the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Following this decision, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the Philippines clarified that a deadline had been scheduled for Filipinos to withdraw their funds from Binance. After several considerations on March 25, 2024, the National Telecommunications Commission ordered local internet service providers to shut down Binance. To further exercise stricter action against the cryptocurrency exchange, the SEC instructed tech giants like Apple and Google to eliminate Binance’s app from their stores. At this particular moment, sources highlighted that it had been almost a month since the ban was executed. Following this ban, the SEC warned that it was unable to offer any method for Filipinos to retrieve their funds. Unregulated crypto exchanges find themselves in trouble in the Philippines Earlier, the SEC noted that approximately 10 crypto exchanges were operating in the Philippines without proper licenses. Examples of these exchanges include OKX , Bybit, and KuCoin. Interestingly, as the country carried out strict measures against unauthorized platforms, reliable sources discovered that compliant firms have been promoting crypto-related services in the Philippines. In the meantime, reports stated that regulated crypto exchange PDAX joined forces with payroll provider Toku on November 19. Their collaboration aimed to enable remote employees to collect their wages in stablecoins seamlessly. Afterwards, they would effectively convert their pay into pesos without encountering wire charges or delays. Later, on December 8, it was confirmed that digital bank GoTyme had introduced crypto-related services in the country after announcing its collaboration with Alpaca, a US-based API-first brokerage infrastructure company. With this launch, sources familiar with the situation noted that users had the chance to successfully purchase and store eleven different cryptocurrencies via the bank’s app. Don’t just read crypto news.

This figure represents a 2% gain since Friday, yet the market as a whole has also plunged by 30% since reaching a record cap of $4.379 trillion on October 7, as jitters over an AI-related stock market bubble has turned investors off higher risk assets. Given that prices haven’t substantially improved in over two months, the market is getting closer to an overdue rebound, with many major tokens continuing to boast attractive fundamentals. And we’ve picked the best coin to buy this Christmas Eve that could 100x in 2026, with our pick – the Solana-based layer-two network Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – currently holding a hugely successful presale as it prepares to launch. Best Coin To Buy This Christmas Eve That Could 100x in 2026 – 24 December 2025 In fact, Bitcoin Hyper has now raised an enviable $29.7 million , making its initial coin offering one of the biggest of 2025. This figure is a testament to how much confidence Bitcoin Hyper is inspiring among investors, who have clearly taken a keen interest in its plans to launch a fully fledged layer-two network for Bitcoin. As an L2 for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Hyper will provide investors with the chance to convert their BTC into corresponding amounts of HYPER tokens, and then to use the latter in the L2’s ecosystem of dapps. Bitcoin Hyper will focus on providing BTC holders with DeFi platforms and protocols in which to put their BTC to work, enabling them to lend out their Bitcoin or, via HYPER, stake it for a regular income. Given that Bitcoin now boasts a market cap of $1.7 trillion, this means that Bitcoin Hyper’s ecosystem could provide a means of tapping into enormous capital and wealth. On a technical level, it will operate using Solana’s Virtual Machine, giving it state-of-the-art speed and scalability, and also making it compatible with Solana apps and platforms. The platform will also harness zero-knowledge rollups, which will not only enhance its throughput, but also give transactions a high level of privacy and security. Such features make Bitcoin Hyper one of the most advanced L2s in the crypto sector, which helps to explain not only why its presale has done so well, but also why it’s our best coin to buy this Christmas Eve. Bitcoin Hyper Could Be the Biggest New Coin of 2026: How to Buy Early As a token, HYPER will have a max supply of 21 billion tokens, meaning that it corresponds to Bitcoin’s supply at a 10:1 ratio. This supply will have a broad allocation, with 25% going to its community treasury, 30% to development, 20% to marketing, 15% to staking and community rewards, and 10% to listings and liquidity. While its presale is likely to close within the first few weeks of 2026, investors can still join by visiting the official Bitcoin Hyper website . All of the pieces are coming together to create the greatest Bitcoin L2 ever made. What more could you ask for this holiday season?! https://t.co/VNG0P4GuDo pic.twitter.com/Uq6y1kXwsT — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) December 24, 2025 There, they can connect a compatible wallet (e.g. Best Wallet) and buy any amount of HYPER using SOL, ETH, USDT, BNB or fiat currency (via a credit card). They’ll receive their tokens once the sale ends, with HYPER preparing to list on exchanges very soon after. In view of its fundamentals, it has every chance of rallying strongly once it goes live on exchange, while a market-wide recovery and bull rally could see it rise even higher. This is why it’s our best coin to buy this Christmas Eve, and why it could end up being one of the biggest new tokens of 2026.

Despite this fall, NIGHT remains up by 12% in a week and by 15.5% in the past fortnight, making it the highest-performing top-100 coin over this timeframe. Even though the wider market has suffered as a result of negative sentiment and AI bubble-related fears, Midnight has been flying since launching on the Cardano network. And while it has dipped in the past day or so, it still arguably remains in price discovery mode, and could rally strongly again in the final week of the year. Midnight Price Prediction: As the NIGHT Price Continues to Slip, Is A Christmas Eve Miracle Possible? If we look at Midnight’s chart today, we see that it has lost momentum in recent days, which may be a concern to investors. However, there’s a strong case that it is merely correcting a little over the shorter term, and that it will rebound back up in the very near future. For instance, its relative strength index (yellow) is very close to touch 30 and even falling lower, at which point logic dictates that a rebound will come. Source: TradingView We see something very similar with NIGHT’s MACD (orange, blue), which has turned negative today and could be very close to hitting bottom. But perhaps most bullishly of all, its price has been trading within a pennant since launching earlier this month, and this pennant is about to converge. As such, a big move could be just around the corner, and one catalyst for such a move could be more exchange listings. Coinbase is yet to list NIGHT, as are numerous other major exchanges, such as Binance, Crypto.com and Bitstamp. So if we do see new listings in the next few days, the Midnight price could rise much higher, resuming its bullishness of the past couple of weeks. $NIGHT looks like its ready to pump! Midnight feels like another small cap gem that could give great returns. I have a feeling that it will do what $JELLYJELLY did where we caught the bottom and pumped 3x. I'm expecting the price to go to $0.065 zone and we see a bounce from… pic.twitter.com/HM7B87Ut0o — D Future Money (@DFutureMoney) December 23, 2025 More fundamentally, Midnight looks to have a bright future ahead, seeing as how it’s one of the first platforms to allow for privacy-first programmable dapps and protocols. So instead of simply being a privacy coin (such as Monero or Zcash), it will enable privacy smart contracts and applications. This is why it has been doing so well since launching, and why the Midnight price prediction looks so good right now. Once its current correction plays out, it could reach $0.10 by the end of the year, and then $0.20 by Q2 of 2026. New Mining Token Raises ?? As It Prepares to Launch: Why PEPENODE Could Be a Big Winner in 2026 While Midnight does look like one of the most exciting new coins in the market right now, there are other high-potential new entrants that traders might also want to consider. One of these is PEPENDOE ($PEPENODE), an Ethereum-based token that is planning to make mining more accessible to the average investor. The PEPENODE presale is live. Buy Nodes. Build Your Server Room. Combine Nodes For Huge Bonuses. Do it all here https://t.co/d1JAronqiv pic.twitter.com/60uLhEoukP — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 10, 2025 It has been running its presale over the past couple of months, and has now raised in excess of $2.3 million, with the presale due to end in only 14 days. This is a very encouraging figure for such a new token, and it suggests that PEPENODE has the potential to do very well when it lists in a couple of weeks. What’s exciting about the token is that it’s planning to launch a mining platform that will enable investors to mine meme coins without having to buy and run expensive mining hardware. Instead, users can build and operate their own virtual mining rigs, which they can grow by spending PEPENODE tokens on more virtual nodes. More nodes result in greater rewards, while rewards can also be increased by upgrading nodes and combining them in novel ways. This will incentivize the accumulation of PEPENODE tokens, which could result in the coin’s price rising steadily over time. PEPENODE pays out mining rewards in the form of external tokens such as Fartcoin and Pepe, while holders can also stake the token for a passive income. This potentially makes the new alt hugely profitable, with latecomers still able to join its sale by going to the official PEPENODE website . The token is selling at its final presale price of $0.0012112, but it has every chance of rising much higher once it lists in the next two weeks.

Titles like CS:GO and Dota 2 now attract not only massive audiences, but also a growing number of bettors who prefer placing wagers with USDT and other cryptocurrencies instead of traditional payment methods. This shift is driven by practicality rather than hype. Esports matches move fast, odds change quickly, and delays can be costly. Crypto removes many of the friction points that frustrate players on fiat-based platforms — slow withdrawals, bankingigid verification rules, and regional banking limits. As a result, search demand for terms like csgo betting with crypto and dota 2 esports betting with crypto continues to rise. In this article, we explore why crypto has become the preferred betting currency for esports, how CS:GO and Dota 2 crypto betting works, and which platforms currently offer the strongest overall experience. Comparison of Crypto eSports Betting Platforms To make the differences clearer, here’s a side-by-side overview of how the reviewed platforms compare specifically for CS:GO and Dota 2 crypto betting. Platform Esports Focus CS:GO & Dota 2 Markets USDT Support KYC Policy Best For Dexsport High Deep + Live Yes No KYC All-around esports crypto betting Thunderpick Very High Very Deep + Live Yes Conditional Esports-only bettors BetPanda Medium Basic Limited Conditional Anonymous casual betting Vave Medium Standard + Live Yes Required at limits Hybrid sports + esports Lucky Block Medium Standard Yes No KYC to play Token-driven betting ecosystem This comparison highlights a key pattern: most platforms support esports, but only a few are truly optimized for active CS:GO and Dota 2 crypto betting with stablecoins. Dexsport — Best All-Around Crypto eSports Betting Platform Dexsport consistently stands out as one of the most balanced options for crypto esports betting, particularly for players focused on CS:GO and Dota 2. Instead of treating esports as an add-on, Dexsport integrates competitive gaming directly into its sportsbook logic. Access is intentionally frictionless. Users can start betting through a crypto wallet, email, or Telegram login, without mandatory identity verification. For many bettors, this alone makes a noticeable difference when compared to platforms that introduce KYC checks at the withdrawal stage. What makes Dexsport especially relevant for esports bettors is how markets are structured. CS:GO and Dota 2 events are not limited to simple match winners. Instead, players can engage with a wider range of betting options, including map-level and live markets, which are critical for active in-play strategies. Key strengths for esports betting include: Full support for USDT, alongside BTC, ETH, and other major assets Live betting on ongoing CS:GO and Dota 2 matches Competitive odds presentation without clutter Fast settlement and transparent payout rules Unlike many crypto sportsbooks, Dexsport does not force users into long wagering cycles. Bonuses are designed to remain usable rather than restrictive, which is especially important for esports, where betting volume tends to be higher but margins are tighter. Dexsport feels built for bettors who actively follow the match, not just the final score. For users searching for a reliable best dota 2 esports crypto betting site or a practical solution for csgo crypto betting with USDT, Dexsport offers a rare combination of speed, flexibility, and esports depth without unnecessary friction. Thunderpick — Esports-First Crypto Betting Specialist Thunderpick is one of the few betting platforms built with esports as its primary focus rather than traditional sports. For fans of CS:GO and Dota 2, this becomes obvious immediately through the market structure and overall interface. The platform offers: Deep betting lines on CS:GO and Dota 2 Live betting with continuously updated odds Crypto-only deposits and withdrawals Provably fair mechanics Thunderpick performs particularly well in pre-match and live esports markets, which is why it remains popular among users focused specifically on csgo esports crypto betting. That said, the platform is not without limitations. Weak points become more noticeable outside esports: Traditional sports coverage is limited Live statistics are less detailed than on major sportsbooks Withdrawals can take up to 24 hours KYC may be required for large withdrawals or bonus participation Thunderpick is an excellent choice if esports is your top priority and you mainly bet on CS:GO and Dota 2. BetPanda — Anonymous Crypto Betting With Limited Esports Depth BetPanda is better known as a crypto casino, but it also offers sportsbook functionality with esports markets. The platform emphasizes anonymity and ease of access. Where BetPanda performs well: Email-based registration with no mandatory KYC Fast deposits and withdrawals Support for popular cryptocurrencies Weekly cashback and a VIP program From an esports perspective, however, BetPanda works more as a supplementary option. CS:GO and Dota 2 markets are available, but market depth is noticeably weaker compared to esports-focused platforms. In practice, this means: Fewer live betting options Limited prop bets Less flexibility for active betting strategies BetPanda is better suited for users who place dota 2 betting with crypto or csgo betting with crypto occasionally, rather than as a primary esports betting platform. Vave — Hybrid Sportsbook With Solid Esports Coverage Vave sits between a traditional sportsbook and a crypto-friendly betting platform. Esports is not the core of its ecosystem, but it is implemented more thoroughly than on most general-purpose sportsbooks. Key strengths of Vave include: Smooth, fast user interface Live betting and cash-out functionality Support for USDT across multiple networks Regular promotions and cashback offers CS:GO and Dota 2 markets are consistently available, though the platform’s primary focus remains on football and traditional sports. Additionally, KYC becomes mandatory once certain withdrawal thresholds are reached. Vave is best suited for users who: Bet on both traditional sports and esports Prefer a single all-in-one betting account Are comfortable with a hybrid custody and compliance model Lucky Block — Token-Based Betting Ecosystem Lucky Block builds its betting ecosystem around a proprietary token and wallet-based access. This approach appeals to Web3-native users but also introduces additional considerations. From an esports perspective: CS:GO and Dota 2 betting markets are available Live betting and streams are supported USDT and major cryptocurrencies are accepted Pros: Very fast payouts Low minimum deposit requirements No mandatory KYC to place bets Cons: Mixed user feedback regarding withdrawals Limited responsible gambling tools Esports is not always prioritized over casino offerings Lucky Block is better suited for users who view betting as part of a broader crypto ecosystem, rather than those strictly looking for the best csgo esports crypto betting site. Why Crypto Is Dominating eSports Betting At first glance, crypto betting may seem like a simple alternative payment option. In reality, it changes how esports wagering functions at a structural level. The most obvious advantages are practical: Faster deposits and withdrawals, often processed within minutes Global access without reliance on banks or local payment providers Stablecoin options like USDT that eliminate volatility concerns Fewer barriers to entry compared to traditional sportsbooks But there’s a deeper reason crypto fits esports so well. Esports audiences are already digitally native. Many players use wallets, trade tokens, and interact with Web3 tools daily. For them, betting with crypto feels natural — not experimental. Speed and flexibility matter more in esports than in traditional sports.Matches are shorter, live markets are more active, and timing often determines profitability. This is especially true for dota 2 betting with crypto, where live events such as first blood, Roshan kills, or sudden momentum shifts can change odds in seconds. The same applies to csgo esports crypto betting, where round-by-round action creates constant in-play opportunities. Crypto betting platforms are built to handle this pace. They settle bets quickly, avoid banking delays, and allow users to move funds freely between matches — something traditional bookmakers still struggle to deliver. How Crypto eSports Betting Works (CS:GO & Dota 2) At a functional level, crypto esports betting is similar to traditional sports betting — but the mechanics around funding, payouts, and live interaction are noticeably different. Instead of depositing fiat currency through a bank or payment processor, users fund their accounts with crypto, most commonly USDT. Bets are then placed directly from the crypto balance, and winnings are credited back without banking intermediaries. This model is especially well-suited for esports, where matches are frequent, fast, and often unpredictable. Before choosing a platform, it’s important to understand what you can actually bet on in each game. Popular Dota 2 Crypto Betting Markets Dota 2 offers some of the most diverse betting markets in esports, which explains the strong demand for dota 2 esports crypto betting and dota 2 betting with crypto. The most common markets include: Match winnerStraightforward bets on BO1, BO3, or BO5 series outcomes. Map-based betsWinners of individual maps, correct map scores, or total maps played. In-game events First Blood First Roshan kill Total towers destroyed Total kills over/under Handicaps and totalsKill spreads, gold advantage, or time-based totals. Live betting plays a major role here. Odds often shift rapidly after early fights or objective control, making crypto’s instant balance updates particularly valuable. For experienced users, this flexibility is a key reason why dota betting crypto continues to gain traction. Popular CS:GO Crypto Betting Markets CS:GO betting follows a different rhythm, built around rounds, momentum swings, and map control. This has made csgo esports crypto betting one of the most active segments in the market. Common CS:GO betting options include: Match and map winners Correct score (e.g., 2–0, 2–1) Round handicaps Total rounds played Pistol round winner Live CS:GO betting is particularly popular. A single eco round win or early streak can dramatically affect odds, which is why many users actively search for csgo crypto betting platforms with fast execution and reliable live markets. In CS:GO, timing is everything. Delayed bets or locked balances can mean missed value within seconds. Platforms that support stablecoins like USDT allow bettors to stay active across multiple matches without worrying about price fluctuations. What to Look for in a Crypto eSports Betting Site Not all crypto betting platforms are built with esports in mind. Many sportsbooks add CS:GO or Dota 2 markets as a secondary feature, offering only basic match winner bets and limited live options. If your goal is consistent dota 2 esports betting with crypto or active csgo betting with crypto, the platform itself matters as much as the odds. Here are the key factors that separate strong esports betting sites from generic crypto sportsbooks. Depth of eSports Markets A reliable esports-focused platform should offer more than just match winners. Look for: Map-specific bets In-game events (kills, objectives, rounds) Proper handicap and totals markets Live Betting Performance Esports betting is heavily live-driven. Delays, suspended markets, or slow odds updates can quickly erase any edge.Platforms optimized for esports handle: Fast odds recalculation Continuous in-play betting Quick bet settlement Support for USDT and Stablecoins While BTC and ETH are still popular, many bettors prefer USDT for esports wagering.Stablecoins allow users to: Avoid volatility during long tournaments Manage bankrolls more precisely Move between matches without price risk This is why searches for csgo esports crypto betting and dota 2 betting with crypto increasingly include USDT-specific intent. Withdrawal Speed and Transparency Esports betting often involves frequent cash-outs rather than long-term holds. Platforms that delay withdrawals or introduce unexpected checks quickly lose trust. A strong crypto esports betting site should offer: Predictable withdrawal times Clear limits and rules Minimal post-win friction Bonuses That Apply to eSports Many bonuses look attractive but exclude esports entirely or apply extremely high wagering requirements.Always check: Whether esports bets count toward wagering If live bets are eligible Any market-specific restrictions A good esports bonus supports betting activity — it doesn’t restrict it. When these elements align, the platform becomes suitable not just for casual bets, but for sustained esports wagering across CS:GO and Dota 2 events. Is Crypto eSports Betting Legal? The legality of crypto esports betting depends largely on jurisdiction rather than the betting format itself. Most crypto esports betting platforms operate under international gambling licenses and accept users from a wide range of regions. That said, there are a few important points bettors should keep in mind: Regulations vary significantly by country Some regions restrict online gambling regardless of payment method Crypto transactions do not remove tax obligations in most jurisdictions Responsibility often shifts more toward the user In practice, most players access crypto esports betting sites without issues, but understanding local regulations is always recommended — especially for frequent or high-volume bettors. Risks of Betting on Esports With Crypto While crypto betting offers speed and flexibility, it also comes with trade-offs that should not be ignored. Common risks include: Wallet responsibility — lost private keys cannot be recovered No chargebacks — crypto transactions are irreversible Volatility exposure — unless using stablecoins like USDT Platform risk — not all operators are equally transparent Using USDT for esports betting helps reduce price fluctuation risk, which is one reason why it’s become the preferred option for both csgo crypto betting and dota 2 esports betting with crypto. Crypto betting rewards control and discipline — but it also requires them. Final Verdict Crypto esports betting has matured into a serious alternative to traditional sportsbooks, especially for competitive titles like CS:GO and Dota 2. The combination of fast transactions, stablecoin support, and esports-specific markets makes crypto a natural fit for this segment. Most platforms reviewed offer some level of esports coverage, but the quality varies significantly. Esports-first platforms excel in market depth, while hybrid sportsbooks prioritize breadth over specialization. Among the available options, Dexsport stands out as the most balanced choice for crypto esports betting . It combines strong CS:GO and Dota 2 coverage, USDT support, live betting functionality, and frictionless access — without forcing users into unnecessary verification or restrictive wagering cycles. For bettors searching for a reliable environment to place dota 2 betting with crypto or engage in active csgo esports crypto betting, platforms that prioritize speed, transparency, and esports depth consistently deliver the best experience.",More News,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-12-24 17:24:00

Overview Cryprocurrency Arbitrum Ticker ARB Current Arbitrum price $0.1883 Market cap $1.07B Trading volume $90.57M Circulating supply 5.71B All-time high $2.40 on Jan 12, 2024 All-time low $0.136 on Oct 11, 2025 24-hour high $0.1920 24-hour low $0.1825 Arbitrum price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 5.73% 50-day SMA $0.2252 200-day SMA $0.3672 Sentiment Bearish Green days 13/30 (43%) Fear and Greed Index 24 (Extreme Greed) Arbitrum price analysis On December 24, Arbitrum’s price rose by 1.66% in 24 hours to $0.1891, slowing the month-long bearish trend. Over the last 30 days, ARB lost 9.77% in value. The recovery was accompanied by rising trading volumes (6.85%). ARB 1-day chart analysis ARBUSD chart by TradingView ARB has support at $0.19 after breaking below key 23.60% Fibonacci levels at $0.2712, which triggered a new ATL last month. The coin now trades below all major SMA and EMA levels, signaling poor performance. The MACD histogram (0.0007) confirms little market momentum, while the RSI (41.50) is in neutral territory. It is oversold when the value drops below 30. Arbitrum price 4-hour chart price analysis ARBUSD chart by TradingView ARB registers little momentum on the 4-hour chart.

ARB is caught in a broader risk-off rotation. The recent correction is a result of exhaustion from selling pressure. The $0.18 support level remains critical to ARB’s trajectory. Why is ARB down? ARB’s 14-day RSI hit 41.50 – nearing oversold territory (sub-30) – signaling exhaustion in recent selling pressure. The price stabilized at the $0.19 pivot point, triggering short-term bullish momentum. Recent news Analysts argue ARB is undervalued given its ecosystem growth (TVL at all-time highs, $4B+ stablecoin liquidity). However, the token’s price has dropped since September 2025, highlighting persistent supply overhang. Does Arbitrum have a future? A high adoption rate is crucial for any blockchain’s long-term success and sustainability. Arbitrum’s performance in this regard is a positive sign of its future performance despite the price declines. Is Arbitrum good to buy? Arbitrum is trading at its lowest range this year, with the charts showing it is just above the oversold region. At current prices, ARB is undervalued and is likely to recover if market sentiment changes. On the other hand, the Arbitrum ecosystem’s total value locked has crossed above $2.5 billion, indicating solid utility in decentralized finance. Is Arbitrum a good investment? SkyEcosystem’s Risk Analysis has launched USDS stablecoin on Arbitrum, expanding Arbitrum’s utility, which will attract liquidity to the network. This integration could increase ARB usage, potentially boosting its price. Will Arbitrum reach $10? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ARB is unlikely to reach $10 before 2031. Can Arbitrum reach 100 dollars? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, it is unlikely that ARB will trade at $100 by the end of 2031. Will Arbitrum reach $1,000? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, it is unlikely that ARB will trade at $1,000 by the end of 2031. Does Arbitrum have a good long-term future?

Arbitrum historic price sentiment Arbitrum price history by CoinGecko The Arbitrum airdrop snapshot occurred on Feb 6, 2023, and eligible participants started claiming on Mar 23, 2023. The claiming period ended on Sep 24, 2023. The airdrop granted 11.5% of the total supply to eligible users, 1.1% to DAOs operating in the Arbitrum ecosystem, and 44% to employees and Offchain Labs investors. The 44% is subject to lock-up periods and a vesting schedule. The rest was sent to the Arbitrum DAO treasury. On Sep 11, 2023, it fell to its all-time low at $0.7453. Bitcoin halving and crypto ETF hype helped the coin recover from October. By the end of the year, it had risen to $1.4. The run continued into 2024. On Jan 12, it reached its all-time high at $2.40. Per CoinMarketCap data, ARB broke below its listing price in June 2024. On August 5, 2024, it registered a new all-time low of $0.4317 It then recovered in September, reaching a high of $0.67.

Large investors are purchasing additional ETH and the smaller ones are selling them as the price increases. Although ETH has recovered, it is yet to hit important levels of resistance and several investors are not sure whether to expect short-term returns. Ethereum is keeping everyone waiting, so many are looking at an alternative that is now seen as the best crypto to invest in now, and this is Mutuum Finance , with 99% of presale Phase 6 sold out. Ethereum Recovers $3,000 but the momentum declines The significant purchases and the decreased exchange balances support the return of Ethereum above the level of $3,000. Confidence in big players is demonstrated by 10,000 to 100,000 ETH big wallets having over 22 million tokens. Meanwhile, ETH in exchanges is at a nine-year low, and the pressure is taken off selling. The traffic of the network is increasing and addresses are becoming more active and more new wallets are being generated day by day. Nevertheless, the price is reluctant. ETH has failed to cross the resistance area of $3,100 to $3,200 that analysts believe is important in order to initiate a higher move. Many investors are about to see slow upside until that level is cleared. The uncertainty arises, prompting some to stock up on one of the cryptos out there rather than wait around until the large caps see a follow through. As such, the money is shifting towards newer entries with lower entry values and higher growth rates. Strong FOMO in Mutuum Finance Phase 6 The presale phase 6 of Mutuum Finance is almost fully subscribed. Since the presale started, it has accumulated $19.5M and has recorded 18,550 holders. Despite the price having increased by 250% from the Phase 1 price of just $0.01, the demand continues to rise. Investors recognize the growth potential found in investing in Mutuum Finance early enough. Phase 6 gets sold out quickly. Upon its rematuration, Phase 7 starts with about 20% increase in price to $0.04. Thus, the current stage is considered as the last chance for purchasing at a lower price. Given that MUTM is set to arrive at a market with a value of $0.06, at the moment of its launch, those who acquire it are expected to gain a potential 380% increase in value. It is for these reasons cited above that most people regard Mutuum as the best crypto investment at present. There is also the aspect of security and progress. The audit is being carried out by an independent audit company named Halborn Security. This instills trust among investors. Those who invest realize they are getting into a secure crypto platform. There is also a giveaway of $100,000 by Mutuum to enable early adoption. Every winner among the 10 will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM. This is in addition to the rush of Phase 6 because the Phase is reaching full capacity. Ethereum is moving close to resistance, as Mutuum is nearing a sellout, so the timing is of the essence. With Phase 6 vanishing, analysts say now is the time to invest in the best crypto to buy now as the price will rise again. Mutuum Finance is expected to lead the next bull run.

Operating expenses in sales, R&D, and G&A are rising due to acquisitions and headcount growth, creating potential margin pressure into 2026 as management frames 2025 as an investment year. Coinbase trades at a lower premium vs. sector peers and vs. own history, but flat earnings expectations limit how much this valuation discount can support the stock. COIN has failed multiple times at a key technical resistance level vs. the S&P 500, and recent price action suggests growing risk of downside and underperformance ahead. A more accommodative regulatory environment globally remains an upside risk that could expand Coinbase’s market opportunities. Performance Assessment Coinbase ( COIN ) initially rallied well, but recently it has corrected sharply, erasing the gains and outperformance vs. the broader market: Performance since Author's Last Article on COIN (Seeking Alpha, Author's Last Article on COIN) Thesis I am becoming more bearish on COIN stock: Stablecoin revenue is vulnerable rate cuts FY26 is likely to see some margin pressure from increased expenses There is some valuation discount but the earnings expectations index is flat Coinbase has failed to break resistance multiple times and now looks like it might go lower An easing regulatory environment is a source of upside risk Stablecoin revenue is vulnerable rate cuts Whilst I still believe increasing stablecoin adoption is accretive for Coinbase and Circle's ( CRCL ) market-leading USDC stablecoin monetization, I am concerned that rate cuts could be a headwind for stablecoin interest income revenues earnt from holding USDC reserves. Looking one year out, we see that there is a 92.9% chance of a Fed rate cut: Fed Funds Rate Probabilities in Dec'26 (CME FedWatch, Author's Annotations) I expect the lower interest rates to have an incremental slowdown impact on the rate of stablecoin interest income revenues: Stablecoin revenues (USD mn) (Company Filings, Author's Analysis) As of Q3 FY25, this revenue stream makes up almost 20% of the company's overall revenue mix. Hence these headwinds are likely to impact the overall revenue outlook as well. Given this context, it is interesting to see that over the last month, there have been net downward revisions in the Wall St's revenue consensus for COIN stock: Consensus Revenue Estimate Revisions (Capital IQ, Author's Analysis) Note that the overall revenues trend has not really had a strong directional trend over the last 1.5 years: Revenues (USD mn) (Company Filings, Author's Analysis) FY26 is likely to see some margin pressure from increased expenses Coinbase's operating expense margins in S&M, R&D and G&A have been increasing over the past couple of quarters and this is weighing down on operating EBIT margins: Opex Margin Drivers and EBIT Margins (Capital IQ, Author's Analysis) The outlook for Q4 suggests increased spends particularly in R&D and G&A due to headcount growth and acquisition impacts: On the expense side, our expense range is higher quarter-over-quarter for tech & dev and G&A in the range of $925 million to $975 million, up approximately $100 million at the midpoint. Approximately half of this increase is due to the recent acquisitions of Deribit and Echo. The remainder of the quarter-over-quarter increase is largely due to headcount growth, which we expect to grow at a slower rate in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. - CFO Alesia Jeanne Haas in the Q3 FY25 earnings call This $950 million midpoint guidance for R&D and G&A corresponds to a 11.9% QoQ increase. This makes me a bit queasy when the revenue growth outlook is fuzzy. I am not particularly encouraged by management's commentary that labels 2025 as an ""investment year"" and the initial 2026 as a period of ""moderate growth"" and ""digestion"": As we look forward to the first quarter of 2026, we really think of that as digestion. As we go into 2026, we're digesting the growth that we absorbed in 2025. We are going to focus on scaling new products that went from 0 to 1 to get them to 1 to 10. We are going to focus on bringing everybody kind of to their full potential at Coinbase, making sure that those folks that have been with us 3 months are operating the same speed of those that have been with us for 2 years. And so we will see sequential growth Q1 versus Q4, but at a much, much more moderate level. So really think of it as a digestion year with more moderate growth where 2025 was a big investment year. - CFO Alesia Jeanne Haas in the 2025 Goldman Sachs US Financial Services Conference I think this is all a euphemism for potential margin pressure and lower growth in the early part of 2026. There is some valuation discount but the earnings expectations index is flat COIN is trading at a 1-yr fwd PE of 40.1x, which corresponds to a 59% premium to the 25.2x median of similar sectoral comp companies: 1-yr fwd PE Comps (Capital IQ, Author's Analysis) Now although COIN is more richly valued vs. these sectoral comps, I will acknowledge that the degree of the premium is less than the typical 96.7% that COIN has commanded over the other companies: COIN 1-yr fwd PE vs. Sector vs. Time (Capital IQ, Author's Analysis) Also, the company's 1-yr fwd PE today is at a 22.7% discount to its own longer term 1-yr fwd PE median of 51.9x: COIN 1-yr fwd PE and MCAP (USD mn) (Capital IQ, Author's Analysis) So overall, there is a case to be made for COIN's valuation looking less demanding right now. However, this may not be enough to really shift the bullish view on its own because from a fundamental driver perspective, the earnings expectations index remains rather flat: 1-yr fwd PE Drivers (Capital IQ, Author's Analysis) Coinbase has failed to break resistance multiple times and now looks like it might go lower If this is your first time reading a Hunting Alpha article using Technical Analysis, you may want to read this post , which explains how and why I read the charts the way I do. All my charts reflect total shareholder return as they are adjusted for dividends/distributions. Relative Read of COIN vs SPX500 COIN vs SPX500 Technical Analysis (TradingView, Author's Analysis) The relative monthly charts of COIN vs. SPX500 show a whopping 4 failures to clear a major resistance level. The current Dec'25 candle looks like it is making a bearish engulf with a long top wick rejection. I see these signs as signals of a move lower. An easing regulatory environment is a source of upside risk The momentum from the GENIUS Stablecoins Act is flowing over as the Digital Asset Market CLARITY Act is expected to pass in H1 FY26. This bill would formally categorizes crypto assets as digital commodities, removes a lot of legal ambiguity and reduces compliance burdens. I believe Coinbase is well-positioned to benefit from these developments and extend its market leadership as a well-capitalized, US-regulated player. More broadly and thematically, these are encouraging signs that regulators are being more accommodative to crypto and related businesses: We've obviously, in the United States, had a sea change. I mean Europe led with MiCA. We've had leadership in Singapore to bring crypto regulation forward in other countries. But the U.S. had really, in the past administration, been quite antagonistic against the industry. So I cannot tell you what a sea change it's been, what the pendulum has shifted in the other direction. - CFO Alesia Jeanne Haas in the 53rd Annual Nasdaq Investor Conference MiCA is the European Union’s regulatory framework for crypto‑assets And this can open up more opportunities for Coinbase. Indeed, it is already looking to capitalize with initiatives such as expanding into offering US stock trading , prediction markets and tokenized equities . Takeaway & Positioning I suspect COIN is likely to head into FY26 with underperformance as revenue growth may be challenged as the stablecoin segment faces lower yields from rate cuts and increased margin pressure from headcount and post-acquisition expenses. COIN stock valuations are trading lower, but this alone does not seem like enough as the earnings expectations index remains flat. Technically vs. the S&P500, the stock has failed to break a major monthly resistance level 4 times, signaling potential downside and underperformance ahead. Stablecoin revenue is vulnerable rate cuts FY26 is likely to see some margin pressure from increased expenses There is some valuation discount but the earnings expectations index is flat Coinbase has failed to break resistance multiple times and now looks like it might go lower An easing regulatory environment is a source of upside risk Rating: 'Underperform/Sell' How to interpret Hunting Alpha's ratings: Strong Outperform/Strong Buy: Expect the company to outperform the S&P500 on a total shareholder return basis, with higher than usual confidence. I also have a net long position in the security in my personal portfolio. Outperform/Buy: Expect the company to outperform the S&P500 on a total shareholder return basis Market Perform/Hold: Expect the company to perform in-line with the S&P500 on a total shareholder return basis Underperform/Sell: Expect the company to underperform the S&P500 on a total shareholder return basis Strong Underperform/Strong Sell: Expect the company to underperform the S&P500 on a total shareholder return basis, with higher than usual confidence The typical time-horizon for my views is multiple quarters to more than a year. It is not set in stone. However, I will share updates on my changes in stance in a pinned comment to this article and may also publish a new article discussing the reasons for the change in view.",CRCL|COIN|COIN:CA|ZCOI:CA,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-24 17:30:27

This comes as the Cardano network doubles its efforts to improve DeFi on the network and, in the process, boost ADA’s utility. Hoskinson Explains Midnight Will Boost Cardano’s DeFi During a livestream , the Hoskinson rebutted speculation that Midnight would kill the Cardano ecosystem, stating that it would instead 10x DeFi on the network. He also mentioned that the Midnight network provides an incentive for users to leave other networks, such as Ethereum and Solana, and migrate to Cardano. The founder noted that these users can go through the Midnight network to Cardano in order to get privacy. The hype around the Midnight launch already looks to be boosting the network’s ecosystem, as DEX aggregator DEX Hunter pointed out that the DeFi volume has been exploding since the launch of the NIGHT token . Meanwhile, Hoskinson also mentioned why investors should not sell their ADA for NIGHT tokens, describing both tokens as complementary. He further remarked that Midnight is the ‘ChatGPT of privacy’ and that it adds privacy to Cardano decentralized applications (dApps). The founder also asserted that these dApps will be the first to adopt privacy, enabling them to leapfrog competitors on other networks, such as Ethereum’s Uniswap . Hoskinson also does not believe Midnight will steal ADA’s TVL, as he sees the latter as one meant to provide on-chain/off-chain infrastructure for networks like Cardano. Hoskinson also expects Bitcoin DeFi to grow on Cardano, since they share the same UTXO system. This move could further boost ADA’s utility and lead to significant growth in the ecosystem. However, for now, the blockchain remains well behind, as DeFiLlama data show it ranks 31st in DeFi TVL. Big Things In Store For The Blockchain? Cardano’s core ecosystem organizations proposed an infrastructure budget last month to advance stablecoins, custody, analytics, bridges, and pricing oracles on the network. The ecosystem already appears to be making progress, as the Midnight Foundation President, Fahmi Syed, recently revealed that a legal contract has been received for a stablecoin partner. This has led to speculation that it could be USDT or USDC, with these stablecoins likely to provide a significant boost to network activity. Commenting on the network’s future, stakeholder Rami recently expressed optimism , stating that the network is getting a tier-1 stablecoin in months while the DEX trading volume is “exploding.” He believes that trading volume will continue to grow as additional NIGHT liquidity enters the market and more trading pairs are established. Rami added that DEXs are faster than ever and that new oracle systems are coming online. At the time of writing, the ADA price is trading at around $0.35, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|adausd|ADAUSDT|Cardano ecosystem|Cardano network|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Charles Hoskinson|ChatGPT|Coinmarketcap|DApps|Decentralized Applications|DeFi|DEX Hunter|DEXs|Ethereum’s Uniswap|Fahmi Syed|NIGHT|stablecoin|TVL|USDC|USDT,EN,0,0,ADA|TRADING|USDT|USDC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-24 18:00:36

After pushing to a new all-time high around the $296 region in January, the rally quickly lost momentum and transitioned into a steady decline that has persisted for months. Many traders have attributed this weakness to a risk-off sentiment across crypto, but a deeper on-chain breakdown shared by crypto analyst Ardi on X suggests the story began well before the January peak and has more to do with who was buying and who was quietly exiting. Distribution Was Already Underway Before The January Peak Solana has been on a clear downtrend since September, when it reached a lower high of around $247 compared to its January 19 all-time high of $293. One of the most important insights from Ardi’s analysis is that Solana’s January all-time high did not mark the start of distribution but rather the culmination of it. Related Reading: Why Has The Solana Price Been Crashing Since October? This Major SOL Player Is Selling The chart attached to his post shows that selling volume was already increasing months earlier, well ahead of October, meaning that large holders were positioning for exits long before price reached its final peak. From that perspective, the January high looks less like the beginning of a new expansion phase and more like the last push of a rally. After that point, price action began forming lower highs, and each rebound attempt lacked the strength needed to reclaim the all-time high. Interestingly, Solana failed to reach a new all-time high, even as other large market cap cryptos like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and BNB pushed to new all-time highs during the year. Another interesting feature of the data is the widening gap between retail behavior and that of larger players. Cumulative delta metrics on the chart show that retail-sized wallets have been consistently active throughout the year and are increasing their activity even as Solana’s price moved lower. On the other hand, mid-sized and institutional wallets tell a very different story. Their activity has been trending downward for months, starting from the January peak and extending up until the time of writing. Is Solana’s Price Becoming Dependent On Memecoin Activity? Ardi’s analysis also raises a broader question about what is currently driving demand for Solana. Outside of retail activity on Solana itself, one of the few consistent sources of activity has been the memecoin sector. Successes and booms of meme coins like Cat in a Dogs World (MEW), Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), which gained traction in the second half of 2024, contributed to Solana’s push to all-time highs during those periods. Related Reading: Will Solana Flip Ethereum? Revenue Numbers Show Disturbing Trend Those meme coin successes culminated with the launch of the Official Trump ($TRUMP) token in January 2025 on Solana, which experienced eye-watering gains shortly after its launch. This, in turn, contributed to Solana’s all-time high in January. However, since then, the TRUMP token and other Solana-based meme coins have been trending downwards in recent months and no longer command the same level of attention or trading intensity they had this time last year. That has led to the view that Solana’s price is increasingly sensitive to the success of memecoins in its ecosystem. At the time of writing, Solana is trading at $121.50, down by about 58.6% from its January all-time high of $293.

However, on-chain analytics firm Santiment says that the wave of pessimism may be flashing a contrarian signal. According to it, extreme negativity toward high-profile Bitcoin holders has often appeared near local market lows, suggesting selling pressure may be close to exhaustion rather than just beginning. Rising Hostility Toward Saylor as Bitcoin Stalls In a Christmas Eve post, Santiment noted that discussions around Strategy and Saylor spiked sharply in mid-November as Bitcoin failed to regain upside traction. The firm stated that a key trigger for the backlash was the steep fall in Strategy’s stock price, which dropped from around $456 in July to roughly $160 in December, a decline of about 65%. Santiment wrote that the drop “has come with quite a bit of hostility, distraught, and of course memes,” reflecting growing frustration among retail traders. Much of the concern centers on Strategy’s aggressive borrowing to buy Bitcoin, a plan that worked well during strong markets but looks risky during downturns. On X and Reddit, the topic has often been simplified into fears of over-leverage and liquidation, even though most of the company’s debt does not face daily margin calls. Santiment also pointed out that another source of anxiety is Strategy’s identity shift under Saylor, with many traders viewing it less as a software firm and more as a Bitcoin proxy. The market intelligence platform noted that social posts frequently jump to worst-case scenarios, including forced BTC sales or shareholder dilution, even when such outcomes are not automatic. Additionally, less than three weeks ago, Polymarket data showed 61% of traders betting that Strategy could be removed from the MSCI index by March 31 next year, adding to the gloomy mood. Why Extreme Pessimism May Hint at a Market Floor It is the hostility that Santiment contends may be a signal. “Heavy bearishness toward Strategy and Michael Saylor is arguably a stealth bottom signal because it shows emotions have reached an extreme level of FUD,” the firm remarked. It added that when fear becomes one-sided, it means that many weaker hands have already sold, leaving fewer sellers behind. This view comes as other data points show Strategy shifting into a more defensive stance. A CryptoQuant report from earlier in the month said the company has slowed Bitcoin purchases through 2025 and built a dollar cash buffer to cover dividends and interest for at least a year. While Strategy still holds more than 670,000 BTC, recent disclosures confirm it now allows for Bitcoin sales or derivatives use as part of risk management. Santiment added that when sentiment toward figures like Saylor is deeply negative, even modestly positive developments can shift narratives quickly. And even though fear alone does not guarantee a rebound, history suggests that when social chatter turns relentlessly hostile, downside risk may already be priced in.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-just-did-a-complete-180-heres-the-significance/,"Crypto markets are driven as much by emotion as they are by data, and XRP’s recent sentiment swing is a clear reflection of that reality. Investor psychology has once again taken center stage, with narratives shifting sharply as price action changes. The result is a familiar cycle of euphoria, disappointment, and renewed doubt—one that says more about market behavior than about XRP itself. Nick, a well-followed crypto market commentator, recently highlighted this phenomenon in an X post, pointing to how dramatically sentiment around XRP has flipped over the past few years. His commentary comes at a time when negativity has returned in force , despite XRP’s undeniable performance since the bear market. We just did a complete 180° on $XRP again. From 2020 up until November 2024 XRP was called a ponzi, a shitcoin, scam, etc. November 2024 when we watched #XRP go from 0.40 to nearly $2 in less than 1 month everyone was bullish. No negativity, no ponzi or scam comments, just… pic.twitter.com/g2xJf1GMad — Nick | Crypto Crusader (@NCashOfficial) December 23, 2025 From Years of Skepticism to Sudden Optimism Between 2020 and late 2024, XRP was routinely dismissed across the crypto space. Labels such as “ponzi,” “scam,” and “dead coin” became common, reinforced by prolonged price stagnation and regulatory uncertainty. That narrative collapsed almost overnight in November 2024 when XRP surged from around $0.40 to nearly $2 within weeks. As momentum accelerated, criticism faded. Social sentiment turned overwhelmingly bullish, and XRP was once again framed as a major contender in the market. The shift was swift, revealing how quickly conviction can follow price rather than precede it. The Pullback That Changed Everything Again That optimism proved fragile. After peaking above the $3.60 region, XRP entered a sharp correction , sliding back toward the $1.80 range. With red candles dominating the chart, the earlier enthusiasm evaporated. Accusations that had disappeared during the rally resurfaced, and confidence gave way to frustration and doubt. Nick emphasized that this pattern reflects emotional investing at scale. Green candles are interpreted as validation, while red candles are treated as proof of failure, regardless of the broader context. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Psychology and Emotional Warfare According to Nick, this emotional volatility is not random. Fear, uncertainty, and doubt tend to intensify during drawdowns, pushing retail investors toward reactive decisions. The market, in effect, conditions participants to associate price direction with truth, even when fundamentals remain unchanged. Notably, XRP still stands more than 10x above its bear market lows in the $0.20–$0.50 range—a fact that is largely ignored amid current negativity. Why Sentiment Extremes Matter Historically, periods of widespread pessimism often coincide with late-stage corrections rather than market tops. Nick argues that when sentiment is “completely wiped out,” it can signal exhaustion rather than further downside. While he acknowledges that only time can confirm whether XRP has found a durable bottom, the sentiment reset itself is significant. XRP’s latest 180° is less about the asset and more about the crowd. It serves as a reminder that in crypto, narratives follow price—but disciplined investors must look beyond them.

The network processed about 1,913,481 transactions on its Layer 1 in a single day, and the average fee to resolve each was around $0.16 per transaction. What is the highest number of transactions on Ethereum? Ethereum stakeholders believ e th e 2025 transaction count record can be linked to a combination of high throughput and low costs, which were directly linked to the two major network upgrades that occurred during the year: the Pectra and Fusaka upgrades. The Fusaka upgrade went live earlier this month and has been singled out as the most probable and immediate cause for the achievement of the new record. The upgrade directly expanded the capacity of the Ethereum L1 blockchain, increasing the size of each block by roughly 33%. That increase may seem minute, but it has allowed the L1 network to fit significantly more transactions into every block. In the past, all nodes were tasked with downloading all data, which resulted in a bottleneck. The Fusaka upgrade introduced PeerDAS, a new feature that has made it possible for nodes to verify data “blobs”, large chunks of transaction data, by sampling just tiny parts of them. Blobs are like sidecars attached to the main block and carry data cheaply without competing with standard transactions. The Fusaka upgrade follows the Pectra upgrade , which was implemented in May, laying the groundwork for scaling by optimizing how Layer 2 networks, such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base, interact with the main chain. Pectra doubled the number of the aforementioned “sidecars” from 3 to 6 per block. And because there was suddenly double the supply of space for Layer 2 data, the cost for L2s to “settle” on Ethereum dropped. Ethereum still faces some critical issues The Pectra and Fusaka upgrades have kept the overall network uncongested and resulted in lower average gas fees. However, scaling challenges still exist within the ecosystem. There is also the fact that the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole is fractured, and users still find it challenging to use L2 funds, as that involves navigating complicated bridges and routes. The fragmentation issue remains a big one, but every now and then, a new L2 pops up, and the database of all accounts, balances, and smart contracts (the “State”) keeps growing larger and larger. If this keeps up, the State becomes terabytes or petabytes in size. And if it gets too big, it becomes impossible for a normal person to buy a hard drive big enough to run a node.

Some assets are demonstrating real volatility. Others are undergoing strategic shifts that make timing more important than ever. In this landscape, APEMARS is emerging as a brand new opportunity, with the presale whitelist live and early entry advantages that could matter more than you think. XRP’s recent price behavior shows resistance and hesitation near key levels, with failed breakouts weakening momentum. Meanwhile, Ethereum, though fundamentally strong, is seeing strategic treasury moves that reflect broader market recalibrations and institutional dynamics. In contrast, APEMARS’ structured presale, built-in utilities, and mission-driven ecosystem offer a clear and compelling reason to join the whitelist now before Stage 1 closes. Timing is everything in crypto, and in this race for the next 100x crypto , those who act first often benefit most. Is APEMARS ($APRZ) the Next 100x Crypto in 2026? From the moment the APEMARS mission launched, it set itself apart from traditional token offerings. This is not a random meme token; it’s a structured journey with purpose and utility at its core, and the whitelist is currently live. APEMARS integrates meaningful utilities designed to reward commitment and engagement from day one. Its 63% APY staking system allows early supporters to earn substantial yield simply by holding and participating. Meanwhile, the thermal disposal mechanism reduces unsold supply at key checkpoints, creating visible scarcity that further underpins demand. Together, these utilities make the early stages of APEMARS not just rewarding but strategically advantageous for forward-thinking investors. Imagine turning every $APRZ you hold into a powerful growth engine; this is exactly what APEMARS’ 63% APY staking delivers. You’re not just holding tokens; you’re earning rewards that compound your wealth while you sleep. And with the thermal disposal mechanism, every unsold token disappears at key stages, creating undeniable scarcity that increases the value of your holdings in real time. These aren’t passive features; they’re strategic tools that put early participants ahead of the curve. By joining now, you’re not just investing; you’re leveraging APEMARS’ ecosystem to maximize returns, dominate early access, and secure a first-mover advantage that others will scramble to catch once the presale fills up. Missing out means watching others capitalize on these rewards while you’re left on the sidelines. Turn $500 Into Massive Gains: APEMARS Investment Scenario Imagine investing $500 in APEMARS Stage 1, where each token is priced at $0.00001699. That means you would receive approximately 29.4 million $APRZ tokens. If the projected listing price of $0.0055 is realized, your $500 investment could potentially grow to around $161,000, a staggering 32,269% ROI. Breaking it down: for every $1 you invest at Stage 1, you are effectively securing 58,800 $APRZ tokens. The structured presale ensures early participants benefit from the lowest possible entry price, while thermal disposal and community-driven scarcity mechanics increase the value potential as the presale progresses. With the whitelist live, securing your allocation now gives you a first-mover advantage, ensuring you’re part of the mission before prices climb and token availability decreases. This is more than buying tokens; it’s entering a strategic position designed to maximize upside from day one. How to Join the APEMARS Whitelist Joining the APEMARS whitelist is simple, fast, and gives you early access to one of the most promising 100x meme coins. Visit the official website and head to the whitelist section. Submit your email address, and you will receive a confirmation email. Join the whitelist today to grab $APRZ at Stage 1 and position yourself for first-mover advantage before the public presale opens. Every moment counts; don’t miss out on this structured opportunity to enter early! XRP: Resistance and Recovery Challenges Amid Market Pressure XRP has long been recognized as one of the most established digital assets in the crypto market, particularly for its role in cross-border payments and liquidity solutions. But it has recently shown repeated failures near the $1.93–$1.95 range, indicating a clear resistance zone where selling pressure continues to outweigh buying momentum. Despite several attempts, the asset has struggled to establish a sustained breakout, suggesting that market participants remain cautious in the short term. After losing support around these levels, XRP has traded lower, with price action pointing toward a range-bound or mildly bearish structure unless renewed demand enters the market. This behavior is typical during consolidation phases, particularly for assets that have already experienced strong prior rallies. Importantly, XRP’s broader fundamentals remain intact. Its established use case in cross-border payments and continued institutional attention provide long-term relevance, even as near-term price action stabilizes. However, the current structure highlights a familiar dynamic in mature assets: upside often becomes incremental rather than exponential once key price levels are widely recognized. In this context, investors seeking higher growth potential may naturally look toward earlier-stage opportunities. Presale projects like APEMARS, where pricing is still forming, and access is structured through a whitelist, offer exposure before market discovery fully unfolds, rather than reacting after resistance levels have already shaped sentiment. Ethereum: Strategic Asset Moves Signal Broader Market Shifts Ethereum continues to serve as the backbone of the decentralized ecosystem, powering DeFi, NFTs, and smart-contract infrastructure across the industry. Recent developments, however, reveal how even large ecosystem participants are adapting to evolving market conditions. Notably, a digital asset treasury firm, ETHZilla, sold approximately 24,291 ETH for around $74.5 million as part of a broader effort to reduce debt and reallocate capital toward real-world asset tokenization initiatives. This large sell action reflects broader challenges within the crypto market, as firms rebalance holdings and navigate financial pressures. While Ethereum remains foundational, these moves highlight evolving priorities among institutional players and underscore why late-stage traders may face increased volatility and unclear shorter-term price momentum. In this shifting environment, early-stage presales like APEMARS, with structured entry and built-in utility incentives, present a clearer blueprint for early participation, rather than reacting to established asset dynamics. Conclusion: The Next 100x Crypto Starts with Early Action XRP’s recent price pressures and Ethereum’s strategic shifts paint a picture of market transitions, not a lack of opportunity. Yet in these cycles, the biggest gains often come from early, structured opportunities before price discovery accelerates. APEMARS, with its live whitelist, staking rewards, and scarcity mechanics, stands out as the next 100x crypto that forward-thinking investors can act on today. For those seeking to know more about the latest coins, refer to the best crypto to buy now, and stay updated. Moreover, waiting for broader market confirmation could mean missing the first-mover advantage that early whitelist entrants are positioned to capture. Join the APEMARS whitelist now and position yourself ahead of the curve.

It refers to early-stage projects with potential for significant price appreciation, often through presales before public listings. Why highlight APEMARS alongside XRP and Ethereum? APEMARS represents a presale opportunity where early participation and structured utilities offer potential upside, unlike more established assets trading after most gains have been realized. Is the APEMARS whitelist live? Yes. The whitelist for APEMARS presale is live, giving early participants priority access before public trading. How does the staking system work in APEMARS? APEMARS offers a 63% APY staking system that rewards holders for commitment, enhancing long-term participation potential. Why should I join the whitelist now? Each completed presale stage increases the price and reduces supply. Early entry secures lower pricing and better positioning for potential future gains. Article Summary In this dated comparative article, we examine APEMARS, XRP, and Ethereum in the context of evolving crypto markets. XRP’s price action shows resistance and weakening momentum below key levels. Ethereum faces strategic asset moves with large ETH sales by institutional players. In contrast, APEMARS presale, with its community mission, staking, and scarcity features, offers investors a genuine chance to participate early in the next 100x crypto opportunity. With the whitelist live, early entry could be vital for maximizing potential returns ahead of public listing and broader adoption.

Internet service providers across the Philippines began blocking major global exchanges, signaling that regulatory compliance now determines market participation. Consequently, crypto users now face a more controlled environment as authorities push platforms to secure proper authorization before offering services. Reports from local users confirmed that access to Coinbase and Gemini became unavailable on Tuesday, Dec. 24, 2025. Multiple internet providers enforced the restrictions at the same time. Besides user reports, independent checks showed both platforms remained inaccessible nationwide. The move reflects closer coordination between regulators and telecom providers to enforce financial oversight rules. Regulators Enforce Licensing Rules More Aggressively According to the Manila Bulletin, the National Telecommunications Commission issued directives to block access to 50 trading platforms. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas flagged these platforms for operating without authorization. However, the central bank did not publish the full list of affected exchanges. Hence, market participants continue to assess the broader impact. Significantly, this action highlights a clear policy shift. Philippine regulators no longer tolerate informal crypto access. Instead, they now prioritize licensing as the gateway for operation. Coinbase and Gemini now join Binance on the blocked list, reinforcing the government’s message to global platforms. Binance Case Set the Enforcement Precedent The current action follows earlier enforcement against Binance. In December 2023, Philippine authorities launched a 90-day compliance window. The Securities and Exchange Commission urged users to withdraw funds during that period. Consequently, regulators moved ahead with restrictions after Binance failed to meet requirements. On March 25, 2024, the NTC ordered ISPs to block Binance. Additionally, in April 2024, regulators instructed Apple and Google to remove the Binance app from local stores. Afterward, the SEC stated it could not support recovery methods for affected users. Moreover, authorities later identified OKX, Bybit, and KuCoin among ten unlicensed exchanges. Regulated Platforms Expand as Enforcement Tightens While enforcement intensifies, compliant firms continue expanding services. On Nov. 19, 2024, regulated exchange PDAX partnered with payroll provider Toku. The service allows remote workers to receive salaries in stablecoins. Users can convert earnings to pesos without delays or wire fees. Additionally, on Dec. 8, 2024, digital bank GoTyme introduced crypto services through a partnership with Alpaca. The platform now supports 11 digital assets within its banking app. Consequently, regulators appear to encourage innovation, provided companies follow licensing rules.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|BNB|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-24 18:16:08

But here’s the stark reality for European startups: the data tells a different story. While optimism fills conference halls, the numbers reveal a market still recovering from the global venture capital reset. Let’s dive into what the data really says about Europe’s startup ecosystem and why there might be light at the end of the tunnel. European Startups: Energy vs. Reality You can feel the excitement in European tech hubs—from Berlin to Stockholm to Paris. But the hard numbers from PitchBook paint a more sobering picture. Through Q3 2025, investors poured €43.7 billion into European startups across 7,743 deals. While substantial, this puts Europe on track to match, not exceed, the €62.1 billion invested in 2024. Compare this to the U.S., where venture deal volume in 2025 had already surpassed 2022, 2023, and 2024 levels by the end of the third quarter. Region 2025 Funding (Through Q3) Trend vs. Previous Years Europe €43.7 billion Matching 2023-2024 levels United States Data indicates growth Surpassing 2022-2024 levels The Venture Capital Drought in Europe Here’s where the situation gets concerning: European VC firm fundraising. Through Q3 2025, European VC firms raised a mere €8.3 billion. This puts Europe on track for its lowest yearly fundraising total in a decade. Navina Rajan, a senior analyst at PitchBook, told Bitcoin World: “Fundraising, LP to GP, is definitely the weakest area within Europe. We’re on track for around 50% to 60% decline in the first nine months of this year.” The breakdown reveals three critical issues: Emerging managers dominate fundraising versus experienced firms Mega funds that closed last year haven’t repeated in 2025 Limited partner confidence remains cautious AI Startups: Europe’s Bright Spot Despite the funding challenges, European AI startups are capturing global attention. This sector represents one of the most promising areas for growth and investor interest. French AI research lab Mistral’s recent €1.7 billion Series C round included heavyweights like Andreessen Horowitz and Nvidia, signaling that world-class AI innovation is happening in Europe. Swedish vibe-coding startup Lovable represents another success story. The company just announced a $330 million Series B round led by U.S.-based VCs including Salesforce Ventures and CapitalG. Rajan notes the strategic thinking behind this U.S. interest: “Just from an entry point of view, because you think about valuations, especially within AI tech and in the U.S., it’s just impossible to get in now, whereas, if you’re in Europe and your multiples are lower, and you’re new as an investor, it just provides a better entry point for perhaps similar tech.” The Klarna Exit: A Turning Point for European Startups? Klarna’s recent public offering represents more than just a successful exit—it could signal a fundamental shift in Europe’s startup ecosystem. The Swedish fintech giant went public in September after raising $6.2 billion across two decades in the private market. This exit matters because: It recycles capital back to European limited partners It demonstrates that European companies can achieve massive scale It provides a blueprint for other European startups Victor Englesson, a partner at Swedish EQT, observes how these success stories are changing founder mentalities: “Ambitious founders have seen what great looks like in companies like Spotify, Klarna, Revolut and are now starting companies with that type of ambition. They’re not starting companies with like, I want to win in Europe, or I want to win in Germany. They start companies with a mindset that I want to win globally.” Startup Funding: The Path Forward The data reveals a complex picture for European startup funding. While overall investment levels remain stable, the VC fundraising drought presents a significant challenge. However, several positive indicators suggest potential recovery: U.S. investor participation in European deals is rising again, reaching 19% in 2023 and climbing steadily since Successful exits like Klarna’s are building confidence European AI startups are attracting global capital Founder ambitions are becoming more globally oriented Englesson’s perspective from EQT captures the long-term confidence: “For EQT, we’ve invested $120 billion in Europe [over the] last five years. We’re going to invest $250 billion [over the] next five years in Europe. So we are extremely committed to Europe.” FAQs: European Startup Market What is the current state of European startup funding? European startup funding through Q3 2025 reached €43.7 billion across 7,743 deals, putting the region on track to match 2023-2024 levels rather than exceed them. Which European AI startups are attracting attention? Mistral , the French AI research lab, recently raised €1.7 billion in Series C funding. Swedish vibe-coding startup Lovable raised $330 million in Series B funding with participation from U.S. investors. How significant was Klarna’s exit for Europe? Klarna’s September IPO after raising $6.2 billion privately represents a major milestone for European fintech and the broader startup ecosystem, potentially recycling capital and building investor confidence. What do investors like Navina Rajan say about Europe’s VC fundraising? PitchBook senior analyst Navina Rajan notes that European VC fundraising is “definitely the weakest area” with a 50-60% decline in the first nine months of 2025 compared to previous years. How are firms like EQT approaching European investment? EQT partner Victor Englesson states the firm plans to invest $250 billion in Europe over the next five years, demonstrating strong commitment despite current challenges. Conclusion: The Resilient Future of European Startups The European startup market presents a study in contrasts—boundless energy against sobering data, local challenges against global opportunities. While VC fundraising remains a significant concern, the resurgence of U.S. investor interest, the success of AI startups, and landmark exits like Klarna’s suggest Europe may be on the cusp of a meaningful turnaround. The most encouraging development might be the shift in founder mentality—from thinking locally to building globally. This psychological shift, combined with strategic investments in high-potential sectors like AI, could help Europe’s startup ecosystem not just recover, but thrive in the coming years.

56305248,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/12/st-mary-capital-announces-launch-of-custom-alert-builder,1766600868,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/56305248.jpeg,St Mary Capital Announces Launch of Custom Alert Builder,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/12/st-mary-capital-announces-launch-of-custom-alert-builder,"London, UK, December 24th, 2025, Chainwire St Mary Capital , a financial firm providing multi-asset access through its investment platform, has announced the launch of a Custom Alert Builder. The new feature allows users to create personalized alerts based on selected market conditions and account-related activity. The update is now available to users in supported regions and is intended to improve how market information is monitored within the platform. The Custom Alert Builder enables users to define alerts tied to specific price levels, percentage movements, and other pre-set criteria. These alerts are designed to notify users when selected conditions are met, helping them track “price action” and “market volatility” without the need for continuous platform monitoring. The feature has been added without changing existing account structures or execution processes. St Mary Capital’s CTO, Benjamin Rothwell, said the update reflects ongoing efforts to respond to user behavior. “Many users prefer structured notifications instead of constant observation,” Rothwell said. “The Custom Alert Builder offers that option while keeping the experience straightforward.” Rothwell added that the feature was developed to fit into existing workflows without adding unnecessary steps. The alert system supports assets available across the platform, allowing users to apply different conditions to different instruments. Alerts can be modified, paused, or deleted at any time. This flexibility is intended to support common practices related to “risk management” and monitoring “entry levels” or “exit points,” while leaving all decisions to the user. Platform Update Focuses on User-Defined Monitoring The release of the Custom Alert Builder aligns with broader industry trends toward configurable monitoring tools. As financial markets operate continuously across global time zones, alerts have become a practical way for users to stay informed. St Mary Capital stated that the feature is optional and only functions when activated by the user. Rothwell commented on the role of alerts within daily platform use. “Alerts are meant to support awareness,” Rothwell said. “Users decide what they want to track and when they want to be notified.” Rothwell noted that the tool allows users to observe “market signals” without receiving unsolicited notifications. The Custom Alert Builder is integrated directly into the platform dashboard. Users can manage alert settings through the same interface used for other account tools. Notifications are delivered through in-platform messages and supported communication channels based on user preferences. The firm stated that the system was tested to ensure consistent delivery under standard market conditions. From a technical perspective, the alert builder operates using real-time market data already available on the platform. Alerts reflect only the conditions defined by the user and do not include predictive elements or automated recommendations. The firm emphasized that alerts do not trigger trades or modify orders. Market participants increasingly rely on configurable alerts to manage diverse portfolios. Industry observers note that such tools are commonly used to monitor multiple instruments at once while limiting screen time. St Mary Capital stated that feedback from users will be reviewed to inform future platform updates. The company also clarified that the Custom Alert Builder does not provide guidance or advice. All alerts are informational and serve as notifications rather than signals. Users remain responsible for how they interpret data and how they respond to market changes. The introduction of the Custom Alert Builder represents an incremental platform update rather than a change in service scope. St Mary Capital stated that development efforts remain focused on usability, transparency, and system reliability. Future updates will continue to emphasize tools that support informed engagement with market data while maintaining user control. About St Mary Capital St Mary Capital is a global investment firm offering access to a diverse range of financial instruments, including cryptocurrencies, equities, indices, and commodities.

This $0.035 New DeFi Crypto Is Being Compared to Top Altcoins,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-crypto-to-invest-for-long-term-this-0-035-new-defi-crypto-is-being-compared-to-top-altcoins/,"Crypto markets often move in cycles that are not driven by headlines, but by capital rotation. Late in a cycle, large caps tend to slow. Price action becomes tighter, and upside looks limited. At the same time, attention and liquidity start moving toward smaller assets with room to expand. This rotation pattern has played out many times before. Capital exits crowded trades and looks for early stage DeFi crypto with developing fundamentals. Right now, Mutuum Finance is increasingly viewed as one of those rotation targets, even before its full utility goes live. Why Capital Is Rotating Away From Large Cap Crypto Large cap assets like Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana already carry high market caps. This size brings stability, but it also limits upside. Moving these assets requires massive inflows of new capital. As markets mature, returns compress. A 2x move becomes harder. A 5x move becomes unlikely. Investors looking for long-term growth often start searching for smaller tokens where price discovery is still forming. This does not mean large caps lose relevance. It means their role changes. They become core holdings, while growth focused capital rotates toward new crypto with lower valuations and expanding narratives. Where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Fits in the Rotation Cycle Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , sits at a point in the cycle that often attracts rotation capital. It is not an early concept anymore. Development is advanced, audits are complete, and the roadmap is active. At the same time, full protocol usage has not started yet. This combination matters. MUTM is visible enough to reduce uncertainty, but early enough to offer price elasticity. The token is currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6, after a 250% rise since Phase 1. Presale growth supports this rotation narrative. More than $19.4M has been raised, and the holder base has grown to over 18,600 wallets. This expansion happened steadily, which often signals capital rotation rather than short term speculation. Relative Valuation Model Relative valuation is a common way to assess early stage DeFi crypto. Instead of asking what a token is worth in isolation, investors compare it to similar protocols at comparable stages. Early lending platforms often traded at much higher valuations once basic infrastructure was live and usage began. MUTM is still valued as a developing protocol, not as an active one. A conservative model assumes MUTM only captures a small share of the valuation seen in established DeFi lending platforms. Under that view, a 3x to 4x move from current levels becomes reasonable as capital rotation continues and visibility increases. This scenario does not rely on hype. It relies on capital flowing from slower large caps into assets where valuation gaps still exist. Usage Expansion The second scenario focuses on what happens after V1 goes live . Once lending and borrowing activity begins, valuation drivers change. Mutuum Finance is designed around structured lending markets. Users supply assets and receive mtTokens that grow as interest accrues. Borrowers lock collateral and pay interest based on clear rules. As usage expands, lending volume and borrowing demand become measurable. This data often attracts a different type of capital, focused on fundamentals rather than narratives. If post V1 activity grows steadily, a 5x range from current pricing becomes a realistic scenario over time. This assumes moderate adoption, not explosive growth. Why Analysts See Rotation Continuing The case for continued rotation into MUTM rests on timing. Large caps are stable but slow. Their upside is capped by size. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance is still forming its market position. Security has already been addressed. The protocol completed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 score and underwent additional Halborn Security reviews . A $50k bug bounty adds another layer of protection. Phase 6 allocation is nearing completion (over 99% allocated), which tightens supply further. Activity indicators like the 24 hour leaderboard show consistent engagement, not one time spikes. Taken together, these factors explain why some analysts view MUTM as a long-term rotation play rather than a short-term trade. The upside case is driven by capital movement, usage growth, and structural design, not hype. As markets continue to rotate away from crowded large caps, early stage DeFi crypto with developing fundamentals often become the next focus. Mutuum Finance appears to be entering that window.

That is the challenge posed by Jesse of Apex Crypto, who urged followers to reconsider expectations around XRP’s long-term price . Rather than focusing on short-term market movements, Jesse centered his argument on the role he believes XRP is meant to play and the financial structure that would be required to support it. Since XRP will become the world's main liquidity source (On-Demand-Liquidity), a $3 valuation is unrealistic. Being backed by global assets like gold and fiat requires a much higher valuation to make sense. pic.twitter.com/RLFu6BYrSH — Apex Crypto Insights (NFA) (@APEXCONSULTNFA) December 22, 2025 XRP as a Global Liquidity Source Jesse’s core position is that XRP is intended to function as the world’s main liquidity instrument through on-demand liquidity mechanisms. In his view, such a role would place XRP at the center of cross-border settlements, institutional transfers, and large-scale value movement between financial entities. He argues that an asset tasked with facilitating liquidity at this scale cannot reasonably align with a $3 price. According to Jesse, the logic is straightforward. If XRP is expected to provide liquidity for global markets, it would need to reflect the magnitude of the value flowing through it. A low unit price, he suggests, would be incompatible with the demands of serving the largest financial institutions and the volume of transactions associated with them. Backed By Global Financial Assets Another key point in Jesse’s commentary is the idea that XRP could be supported, or effectively backed, by a range of global financial assets. He refers to major stores of value such as gold, potential inclusion of silver, fiat currencies, and even central bank digital currencies. In this scenario, XRP would not exist in isolation but would be linked to reserves held across the global financial system. Jesse explains that if such backing were to exist, the combined value of these assets would need to correspond with the total value of the XRP supply in circulation. Using a hypothetical illustration, he notes that if there were around one hundred billion tokens, their aggregate valuation would be expected to align with the pool of assets, providing stability and support. From this perspective, a low per-unit price would fail to account for the scale of reserves implied by such a model. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Floor for Long-Term Valuation Building on this reasoning, Jesse suggests that asset backing would effectively establish a valuation floor for XRP. The presence of substantial reserves would mean that the price could not logically remain at a minimal level if it were truly represented and supported by vast financial holdings. In his assessment, the idea of XRP operating as both a global liquidity source and a form of stable value instrument while remaining near $3 does not align with basic financial sense. While Jesse does not assign a specific figure to what he believes XRP should be worth, his message is clear. If the asset is to fulfill the role he describes, expectations anchored to low valuations are, in his words, unrealistic.

Key Metric Hits Alarming Low,https://cryptopotato.com/is-bitcoins-cycle-top-already-in-key-metric-hits-alarming-low/,"Bitcoin (BTC) remains stuck in a tight range, with options data and on-chain activity showing a shift in how the market is positioned. Holiday conditions have thinned liquidity, and recent data points to cautious trading in derivatives while long-term holders continue to add. Options Data Shows Shift in Market Positioning CME options data shows that Bitcoin call option open interest peaked in December 2024, close to recent price highs above $90,000. Since then, call interest has declined steadily and is now near cycle lows. This pattern follows historical behavior, where call interest often falls after strong price rallies fade. Crypto analyst CW said , “$BTC CME options open interest indicates a bottom in buying pressure.” Lower call positioning shows that traders are no longer pricing in a near-term move higher. Meanwhile, put option open interest has risen, pointing to increased demand for downside cover rather than fresh upside exposure. Moreover, growing put option activity often appears during periods of uncertainty. While it can reflect downside risk, similar conditions have also formed during price stabilization phases. CW noted that “ an increase in put options can also signal a potential market reversal, ” especially when positioning becomes crowded on one side. On-chain data shows a different trend. Bitcoin inflows to accumulation addresses have increased, with several large spikes recorded while the price trades below recent highs. These wallets tend to hold for long periods and rarely move funds, which points to large holders increasing positions rather than selling. Bitcoin (BTC) Inflows to Accumulation Addresses 24.12. Source: CW/X Bitcoin Price Trades Between Key Support and Resistance Bitcoin trades near $87,000 at press time, down just under 1% over the past day and slightly higher on the week. Earlier in the week, the asset dropped from above $90,000 to below $86,500 before buyers stepped in and lifted it back up. Activity slowed over the weekend, followed by another failed push near $90,400. On the 4-hour chart, BTC continues to move sideways with little follow-through. The $86,500 area has held as support after several tests, while selling pressure near $88,000 has kept price contained. Michaël van de Poppe said that “ there’s just some chop taking place on the markets, ” adding that a break above $88,000 would improve short-term structure. Elsewhere, liquidity data shows heavy sell interest between $90,000 and $95,000, with strong buy interest sitting between $83,000 and $85,000.

This strategic expansion allows users to directly swap their USDC for digital representations of physical gold (GLDC) and silver (SILC), marking a significant evolution in the tokenization of real-world assets. For investors seeking stability and diversification, this development opens a compelling new chapter. What Are Circle’s New Gold and Silver Tokens? Circle’s latest innovation introduces two new asset-backed tokens: GLDC for gold and SILC for silver. According to a report from CryptoBriefing, these tokens are not mere speculative digital assets. Instead, each token is designed to represent a claim on a specific quantity of physical gold or silver held in secure, audited vaults. This model provides a seamless, blockchain-based method to own and transfer precious metals without the logistical hurdles of physical storage. The launch process is straightforward. Users can visit Circle’s official website and use their USDC holdings to acquire these new tokens. This direct swap mechanism leverages the efficiency and transparency of blockchain technology, creating a frictionless bridge between the world’s leading dollar-pegged stablecoin and timeless stores of value. Why Is Circle Launching Gold and Silver Tokens Now? This move is a strategic response to growing market demand for diversified, inflation-resistant assets within the crypto ecosystem. By tokenizing gold and silver, Circle addresses several key investor needs: Portfolio Hedging: Precious metals have historically acted as a hedge against market volatility and currency devaluation. Accessibility: It lowers the barrier to entry for fractional ownership of high-value commodities. Liquidity and Speed: Transacting with these Circle gold silver tokens is faster and more global than trading physical bullion. Therefore, this launch positions Circle not just as a stablecoin issuer, but as a foundational platform for a broader range of tokenized real-world assets. How Do You Acquire and Use These New Tokens? The user journey for acquiring GLDC and SILC is intentionally simple, mirroring the ease of use that has made USDC popular. Here is a quick guide: Hold USDC in a compatible wallet. Navigate to the dedicated section on Circle’s official website. Initiate a swap, converting your USDC into either GLDC or SILC tokens. The new tokens are then delivered to your wallet, representing your ownership stake. Once acquired, these tokens can be held as a long-term store of value, used as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, or transferred globally with the speed of a digital asset. This functionality merges the ancient value proposition of precious metals with modern financial utility. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges? The introduction of Circle gold silver tokens brings exciting possibilities alongside considerations for savvy investors. Key Benefits: Diversification: Instantly adds a non-correlated asset class to a crypto portfolio. Transparency: Blockchain enables verifiable proof of the underlying asset reserves. Convenience: Eliminates concerns about storage, insurance, and authenticity of physical metals. Points to Consider: Custodial Trust: Users must trust Circle and its partners to properly vault the physical assets. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory treatment of asset-backed tokens is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Market Adoption: The long-term liquidity and use cases for GLDC and SILC will depend on widespread market acceptance. Conclusion: A New Era for Tokenized Assets Circle’s launch of gold and silver tokens is a visionary step that significantly broadens the scope of the digital asset economy. It provides a trusted, efficient on-ramp for converting digital dollars into timeless commodities. For the everyday crypto user, this means unprecedented access to wealth preservation tools. For the broader market, it signals the accelerating convergence of traditional finance and blockchain innovation. As tokenization of real-world assets gains momentum, Circle gold silver tokens stand as a pioneering example of a more accessible and interconnected financial future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What exactly are GLDC and SILC tokens? GLDC and SILC are digital tokens issued by Circle. Each GLDC token represents ownership of a specific amount of physical gold, and each SILC token represents ownership of physical silver, which is held in secure, insured vaults. 2. How can I buy these gold and silver tokens? You can purchase them directly on Circle’s official website by swapping your existing USDC stablecoins for GLDC or SILC tokens. 3. Are these tokens a good investment? Like any asset, they carry risk. Their value is primarily tied to the market price of physical gold and silver, offering potential as a hedge against inflation, but they are not immune to price fluctuations. 4. Can I redeem the tokens for physical gold or silver? The specific redemption terms are set by Circle. Typically, such programs allow for redemption of the physical asset, but often with high minimums and through authorized partners. Check Circle’s official documentation for precise details. 5. Where can I store my GLDC and SILC tokens? You can store them in any cryptocurrency wallet that supports the blockchain standard on which they are issued (likely Ethereum initially). Always use a secure, self-custody wallet for control over your assets. 6. How is this different from other gold-backed cryptocurrencies? Circle’s reputation as the issuer of USDC, a highly regulated and transparent stablecoin, brings a significant level of institutional trust and integration potential to its gold and silver tokens that newer projects may not have.

Repeated rejections suggest buyers are struggling to force a breakout, yet downside follow-through remains limited for now. With volume thinning and structure unchanged, the next reaction around this level could determine whether SOL’s price trajectory. Structure Stalls As $127 Continues To Cap Upside Speaking in a recent Solana update, crypto analyst Umair Crypto highlighted that the asset’s structural situation remains unchanged from previous discussions. The core issue is that the chart continues to lack the necessary momentum to flip the $127 level into support. Repeated attempts to breach this price point have been cleanly rejected, forcing the price to turn downward and search for the next established area of support. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Loses Momentum—Could Sellers Take Control Again? Given this persistent failure, the analyst believes a brief sweep below the key $120 level looks increasingly likely before buyers attempt another serious push higher. Umair Crypto emphasized that the most crucial aspect of this potential dip will be the market’s reaction and volume response, particularly around key areas like the volume profile and the Change of Behavior (COB) zone. A weak reaction at these lower levels would signal continuation lower, while a strong acceptance and high volume response could set up the next major rotation back toward the $127 resistance. In the meantime, while the immediate risk is to the downside for a liquidity sweep, the $127 level remains the absolute line in the sand that decides the medium-term direction. Until Solana can secure a sustained reclaim of this barrier, the momentum will remain structurally tentative. Solana Presses Channel Resistance As Market Waits Bitcoinsensus pointed out that Solana is now trading right at a critical breakout area, placing the market in a clear wait-and-see mode. Price is pressing against the descending channel resistance, a level that has repeatedly capped upside attempts in recent sessions. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Cools Off After Rally While Market Eyes a Resistance Break Despite hovering near the upper trendline, no confirmed breakout has occurred yet. The structure suggests growing pressure, but price alone has not been enough to validate a bullish shift. As long as SOL remains trapped beneath this resistance, the setup stays neutral rather than decisively bullish. One key missing ingredient is volume. Buying pressure remains relatively light, signaling hesitation from bulls and a lack of conviction behind the current push higher. Without a noticeable increase in volume, any move above resistance risks turning into another false breakout. A clean break above the channel, paired with strong volume expansion, would change the outlook, acting as a bullish ignition for the next leg higher.

56308712,648416,1766602848,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56308712.jpeg,Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Activity Shows Balanced Buy–Sell Dynamics,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-short-term-holder-activity-shows-balance/,"Bitcoin is struggling to regain traction below the $90,000 level as selling pressure and uncertainty continue to weigh on the market. After repeated failed attempts to reclaim higher ground, price action has turned choppy and directionless, reflecting a market increasingly driven by apathy and fear rather than conviction. On-chain data reinforces this fragile backdrop. Analysis shared by Axel Adler shows that Bitcoin’s short-term holder Net Pressure has fallen into the bottom 5% of its historical distribution, a rare condition that signals an unusually subdued intensity of trading activity. This metric captures the balance between buying and selling from recent market participants, and its current reading points to a state of near equilibrium rather than strong directional bias. At the same time, Bitcoin is trading below the short-term holder realized price, meaning a large share of recent buyers are sitting at or below breakeven. This dynamic typically suppresses aggressive buying while encouraging selling into rallies, as participants look to exit positions with minimal loss. The result is a market caught in balance , where upside attempts lack follow-through, and downside moves struggle to accelerate. As Bitcoin remains pinned below $90,000, the coming weeks are likely to determine whether this rare equilibrium resolves into renewed downside or sets the foundation for a broader trend reset. Short-Term Holder Pressure Enters Rare Neutral Zone Recent on-chain analysis highlighted by Axel Adler points to an unusual shift in Bitcoin’s short-term holder dynamics. The chart tracks Bitcoin’s price alongside the short-term holder realized price and the Net Pressure Tilt indicator, which measures the balance between weighted selling and buying pressure from recent market participants. Positive readings reflect dominant selling pressure, while negative values signal stronger buying activity. At present, the 24-hour moving average of Net Pressure stands at 4.79, with Bitcoin trading near $87,324. This places the indicator deep in historically rare territory. Over the past three years, the median Net Pressure value has been 73.17, a level typically associated with strong selling dominance during expansion phases. By contrast, readings below 10 have occurred in just 5.8% of all observations, underscoring how uncommon the current environment is. Looking at recent behavior, the indicator has fluctuated between −13.30 and +16.66 over the past month. While it spent roughly 75% of that time above zero, indicating net selling pressure, the intensity has remained unusually low. This lack of force suggests neither buyers nor sellers are acting with conviction. The market is now firmly inside the so-called neutral zone, defined by Net Pressure values between −10 and +10. Historically rare, this zone reflects a state of equilibrium where buying and selling pressures largely cancel each other out. Such conditions often precede major directional moves, making the current setup particularly important as Bitcoin searches for its next trend. Bitcoin Holds Near $87K as Medium-Term Structure Comes Under Pressure Bitcoin is trading near the $87,300 level on the 3-day chart, consolidating after a sharp corrective move from the $120,000–$125,000 highs recorded earlier in the cycle. While price remains well above long-term trend support, the medium-term structure has weakened notably, reflecting a shift from momentum-driven expansion to a corrective phase marked by lower highs and reduced follow-through. Technically, Bitcoin has lost its faster-moving averages, with price now trading below the 100-day and 200-day averages on this timeframe. Both are beginning to flatten and turn lower, acting as dynamic resistance rather than support. This change signals that upside momentum has faded and that rallies are increasingly being sold into. The rejection of above $110,000 was particularly significant, as it confirmed a distribution phase rather than a simple consolidation. From a structural standpoint, the $85,000–$88,000 zone is critical. Holding this area preserves the broader bullish market structure, anchored by the rising long-term moving average below. A decisive breakdown, however, would likely open the door to a deeper retracement toward the low $80,000s. For Bitcoin to regain strength, price must reclaim the $95,000–$100,000 region and reestablish acceptance above its key medium-term averages.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Activity|bitcoin news|Bitcoin Price Analysis|Bitcoin Short-Term Holder|Bitcoin STH|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-24 19:00:48

56306603,https://timestabloid.com/?p=93241,1766603112,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Very Important Message to the XRP Community,https://timestabloid.com/very-important-message-to-the-xrp-community/,"The XRP ecosystem is once again navigating a moment where influence, interpretation, and technical accuracy collide. As XRP’s role in global payments, liquidity provisioning, and institutional blockchain infrastructure continues to expand, community discussions have grown more complex—and, at times, more contentious. In such an environment, clarity matters just as much as conviction, especially when widely shared content begins shaping market perception. Against this backdrop, Jesse of Apex Crypto Insights issued a public message addressing rising concerns sparked by a recently circulated video discussing XRP flows, utility, and ledger architecture. While reaffirming his respect for long-standing contributors within the community, Jesse made it clear that certain claims now gaining traction do not align with verified, current realities surrounding the XRP Ledger and Ripple’s enterprise ecosystem. VERY IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO THE XRP COMMUNITY Dear XRP Community, Regarding the recent video and post by Lewis Jackson on XRP's flow, utility, private ledgers, shared ledgers, and related topics, I want to address this directly. I have genuine respect for Lewis Jackson and… — Apex Crypto Insights (NFA) (@APEXCONSULTNFA) December 24, 2025 Context Behind the Controversy The discussion centers on interpretations of how XRP interacts with private ledgers, shared ledgers, and institutional systems. According to Jesse, several technical conclusions presented in the video are fundamentally flawed. He noted that within the first portion alone, multiple inaccuracies stood out—enough to warrant a direct response due to the confusion they were causing among XRP holders. This concern is not abstract. Jesse revealed that numerous community members reached out privately seeking reassurance and technical clarification, underscoring how quickly uncertainty can spread when complex infrastructure topics are oversimplified or mischaracterized. The XRPL Architecture and Utility Publicly documented information from Ripple and XRPL developers confirms that the XRP Ledger is a public, decentralized blockchain . Private ledgers used by financial institutions are separate systems designed for regulatory compliance and operational privacy. Interaction between these environments occurs through structured interoperability frameworks, not through undocumented or speculative XRP “flow” mechanisms. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Misrepresenting this distinction can distort expectations around liquidity movement, token utility, and institutional adoption—particularly at a time when Ripple’s infrastructure strategy includes regulated products such as RLUSD, which launched in December 2024 and is now fully operational. Addressing Misinformation and Platform Friction Jesse also disclosed that an earlier post outlining his concerns and promising detailed follow-ups was removed from the platform, prompting the release of a more direct public statement. Despite this setback, he stressed that there is no cause for alarm and advised the community to disregard the disputed claims until a full technical breakdown is presented. What Comes Next for the XRP Community To ensure transparency and accuracy, Jesse confirmed that a series of fact-based response videos will be released within the next four to eight days. Each will address specific errors using verifiable data and established XRPL documentation. For now, his message is one of reassurance: informed analysis, not reactionary fear, remains essential as XRP continues its evolution within global finance.

The Japanese Bitcoin treasury company’s board just passed a vote at an extraordinary shareholder meeting, according to a post on X by strategy director Dylan LeClair, who confirmed that shareholders unanimously backed the equity moves. These will allow Metaplanet to use financing tools to buy more Bitcoin without instantly cutting the value of shares held by current investors.

These shares come loaded with features, like floating rates, meaning interest that changes over time with the market, so that investors pay less upfront but take on changing returns. Also, they’ll pay quarterly dividends. That’s four payments a year. Not bad, considering most Bitcoin-focused firms don’t even touch dividends. With the Class B preferred shares, investors will get a 10-year, 130% “issuer call”. In plain English? The company can buy back the shares after 10 years for 130% of what they originally cost. There’s also a put right feature. If Metaplanet doesn’t go public within a year, investors can force the company to buy back the shares at a pre-set price. This gives some safety to buyers worried about liquidity or exit options. Crypto winter or not, Japan-based digital asset treasuries are still spending. Two other DATs on the Tokyo Stock Exchange have recently bought around $2.6 million worth of Bitcoin. Both plan to keep buying more in 2026. This is happening while most crypto treasuries globally are taking heavy hits or trading below their asset value. But that hasn’t stopped Metaplanet. Hermes Lux, an analyst who follows Bitcoin treasuries, said the company’s stock could jump 1,500% by the end of 2027, assuming Bitcoin grows 40% a year and Metaplanet hits its goal of 100,000 BTC by 2026 and 210,000 BTC by 2027. For 2026 alone, Lux expects a 402% upside on the stock. Again, that’s if Bitcoin performs and the firm keeps buying. Source : Hermes Lux/X Right now, Metaplanet has three stocks in the wild. MPJPY is the new one, backed and trading in the U.S. OTC markets. MTPLF was the first U.S. listing, but it’s unbacked. Then there’s the original: stock 3350, which trades on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. All three have bounced back over the past month. Gains range between 6% and 28%, even as Bitcoin itself only managed under 1%. Strategy’s MSTR, by comparison, dropped 12% in the same period. That gap has started to catch attention, and not in a subtle way.

This announcement comes as a direct response to a fabricated press release that circulated online, claiming the company had entered the precious metals tokenization space. The situation highlights the ongoing challenge of misinformation in the cryptocurrency industry. What Exactly Did Circle Deny About Their Token Platform? Circle has explicitly stated that it has not launched gold (GLDC) and silver (SILC) tokens. The company refuted claims from a fake press release that circulated, which falsely announced the creation of a platform called CircleMetals. According to the fraudulent announcement, this platform would support the trading of these precious metal-backed tokens. However, Circle’s official channels contain no such announcement, and the company has moved quickly to correct the record. This incident serves as a stark reminder of how quickly false information can spread in the digital asset space. The fake release appeared convincing enough to generate initial interest before being debunked. Circle’s prompt response demonstrates their commitment to transparency and protecting their reputation in the market. Why Would Someone Create Fake News About a Token Platform? The motivations behind such fabricated announcements can vary, but they typically involve several concerning possibilities: Market manipulation : False news can influence token prices or create artificial demand Phishing attempts : Fake platforms can be used to steal user credentials or funds Reputation damage : Competitors or bad actors might seek to undermine trust in legitimate companies Testing security : Sometimes these are probes to see how quickly misinformation spreads For investors, this situation underscores the importance of verifying information through official channels. Always check a company’s verified website and social media accounts before acting on any news about new token platforms or product launches. How Can You Spot Fake Crypto News About Token Platforms? Protecting yourself from cryptocurrency misinformation requires developing a critical eye. Here are practical steps to verify news about any token platform: Check official sources : Visit the company’s verified website and social media profiles Look for multiple confirmations : Legitimate news is typically reported by multiple reputable outlets Examine the details : Fake announcements often contain grammatical errors or vague technical information Verify contact information : Legitimate companies use official email domains and contact channels In the case of Circle’s denied token platform, the company’s quick response helped prevent potential confusion. However, not all companies react as swiftly, making personal verification crucial for anyone participating in digital asset markets. What Does This Mean for the Future of Tokenized Assets? Despite this incident involving false claims, the concept of tokenizing real-world assets like gold and silver continues to gain traction in legitimate circles. Several companies are actively developing platforms for precious metal tokens, offering potential benefits including: Increased accessibility to commodity investments Improved liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets Fractional ownership opportunities Enhanced transparency through blockchain tracking The key takeaway is that while innovation continues in the token platform space, due diligence remains essential. Circle’s experience with fake news serves as a cautionary tale for both companies and investors navigating this evolving landscape. Conclusion: Navigating Truth in the Token Economy Circle’s denial of launching a gold and silver token platform highlights the persistent challenge of misinformation in cryptocurrency markets. As the industry grows, so too does the sophistication of false information campaigns. For investors, this means developing stronger verification habits and relying on official communication channels. For companies like Circle, it demonstrates the importance of rapid response protocols when false information emerges. The incident ultimately reinforces that in the world of digital assets, trust must be earned and verified at every turn. Frequently Asked Questions Q: What exactly did Circle deny about the gold and silver token platform?

CZ made the rallying call after a $50 million loss by a single trader a few days ago. Writing on Wednesday, December 24, 2025, CZ outlined a blueprint for protecting cryptocurrency users from fraudulent transactions. Binance already does what CZ is recommending, using automatic checks that warn users before they send funds to flagged addresses. CZ is urging other platforms to adopt similar safeguards. “Our industry should be able to completely eradicate this type of poison attacks, and protect our users,” CZ wrote on Binance’s social platform. “All wallets should simply check if a receiving address is a ‘poison address’, and block the user.” CZ challenges industry against poison address scams The urgency behind CZ’s intervention goes back to a December 19 incident where a trader lost nearly $50 million in USDT stablecoins after copying a fraudulent address from their transaction history. According to blockchain security firm Web3 Antivirus , the victim had withdrawn the funds from Binance less than an hour before the attack. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the trader initially sent a test transaction of 50 USDT to verify the correct destination address. A few minutes later, they transferred $49,999,950 to what appeared to be the same recipient. The actual destination, however, was a scammer-controlled address designed to match the first three and last four characters of the legitimate address. Security researcher Cos , founder of SlowMist, noted that the malicious address 0xBaFF2F13638C04B10F8119760B2D2aE86b08f8b5 bore a deceptive resemblance to the intended destination 0xbaf4b1aF7E3B560d937DA0458514552B6495F8b5. Cos said that the subtlety is in the middle characters, which is enough to deceive even pros who rely on partial checks. Within 30 minutes of receiving the stolen funds, the attacker converted the USDT to DAI via MetaMask Swap, then swapped it for roughly 16,690 ETH before depositing most of the cryptocurrency into Tornado Cash. What are address poisoning scams? Binance developed its detection algorithm in May 2024, following a separate $68 million address poisoning attack that saw the funds mysteriously returned after investigators traced the scammer’s Hong Kong-based IP addresses. How does Binance’s system against address poisoning work? According to reports, Binance’s system identifies suspicious transfers with near-zero value or unknown tokens, pairing them with potential victim addresses, and time-stamping malicious transactions to determine the point of poisoning. CZ’s proposal also called for wallets to ignore small-value spam transactions entirely in the interface that users see. Finally, he asked security alliances to maintain real-time blacklists that are accessible across different mediums and to all platforms. Address poisoning has accounted for more than 10% of wallet drains in 2025, according to Web3 Antivirus and SlowMist. The attack exploits a common user behavior, which is the fact that most people verify only the beginning and ending characters of their respective wallet addresses, rather than examining each digit when transferring cryptocurrency. Speaking at the MIT Bitcoin Expo in April, Jameson Lopp , chief security officer at Bitcoin custody firm Casa, attributed the current proliferation to low transaction fees, which make it economical for scammers to send thousands of fake transactions. The December incident contributes to what has been a record year for cryptocurrency theft. With a few days left in the year, Chainalysis ’ recent crypto crime report shows that over $3.4 billion has been stolen, with North Korea hackers accounting for over $2 billion of those thefts.

Volatility hasn’t disappeared, but investor behavior is changing. Many are no longer chasing short-term price fluctuations, but are focusing more on stability, structure, and long-term wealth planning. Astrology’s reflection of these changes is surprisingly accurate. Each zodiac sign approaches money differently—risk tolerance, patience, discipline, and emotional responses all vary. XRP staking, with its structured, time-based reward model, naturally aligns with many of these personality-driven investment strategies. Below is a link between each zodiac sign’s financial outlook for 2026 and XRPstaking platform . Aries (March 21 – April 19) 2026 Money Theme: Maintain Discipline, Ride the Wave Aries enjoy excitement, but are prone to overtrading when the market is volatile. In 2026, the key to success lies in slowing down while maintaining momentum. Why XRP staking works for Aries: Fixed staking cycles reduce impulsive behavior. Automated reward mechanisms maintain capital productivity. Less screen time, more action. Best approach: Channel energy into structured growth through staking. Recommended contract: Litecoin Stable Staking Program Initial investment: $500 | Contract duration: 5 days | Settlement at maturity: $535 Taurus (April 20 – May 20) 2026 Financial Theme: Stability and Accumulation Taurus values ​​security and predictable outcomes. If you can maintain a stable routine, this year will be one of your best financial years. Why XRP staking works for Taurus: Clear rules and predictable cycles Reduces susceptibility to daily price fluctuations Perfect for long-term compound interest investing Best approach: Think of staking as a digital savings engine.

This persistent instability, marked by sharp price swings and failing rallies, reflects a market still struggling to recover from a historic crash and now grappling with structural uncertainty heading into the new year. Heavy Liquidations Expose Fragile Year-End Market Structure According to a recent report by market maker Wintermute, downside pressure intensified early last week, with Bitcoin (BTC) briefly breaking below $85,000 and Ethereum (ETH) falling under $3,000 before derivatives-driven selloffs took hold. Liquidations topped roughly $600 million on Monday, followed by about $400 million each on Wednesday and Thursday, as steep rebounds were quickly sold into. “Downside moves remain abrupt, but they are increasingly self-contained as leverage is flushed quickly and capital retrenches into the most liquid assets,” the firm wrote. By the end of the week, activity slowed, and Bitcoin edged back toward $90,000, though that level again proved difficult to hold. As reported by CryptoPotato on December 23, BTC failed to secure a clean break above $90,000 before retreating toward the high-$80,000 range, with daily liquidations still near $250 million. This struggle has placed Bitcoin on track for a near-24% loss in the fourth quarter, its weakest Q4 since 2018, according to Coinglass data. Wintermute’s internal flow data points to a narrowing market. Buying interest is still focused on BTC and ETH, with institutional demand steady since the summer. Meanwhile, retail traders seem to be moving out of smaller tokens and back into the majors. “BTC and ETH continue to act as the primary risk absorbers, while the broader market struggles under supply pressure and limited risk appetite,” Wintermute said. The firm also noted that token unlocks and excess supply have continued to weigh on altcoins. October’s Leverage Flush Still Hangs Over Sentiment The choppy conditions are also linked to deeper scars left by a massive sell-off in October. Several analysts have argued that the crash, which wiped out more than $12,000 from Bitcoin’s price in a single day, damaged confidence in leverage-heavy trading. BTC is now down about 7% year to date and is heading for one of its rare red years, despite relatively strong fundamentals. Wintermute echoed that caution, warning that price discovery is still happening “at the margin via derivatives,” leaving room for sudden air pockets when crowded positions unwind. Furthermore, funding rates remain compressed, options markets are pricing wide outcomes, and holiday trading desks are winding down, keeping liquidity thin. Looking ahead, the market maker expects quieter conditions into year-end, with range-bound trading unless a clear macro or policy trigger appears. While institutional involvement continues to grow, the firm cautioned that near-term moves are likely to be driven more by positioning than conviction, keeping volatility elevated even with activity slowing.

Source: NHTSA NHTSA expands ongoing investigation into Tesla’s mountain of door issues Just last September, the NHTSA opened a separate case into the Tesla Model Y after several reports of children getting stuck when the 12-volt battery died, since that makes the electric handles stop working. The Model 3 and Model Y are the company’s best-selling cars, so these cases could impact a large group of drivers. A Bloomberg investigation found that at least 15 people have died in the past decade in situations where Tesla doors didn’t open after a crash. Some of the deaths allegedly involved first responders unable to open the doors fast enough when the cars caught fire. During the design phase for the Model 3, engineers flagged concerns about electric handles not working in an emergency. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, those concerns were brought directly to Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, who still chose to go with the same design, as long as a manual release was included. Musk faced concerns years ago, but pushed ahead The issue goes back to how Tesla builds its cars. The Model S, which launched in 2012, was the first model the company built from scratch. It came with flush door handles that slide out when touched. The design helped reduce wind drag and noise, but it also added complexity. If the power is cut, those electric handles don’t function. Elon Musk admitted there were problems with these door sensors as early as 2013. “We’ve got quite a fancy door handle, and occasionally the sensor would malfunction,” he told analysts during a quarterly earnings call. “So you’d pull on the door handle, and it wouldn’t open. Obviously, it’s quite vexing for a customer.” In 2021, Elon told analysts that the issue had been resolved. “Essentially, the door-handle incidents have gone to virtually zero.” But that’s not what Clouse and others are reporting in 2025. After Clouse filed his petition last month, NHTSA started reviewing whether to launch a full recall. The agency hasn’t made a final decision yet, but the investigation is live. Bloomberg also confirmed details of Clouse’s 2023 fire incident, including the fact that he had to kick through a window to get out while the cabin filled with smoke. Tesla shares dropped 0.7% at the close of the market on Christmas Eve, following a shortened session. The company has not issued a public response to the investigation. Clouse, meanwhile, is still waiting for answers.

Capital flows into a trend, prices surge, then attention fades as upside becomes limited. Many investors remember how Pepecoin delivered explosive gains early, only for momentum to slow once size and saturation set in. Today, some market watchers believe a similar early phase may be forming elsewhere. A new DeFi crypto selling at $0.035 has already climbed 2.5x from its earliest stage, yet remains far smaller than meme coins like PEPE. This contrast is driving renewed discussion about where the next sustained upside could come from. Pepecoin (PEPE) Early Surge and Its Current Limits Pepecoin became one of the most visible meme coins during its breakout phase. Early buyers benefited from rapid price expansion driven by social momentum and viral attention. At its peak, PEPE delivered gains that exceeded 800%, turning it into a reference point for fast moving altcoin rallies. However, that early phase has passed. Pepecoin now carries a large market cap, which makes repeating those same gains difficult. Price movement has slowed, and upside depends heavily on renewed hype rather than new fundamentals. Many analysts now describe PEPE as a mature meme asset. While it still trades actively, its ability to deliver another multi hundred % run is limited by size, liquidity needs, and the lack of protocol level utility. This is often the point where capital starts rotating elsewhere. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Building Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is positioned very differently. Instead of relying on social narratives, it is building an Ethereum based lending and borrowing protocol designed around structured usage. At a high level, users supply assets to earn yield, while borrowers access liquidity by locking collateral. Interest rates, collateral rules, and liquidation logic are clearly defined. This structure creates predictable value flows, which long term capital tends to favor. The protocol is preparing for its V1 launch , according to official updates. Development milestones are complete, and Halborn Security has been reviewing the lending and borrowing contracts. This places MUTM closer to execution than concept, which often shifts how markets value a new crypto. Presale Progress and Payment Access Mutuum Finance is currently in Phase 6, priced at $0.035. Since Phase 1, the token has surged 250%, reflecting steady accumulation rather than sudden spikes. More than $19.4M has been raised, and the holder base has grown beyond 18,600 wallets. Out of the total 4B MUTM supply, 45.5% is allocated to the presale, equal to 1.82B tokens. A large portion of this allocation has already been distributed, which tightens available supply as later phases progress. Activity indicators also matter. The 24 hour leaderboard rewards consistent participation instead of one time purchases. This encourages longer holding behavior and repeated engagement. Card payment support further lowers friction, making access easier for a wider range of participants. These signals often appear before broader market attention arrives. Why Investors See a Different Upside Profile The comparison between MUTM and PEPE highlights how different growth models behave over time. Pepecoin’s early run was driven by viral demand. Once that demand cooled, price expansion slowed. Mutuum Finance operates on a different curve. It does not need massive liquidity to move. As a smaller asset, even moderate inflows can have a meaningful impact on price. This gives it higher price elasticity than large meme coins. Utility is another key difference. MUTM is developing around lending markets, mtTokens, and a buy and distribute model that links protocol revenue to token demand. This creates ongoing reasons to hold the token beyond speculation. Timing also plays a role. MUTM is approaching its first live usage phase. Historically, many DeFi crypto projects experience repricing as they move from development into execution. PEPE, by contrast, is already well past its discovery phase. Whale Activity and Phase 6 Recent on chain data has drawn attention to larger allocations. A $115k whale purchase during Phase 6 highlights growing confidence among higher value participants. Whales tend to position earlier when they believe the risk to reward profile is favorable. Phase 6 represents one of the later stages of distribution. As supply tightens, price behavior often changes. Fewer tokens are available, and demand shifts from early access to longer term positioning. Security also supports this phase. Alongside Halborn’s review , MUTM completed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 score and launched a $50k bug bounty. These layers reduce protocol risk, which is often a requirement for larger capital participation. Why Some See MUTM as the Next Rotation Target Many early PEPE investors are now experienced enough to recognize cycle shifts. When meme driven upside fades, attention often turns to new crypto with utility and room to grow. Mutuum Finance fits that profile. It is still early relative to its roadmap, yet far enough along to reduce uncertainty. The combination of structured lending, growing participation, tightening supply, and upcoming V1 activation creates a setup that looks very different from meme coin cycles. While PEPE’s early surge is now part of history, MUTM appears to be entering the stage where long term positioning begins. For investors focused on token appreciation driven by structure rather than hype, that difference is becoming harder to ignore.

If sellers hold the ongoing momentum, XMR’s estimated price might decrease to the $400 range. Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality, which has created a strong demand in the market . Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice. Why is XMR down? Monero price analysis shows that XMR saw a sharp drop after being rejected at the $480 mark resulting in a drop to the current $425 level. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption, as it remains highly speculative . How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chances of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinge on various factors, which will influence its future price movements. The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility creating an atmosphere of extreme fear are challenges that Monero traders could face that could hinder significant growth. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, many investors have concerns regarding privacy, regulatory scrutiny, and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals, which impact the current Monero sentiment. Monero’s commitment to ring confidential transactions and the broader monero project gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

Monero historic price sentiment XMR price history Monero’s market value has changed dramatically since its launch in 2014, from less than $1 to over $475. May 2021 marked the highest point in Monero’s history. Monero’s price projections revealed the coin’s security. They provide investors with optimism that they will be freed from the persecution of some authorities simply by buying or selling Monero Across 2023, Monero’s price rose by 11.49%. The highest price was $278.56, and the lowest was $114.16. In January 2024, Monero stayed stable around the $150.00 mark as market momentum remained low. However, the stability was short-lived as February crashed to $101.95. However, XMR showed swift recovery as it closed the month near the $150.00 level again. In March and April 2024, XMR saw a steady decline from $150.00 to $120.00, where it found key support. In May 2024, XMR observed steady bullish pressure as the price rose from $120.00, approaching resistance at $150. In June 2024, Monero (XMR) traded within the $150 – $175 price range as either side struggled to make a clear breakthrough. In July, the crypto traded around the $155 mark as the price volatility remained relatively low. XMR opened trading at $156.05 in August and ended the month at $176.00, making remarkable gains. September was bearish for the asset, as the price declined below the $160 mark by the end of the month. In October, Monero observed a steep crash and has been making a swift recovery since then. In December, Monero made remarkable strides as the asset’s price broke past the $220 mark, albeit briefly as it closed the month below $200. In January, Monero saw a bullish January as the price rose from below the $200 mark to $238 by the end of the month. In February, the price fell towards the $215 mark as bears dominate the markets. In March, the price observes mixed momentum and closed the month slightly below $215. In April the consolidation continued until late into the month when it spiked past the $325 mark before ending the month around $275. In May the price continued rising rapidly as the bulls cruised past $300 ending the month around $320. During June the price continued to observe high volatility but observed low net change as the asset closed the month around $313. In July the price saw a huge spike in volatility as the price rose past $340 but the asset closed the month below the $310 mark. In August the price declined rapidly falling to the $260 mark by the month’s end. In September, the price rose to the $340 and while it did not maintain the level but managed to close the month above the $320 mark. In October the price continued to rise ending the month above the $340 mark, a trend separating it from most other cryptocurrencies that saw a decline during the period. In November, the bullish rally continued with XMR crossing the $400 mark by the end of the month.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XMR|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-24 20:00:00
56310949,648306,1766606448,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56310949.jpeg,Bitcoin Coin Days Destroyed Plunge After Massive Coinbase BTC Transfer,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-coin-days-destroyed-plunge/,"Bitcoin ’s current pullback continues to reflect on multiple major on-chain metrics, reinforcing the volatility across the market. With selling pressure still present among retail and institutional investors, the BTC Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric has experienced a sharp decline to levels that could shape the market’s direction. Major Coinbase Transfer Triggers Bitcoin CCD Drop While ongoing volatility has increased within the broader cryptocurrency sector, the Bitcoin market appears to be entering a pivotal phase. This new phase, which goes beyond routine volatility or short-term price noise, is largely driven by the BTC Coin Days Destroyed, an indicator that simply measures the number of holding days of a UTXO before it is spent, after undergoing a notable drop. Beneath the surface, key structural indicators point to a significant shift occurring, characterized by evolving on-chain patterns, shifting liquidity dynamics, and altered investor behavior. This is a crucial turning point in the current cycle since it has the potential to redefine the market’s next major direction. In the report shared on X by Darkfost, a market expert and author at CryptoQuant, it shows that the drop in the BTC CDD metric emerged following a large BTC move from Coinbase over a month ago. As a result, all leverage data are now slowly returning to normal levels. According to the expert, the most interesting aspect of the development is that this decline has reached a level well below the previous spike. In addition to the Coinbase-related action , this implies a sign of slowdown in Bitcoin long-term holders’ activity. It is worth noting that when BTC held in the long term begins to move, it is usually in preparation for a sell-off. Although it may sound bad, this drop in CDD is a positive signal. This is because long-term holders continue to be the biggest possible source of selling pressure as they account for the largest share of the total supply. However, a decrease in long-term holder selling pressure aids in relieving the market and may add to the formation of a bottom if this trend persists. When Is The Time To Buy The Crypto Asset? After weeks of waning price action, Joao Wedson, the founder of Alphractal, has o ffered insights into when to purchase Bitcoin using the Financial Stress Index (FSI). Historically, this key metric has acted as a reliable signal for when to buy BTC, making it one of the most closely watched indicators. Presently, the FSI metric has flipped into a positive territory. Wedson highlighted that each time this happens, good opportunities to acquire more BTC have emerged. However, this trend has not yet unfolded. The indicator, which uses a wide range of factors, including volatility, spreads, and risk premiums, to gauge systemic stress in international financial markets , was created by the Office of Financial Research. Wedson stated that these kinds of metrics are uncommon in the macroeconomic environment, which is characterized by substantial data delays and sluggish decision-making.",Bitcoin News|Alphractal|bitcoin|Bitcoin Coin Days Destroyed|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CDD|coinbase|Darkfost|Financial Stress Index|FSI|Joao Wedson|Office of Financial Research|UTXO,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-24 20:00:48
56308704,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=870000,1766606449,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/56308704.jpeg,Ethereum Bearish Structure Meets Bullish Supply Signal – What Happens Next,https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-bearish-structure-meets-bullish-supply-signal-what-happens-next/,"Ethereum is facing renewed selling pressure as market uncertainty deepens and confidence continues to erode across the broader crypto landscape. After weeks of fragile price action and failed recovery attempts, ETH has struggled to attract sustained demand, pushing an increasing number of analysts to warn that the market may be entering the early stages of a bear cycle. Volatility remains elevated, sentiment is weak, and traders appear hesitant to commit capital as downside risks grow more pronounced. Related Reading: Bitcoin and Ethereum Coinbase Inflows Collapse While Binance Retains Relative Activity – Details Recent on-chain and technical analysis from CryptoQuant highlights why concerns are mounting. Ethereum’s price structure has tightened into a descending triangle formation, a pattern that often emerges during periods of distribution rather than accumulation. Price remains capped below a well-defined downtrend line, while key moving averages continue to act as overhead resistance, limiting upside momentum. This compression reflects a market where sellers maintain control, even as prices attempt to stabilize. Historically, this type of technical setup increases the probability of a downside resolution. In Ethereum’s case, the $2,800 level has become a critical support zone. A sustained break below it would likely confirm a broader bearish continuation, potentially accelerating losses as stop orders are triggered. On-Chain Supply Tightening Challenges Ethereum’s Bearish Technical Outlook While Ethereum’s price structure continues to reflect stress, on-chain data is telling a more nuanced story. Analysis shared by CryptoOnchain highlights a sharp contraction in the amount of ETH available for immediate sale on major exchanges, particularly Binance. The Ethereum Exchange Supply Ratio on Binance has fallen to 0.032, its lowest reading since September 2024, pointing to a meaningful reduction in liquid supply despite ongoing price weakness. This drop suggests that market participants are moving ETH off exchanges and into self-custody, a behavior typically associated with longer-term positioning rather than imminent selling. In practical terms, fewer coins sitting on exchanges reduces the immediate sell-side pressure that often exacerbates downtrends. The timing is notable, as this supply contraction is unfolding while Ethereum remains locked in a bearish technical formation. The contrast between the chart and the on-chain data is becoming increasingly relevant. From a purely technical perspective, the descending triangle and persistent resistance argue for caution. However, shrinking exchange supply introduces the risk of a supply-driven move if demand stabilizes. Should buyers successfully defend the $2,800 support zone, even modest inflows could have an outsized impact on price due to reduced available liquidity. For now, the market sits at an inflection point. A decisive break above the downtrend line would strengthen the case that accumulation is taking precedence over distribution, potentially shifting the balance away from the prevailing bearish narrative. Related Reading: Gold & Silver Breakout While Bitcoin Chops: Why Capital Is Flowing Into Precious Metals Ethereum Consolidates as Bearish Structure Remains Intact Ethereum is trading around the $2,930 level on the daily chart, continuing to consolidate after an extended decline from its late-summer highs. The broader structure remains technically weak, with price still forming a sequence of lower highs and lower lows since failing to hold above the $4,500–$4,800 zone earlier in the cycle. This rejection marked a clear trend shift, transitioning ETH from expansion into a corrective and potentially distributive phase. From a trend perspective, Ethereum remains capped below its key daily moving averages. The faster moving average has rolled over sharply and continues to act as immediate resistance, while the 111-day and 200-day simple moving averages sit higher, converging in the $3,400–$3,600 range. This layered resistance suggests that any upside attempts are likely to face strong selling pressure unless momentum improves meaningfully. Related Reading: The Gold-to-Bitcoin Rotation Narrative Gains Strength: A Data-Driven Review Price action over recent weeks reflects indecision rather than recovery. ETH has been oscillating in a tight range between roughly $2,850 and $3,050. Indicating short-term stabilization but not a confirmed reversal. Volume supports this view, as selling spikes dominated the initial breakdown, while subsequent rebounds have lacked strong participation from buyers. Technically, the $2,800–$2,900 zone remains critical. Holding this area preserves the possibility of base-building, but a decisive breakdown would open the door to a deeper retracement. For structure to improve, Ethereum would need to reclaim the $3,200–$3,300 region and regain acceptance above its declining daily averages.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/crypto-proponent-to-xrp-holders-we-are-so-early-heres-why/,"The global financial system is standing at the edge of a transformation that has been decades in the making. For all the sophistication of modern markets, their foundations remain burdened by slow settlement, fragmented records, and layers of hidden risk. As blockchain technology steadily matures, the question is no longer whether change is coming, but how quickly the old infrastructure will give way to something radically more transparent and efficient. That question took on new urgency following an X post by Amelie, who highlighted a Fox Business interview featuring U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins . While the post energized XRP holders, its broader significance lies in what it reveals about the future direction of U.S. capital markets. Tokenization Gains Regulatory Clarity In the interview, Atkins explained tokenization as the use of blockchain-based tokens and smart contracts to represent traditional securities. Importantly, he clarified that a tokenized security remains a security under U.S. law and is fully subject to SEC regulations. The innovation, therefore, is not about deregulation but modernization.

Issuers can clearly see who owns their securities and where those assets reside—visibility that is often lacking in today’s complex custody and clearing systems. On-Chain Settlement and Risk Reduction A major focus of Atkins’ remarks was settlement efficiency. Although U.S. markets have recently shifted to T+1 settlement, he pointed to the real possibility of near-instant settlement, or T0, for certain instruments using blockchain infrastructure. On-chain delivery-versus-payment and receipt-versus-payment mechanisms could close the gap between trade execution and settlement. According to Atkins, this gap is where systemic risk is introduced. Compressing or eliminating it would significantly reduce counterparty risk, streamline clearing and settlement, and improve overall market stability. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Adoption Is Accelerating When asked whether major banks and brokers are moving toward tokenization, Atkins was unequivocal. He stated that this transition is not a distant, ten-year horizon but something that could materialize within just a couple of years. This aligns with confirmed developments across global finance, where institutions are already piloting tokenized bonds, funds, and settlement systems. Such momentum underscores that blockchain adoption is no longer confined to experimental use cases but is increasingly embedded in institutional strategy. A Clear Shift in U.S. Regulatory Tone Perhaps the most consequential takeaway was Atkins’ acknowledgment of the SEC’s past resistance to crypto innovation. He openly admitted that the U.S. had, in effect, mirrored China in restricting crypto development through regulatory pressure. That posture, he said, has now changed. The SEC, according to Atkins, intends to embrace blockchain technology to keep the United States competitive in global finance. For XRP holders, this regulatory pivot reinforces the idea that blockchain-based payment and settlement networks may still be in their earliest phase—long before their full role in modern markets is realized.

Critics allege the move was intended to increase his voting power rather than signal long-term alignment with token holders. The allegation surfaced publicly this week after Robert Mullins, a decentralized finance strategist and liquidity specialist, said on X that the purchase appeared timed to influence an upcoming vote. I’m surprised that no one is talking about the fact that Stani bought $10M of AAVE, claimed it was bc he is aligned with the token yet in actual fact it was to increase his voting power in anticipation to vote for a proposal directly against the token holders best interests This… — Robert (@0xluude) December 23, 2025 Mullins argued that the transaction highlights structural weaknesses in token-based governance systems, where large holders can quickly accumulate influence without long-term commitments.

The debate has unfolded against a broader governance dispute within the Aave ecosystem over control of the protocol’s brand and associated assets. On December 22, Aave Labs submitted a proposal to Snapshot concerning ownership of key brand assets, including the aave.com domain, social media accounts, GitHub organizations, and naming rights. Aave Labs unilaterally pushed a brand ownership proposal to vote without author notification, escalating governance tensions over protocol asset control and value extraction. #Dao #Aave https://t.co/2uRM8QM6Jy — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 22, 2025 The proposal had been authored by Ernesto Boado, co-founder of BGD Labs, but Boado publicly rejected the decision to push it to a vote, saying he had not been notified and did not support the version submitted. Boado said the move broke trust during what he described as a productive forum discussion and argued that the proposal was intended to transfer brand assets into a DAO-controlled legal wrapper with strong protections against capture. Tensions Rise Around Aave Over Brand Use, Fee Flows, and Whale Voting The initiative followed mounting concerns from contributors that brand assets were being used to support private products without the DAO being the main beneficiary. Recent examples cited by critics include Aave Labs replacing Paraswap with CowSwap, a change estimated to redirect around $10 million per year in fees away from the DAO, and the Horizon market launch , which generated roughly $100,000 in revenue while using about $500,000 in DAO incentives. Marc Zeller of the Aave Chan Initiative said the DAO had effectively paid multiple times for these assets through the original LEND token sale, dilution, liquidity mining programs, and service provider fees. Kulechov defended the rushed vote, saying discussion had already taken place and that submitting proposals outside extended processes was not unprecedented. He said the issue should ultimately be resolved through voting. Those who wonder, yes the vote is legitimate – The discussion has been going over the past 5 days already with various of opinions and takes, a timeline set on the ARFC temp check (see more https://t.co/KovomHiB6H ) – The Snapshot is in compliance of the governance framework -… https://t.co/nZoixZvbwl — Stani.eth (@StaniKulechov) December 22, 2025 However, several observers, including crypto educator Duo Nine, raised concerns about conflicts of interest when founders retain influence through private companies while also shaping DAO outcomes. Voting data has further fueled the debate. Samuel McCulloch of USD.ai noted that a small number of large holders account for a significant share of voting power. Snapshot data shows the top three voters control more than 58% of the vote, with the largest wallet holding over 27%. Source: Aave DAO The controversy comes shortly after regulatory pressure on Aave eased. On December 16, Kulechov disclosed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had concluded its multi-year investigation into the protocol without recommending enforcement action, ending nearly four years of uncertainty. Aave Labs has also secured MiCA authorization in Europe and is preparing for the launch of Aave V4.

This isn’t science fiction; it’s the reality facing communities across America as data centers transform from invisible internet backbones into controversial neighbors. The explosive growth of artificial intelligence has thrust these once-obscure facilities into the spotlight, sparking a populist uprising that’s reshaping the tech landscape. Why Are Data Centers Suddenly Everywhere? The numbers tell a staggering story. Since 2021, construction spending on data centers has skyrocketed 331%, according to US Census Bureau data. Hundreds of billions of dollars are flowing into projects that barely existed on public radar just years ago. This isn’t organic growth—it’s a calculated surge driven by the AI arms race, with every major tech company racing to build the computational infrastructure needed to power tomorrow’s artificial intelligence. Consider this comparison of data center expansion drivers: Driver Impact Example AI Model Training Requires 10-100x more computing power than traditional cloud services OpenAI’s GPT models needing thousands of specialized processors Government Policy Federal initiatives promoting “re-industrialization” through tech infrastructure The Trump administration’s Stargate Project announced in January 2025 Corporate Competition Tech giants fearing being left behind in the AI race Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon all announcing massive capital expenditures Economic Incentives Local governments offering tax breaks and subsidies Communities trading lower tax revenue for promised job creation The AI Infrastructure Backlash Goes Mainstream What began as isolated community concerns has mushroomed into a national movement. Data Center Watch, an organization tracking anti-data center activism, reports 142 different activist groups across 24 states organizing against developments. The concerns are diverse but interconnected: Environmental impact: Massive water consumption for cooling and carbon emissions from increased energy use Health concerns: Potential effects of electromagnetic fields and noise pollution Economic inequality: Public subsidies going to trillion-dollar corporations while communities struggle AI ethics: Opposition to how artificial intelligence is being developed and deployed Danny Candejas, an activist with MediaJustice who has organized multiple protests including one against Elon Musk’s xAI Colossus project in Memphis, told Bitcoin World: “I meet new people every week who want to fight a data center in their community. There’s a very palpable anger around how these projects are prioritized over community needs.” How Electricity Costs Are Fueling the Fire Nothing makes an abstract issue concrete like a higher monthly bill. As data centers consume ever-larger portions of regional power grids—some facilities use as much electricity as medium-sized cities—residents are seeing direct impacts on their utility costs. In some regions, electricity prices have surged 20-30% directly attributable to data center demand. “The connection to everybody’s energy bills going up—that’s what’s made this issue so stark,” Candejas explained. “People are struggling month to month while their local governments give away public funds to incentivize these projects.” The political implications are significant. Analysts believe rising electricity costs driven by the AI boom could become a decisive issue in the 2026 midterm elections, turning what was once technical infrastructure policy into kitchen-table economics. Tech Giants Fight Back Against Public Resistance The industry isn’t taking this backlash lying down. A new trade group, the National Artificial Intelligence Association (NAIA), has begun distributing talking points to Congress members and organizing data center field trips to “better pitch voters on their value.” Companies like Meta are running advertising campaigns highlighting the economic benefits of data centers, including: Job creation during construction and operation Increased local tax revenue (though often reduced by incentives) Attracting other tech businesses to regions Positioning communities for future economic opportunities Meanwhile, the construction surge continues unabated. Major tech companies have announced capital expenditure projections for 2026 that suggest the data center boom has only begun, with AI infrastructure remaining their top investment priority. When Protests Actually Win: Successful Resistance Movements Grassroots opposition isn’t just making noise—it’s getting results. Data Center Watch claims approximately $64 billion worth of developments have been blocked or delayed due to community activism. Notable victories include: Wisconsin: Local opposition appears to have dissuaded Microsoft from building a 244-acre data center Southern California: Imperial Valley filed a lawsuit to overturn county approval of a data center project Michigan: Protesters descended on the state capitol declaring “Michiganders do not want data centers in our yards” Multiple states: Dozens of local zoning and permit challenges slowing or stopping projects “All this public pressure is working,” Candejas said optimistically. “More projects are going to be stopped as this movement keeps building.” The Inevitable Conflict: AI Progress vs. Community Welfare This tension represents a fundamental clash between two visions of America’s future. On one side: a tech industry and federal government betting that artificial intelligence infrastructure will drive economic dominance in the 21st century. On the other: communities questioning why they should bear the costs—in higher bills, environmental impact, and changed neighborhoods—for benefits that seem to flow primarily to Silicon Valley. The data center has become the physical embodiment of this conflict. No longer hidden in remote industrial parks, these facilities are increasingly proposed for locations near residential areas, drawn by existing power infrastructure and fiber optic networks. Their very visibility has made them targets for broader frustrations about technology’s role in society. FAQs: Understanding the Data Center Debate Which companies are building the most data centers? The “Big Four”— Google , Meta , Microsoft , and Amazon —are leading the construction surge, along with OpenAI and xAI (founded by Elon Musk ). What is the Stargate Project? Announced in January 2025, this federal initiative aims to accelerate AI infrastructure development as part of a “re-industrialization of the United States” under the Trump administration . How much power do data centers use? A large data center can consume 100-200 megawatts—enough to power 80,000-160,000 homes. The AI-specific facilities require even more power for training complex models. Who is Danny Candejas? An activist with the nonprofit MediaJustice who has helped organize multiple protests against data center developments across the United States. What is Data Center Watch? An organization that tracks anti-data center activism, currently monitoring 142 activist groups across 24 states opposing various developments. Conclusion: The Infrastructure Wars Have Just Begun The year 2025 will be remembered as when data centers stopped being someone else’s problem and started being everyone’s concern. As artificial intelligence transitions from promising technology to economic imperative, the physical infrastructure needed to support it is colliding with the communities asked to host it. The resulting conflict—between global technological ambitions and local quality of life—shows no signs of resolution. If anything, as AI’s computational demands continue growing exponentially, so too will the backlash against the facilities that make it possible. The invisible backbone of the internet has become the visible front line in America’s debate about its technological future.

What investors are seeing instead is ADA dropping below $0.35 for the first time in over a year. “It’s built to expand ADA’s ecosystem, not replace it” is how Hoskinson describes the Midnight chain. However, this is crypto, and a new shiny thing always attracts attention, so it will definitely pull some volume. $NIGHT is reviving Cardano DEX volume. Liquidity is flowing back.

That is nearly two times Cardano’s volume, which is sitting around $400M. This does not define the full picture, but it does show there is an impact, at least in the short term. Cardano Price Prediction: Can the ADA Price Break the $0.36 Resistance This Christmas? Source: ADSUSD / TradingView To confirm a bullish rebound, ADA needs to break and hold above the $0.36 level in the short term. If it does, the next clear resistance sits at $0.38, where price has already failed twice over the past week. A move down toward the $0.30 zone is still possible if this level fails to break. The RSI is around 40 and not yet oversold, which leaves room for that scenario to play out. As long as the previous low near $0.27 is not broken, the bullish setup remains possible heading into the new year. If Night Replaced Cardano, Could ($HYPER) Replace Bitcoin? Bitcoin was supposed to be slow, secure, and untouchable. But in 2025, speed and utility matter more than ever. That is where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) comes in. Bitcoin Hyper is a next generation Layer 2 built to unlock what Bitcoin has been missing: fast transactions, ultra low fees, and real on chain utility. Using Solana style high throughput architecture, Hyper lets BTC move at lightning speed while keeping Bitcoin’s security at the core. Through the Hyper Bridge, users can move BTC onto the Hyper network and instantly receive a 1:1 representation with near instant finality. From there, Bitcoin holders can finally access DeFi, staking, payments, NFTs, and high yield opportunities without leaving the Bitcoin ecosystem. The market is already paying attention. Bitcoin Hyper has raised over $29.7M so far, with early buyers locking in staking rewards currently offering up to 39% APY . As Bitcoin consolidates and altcoins fight for attention, Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as the cleanest way to scale BTC without changing its base layer.

The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the Securities and Futures Commission said on Dec. 24 that firms providing virtual asset dealing or custody services in Hong Kong will be required to obtain licenses once the new framework takes effect. New Licensing Plan Brings Crypto Brokers and Custodians Into Oversight The move follows months of consultation and comes as authorities seek to close regulatory gaps that emerged as crypto activity spread beyond licensed exchanges into over-the-counter trading, brokerage services, and third-party custody. Regulators said the proposals received broad market support and will now move into the legislative phase, marking another step in building a comprehensive digital asset regime under the SFC’s ASPIRe roadmap. According to the SFC release, all virtual asset dealers will be regulated in a way that closely mirrors existing rules for securities dealers. Notably, the licensing requirement will cover a wide range of activities, including virtual asset-to-fiat and virtual asset-to-virtual asset conversions, brokerage services, block trading, and related advisory functions, whether conducted online or through physical outlets. This brings OTC trading and broker-style services squarely within regulatory oversight for the first time. Also, under the planned framework, custodians will also face a dedicated licensing regime focused on the safekeeping of client assets. Any entity holding or controlling private keys for client virtual assets in Hong Kong will need to be licensed or registered. Regulators said the regime is designed to address risks around asset protection by requiring strict segregation of client assets, strong internal controls over key management, enhanced cybersecurity standards, and robust business continuity planning. Dealers will be required to place client assets only with licensed or registered custodians operating in Hong Kong. Both regimes will impose fit-and-proper requirements on applicants, alongside minimum financial resource thresholds. Dealers are expected to meet capital requirements of around HK$5 million, while custodians will face higher thresholds, including HK$10 million in paid-up capital. Hong Kong’s Crypto Framework Grows to Include Advisers and Managers Alongside the dealer and custodian regimes, regulators launched a further consultation on extending licensing requirements to virtual asset advisory and management service providers. The proposals would bring crypto advisers and asset managers under a similar regulatory structure to their traditional finance counterparts, giving the SFC powers to supervise, inspect, and sanction firms operating in this part of the market. SFC Chief Executive Officer Julia Leung said the expanded framework is intended to support a secure and competitive digital asset ecosystem while maintaining strong investor protection. Regulators are encouraging firms interested in the new regimes to engage early with the SFC through pre-application discussions to better prepare for compliance. Source: SFC The latest step builds on a series of regulatory developments over the past year. Hong Kong already requires crypto trading platforms to be licensed , with 11 exchanges approved so far under a mandatory regime that replaced an earlier opt-in framework. Earlier in 2025, the city brought its Stablecoin Ordinance into force , creating a licensing regime for stablecoin issuers. Stablecoin licensing frameworks are advancing globally as regulators in Hong Kong seek to manage new forms of digital settlement. #hongkong #stablecoin https://t.co/hHATckRvWQ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 23, 2025 Authorities have also taken steps to expand market access, including allowing licensed exchanges to connect to global liquidity pools and easing certain token listing requirements. The proposal, still subject to consultation, reflects a cautious approach that distinguishes between regulated stablecoins and more volatile crypto assets.

In 2027, it will range between $50.88 and $59.50, with an average price of $52.31. In 2030, it will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $8 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ordinals Symbol ORDI Current price $3.96 Market cap $83.21M 24-hour trading volume $16.43M Circulating supply 21M All-time high $96.17 on Mar 5, 2024 All-time low $1.41 on Oct 11, 2025 24-hour high $3.96 24-hour low $3.76 ORDI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 5.00% 50-day SMA $4.39 200-day SMA $7.63 Sentiment Bearish Green days 15/30 (50%) Fear and Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) ORDI price analysis On December 24, ORDI’s price rose by 3.13% in 24 hours following a sell-off exhaustion that had lasted weeks. Its trading volume rose 3.81%, showing rising trader conviction in the market. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView The Ordinal daily chart indicates that ORDI has been in a bearish trend since late September. It now trades along the Williams Alligator trendlines, signaling a potentially uneventful market after the price dropped below support levels (78.60% Fibonacci level) and key moving averages. The coin had littlemomentum this week, slowing its drop. The MACD and signal lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator are below zero, signaling a bear market. At the same time, the relative strength index (RSI) is in neutral territory at 47.18. It is oversold when the RSI falls below 30. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView Technical analysis of the 4-hour chart indicates that ORDI is moving upwards at the $3.96 mark with MACD confirmation (0.016) and a bullish engulfing candle. The William Alligator trendlines indicate that its volatility is dropping.

ORDI is bearish at current levels, with the Fear & Greed Index indicating an extreme fear sentiment among investors. Over the short term, ORDI remains correlated with Bitcoin, which has risen above $87,000, following a brief recovery. Why is ORDI down? ORDI’s drop reflects technical triggers, Bitcoin-driven risk aversion, and technical overextension. Its status as a “Bitcoin beta” leaves it vulnerable during dominance rallies, while thin liquidity amplifies price movements. Recent news BitVMX has launched the first cross-chain bridge connecting Bitcoin Ordinals to Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem. Concurrent upgrades to Unisat Wallet’s UTXO management improved user experience for BRC-20 token interactions. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or stringent regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction indicates how the coin will gain value in the years to come.

ORDI’s historic price sentiment ORDI price history by CoinGecko According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed, falling below $12 in February and $8 in May. In July, it was trading below $10. In October, it dropped $8 and assumed a bearish run; by December, it had reached $3.80.",Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|ORDI|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-24 20:55:00

The latest disclosure shows the firm prioritizing cash generation over Bitcoin accumulation as it evaluates its next steps. This change in capital allocation comes as rumors spread that Strategy could sell a significant portion of its Bitcoin holdings. Strategy Prioritizes Cash Reserve Over Bitcoin Buys Strategy has released a new financial update showing a clear shift toward US dollar accumulation, stepping back from its previous pattern of aggressive Bitcoin buys . Saylor shared the report on X this Monday, outlining the company’s most recent capital activity. The filing focuses on equity sales, Strategy’s bitcoin holdings and activity, and its cash reserves. During the week of December 15 to December 21, Strategy raised significant funds through its ATM equity program . The business intelligence firm did not sell any of its preferred stock offerings within this period, leaving billions of dollars in remaining issuance capacity. Notably, the filing shows that the STRK preferred stock program still holds more than $20 billion in available capacity. Instead of preferred shares, Strategy had tapped its common stock program. The company sold 4.5 million shares of Class A common stock, generating roughly $747.8 million in net proceeds after fees. Even after this raise, Strategy still has approximately $11.8 billion of common stock available for future issuance. While the business intelligence firm has increased its cash position , it paused Bitcoin purchases for the week. The filing reported that no new Bitcoin purchases were made during the week of December 15 to December 21, keeping its total holdings unchanged at 671,268 BTC. Those holdings carry an aggregate purchase cost of about $50.33 billion, with an average price near $74,972 per coin. Update On Strategy’s US Dollar Reserve Strategy’s latest addition to its cash reserve this past week builds a larger cushion to cover the company’s financial obligations. The firm started the month with a reserve of $1.14 billion and increased it to approximately $2.19 billion by December 21. This growth suggests a deliberate move to secure liquidity amid ongoing market activity. The boost in cash comes after rumors circulated that Strategy could face pressure to meet dividend obligations on its preferred shares. Additionally, there has been speculation that the business intelligence firm may sell its over $50 billion Bitcoin holdings if the market continues to trend downward for a prolonged period. According to the filing, the primary purpose of the Strategy’s US dollar reserve is to cover dividend payments on preferred stock and interest payments on outstanding debt. Because the company holds a large amount of Bitcoin, selling a significant portion to fund these dividends could disrupt the market , especially during periods of volatility. This underscores the importance of maintaining a cash reserve for easy liquidity.",Bitcoin|ATM|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|michael saylor|Strategy|US Dollar,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-24 21:00:37
56310945,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=870021,1766610044,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,XRP Price Must Stay Above This Level Or Crash To $0.9,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-must-stay-above-this-level/,"A crypto analyst has identified a key support level that could determine whether the XRP price stabilizes or experiences a sharp sell-off, sending it crashing toward the $0.90 mark. With volatility building and market sentiment turning cautious, XRP’s next move may be critical for both short-term traders and long-term holders. XRP Price Faces Decline To $0.9 If Support Fails A crypto market expert who refers to himself as ‘Guy on the Earth’ on X has released an updated outlook on XRP, warning traders about a critical price level that could determine the cryptocurrency’s near-term direction. He noted that XRP has closed below the $1.95 monthly support zone for the first time in 13 months, signaling growing downside risk. According to his assessment, this breakdown could have serious technical implications if XRP fails to recover quickly. Related Reading: Here’s Why The XRP Price Will Shine In The New Year The analyst’s chart shows that this marks the second time XRP has fallen below the $1.95 support on the weekly timeframe. Guy on the Earth stated that the last time it happened was during April’s US tariff-related market stress, which caused XRP and the broader crypto market to crash. If history is any guide, the cryptocurrency could decline again if it fails to hold the $1.95 support level. The analyst has set the breakdown target at $0.90, which represents a more than 50% crash from current levels around $1.85. For the XRP price to stabilize, bulls must reclaim the $1.95 level and hold above it as soon as possible. Guy on the Earth noted that XRP recently attempted to move back above $1.95 but was rejected, forming another lower high and reinforcing its broader bearish structure. He added that if the monthly chart fails to reclaim this support within the next several days, XRP’s downside momentum could accelerate. For traders uncomfortable with the current setup, the analyst suggested reducing exposure and waiting for a confirmed daily close above $1.95 before re-entering the market. He explained that this strategy could help limit losses while keeping traders positioned for a potential price recovery. From a longer-term perspective, Guy on the Earth has identified several potential accumulation zones if XRP’s price continues to fall. The key levels to watch on the chart are $1.61, $1.42, and the $0.90 target, with $0.75 representing the initial breakdown area from the previous rally. The analyst further noted that increased selling pressure from Bitcoin could open the door to deeper downside moves for XRP. Analyst Confirms Bullish Recovery Still Possible Toward the end of his analysis, Guy on the Earth noted that the recent price action does not indicate a full-scale downturn for XRP. He explained that the cryptocurrency is less than $0.04 from the rectangle resistance and that Bullish Divergence has yet to play out across multiple timeframes. Related Reading: Peter Brandt Highlights Bearish XRP Price Chart, ‘You Need To Deal With It’ According to the analyst, a recovery and subsequent rally are still in the books for XRP, highlighting that sellers are becoming exhausted. Nevertheless, he warned that caution is necessary given XRP’s two consecutive weekly closes below key support.

When you look at the Pippin chart, something feels off. It does not feel organic, which is something to be suspicious about. Why? According to Bubblemaps, 93 wallets now hold 80% of the supply. Source: Pippin Bubblemaps The fact is, neither the project owner nor the official Pippin accounts on X have mentioned the project in the past few months. Yet, the PIPPIN coin was listed on Robinhood just recently. So do they know something we do not? This is mainly why people keep shorting it, and the coin keeps going up and liquidating them. The leverage shown on CoinMarketCap , around $3 to $4 billion, is leading many to believe a violent move in either direction is coming soon. Pippin Price Prediction: Can PIPPIN Reach $0.8 This Christmas? Since nothing feels organic, there is one belief: if there is more liquidity in longs, the coin will nuke, and if there is more liquidity in shorts, the candle will go straight up. Source: PIPPINUSD / TradingView The coin is up 30% over the last 7 days. It just broke its previous all time high at $0.528 with a large candle before slipping back below it. Last time it hit this level, price dropped around 40%. If it manages to break and hold above it this time, there is a good chance it could rally toward $0.80. With around $4B in open futures interest, it could really move either way. The RSI is sitting near 60, confirming bullish momentum, but given the history of this chart, that signal alone does not mean much. If It Is All Speculation, It Is Better to Be a Memecoin Maxi Doge is not running on mystery pumps, hidden wallets, or liquidation games. It is doing the opposite. The project is building momentum the slow, dangerous way: real demand, visible inflows, and a growing base of holders who are not just flipping candles. The presale has already raised over $4.36M, even while the broader memecoin market is shaky. That kind of capital does not show up unless buyers are positioning early, not chasing hype after the move is done. What really separates Maxi Doge is the 71% APY staking. Instead of forcing holders to trade every spike, it gives them a reason to sit tight and let pressure build. That is usually how the biggest memecoin runs start, quietly, before everyone else notices. While PIPPIN feels like a leverage trap waiting to spring in either direction, Maxi Doge looks like a clean setup forming under the radar. No forced narratives, no weird wallet concentration drama, just steady accumulation and patience. If memecoin volatility is about to explode again, the projects with real liquidity, locked-in holders, and early conviction tend to outperform when it matters most.

Apeing Could Be the Next 1000x Crypto Still Flying Under Radar,https://timestabloid.com/too-late-on-stellar-winners-apeing-could-be-the-next-1000x-crypto/,"Apeing ($APEING) is increasingly appearing in conversations about the next 1000x crypto, particularly among investors who missed early opportunities. Designed around controlled access and staged pricing, Apeing introduces a structure that prioritizes timing, scarcity, and early conviction rather than open-market chaos. For many market participants, the regret of missing early-stage blockchains still lingers. Apeing positions itself as a second-chance style setup, not by copying past giants, but by applying lessons learned from how early momentum actually forms. Understanding its access model, pricing stages, and psychology-driven design is essential for anyone evaluating a potential next 1000x crypto . How Apeing Is Building a Next 1000x Crypto Narrative Through Early Access Apeing blends meme-driven energy with deliberate mechanics aimed at early participation. Instead of launching directly into open trading, the project uses a whitelist-only entry system that restricts initial supply and creates a measurable advantage for early adopters. Key elements shaping Apeing’s next 1000x crypto narrative include: Stage-based pricing that increases with each phase Whitelist-gated access to the earliest allocation Limited early supply, encouraging long-term positioning over instant flipping This design rewards those who act before attention peaks, rather than those chasing momentum afterward. Early pricing combined with scarcity often amplifies perception-driven value once a token lists publicly. Why Whitelist Access Matters When Targeting the Next 1000x Crypto In modern crypto cycles, whitelist access has become a strategic edge rather than a marketing gimmick. For investors researching the next 1000x crypto, controlled entry often defines who captures the largest asymmetry. With Apeing , whitelist access unlocks Stage 1 participation, the lowest price tier available. Apeing Stage 1 Snapshot Stage 1 price: $0.0001 Expected listing price: $0.001 Implied upside at listing: 10× before broader market trading This structure allows early participants to enter before volatility, influencer narratives, and exchange-driven price discovery reshape valuation. In high-risk, high-reward setups, this early positioning frequently separates leaders from latecomers. How to Join Apeing Early and Avoid Common Risks Securing early access to the next 1000x crypto requires caution and discipline. Apeing’s team emphasizes using official channels only to reduce exposure to impersonation and phishing attempts. Visit the official Apeing website Submit an email address in the whitelist section Confirm registration via email Monitor official updates to track stage announcements Following verified instructions ensures access remains legitimate while protecting participants from common presale risks. Stellar as a Benchmark: Why Investors Compare Emerging Tokens to It Stellar is often used as a benchmark because it shows how a low-visibility crypto project can grow into globally recognized infrastructure over time. In its early years, Stellar attracted limited attention and traded at modest valuations, yet it steadily built relevance through real-world applications such as cross-border payments, stablecoin issuance, and financial inclusion initiatives. For investors, this long and quiet growth phase reinforces the idea that the most meaningful opportunities often appear before mainstream awareness takes hold. Investors also compare emerging tokens to Stellar because of its fundamentals-first trajectory. Rather than relying on short-term hype cycles, Stellar focused on utility, network reliability, and adoption across multiple market cycles. This durability highlights an important lesson: early positioning in structurally sound projects can deliver asymmetric outcomes when patience aligns with long-term vision. As a result, Stellar functions as a reference point for evaluating whether new tokens have the design, timing, and discipline required to mature beyond speculation. Final Outlook: Timing, Structure, and the Next 1000x Crypto Mindset The search for the next 1000x crypto is less about chasing headlines and more about understanding access mechanics. Apeing introduces a framework built around staged entry, controlled supply, and early participation, a combination that has historically driven outsized outcomes. Research referenced by Best Crypto to Buy Now , along with comparisons to Solana cycles, shows that this structure often forms before major breakouts. For those who missed Stellar’s earliest chapters, Apeing represents a chance to engage before attention peaks rather than after narratives harden. Risk remains unavoidable, but informed timing frequently outperforms hesitation in asymmetric setups. By understanding whitelist mechanics, stage pricing, and broader market psychology, participants can approach Apeing not as blind speculation, but as a structured early-stage strategy aligned with how major crypto stories often begin. For More Information: Website: Visit the Official Apeing Website Telegram: Join the Apeing Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow Apeing ON X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions About the Next 1000x Crypto Why is Apeing discussed as the next 1000x crypto? Apeing attracts attention as the next 1000x crypto due to its whitelist-only Stage 1 access, low initial pricing, and scarcity-driven distribution model that favors early participants. How does early access improve upside potential? Early access allows participants to enter at the lowest valuation before public trading, reducing exposure to volatility and increasing potential upside if demand accelerates. Is targeting the next 1000x crypto risky? Yes. All early-stage crypto investments carry significant risk. Structured access improves positioning but does not guarantee returns. Summary Apeing is emerging as a strong candidate in discussions around the next 1000x crypto, driven by early whitelist access, staged pricing, and scarcity-focused design. By replacing open-market launches with controlled entry, the project emphasizes timing and psychology. With Stellar serving as a long-term benchmark, Apeing highlights how early positioning can shape outsized outcomes for those willing to act early and responsibly.

Pros Cons Proprietary xStation platform Limited 20x leverage Strong European regulation No MetaTrader platforms Extensive education programs Geographic restrictions Competitive spreads Smaller crypto selection Market analysis included Inactivity fees after period The Regulated Crypto CFD Advantage Regulated crypto CFDs through platforms like Moneta Markets provide compelling alternatives to direct exchange trading for multiple strategic reasons. Regulatory oversight ensures proper fund segregation, transparent pricing, and adherence to conduct standards protecting trader interests. Licensed brokers maintain capital buffers and insurance mechanisms that safeguard client funds even during platform financial stress. This protection framework contrasts sharply with cryptocurrency exchanges where regulatory oversight remains inconsistent and customer fund protection often proves inadequate during crisis situations. The recent history of exchange failures demonstrates the material risks of holding significant capital on unregulated platforms without proper segregation or insurance mechanisms. Cryptocurrency trading costs through regulated CFD brokers frequently total less than equivalent exchange-based positions when accounting for all fees. Exchanges charge maker/taker fees typically ranging 0.02-0.10% per trade plus funding rates averaging 0.01-0.03% every 8 hours on leveraged positions. These funding rates compound to potentially 1-3% monthly on larger positions, significantly impacting profitability for swing traders and position holders. Moneta Markets eliminates funding rate volatility through fixed swap rates while offering tighter spreads than many exchanges during normal conditions. The total cost advantage becomes more pronounced with higher trading frequency and larger position sizes where basis points translate to substantial dollar amounts. Additional exchange costs including withdrawal fees, network transfer costs, and conversion spreads further erode profitability compared to regulated CFD structures. Execution quality and infrastructure reliability separate professional-grade platforms from exchange trading environments that sometimes suffer degradation during peak volatility. Regulated brokers invest heavily in server infrastructure, redundancy systems, and technology partnerships ensuring consistent execution even during extreme market conditions. Platform downtime during critical trading moments can prove catastrophic for leveraged positions, making reliability a crucial consideration beyond just pricing. The mobile-first approach adopted by Moneta Markets recognizes modern trading patterns while delivering full functionality through optimized mobile applications. Professional risk management tools including guaranteed stops, trailing orders, and advanced position monitoring provide sophisticated control over leveraged exposures that exchange interfaces often lack or implement poorly. Market Impact and Future Outlook The expansion of regulated crypto CFD offerings like Moneta Markets’ 500x leverage products represents a significant market evolution with implications for cryptocurrency trading structure. As retail and institutional traders increasingly recognize the advantages of regulated environments over direct exchange trading, volume migration toward licensed CFD providers will likely accelerate. This trend benefits traders through intensifying competition among providers, driving continuous improvement in pricing, execution quality, and platform functionality. The bifurcation between regulated and offshore trading environments will become more pronounced as regulatory frameworks mature and enforcement mechanisms strengthen across major jurisdictions. Leverage availability through regulated channels addresses a critical market need for capital efficiency without exposing traders to unregulated counterparty risk. The ability to deploy 500x leverage on cryptocurrency CFDs through properly capitalized and supervised brokers democratizes access to professional trading tools previously available only through offshore platforms or institutional relationships. This democratization empowers skilled traders to maximize returns on capital while maintaining protections against platform insolvency or operational failures. As leverage products gain mainstream acceptance, educational resources and risk management tools will continue improving to support sustainable trading practices. The future cryptocurrency trading landscape will likely see continued convergence between traditional financial infrastructure and digital asset markets. Platforms combining the best aspects of both worlds through regulated operations, institutional-grade execution, and crypto-native product innovation will capture disproportionate market share. Geographic specialization, such as Moneta Markets’ focus on Korean traders with tailored products, demonstrates how successful platforms will differentiate beyond just pricing and leverage availability. The integration of additional cryptocurrency pairs, options products, and sophisticated hedging tools will further enhance the value proposition of regulated CFD trading as the market matures. Comparing Regulated Crypto CFD Providers Provider Max Leverage Regulation Platforms Crypto Selection Key Advantage Moneta Markets 500x Multi-jurisdiction MT4/MT5/ProTrader/Mobile BTC, ETH, XRP Lowest total costs Plus500 30x FCA/ASIC/CySEC Proprietary 15+ cryptos Guaranteed stops IG Markets 20x FCA/ASIC Proprietary 10+ cryptos 45+ year track record CMC Markets 30x FCA/ASIC Next Generation 12+ cryptos Advanced charting City Index 25x FCA Web/Mobile 8+ cryptos Market commentary Saxo Bank 20x Danish FSA SaxoTrader 10+ cryptos Multi-asset integration IBKR Futures SEC/FCA TWS BTC futures Institutional quality XTB 20x EU licenses xStation 20+ cryptos Educational content Key Advantages of High Leverage Trading High leverage availability through regulated platforms like Moneta Markets enables sophisticated trading strategies that would otherwise require prohibitive capital commitments. Traders can maintain diversified positions across multiple cryptocurrency pairs while preserving capital for opportunistic deployments when favorable setups emerge. The capital efficiency gained through 500x leverage allows a $2,000 account to control a $1,000,000 position, generating meaningful returns from smaller account sizes when managed properly. This accessibility democratizes professional trading strategies previously restricted to well-capitalized institutional participants or individuals willing to accept offshore platform risks. Proper leverage utilization enables aggressive position scaling during high-conviction trades while maintaining appropriate risk controls through position sizing mathematics. A trader risking 1% of account balance per trade can deploy larger absolute position sizes with higher leverage, potentially capturing greater profits from correct market calls. The key lies in understanding that leverage itself doesn’t increase risk, but rather inappropriate position sizing relative to account size and stop-loss placement. Traders using 500x leverage with proper risk management can actually maintain lower overall account risk than those using 10x leverage with oversized positions lacking appropriate stop-loss protection. The psychological aspects of leverage trading require careful consideration alongside mathematical risk calculations. Higher leverage availability demands greater discipline in execution, position sizing, and emotional control during adverse price movements. Successful high-leverage traders develop systematic approaches to trade selection, entry timing, and position management that remove emotional decision-making from the process. The availability of demo accounts and educational resources helps traders develop necessary skills before deploying significant capital with high leverage multiples. Platforms like Moneta Markets that combine high leverage with comprehensive risk management tools and trader education create environments supporting sustainable high-leverage trading rather than encouraging reckless speculation. Frequently Asked Questions Why choose regulated crypto CFDs over exchange trading? — Regulated CFDs provide lower total costs, higher leverage, better execution, regulatory protections, and professional risk management tools that exchanges typically lack, making them superior for active cryptocurrency trading and capital preservation. What makes 500x leverage safe with proper management? — Leverage doesn’t inherently increase risk when combined with appropriate position sizing and stop-losses. 500x leverage with 1% account risk per trade is safer than 10x leverage with 10% risk per trade, demonstrating that position sizing matters more than leverage multiple. How does Moneta Markets keep costs lower than exchanges? — Moneta Markets eliminates volatile funding rates, offers tighter spreads, charges minimal commissions, and has no withdrawal fees or network costs, resulting in 30-40% lower total trading costs compared to major exchanges for equivalent positions. Can I trade crypto CFDs on mobile devices? — Yes, Moneta Markets prioritizes mobile-first execution with full-featured applications for iOS and Android, recognizing that over 65% of modern trading occurs through mobile devices requiring seamless functionality without compromise. What regulatory protections apply to crypto CFD trading? — Regulated brokers must segregate client funds, maintain capital buffers, provide transparent pricing, offer negative balance protection, and submit to regular audits and oversight ensuring trader protections unavailable on unregulated exchanges. Conclusion Moneta Markets’ expansion of regulated crypto CFD offerings with 500x leverage represents a significant development in the crypto trading platform landscape, providing traders with compelling alternatives to traditional exchange-based cryptocurrency trading. The combination of high leverage availability, substantially lower total trading costs, mobile-first execution, and comprehensive regulatory protections addresses the core needs of active traders seeking institutional-grade infrastructure. As the market continues evolving toward regulated environments offering superior trader protections and cost structures, platforms like Moneta Markets that successfully bridge traditional financial infrastructure with crypto-native innovation will capture increasing market share from exchanges struggling to compete on both execution quality and total cost efficiency.

This week, Gnosis confirmed that the assets are now out of the attacker’s control and urged remaining operators to update their nodes to avoid penalties. It has not yet specified the exact total amount of funds recovered. Validator-Approved Hard Fork In a post on X, the network said the decision was taken by operators following weeks of discussion after the November hack of decentralized exchange and automated market maker, Balancer, which resulted in the loss of almost $120 million in digital assets across multiple chains. The hard fork follows an earlier emergency soft fork adopted by a majority of validators in November that restricted bridge movements and froze stolen funds on Gnosis Chain. According to Gnosis, the hard fork was required to move those frozen assets and enable their recovery. The Balancer exploit was later traced to a vulnerability in Balancer V2 Composable Stable Pools, despite the protocol having undergone 11 audits by four different security firms. On-chain data revealed that the attacker had moved large amounts of staked Ether to new wallets shortly after the breach. Balancer later said that white hat hackers were able to recover about $28 million, though most of the stolen assets initially remained inaccessible. Gnosis Chain was among the networks affected, and roughly $9.4 million in stolen funds were frozen on-chain through the soft fork. Mixed Responses From the Community Philippe Schommers, Gnosis’s head of infrastructure, had said earlier this month that a hard fork would be necessary to return those funds to users, while adding that node operators who failed to follow the majority chain would face penalties. He also said the team’s priority was to enable recovery before the end of December. The move sparked debate within the community. Supporters argued that coordinated intervention showed accountability and a commitment to user protection, while critics warned that such actions could undermine the principle of immutability and called for clearer rules governing future interventions. Some community members said that the soft fork had already altered the chain’s history, which makes the hard fork a continuation of that decision, while others pushed for a formal framework to define when similar actions would be justified.

Our technical analysis indicates that Toncoin is bearish. The coin’s momentum and volatility are dropping over the shorter timeframes, with positive momentum fueling the recent recovery. Why is TON down? Toncoin’s decline reflects structural risks stemming from whale dominance and fading momentum surrounding ecosystem updates, compounded by bearish technical indicators. Recent news Over 68% of TON’s supply is held by whale wallets, per CoinMarketCap data. Long-term holders ( Is TON a good buy? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, TON will trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Will TON reach $10? Yes, TON should rise above $10 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will TON reach $100? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, TON is unlikely to reach $100 before 2031. Will TON reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, TON is unlikely to reach $1000 before 2031.

TON historic price sentiment TON price history by CoinGecko Ton network launched in 2018 as the Telegram Open Network (TON) but was later renamed “The Open Network” and taken over by the TON Foundation. In June 2020, all Toncoin tokens (98.55% of the total supply) became available for mining. The tokens were placed in special Giver smart contracts, enabling anyone to mine until 28 June 2022. Users mined around 200,000 TON daily. All the tokens were mined in two years, marking the completion of the distribution event. On September 20, 2021, TON registered its all-time low price at $0.3906. Its first significant break came in November 2021. In days, the coin slid from $0.8 to $4.5. It corrected in 2022, reaching a low of $0.9. In 2023, it ranged between $1.1 and $2.5. In 2024, it registered another bull run, rising from $2.11 to its all-time high of $8.24 on Jun 15, 2024. It corrected later and traded at the $5.2 mark in October and $4.98 in November when it started recovering. The recovery saw the coin rise above $6.5 in December. It then crossed into 2025, trading at $5.5. From there, it assumed a bear run as it fell below $3.8 in February and $3.0 in May. It crossed into June, trading at $3.20, and it maintained the level into August. In October, it fell below $3.00, and $2.50 in November.

Many large altcoins that once delivered explosive gains are now facing slower price action, higher liquidity demands, and weaker momentum. Investors are still active, but capital is becoming more selective. In these moments, attention often shifts away from saturated assets and toward new crypto projects that show early growth signals without carrying heavy market caps. This is where comparisons to early Shiba Inu and Dogecoin begin to surface. A new DeFi crypto called Mutuum Finance, selling at $0.035 in its current stage, is increasingly mentioned in discussions about where the next structural upside could form. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu became one of the most well known meme coins during its early run. At the time, SHIB traded at extremely low prices and benefited from strong community momentum. Early investors were drawn in by the possibility of large % gains from a small starting valuation. Today, SHIB is a very different asset. It carries a massive market cap and requires significant liquidity to move its price in a meaningful way. This creates a structural challenge. Even with strong trading volume, upside becomes harder to sustain once size grows too large. Price charts also reflect this shift. Breakout attempts tend to stall, and price movement has slowed compared to its early phase. This does not make SHIB irrelevant, but it limits the type of growth it can realistically deliver going forward. For investors looking for asymmetric upside, liquidity weight becomes a real constraint. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin followed a different path, but it now faces a similar ceiling. DOGE rose from a joke asset into one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies in the world. Early hype, social momentum, and celebrity attention helped push its price far beyond what fundamentals alone would suggest. Over time, that narrative weakened. Community excitement faded, and DOGE struggled to find new catalysts that could support another sustained rally. Adoption stalled, and price trends became less convincing. From a market perspective, Dogecoin now sits in a zone where expectations are capped. Without clear protocol development or new use cases, its price outlook remains limited. This creates a narrative gap that investors often try to fill by rotating into assets with clearer growth paths. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance enters this picture from a very different angle. Instead of relying on hype or viral demand, MUTM is designed as an Ethereum based DeFi crypto focused on lending and borrowing. The protocol uses a dual market structure where users supply assets to earn yield and borrowers access liquidity by locking collateral. Lending rules are defined, interest flows are predictable, and collateral requirements are clear. This creates a framework where value is generated through usage rather than attention. Unlike SHIB or DOGE, MUTM does not require massive liquidity to move. Its current scale allows price to respond more directly to changes in participation. Growth is also not tied to social cycles. It is tied to protocol activity. In its current presale Phase 6, MUTM is priced at $0.035. Since Phase 1, the token has surged 2.5x. More than $19.4M has been raised, and the holder count has grown past 18,600 wallets. Out of the 4B total supply, 45.5% is allocated to the presale, equal to 1.82B tokens, with a large portion already distributed. These figures reflect steady accumulation rather than sudden spikes. Core Mechanics That Support Long-Term Value Several mechanics help explain why MUTM is being compared to early growth assets, but with a different foundation. mtTokens play a central role. When users supply assets, they receive mtTokens that increase in value as interest accrues. This encourages holding and participation rather than fast trading. The buy and distribute model adds another layer. Protocol revenue can be used to buy MUTM from the market and distribute it to mtToken holders. This links token demand directly to protocol usage. Oracle systems support accurate pricing and risk management, which is critical for lending markets. Together, these elements connect price performance to real activity. This is something SHIB and DOGE were never designed to do. From a price analysis perspective, some analysts outline a long term scenario where MUTM could reach a 10X increase if usage scales after launch. This is not framed as a guarantee, but as a structural comparison. Smaller supply, active revenue flow, and growing participation create conditions where larger % moves are mathematically possible. Roadmap Catalysts and Why Timing Matters Several upcoming milestones add context to this analysis. The V1 testnet is targeted for Q4 , marking the transition from development into live usage. This is often a key moment for DeFi crypto repricing. Security is another major factor. Mutuum Finance completed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 score, is undergoing a Halborn review , and launched a $50k bug bounty. These steps reduce protocol risk and tend to attract more serious capital. Beyond V1, the roadmap includes a protocol backed stablecoin and Layer 2 expansion. These features aim to lower fees, increase speed, and expand the addressable user base. Phase 6 is now over 99%, and allocation is tightening. Whale inflows have already appeared, and the 24 hour leaderboard continues to reward consistent engagement rather than one time activity. Card payment access further lowers entry barriers. A Different Kind of Comparison The comparison to early SHIB or DOGE is not about copying their hype driven spikes. It is about recognizing how early stage assets behave before size becomes a limitation. Shiba Inu faced a liquidity problem as it grew too large. Dogecoin faced a narrative problem as attention faded. Mutuum Finance positions itself as a structural alternative. Its growth path is tied to lending demand, yield participation, and predictable mechanics. For investors watching top crypto opportunities and new cryptocurrency trends, MUTM represents a different type of setup. One where upside potential is not driven by viral cycles, but by usage scaling over time.

Top Stock Exchanges Ready To Launch Crypto Trading On Tuesday, local news reported that the leading stock exchanges in Russia, the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) and SPB Exchange, expressed their support of the Central Bank of Russia’s proposed regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. The exchanges affirmed they are prepared to launch crypto trading services under the recently unveiled framework as soon as it is enacted. In a statement, The Moscow Exchange, which is the largest exchange in Russia, backed the Central Bank’s proposals. The platform asserted that the Russian financial market’s reliable and effective solutions will be “highly applicable” under the new framework, noting that they are “actively working on solutions to serve the cryptocurrency market and plans to launch their circulation as soon as the relevant regulations are in place.” “In our opinion, the regulatory concept draws on the accumulated experience of conducting operations in the currency market, where the Moscow Exchange Group has accumulated expertise in trading, clearing, and settlement technologies that is unique in the international context,” the exchange reportedly said. Meanwhile, the SPB Exchange also stated its support to the Central Bank’s efforts to create “transparent and secure conditions” for crypto trading, noting that it is prepared to participate in joint efforts to develop the relevant infrastructure within the regulated market. “We are ready to start trading cryptocurrencies after the relevant changes are made to the legal regulation. The SPB Exchange has the appropriate technological infrastructure for trading and settlements,” the exchange’s statement read. Russia’s New Regulatory Framework As reported by Bitcoinist, the central bank unveiled new regulatory proposals this week that will allow retail and qualified investors to buy crypto assets through already licensed platforms in Russia. The proposed rules, expected to take effect by July 2026, will permit non-qualified investors to purchase up to 300,000 rubles, worth around $3,800, annually in the most liquid digital assets after passing a knowledge test. Meanwhile, qualified investors will be able to purchase unlimited amounts of any cryptocurrency after passing a risk-awareness test. The framework would also require that transactions are conducted through already licensed platforms, including exchanges, brokers, and trust managers, with additional requirements applied to custodians and exchange services. In addition, residents will be allowed to buy crypto assets abroad and transfer their holdings through Russian licensed intermediaries, while subject to the necessary tax reporting. Recently, Vladimir Chistyukhin, First Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, affirmed that the local financial market has all the necessary infrastructure to work with crypto assets. The Deputy chairman explained that Russian financial authorities consider it “fundamentally important” to legitimize the digital assets sector and ensure that it is compliant with the law. However, he noted that the country needs to adopt regulations quickly due to “international attention” and this process will require amendments to multiple laws, including digital financial assets, the securities market, and banking legislation.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Central Bank of Russia|crypto framework|crypto investors|Crypto legislation|Crypto Trading|Moscow Exchange|Russia Crypto legislation|Russia stock exchange|SPB Exchange,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-24 22:00:03

The market’s leading cryptocurrency, currently trading at approximately $87,370, has experienced a decline of over 30% from its all-time high of more than $126,000, drawing comparisons to past market behaviors, particularly those witnessed in December 2021. Fractal Patterns Resurface Notably, on December 24, 2021, Bitcoin was valued at around $51,700, marking a local peak before it plummeted to $34,000 by January 24, 2022. This decline represented a significant 34% drop within just one month. Related Reading: This Friday’s Bitcoin Options Expiry Could Shake Up The Market: What To Look Out For An expert analyzing the current market dynamics has applied a fractal model derived from that previous sell-off to Bitcoin’s present price. According to this analysis, there is a potential trajectory that could see the cryptocurrency move toward the $70,000 mark in the coming days. The expert argues that given the current price action and current market conditions, this scenario is plausible and suggests an additional decline of about 20% for the Bitcoin price if a similar pattern unfolds. However, without clear direction, the question remains whether this situation will unfold into a recovery above key price levels or into an extended bear market heading into the first quarter of 2026. As such, perspectives among analysts vary widely. Expert Predicts ‘Bitcoin Supercycle’ Ahead CryptoKaleo, another figure on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), posits that the current market mirrors conditions seen in the fall of 2020. Both scenarios involved Bitcoin losing a critical support level that had been established in the wake of significant market corrections, leading to a “mini-bart” scenario where the price retraced nearly all of its previous gains, eventually finding a new base. During the recovery phase after the COVID-19 crash in 2020, traditional stocks, particularly in the tech sector, significantly outperformed Bitcoin, leading many to claim that the leading cryptocurrency was fading into irrelevance. Related Reading: These Five Key Drivers Could Boost XRP To $5 By 2026, Claims Top Analyst Today, as equities frequently reach new all-time highs, a similar narrative is emerging, with some asserting that Bitcoin has become stagnant and altcoins are lacking momentum. Despite this, CryptoKaleo remains optimistic, suggesting that the present situation does not conform to the typical four-year market cycle for the cryptocurrency. Instead of a prolonged bearish phase, he predicts that when Bitcoin reaches new all-time highs in 2026, it will usher in an exciting “supercycle,” characterized by prolonged upward trends, robust altcoin seasons, and a resurgence of retail interest in mainstream cryptocurrencies.

This is Nvidia’s biggest deal ever, beating its 2019 Mellanox purchase by nearly triple. That one was worth around $7 billion. This one comes in cash, straight from Nvidia’s growing $60.6 billion pile of cash and short-term investments. That pile was just $13.3 billion in early 2023. Now they’re spending it. Groq builds high-performance chips to run large language models faster. Their hardware helps these models complete inference tasks quickly. The company was not even up for sale when Nvidia reached out, but the deal came together fast. Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive, the lead investor in Groq’s most recent round, said things moved quickly. Disruptive has put over $500 million into Groq since its founding in 2016. Groq raised billions before selling and left its cloud unit behind Three months ago, Groq raised $750 million at a $6.9 billion valuation. That round had big names like Blackrock, Neuberger Berman, Samsung, Cisco, Altimeter, and 1789 Capital, where Donald Trump Jr. is a partner. And now Nvidia is buying the entire company for nearly three times that valuation. Groq is expected to inform its investors later today. But Davis said not everything is included. Nvidia is buying all of Groq’s assets, except for one thing; Groq Cloud, the company’s new cloud division. That’s staying behind and isn’t part of the purchase. The rest, though, is going under Nvidia’s belt. Groq is aiming to hit $500 million in revenue this year, thanks to insane global demand for chips that power AI is real and growing. Groq’s technology has apparently been helping companies speed up how fast AI models answer prompts and make decisions. That kind of tech is hot right now, and Nvidia clearly wanted in. Founders came from Google, and Musk had something to say Groq was founded by engineers who left Google, including CEO Jonathan Ross. He helped build Google’s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), custom chips used by some companies instead of Nvidia’s chips. Ross and Douglas Wightman, another ex-Google engineer, were listed in Groq’s first SEC filing in 2016 when they raised $10.3 million. Wightman worked at Google’s experimental lab, Google X. Nvidia has been throwing money at the whole AI ecosystem lately. It invested in Cohere, a company building AI models, and Crusoe, which mixes AI with energy infrastructure. Nvidia also put more into CoreWeave, a cloud platform focused on AI that’s preparing for an IPO. Back in September, Nvidia also said it wanted to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. OpenAI, in return, would have to use at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia’s hardware. That deal still hasn’t been finalized. In the same month, Nvidia said it would invest $5 billion in Intel under a separate agreement. Other chip startups have been moving too. Cerebras Systems, another company in the AI space, had planned to go public this year. But in October, it backed out after raising over $1 billion in private funding. Meanwhile, Mr. Elon Musk, who owns AI startup xAI, posted on X that, “xAI will have more AI compute than everyone else combined in Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",Tech|NVDA,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-24 22:00:51
