Related Reading: Dogecoin: Why This One Price Level Is Drawing All the Attention While ADA continues to trade under pressure near the mid-$0.30 range, founder Charles Hoskinson has shifted attention away from short-term price movements toward longer-term structural developments, particularly within Cardano’s decentralized finance and security roadmap. The contrast between weak market sentiment and expanding ecosystem narratives has become one of the defining features of Cardano’s current phase. ADA's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview ADA Price Weakness Reflects Broader Caution Cardano (ADA) remains in a consolidation pattern after slipping below $0.37, weighed down by persistent selling pressure and declining risk appetite across the altcoin market. On-chain data shows that large holders are reducing their exposure, with tens of millions of tokens being redistributed over recent days. Derivatives metrics reinforce this cautious stance, as short positions continue to outnumber longs and momentum indicators remain subdued. Technically, ADA is trading below key moving averages, keeping the near-term outlook fragile. Analysts identify the $0.35 level as a critical support zone, with a deeper decline toward the $0.27–$0.30 range possible if sentiment deteriorates further. Founder Urges Patience on Security and Infrastructure Against this backdrop, Hoskinson has used recent commentary to address longer-term challenges rather than short-term volatility. Hoskinson has warned against rushing into post-quantum cryptography upgrades, arguing that while the tools already exist, deploying them prematurely could impose heavy performance costs on blockchains. Larger signatures and slower verification, he noted, could undermine scalability long before quantum computers become a practical threat. Hoskinson’s position reframes the security debate around timing rather than urgency. While global standards for post-quantum cryptography are now finalized, he maintains that readiness depends on hardware capabilities, network economics, and validator incentives. DEXes Framed as Long-Term Opportunity Hoskinson has also highlighted what he sees as a valuation disconnect within Cardano’s DeFi sector. Responding to recent activity around the privacy-focused sidechain Midnight and its token NIGHT, he argued that trading volumes on Cardano-based decentralized exchanges remain low relative to their potential. Stablecoins and cross-chain bridges remain central to this thesis. Without deep liquidity and reliable settlement assets, Cardano’s DEX ecosystem struggles to compete with more mature networks. Hoskinson suggested that once these components are in place, decentralized exchange activity could expand significantly, framing the current period as one of accumulation rather than stagnation. Currently, Cardano’s market narrative remains split. ADA’s price reflects caution and consolidation, while ecosystem development points to longer-term optionality.

56258766,647974,1766527214,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56258766.jpeg,Ripple CTO Explains How The XRP Ledger ‘Will Take Over The World’,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-cto-xrp-ledger-take-over-the-world/,"On a Token Relations webinar for the XRP ecosystem on Dec. 20, Ripple CTO David Schwartz was asked the sort of question that usually produces a tidy dashboard answer, what on-chain metrics actually matter, what’s “real” economic activity, and what trends are showing up across the ledger (and, yes, the ETF chatter in the background). He went straight to the point: usage that sticks, value that moves, and the boring-but-decisive plumbing that financial institutions actually care about will “take over the world.” How Ripple Wants To Make The XRPL Mainstream “I definitely focus on metrics that show sustained usage and real value moving through the network,” Schwartz said . “Transaction activity is probably the clearest signal. The XRP ledger has now processed more than four billion transactions with pretty consistent settlement in about four to five seconds at a fairly predictable fee.” That’s the pitch in one breath: scale, predictable finality, and fees so low you don’t have to pretend they’re a feature.“You know, a transaction on the XRP ledger costs a tiny fraction of a penny,” the Ripple CTO added. “It’s not trying to extract value from people’s transactions. That’s trying to enable people to do what they need to do.” Then he pivoted to liquidity, the kind of line XRP holders love to hear, but framed as infrastructure rather than tribal scoreboard-watching. “Liquidity is another huge factor,” Schwartz said. “XRP is a top five digital asset by market capitalization and has been for I think 10 years now, about 109 billion dollars deep global liquidity for real financial activity. That depth matters.” The bigger point he kept coming back to was momentum in actual network use, not just “we issued a token and it sat there.” “The XRP ledger itself is now one of the top 10 blockchains for real world activity this year with a rate of increase that’s just absolutely astonishing from a use case that was you know almost unthinkable just a year ago,” he said. “We now have institutional issuers like Guggenheim, Ondo [Finance] , Aberdeen [Standard Investments], Franklin [Templeton] .” And then the part that’s meant to separate “RWA theater” from RWAs that matter : “And it’s not just issuance, you know, it wouldn’t be super exciting if they were just sort of issuing an asset on chain that just sort of sat on chain,” the Ripple CTO said. “What’s interesting is that these assets are actually moving and settling on chain. So the financial activity is getting the benefit.” That little distinction is where a lot of tokenization narratives either hold up or collapse. Anybody can “issue” a thing on a ledger. The harder bit is getting it to behave like financial infrastructure, moving, settling, plugging into workflows that aren’t built for crypto vibes. Schwartz also threw a bit of cold water on the current retail mix. XRPL has users who love the tech (and users who love leverage), but he was pretty blunt that this isn’t the endgame. But obviously that’s not how we’re going to take over the world. We’re going to take over the world with solid financial products that solve real world use cases. And we are actually starting to see that now enabled by things like stablecoins and tokenized real world assets that let us handle these use cases like payments and like reasonable investments, tokenized money, market funds and treasuries,” he said. “ And retail might follow the institutions, not the other way around. The Ripple CTO pointed to “more than 500,000 new wallets” created, framing it as early evidence that institutional rails can drag everyday users in behind them. At press time, XRP traded at $1.88.",XRP|David Schwartz|ripple|ripple news|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price,EN,0,0,MARKET|WALLET|XRP|ONDO|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-23 22:00:14

Speaking in a long Truth Social post, Trump declared that he has not enacted what he calls ‘The Trump Rule.’ “The Financial News today was great — GDP up 4.2% as opposed to the predicted 2.5% (and this, despite the downward pressure of the recent Democrat Shutdown!),” said Trump. The president added that markets no longer react the way they once did, as past rallies followed good economic news, while current rallies fade because investors assume the Fed will step in to curb inflation by raising rates. Trump said this mindset blocks the kind of long-term market growth the country once experienced during earlier expansion periods. He argued that strong markets do not cause inflation and said bad policy decisions do. Trump stated that his preferred Fed chair would cut rates when markets are performing well and avoid what he described as unnecessary interference. “I want my new Fed Chairman to lower Interest Rates if the Market is doing well, not destroy the Market for no reason whatsoever,” Trump wrote. Trump said inflation should be handled later if needed, not during market rallies. He added that rate hikes can wait until there is a clear reason, saying the wrong timing can stop growth that could lift GDP by double digits within a year. Trump also said economic planners who resist market expansion prevent sustained growth. He wrote that the United States should reward success and not punish it, adding that anyone who disagrees with him will never hold the Fed’s top job. Kevin Hassett backs faster cuts as Fed signals caution Kevin Hassett, the National Economic Council director, echoed parts of Trump’s stance in a CNBC interview on Tuesday. Kevin said the Federal Reserve is moving too slowly on rate reductions, even though economic growth has accelerated. He said the United States is lagging other central banks globally when it comes to easing policy. Kevin said advances in artificial intelligence are pushing productivity higher while also keeping inflation pressure lower. He also linked recent growth to trade policy, saying tariffs implemented under Trump reduced the U.S. trade deficit and accounted for about 1.5% of third-quarter growth. Official figures showed the economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.3%, exceeding the Dow Jones consensus estimate of 3.2%. The Federal Reserve cut rates by a quarter point on Dec. 10, marking its third reduction of the year. The central bank also indicated future cuts could slow. Three Fed governors voted against the move, the highest number of dissents since 2019. After the meeting, Jerome Powell, the current Fed chair, said the decision was “a close call.” Trump has repeatedly criticized the Fed for not cutting rates faster. Kevin’s potential candidacy to replace Jerome when his term ends in May has raised concerns among some Fed watchers about political closeness to the White House. Kevin addressed that directly, saying on CNBC last week that Fed independence is “really important.” Trump said in a prime-time address last week that he will announce his Fed chair nominee soon. He said the choice will be someone who strongly supports lower interest rates. The speech focused on affordability pressures facing households. A CBS News/YouGov poll published Sunday showed Trump’s economic approval rating at 37%. When asked about that figure, Kevin said public opinion often lags behind economic performance. “In the end, it turns out that I think it has a lot to do with news coverage and how people are processing, their glimpse of the outside world,” Kevin said.

The findings point to Ethereum quietly becoming a settlement layer for corporate payments and consumer spending, rather than just peer transfers. And while most stablecoin transactions, by count, still happen between individuals, the bulk of the money now flows through business-linked wallets, a sign that real-world payment use is gaining ground. Institutions Drive Volume, Consumers Fuel Growth The findings, published in an Artemis research report, provided a detailed look at stablecoin payments on Ethereum, which hosts nearly half of the global stablecoin supply. In the study, Artemis separated personal payments from business activity, analyzing transactions from August 2024 to August 2025 and classifying wallet types. The data shows a clear divide. Person-to-person (P2P) transfers made up 67% of the transaction count but only 24% of the total dollar volume. In contrast, business-involved payments, though fewer in number, accounted for the majority of value. This trend accelerated significantly in the past 12 months, with business-to-business (B2B) payment volume expanding by 156%, while the average transaction size increased 45%, suggesting institutions are moving larger sums. However, according to the report, the fastest-growing category was person-to-business (P2B) payments, which saw a 167% rise in volume. James, Head of Ecosystem at the Ethereum Foundation, highlighted the trend on social media, noting that “institutions aren’t sending more payments. They’re sending bigger ones.” What this Means for Ethereum’s Wider Role The payment trend comes with Ethereum’s native token trading just under the $3,000 level, reflecting a 2.5% drop in the last 24 hours. In the past seven days, it has gained slightly over 1% while losing 5% of its value over two weeks. ETH’s current value remains 5.5% higher than it was 30 days ago, despite a significant decrease of over 40% from its August all-time high, which was just shy of $5,000. Analysts say stablecoin usage, rather than price speculation, may be one of Ethereum’s strongest long-term demand drivers. Meanwhile, Artemis’ broader “Stablecoin Wrapped 2025” report added some context. It shows USDT adding more supply this year than the next five issuers combined, while on-chain B2B payments reached an annual run rate of nearly $77 billion. These figures suggest that firms are increasingly trusting blockchain rails for real transactions. The data also revealed concentration risks, where roughly 84% of stablecoin volume comes from the top 1,000 wallets, meaning large players still control most flows. That raises questions about how decentralized stablecoin usage truly is, even with adoption growing. Taken together, the findings suggest Ethereum’s stablecoin economy is maturing. Instead of mainly serving individuals sending small sums, the network is becoming a backbone for business payments and everyday commerce. If this pattern continues, analysts believe Ethereum’s value may depend less on hype cycles and more on its role as financial plumbing for a growing digital economy.

The Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange is recruiting a quantitative trader to join a team responsible for buying and selling financial contracts tied to the outcomes of sporting events on its prediction market platform. https://t.co/1aQemhmjuy is looking for a new employee to work on a market making team that will face off against customers on the company’s prediction market exchange https://t.co/M90qMhiCQ3 — Bloomberg (@business) December 23, 2025 Liquidity or Conflict? Crypto.com’s Market-Making Role Sparks Debate According to a recent Bloomberg report , the role would sit on Crypto.com’s market-making desk and involve actively trading against customer orders to support liquidity across sports contracts and other derivatives offered on the company’s U.S. platform. The hiring effort comes as prediction markets expand rapidly across both crypto and traditional finance. These platforms allow users to trade contracts that settle based on real-world outcomes , such as sports results or political events, with prices reflecting the market’s implied probability. While prediction markets have long presented themselves as neutral venues where participants trade against each other, the use of in-house market makers has raised questions about conflicts of interest. Market making has become a sensitive issue for event-contract exchanges, particularly those operating under U.S. federal oversight. Critics argue that when an exchange or its affiliate takes the opposite side of customer trades, the structure begins to resemble a traditional sportsbook that profits from customer losses. Those concerns have already surfaced elsewhere in the industry. Kalshi , one of the most prominent regulated prediction market operators, runs an internal unit known as Kalshi Trading. Polymarket , a major decentralized platform, is also reported to be building its own internal market-making team. Crypto.com’s job listing states that the new hire would seek to “maximize profits while carefully managing risks,” language that has fueled debate over whether the firm is effectively trading against its users. In response, in a report, a Crypto.com spokesperson said the company does not rely on proprietary trading as a revenue source and described its business model as providing customer access to digital assets and event contracts for a fee while remaining risk neutral. The spokesperson added that the internal market maker does not receive preferential access to customer order flow or proprietary data and operates under rules disclosed to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , which oversees derivatives markets in the U.S. Prediction Markets Hit Record Volumes, but Trading Rules Stir Concerns The exchange has also taken steps to attract external liquidity providers. Like its competitors, Crypto.com has sought to bring in professional trading firms to ensure continuous buying and selling, particularly in high-volume sports markets. However, company rules grant designated market makers on sports contracts a three-second head start over smaller traders, a policy that has drawn scrutiny for potentially allowing large participants to adjust prices ahead of retail users. The broader industry continues to grow despite these concerns, with prediction markets linked to sports and politics having driven much of the recent surge in activity. Platforms including Kalshi, Polymarket, and Limitless recorded a combined $44 billion in trading volume this year, with Kalshi reaching roughly $1 billion in weekly volume at its peak. Source: Dune Analytics On-chain prediction markets have expanded even faster, with monthly volume climbing from under $100 million in early 2024 to more than $13 billion, according to joint research from Keyrock and Dune Analytics. Major crypto firms are also entering the space. Coinbase recently rolled out prediction market trading on its platform and agreed to acquire The Clearing Company as part of its push to scale regulated event-based markets. The move followed Kalshi’s $300 million Series D raise at a $5 billion valuation , showing investor interest in the sector.

For a coin based on Arbitrum , this is almost unheard of. This price action puts it at over a $2.7B circulating market cap, making it one of the largest coins on Arbitrum. Many in the Rain community have asked a fair question: “How come @Rain__Protocol is built on @arbitrum , but Arbitrum doesn’t follow Rain on X?” So we turned the question into a $10,000 incentivized market: Will Arbitrum follow Rain’s X account by December 11, 2025?

The protocol launched around 2023 to 2024 and was down nearly 99% at one point. It gained massive attention in late November 2025 when Nasdaq-listed biotech company Enlivex Therapeutics announced a $212M private placement to build the world’s first corporate digital asset treasury centered on RAIN tokens. That move, along with appointing former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to its board, caused the token to surge dramatically, peaking at around 20,000% YTD. Over the last month alone, RAIN is up more than 125%, and this is still a beta product. Investors are now wondering what comes next with this level of strength. Rain Crypto Price Prediction: Can RAIN Hit a New ATH This Week? Source: RAINUSD / TradingView The chart is showing one clear pattern over the last month: an accumulation phase followed by a large upside candle in a short period of time. If this pattern repeats, the next leg higher could happen at any time, given the current range it is moving through at these levels. A break above the psychological resistance at 0.01 would be the first step and would confirm the bullish setup. However, there is still a possibility it moves the other way, especially with the RSI nearing oversold levels. A drawback toward the $0.06 level is possible. Bitcoin Hyper Is What Speculation Looks Like With Real Utility While narratives like RAIN show how fast speculation can move prices, Bitcoin Hyper is targeting something much more fundamental: fixing Bitcoin’s biggest limitations. Bitcoin Hyper is a Layer 2 built to bring speed, low fees, and real on-chain utility to Bitcoin, using Solana-grade performance while keeping BTC as the settlement asset. Instead of betting on hype alone, Hyper focuses on enabling DeFi, payments, staking, and high-throughput applications directly for Bitcoin holders. Through the Hyper Bridge, users can move BTC onto the Hyper network and receive a 1:1 representation with near-instant finality. That opens access to yield strategies and on-chain activity that Bitcoin simply cannot support on its base layer. Early momentum has been strong, with Bitcoin Hyper raising over $29.7M so far and offering staking yields of up to 39% APY during its early phase. As more capital looks for utility-driven narratives rather than pure speculation, Hyper is positioning itself as a serious Layer 2 contender going into 2026. In a market where hype fades fast, infrastructure tends to last.

Sentiment has turned decisively cautious, with investors reassessing risk exposure and preparing for a potentially challenging period ahead. Despite multiple attempts to stabilize, price action remains compressed, offering little confirmation that bullish momentum is ready to return. Related Reading: The Gold-to-Bitcoin Rotation Narrative Gains Strength: A Data-Driven Review According to an analysis by XWIN Research Japan, the current market phase is best described as a range-bound consolidation following a high-level correction, with momentum conditionally tilted to the downside. While Bitcoin has remained largely sideways over the past three months, traditional safe-haven assets have followed a very different trajectory. Gold and silver have continued to push higher, reflecting rising demand for defensive assets amid persistent geopolitical tensions, policy uncertainty, and expectations of lower real interest rates. This divergence highlights a structural challenge for Bitcoin in the current macro environment. Institutional capital can allocate to precious metals with relative ease, benefiting from deep liquidity, established market infrastructure, and clear regulatory frameworks. Silver, in particular, has amplified gold’s move, supported by tighter supply dynamics and greater sensitivity to speculative flows. Bitcoin’s Role as a Risk Asset Limits Its Upside The analysis explains that Bitcoin has not followed gold and silver higher because it is still treated primarily as a high-beta risk asset, rather than a pure safe haven. In risk-off environments, capital typically flows first into gold and government bonds, where investors seek stability and capital preservation. Bitcoin, by contrast, is often a secondary consideration, attracting flows only after confidence improves. Unlike gold’s long-term and relatively price-insensitive buyer base, Bitcoin remains more exposed to short-term positioning and marginal demand, making broad macro tailwinds insufficient on their own to sustain a durable uptrend. CryptoQuant data reinforces this interpretation. Bitcoin’s apparent demand has recently turned negative, signaling that fresh demand is not expanding even as prices hold at relatively elevated levels. At the same time, Short-Term Holder SOPR has spent extended periods below 1, indicating that short-term participants are selling at a loss or near breakeven. This behavior typically adds selling pressure on rebounds, as underwater holders use price strength to exit positions. As long as capital continues to favor gold and silver, Bitcoin’s internal demand structure remains a key constraint. The base case points to continued support for precious metals, while Bitcoin’s upside stays capped by weak demand and short-term holder pressure. That view would only change if apparent demand turns sustainably positive and STH SOPR reclaims and holds above 1. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Lags Network Utility: A Valuation Reset Is Underway Price Holds Critical Support as Trend Weakens Bitcoin is currently trading near the $87,000–$88,000 area after a sharp corrective move from recent highs above $110,000. The chart shows that price has lost the short-term bullish structure, with BTC now firmly below the 50-day moving average (blue), which has started to slope downward. This confirms that short-term momentum has turned negative and rallies are facing increasing overhead supply. More importantly, price is now testing the 100-day moving average (green), which sits just above the current level and has acted as dynamic support throughout much of this cycle. The market’s reaction around this zone is critical. A sustained hold above the 100-day MA could allow Bitcoin to stabilize and form a base, while a decisive breakdown would likely expose the 200-day moving average (red), currently rising near the low $80,000s. Related Reading: Ethereum Market Structure Strengthens: Binance Netflows Point to Long-Term Conviction Volume dynamics reinforce the cautious outlook. The sell-off from the October peak was accompanied by elevated volume, signaling distribution rather than a shallow pullback. Since then, volume has tapered off, suggesting a lack of aggressive dip-buying interest at current levels. Structurally, Bitcoin remains in a broader uptrend as long as it holds above the 200-day MA, but the loss of the 50-day and weakening momentum indicate consolidation or further downside risk in the near term. Bulls need a recovery back above $90,000 to regain control and shift sentiment meaningfully.

The IMF said discussions on the second review of the country’s 40-month Extended Fund Facility program are ongoing as authorities work to meet agreed benchmarks. Growth forecasts were revised upward, and the fund signaled continued financial support tied to further policy steps. IMF Notes Faster Growth Reports note that growth is running above earlier forecasts. The IMF now sees real GDP growth near 4% for 2025. Local data show the economy expanded 5.1% in the third quarter of 2025 compared with the same quarter a year earlier, led by construction and remittance-driven consumption. Remittances and stronger investment flows were cited as key drivers. The fund said higher confidence and improved fiscal numbers have helped create space for short-term rebuilding of reserves. Gradually, then suddenly. https://t.co/MWP0avqlDE pic.twitter.com/hYYONaRLcI — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) December 22, 2025 A Program Backed By Clear Conditions Based on IMF releases, a staff-level agreement was reached with El Salvador in December 2024 for a program worth about $1.4 billion. That arrangement sets fiscal targets and governance measures meant to restore sustainability. Earlier, when the IMF completed the first review and Article IV consultation in June 2025, a disbursement equivalent to roughly $118 million in SDRs was approved. Reports added that authorities have enacted a new fiscal law, strengthened public procurement transparency, and advanced governance measures for state firms. Key Reforms And Conditions An actuarial study on pensions has been published, and steps to tighten anti-money-laundering rules were discussed with IMF staff. The fund has also pressed for limits on public sector exposure to cryptoc urrencies; according to international coverage, measures to reduce that exposure and to make private crypto use voluntary are under consideration. What Comes Next For The Program According to IMF briefings, the second review will require follow-through on prior actions and the meeting of fiscal targets. Continued disbursements depend on progress, and IMF teams remain in contact with Salvadoran authorities to work through outstanding issues. In parallel, the IMF has reiterated its position on El Salvador’s Bitcoin policy. According to recent IMF statements, the fund wants the country’s public sector Bitcoin holdings to remain capped, with no additional purchases made under the current loan program. The IMF has also pushed for a reduced state role in crypto-related activities, including changes tied to the Chivo wallet, arguing that limits are needed to contain fiscal and financial risks. Salvadoran officials have said Bitcoin remains part of their strategy, though IMF documents show no confirmed increase in government-held Bitcoin since early 2025.

Chris Kelly, who was Facebook’s chief privacy officer and general counsel, told CNBC on Tuesday that making AI more efficient will be critical going forward. Human brains run on just 20 watts of power, he pointed out. AI companies are building facilities that need billions of watts. “I think that finding efficiency is going to be one of the key things that the big AI players look to,” Kelly said. The companies that figure out how to cut data center costs will come out ahead, he believes. The construction boom has raised questions about where the electricity will come from. The power grid is already under pressure. Nvidia and OpenAI announced plans in September for data centers needing at least 10 gigawatts of electricity. That’s enough to run roughly 8 million American homes for a year. It’s also about what New York City uses during its busiest summer days in 2024, based on New York Independent System Operator figures. Worries about expenses grew after DeepSeek released a free large language model in December 2024. The Chinese company said it cost less than $6 million to develop. That’s dramatically lower than what American competitors have spent. Kelly expects more Chinese companies to become major players. President Donald Trump recently approved the sale of Nvidia’s H200 chips to China. Open-source models from China will give people access to basic computing power and AI tools, Kelly added. Consumers face soaring bills The rush to build these facilities is already hitting electricity bills. Data centers that haven’t been constructed yet are pushing power prices higher as reported by Cryptopoltian previously. Regular customers might end up paying for expensive infrastructure that may not be needed if demand predictions are wrong. Consumers on the biggest electric grid in the country will pay $16.6 billion to guarantee future power supplies for data centers between 2025 and 2027. That’s according to a watchdog report released this month. The grid is PJM Interconnection. It provides electricity to over 65 million people in 13 states, including Virginia, which has the world’s largest data center hub. Northern Illinois and Ohio are growing markets too. “A lot of us are very concerned that we are paying money today for a data center tomorrow,” said Abe Silverman. He was general counsel for New Jersey’s public utility board from 2019 to 2023. “That’s a little bit scary if you don’t really have faith in the load forecast.” Data center boom may not be as big as power companies think Home electricity costs have already gone up in states with major data center activity. Residential prices in September jumped 20% in Illinois, 12% in Ohio, and 9% in Virginia compared to the same month last year. The federal Energy Information Administration provided those numbers. All three states rank among the top five data center markets nationwide. Joe Bowring leads Monitoring Analytics. He explained that data center power costs show up directly on household bills. “When the wholesale power costs go up, people pay more, when it goes down people pay less,” he said. PJM predicts data centers will need an extra 30 gigawatts by 2030. That’s enough electricity to power more than 24 million homes annually. But there’s uncertainty about whether that demand will actually happen. Data center developers often explore multiple locations before choosing one, said Cathy Kunkel. She’s a consultant at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. That means the forecasts likely count some projects twice.

The iPhone maker brought in $109.2 billion from its Services division alone this year while pushing its total worth past $4 trillion. That makes Apple only the second company ever to hit that mark, joining Nvidia in an exclusive club. But behind the scenes , several key executives are heading for the door. Jeff Williams, who served as chief financial officer, has retired from the company. His departure is significant because many inside Apple viewed him as the top candidate to eventually replace Tim Cook as chief executive. Two other longtime leaders are also on their way out. Lisa Jackson, who handles government relations, plans to retire in late January. Kate Adams, the company’s top lawyer, will leave in late 2026. The changes don’t stop there. John Giannandrea, who runs Apple’s artificial intelligence work, is stepping down. His replacement will be Amar Subramanya, who previously worked on AI projects at Google and Microsoft. Alan Dye, a vice president focused on design, left Apple to take a job running a new design studio at Meta’s Reality Labs division. Cook prepares his successor These moves come as Cook appears to be grooming John Ternus, a senior vice president who oversees hardware engineering, to take over when he decides to step aside. The Financial Times reported Cook might leave as soon as early 2026, though Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman says no firm date has been set. Cook took charge of Apple 14 years ago when company founder Steve Jobs died. Jobs had rescued Apple from near collapse after returning in 1997, following his earlier dismissal in 1985. He then launched a series of hit products like the iPod and iPhone that transformed the company. Since Cook joined Apple in 1998 and later became chief executive, he has kept that momentum going. Under his watch, Apple introduced the Apple Watch and AirPods. The company’s services business exploded in size. Cook also pushed Apple to design and use its own computer chips, giving the company greater control over how its devices work. Cook’s skills as a negotiator helped Apple survive several tough spots. The company faced off against the Justice Department, dealt with the pandemic, and navigated trade tensions with China under President Trump. Trump eventually decided not to put tariffs on smartphones and some other tech products from China. These decisions paid off for shareholders. Apple’s market value jumped from $1 trillion in 2018 to $4 trillion this year. Total revenue climbed to $416 billion for fiscal 2025, compared to $391 billion the year before. Major product updates on the horizon Looking ahead, Apple is preparing major product updates. According to Gurman, the company plans to release its first foldable iPhone in the second half of 2026. That could push iPhone sales even higher than current record levels. Apple is also working on a cheaper MacBook model, which would make its laptops available to more buyers. While a budget laptop might not generate as much profit per sale, it could bring in new customers who then pay for Apple’s subscription services. Whoever follows Cook will take over a company at the height of its success. Phone sales have slowed down overall, but Apple still benefits from hundreds of millions of customers who upgrade their devices regularly and increasingly pay for Apple services. The next leader will face challenges too. Investors want to see Apple make more progress on artificial intelligence. The company needs to show off its improved version of Siri. Apple will also need to compete with Meta, Google, and Samsung in smart glasses. Meta already sells two different smart glasses models, and Google and Samsung are both developing their own. For now, Cook remains in charge. Whether that changes next year remains to be seen. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Engineers hired through the Trump administration’s U.S. Tech Force program will earn between $150,000 to $200,000 annually until the period of employment ends. Applications to Donald Trump’s U.S. Tech Force program Scott Kupor, director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, announced on Tuesday that roughly 25,000 people have expressed interest in joining President Trump’s U.S. Tech Force program, which aims to recruit 1,000 engineers for two-year federal positions. The administration intends to complete the first round of hiring by March 31, 2026. The program targets software engineers, data scientists, AI specialists, and cybersecurity experts who are still early in their careers. The program’s website states that candidates do not need to be holders of traditional degrees or meet any minimum experience requirements. However, they must demonstrate strong technical skills through work experience, projects, or certifications. Annual compensation ranges from $150,000 to $200,000 plus benefits. Cryptopolitan previously reported that those who complete their government service will have opportunities in the private sector. Major technology companies, including Apple, Google, Nvidia, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Oracle, Palantir, and xAI, have pledged to consider program alumni for positions after their two-year period of employment ends. The participating companies can also nominate their own employees for temporary government service positions. OPM described the program as a coordinated effort involving the Office of Management and Budget, General Services Administration, White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and multiple agency leaders. Participating agencies include the Departments of Defense, Labor, Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, and Justice, along with the IRS. Why is President Trump seeking engineers? The Office of Personnel Management estimates the federal government could see about 1 in 8 civilian workers gone by the end of the year, or about 300,000 employees out of 2.4 million, with more than 150,000 accepting voluntary buyout offers. Earlier this year, the Trump administration let go of more than 200 AI experts hired under the Biden administration’s National AI Talent Surge. Biden’s parallel initiative resulted in about 200 hires, with roughly 75 remaining in government roles, representing a retention rate of approximately 37%. Former employees from the U.S. Digital Service were dismissed or quit during the first months of the Trump administration. The entire 18F digital consulting group at the General Services Administration was also shut down. The Social Security Administration closed its Office of Transformation in February. The Defense Digital Service closed after suffering mass resignations, and the IRS had lost over 2,000 tech workers as of June. President Donald Trump, in the first months of his second term, focused on eliminating government jobs, sparing only positions his administration considered necessary to maintain national security. Now, the administration is attempting to address a “critical skills” gap in government. Only about 7% of the U.S. government workforce is in their early career, compared to almost a quarter in the rest of the workforce, according to Kupor.

The latest Shiba Inu price prediction shows the immediate future of the dog-themed memecoin appears bleak going into 2026. One OG member of the ShibArmy couldn’t contain his disappointment, taking to X to share his displeasure in a recent post saying “shib is going down and we are (as shib investors) losing money.” $shib is going down and we are (as shib investors) loosing money. Could you please do something? @ShytoshiKusama @kaaldhairya — Shibholder (@Shibaholder__) December 21, 2025 The concerned investor called out to Shiba Inu founder Shytoshi Kusama to “please do something” to stop the price grinding slowly toward zero. First-Ever Weekly Death Cross Signals Deeper Decline Ahead Adding to the concerns, technical indicators show that Shiba Inu has completed its first-ever weekly death cross this year, where the shorter moving average crossed below the longer one, a classic bearish signal. The token is now trading at $0.00000706, down about 3%, and more significantly, it’s breaking below a critical horizontal support level that had held since early 2023. The descending trendline from the 2024 highs continues acting as resistance, with price moving lower within this downward channel. Source: TradingView What’s particularly concerning is that oscillators at the bottom show weakness, with both indicators hovering in the lower range around 37 and 31, suggesting diminished momentum and potential oversold conditions that haven’t yet triggered a bounce. The technical setup reflects analysts’ expectations of continued decline, likely targeting psychological levels significantly lower than current prices. Without a catalyst to break this pattern, the path of least resistance appears to be further downside, especially if the broken support level now acts as resistance on any attempted recovery. Analyst Declares SHIB “Dead” Unless Key Support Reclaimed Crypto analyst Nebraskangooner has delivered the verdict that Shiba Inu is now “dead unless it reclaims the $0.00000135 support level.” This represents a critical threshold that could determine whether SHIB can mount any meaningful recovery or continue its descent into 2026. The confluence of technical breakdown, weakening momentum indicators, and deteriorating market sentiment paints a challenging picture for SHIB holders. The completion of the weekly death cross, combined with the break below multi-year support, suggests the bearish structure could persist without significant fundamental catalysts. Source: X/ Nebraskangooner For SHIB to reverse this trend, it would need to reclaim the broken support level, ideally with strong volume and momentum shifts in the oscillators. Until then, traders remain cautious as fear continues dominating sentiment around one of the original 2021 cycle memecoins. Pepenode Emerges as New Memecoin Alternative With Shiba Inu and other 2021 cycle memecoins entering bearish territory, new cycle memecoins like Pepenode (PEPENODE) are seeing attention turn to them as fresh opportunities for investors.

Speaking at a press conference held online, Paz said company representatives from Tesla, Amazon and Oracle will travel to Bolivia in January to share details about their technology investments. The plans include building data centers in El Alto and Cochabamba, he said. Foreign Minister Fernando Aramayo told the Wall Street Journal that his government was looking for financial help from the Trump administration and wants to open the country’s large lithium reserves to outside investors. Aramayo said he had also talked about the possibility of a currency swap with US officials during a trip to Washington in December. Last week, Bolivia’s government rolled out a sweeping emergency decree that ended two decades of fuel subsidies and also laid out a plan to fix public finances and bring in foreign investment. The decree did not give any details on lithium or a currency swap agreement with the United States. A government spokesman told Reuters that lithium reserves were not a topic of discussion with the United States. “The currency swap is part of the topics related to US support for the economic stabilization process, but the agenda also includes US investment in different sectors. Lithium was not discussed at all,” the spokesperson said. Satellite internet gets green light In the press conference attended by Bloomberg, Paz also mentioned that Bolivia has given permission to OneWeb, SpaceX’s Starlink and Amazon’s Leo to do business in the country. These companies will use satellites that orbit close to Earth to provide better internet service. Foreign businesses must get approval to work in Bolivia. The announcement did not specify whether Tesla, Amazon and Oracle have received such approval. The previous administration, led by President Luis Arce and his left-wing government , had turned down a request from Starlink to operate there. These potential investments would represent a big change for Bolivia, which spent nearly 20 years under socialist leadership that avoided American businesses and built ties with China and Russia instead. Paz, who holds moderate views, took office in November and has shown support for working with the United States. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week that “government officials are currently in Bolivia seeking to facilitate investments that will foster prosperity for both our nations.” Scholarship program for young Bolivians Paz said IBM, Google, Amazon Web Services, Oracle and the Project Management Institute will provide 10,000 scholarships to young people in Bolivia for technology training next year. The best students will get to tour SpaceX locations in Texas and Florida. The US has also praised Bolivia’s recent economic changes , especially ending a fuel subsidy that kept gas and diesel prices low for almost 20 years. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that “we applaud President Paz’s historic efforts to open Bolivia to the world by committing to meaningful reforms to attract international investment”. “This is the path forward, not one of stagnation, blockades or dynamite,” Paz said about protests against his government’s move to end fuel subsidies.

56259801,https://timestabloid.com/?p=93156,1766532617,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Japanese Analyst Outlines Conditions For 1,000 Yen XRP",https://timestabloid.com/japanese-analyst-outlines-conditions-for-1000-yen-xrp/,"XRP has experienced prolonged weakness as digital asset markets remain under strain, yet a Japanese financial commentator believes the current phase may precede a significant shift. Angorou, a widely followed analyst in Japan, has presented a detailed outlook suggesting that XRP could eventually reach a valuation of 1,000 yen, which converts to approximately $6.41 at prevailing exchange rates. At the time Angorou published his assessment, XRP was trading near $1.99, equivalent to roughly 300 yen. While recent price action has disappointed many market participants, he argues that broader structural and regulatory developments could materially improve XRP’s outlook in 2026. Market Performance Leading to the Current Price Angorou’s analysis begins with a review of XRP’s price movement since late 2024. In early November of that year, XRP was valued at approximately 75 yen. Shortly thereafter, Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election altered expectations across the cryptocurrency market. Campaign signals pointing toward regulatory reform and a potential leadership change at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission led investors to anticipate a resolution of Ripple’s legal challenges. This shift in sentiment contributed to a rapid rise in XRP’s price. By January 2025, the token had surpassed 500 yen. However, the rally proved unstable, as a market-wide correction, partly attributed to tax-related selling, pushed XRP back into the 200-yen range. The asset later regained momentum and recorded a new peak of 542 yen in July 2025. Following that high, XRP entered a sustained decline. By the time of Angorou’s commentary, the price had retreated to around 303 yen, representing a drawdown of approximately 45% from its July peak. This performance placed XRP among the weaker assets within the upper tier of cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Whale Activity Reflects Shifting Confidence On-chain data also plays a central role in Angorou’s thesis. He examined wallet addresses holding at least 1 million XRP, which equates to more than 300 million yen at current prices. On November 6, 2024, there were 2,111 such addresses. As XRP prices climbed following the U.S. election, accumulation by these large holders increased significantly. The number of whale addresses continued to grow even after XRP peaked in mid-2025, reaching a record 2,758 by October. However, as prices declined sharply thereafter, the number of large holders fell to approximately 2,011, indicating a rapid reversal in sentiment. Angorou also observed signs of reduced participation from retail investors, which may have further pressured prices.

In November, Canary Capital introduced the first U.S.-listed spot XRP exchange-traded fund. Since then, four additional XRP-focused ETFs have entered the market. These products have demonstrated unusual consistency. Since their launch, XRP ETFs have not recorded a single day of net outflows. From mid-November onward, they achieved 25 consecutive trading days of inflows, bringing total assets to approximately $1.07 billion, or about 169 billion yen. This inflow streak exceeds those previously observed in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana ETF products. Regulatory Clarity as a 2026 Catalyst Angorou believes regulatory developments could be decisive for XRP’s future. He highlighted proposed U.S. legislation aimed at clearly distinguishing between securities and commodities. Under such a framework, assets classified as commodities would fall under the oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which applies fewer constraints than the SEC. Bitcoin already holds commodity status, and similar recognition for Ethereum appears increasingly likely. Angorou contends that if XRP were formally classified as a commodity, U.S. banks and financial institutions could adopt Ripple’s payment infrastructure without legal uncertainty. He also referenced Ripple’s conditional approval to operate as a trust bank, which could expand its role within regulated financial services. To estimate XRP’s potential upside, Angorou examined its historical valuation relative to Bitcoin. During earlier periods of strong market confidence, XRP’s ratio to Bitcoin averaged 0.169, with peaks as high as 0.48. Throughout the SEC lawsuit period, the ratio remained significantly lower. If regulatory clarity restores XRP’s standing and narrows this gap, Angorou estimates the token could reach approximately 780 yen under stable Bitcoin prices. Should legislative reforms coincide with Bitcoin rising above 20 million yen, he believes XRP could surpass the 1,000-yen threshold in 2026.

Despite the pullback, BTC remains the largest crypto asset, carrying a market value of roughly $1.75 tn and a circulating supply just under 20 mn coins, close to its hard cap of 21 mn. Broader market sentiment has softened. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index sits at 29, firmly in “fear” territory, while the Altcoin Season Index is at 17, signaling a clear Bitcoin-dominant phase. Total crypto market capitalization hovers near $2.96 tn, suggesting capital is consolidating rather than exiting the asset class altogether. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Picture: Consolidation, Not Breakdown On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin price prediction seems bearish as BTC continues to trade inside a descending channel that formed after the rejection near $94,200 earlier this month. Importantly, downside follow-through has been limited. Each move toward the $84,500–$85,000 zone has attracted buyers, creating higher lows within the channel. Price is currently squeezed between the 50-EMA near $88,200 and the 100-EMA around $88,850, a compression that often precedes a directional move. Recent candlesticks show small bodies and spinning tops, reflecting balance rather than panic selling. Momentum indicators echo this pause, with RSI near 44 and showing early signs of bullish divergence. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Bitcoin Outlook: What Could Come Next From a pattern standpoint, the structure resembles a falling flag, a setup that often resolves higher if support holds. A brief dip toward $85,000 followed by a break above $90,500 would shift momentum back in favor of the bulls. Such a move could reopen the path toward $94,200, with $98,000 emerging as a stretch target if confidence rebuilds. For now, Bitcoin is consolidating rather than distributing. As long as $84,500 remains intact, the market looks more like it’s preparing for its next move than bracing for a deeper collapse. In phases like this, patience often pays, especially as sentiment resets and longer-term opportunities begin to take shape. PEPENODE: A Mine-to-Earn Meme Coin Nearing Presale Close PEPENODE is gaining momentum as a next-generation meme coin that blends viral culture with interactive gameplay. With over $2.38 mn raised and the presale approaching its cap, interest is building fast as the countdown enters its final stretch. What makes PEPENODE stand out is its mine-to-earn virtual ecosystem. Instead of passive holding, users can build digital server rooms using Miner Nodes and facilities, earning simulated rewards through a visual dashboard. The concept brings gamification and competition into the meme coin space, giving holders something to do before launch. The project also offers presale staking, allowing early participants to earn boosted rewards ahead of the token generation event.

56262835,648100,1766534416,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56262835.jpeg,Cardano Founder Explains Why Not Sell ADA For NIGHT,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-why-not-sell-ada-for-night/,"After the successful Midnight (NIGHT) token airdrop, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson is getting a familiar question from ADA holders: if NIGHT is the new token tied to Cardano’s privacy network, why not sell ADA and move across? In a Dec. 21 appearance on the Discover Crypto podcast, he argued the premise is flawed because Midnight is designed to extend ADA, not replace it. Why Not Sell Cardano For NIGHT “They’re complimentary. They do different things,” Hoskinson said . “Midnight is the ChatGPT of privacy . That’s its job. It’s a blockchain to blockchain infrastructure module. So, what Midnight does is it actually makes Cardano applications have privacy.” That distinction is central to his pitch: Midnight is positioned less as a liquidity siphon and more as an infrastructure module that gives Cardano-native apps a feature set they can use to differentiate in an increasingly crowded DeFi landscape. Hoskinson argued that early adopters are more likely to be Cardano applications precisely because they need a lever to compete for users, rather than larger incumbents elsewhere that tend to be slower-moving. “Which ones do you think are going to adopt privacy first? Uniswap and PancakeSwap and all these giant things that are slow moving and they’re very conservative because they have a lot of users of value flow,” he said. “No, it’ll be Cardano applications. Because they need to gain users and so this is how they leapfrog the competition.” From there, Hoskinson broadened the argument into a cross-chain liquidity thesis, leaning heavily on Bitcoin DeFi as a source of potential inflows. He described Bitcoin as relatively “agnostic” capital that will route to wherever yield, credit, and utility are most accessible, and claimed Cardano’s UTXO model makes it a more natural destination than account-based chains. “When you look at Bitcoin… it doesn’t care if it goes to Ethereum or Solana or Cardano or other places to get yield,” he said. “It’s going to go to the closest continent and the closest continent is Cardano because it’s a UTXO system and Bitcoin is UTXO system. So through Cardano DeFi in particular upgraded with Midnight suddenly Bitcoin’s going to get privacy preserving yield and credit.” He added that the same privacy-preserving yield concept could extend beyond Bitcoin. “And it’s the same for XRP and these other things,” Hoskinson said, arguing that Midnight’s privacy tooling is intended to “hybridize” on-chain and off-chain infrastructure rather than “steal TVL or steal luster from other systems.” In practical terms, Hoskinson also tied the ADA-versus-NIGHT decision to distribution and security. He emphasized that Cardano “launched Midnight,” framing it as evidence the ecosystem can execute large-scale initiatives while positioning ADA holders for preferential participation. “If you’re an ADA holder, you get first access to all of these things and you get the largest proportion of the airdrop,” he said. “And also, Cardano secures Midnight. So, that means ADA holders get NIGHT tokens .” How High Can ADA Go? Hoskinson was also pressed on Cardano price expectations. While he refrained to name any price targets, he used that moment to lay out what he described as a “value leakage” theory tied to Bitcoin’s institutional bid. He said Bitcoin is the only asset he feels comfortable forecasting with any confidence, arguing that large allocators are structurally “stuck” in Bitcoin exposure via ETFs and buy-and-hold mandates, which changes the old cycle mechanic where retail would rotate profits from BTC into alts. In that setup, he suggested the main route for capital to spill from Bitcoin into other ecosystems is not spot rotation, but Bitcoin DeFi yield: if Cardano can offer yield and credit inside a risk profile that institutional holders can tolerate, demand can “leak” outward from BTC without investors selling BTC outright. That is the basis for his view that chains embracing Bitcoin DeFi could move more in sync with Bitcoin, while others could remain decorrelated, even if Bitcoin continues higher. The broader message was less about discouraging trading behavior and more about presenting a structural rationale for staying exposed to ADA. In Hoskinson’s framing, Midnight is not meant to displace ADA; it is meant to expand the set of use cases Cardano applications can offer, while keeping ADA holders economically involved through security ties and token distribution. At press time, ADA traded at $0.36.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Charles Hoskinson|Midnight|NIGHT,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|TRADING|AIRDROP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-24 00:00:16

According to the exchange, most respondents in its ongoing prediction market believe XRP will close 2025 within a narrow trading range between $1.50 and $2.00. Gemini shared results from its XRP year-end pricing poll through a public post on X . The poll, which has been active since December 12, captures user forecasts for XRP’s closing price at the end of the calendar year. As participation increased, consensus around the $1.50–$2.00 range strengthened. Growing Confidence in a Narrow Price Range In its most recent update, Gemini reported that users initially assigned a 63% likelihood to XRP ending the year above $1.50 but not exceeding $2.00. As market conditions evolved, confidence in this outcome rose further. At the time of reporting, 73% of participants favored this price band, indicating a growing belief that XRP will remain range-bound through year-end. There's currently a 63% chance XRP ends the year between $1.50 and $2.00 pic.twitter.com/bCJ6fJuV6n — Gemini (@Gemini) December 22, 2025 At the same time, expectations for higher closing prices have diminished. Earlier in the polling period, 38% of respondents projected a finish between $2.00 and $2.50. That share has since declined to 28%, signaling reduced optimism for a late-year breakout. Predictions for more aggressive upside moves are even less common. Only a small fraction of users assigned probability to XRP closing between $2.50 and $3.00, and confidence in a finish above $3.00 remains minimal. Both scenarios currently carry estimated probabilities of roughly 4%. Limited Expectations for a Major Downside Move While the prevailing view favors stability, some participants anticipate further weakness. Gemini noted that a small portion of respondents expect XRP to end the year below $1.50. That figure has increased modestly, from 6% to 7%, following recent market-wide price pullbacks. Despite this, downside expectations remain limited compared to the dominant view that XRP will hold within its current range. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 How Gemini Will Determine Results Gemini also clarified how outcomes will be finalized once the prediction window closes. The poll is scheduled to resolve on December 31, 2025, at 09:00 a.m. (GMT +1). XRP’s final price will be determined using the GRR-KAIKO_XRPUSD_8UTC benchmark provided by Kaiko. For example, predictions tied to the $1.50–$2.00 range will be settled positively if XRP’s recorded price exceeds $1.50 and does not surpass $2.00 at the resolution time. The exchange stated that payouts will be issued no later than the following day. With roughly one week remaining in the year, XRP is trading at approximately $1.88. Since mid-December, its price has fluctuated between $1.80 and $2.00, reinforcing expectations that it may remain within that corridor through year-end. While this outlook contrasts sharply with XRP’s rally earlier in the year, when prices reached levels above $3.60 , it reflects prevailing caution amid broader market uncertainty. Nonetheless, some participants continue to anticipate improved conditions beyond year-end, citing potential institutional activity and regulatory developments as longer-term factors.

The law was set to start January 1st. Judge Robert Pitman granted an order stopping the Texas App Store Accountability Act (SB 2420) from taking effect. He wrote that the law is like requiring “every bookstore to verify the age of every customer at the door and, for minors, require parental consent before the child or teen could enter and again when they try to purchase a book.” Pitman hasn’t ruled yet on whether the law is actually legal. But by blocking it now, he’s saying the state probably won’t win this fight in court. First legal challenge sets stage for national debate This ruling matters because Texas was first in line with this type of law. Utah and Louisiana passed similar ones, and Congress is now looking at doing this nationwide. So what happens here could set the tone for what comes next everywhere else. So how the law would work? App stores like Apple and Google would have to check ages, then pass that information along to app developers. The goal is keeping kids away from apps they shouldn’t be using. Parent advocacy groups came up with this idea originally, though Meta and other big tech companies like Snap and X ended up lobbying for it too. The Computer & Communications Industry Association sued to stop the law. Their members include Apple, Google, and Meta. They claimed the law “imposes a broad censorship regime on the entire universe of mobile apps” and would make teens jump through hoops to access online content. Kids and their parents would have to give up personal data just to use apps. A student advocacy group filed their own lawsuit too. They argued the law violates the constitution by limiting what speech kids can see. Texas officials say the law is constitutional and should be allowed. The state can appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has overturned similar blocks on internet rules before. Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office hasn’t said yet whether they’ll appeal. Judge says law fails constitutional test Judge Pitman said the law has to pass the strictest First Amendment test. That means Texas must prove it’s “the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling state interest.” He found the state didn’t meet that bar. In fact, he said it wouldn’t even pass a lower standard because Texas hasn’t shown their methods actually connect to their goals. The judge acknowledged protecting kids online is important. But he added, “the means to achieve that end must be consistent with the First Amendment. However compelling the policy concerns, and however widespread the agreement that the issue must be addressed, the Court remains bound by the rule of law.” Apple really didn’t want this law to happen. CEO Tim Cook reportedly called Governor Greg Abbott himself to try talking him out of signing it. The company has previously faced antitrust scrutiny in various jurisdictions over its app store policies. Google opposed the Texas version too but recently supported California’s different approach, which collects less user data. A House Energy and Commerce subcommittee just advanced two bills that mix ideas from both the Texas and California versions. This push for a national law worried Apple enough that Cook met with committee leaders the day before they voted on the bills. With all these laws moving forward in different states and Congress, app store companies are starting to make their own changes. Apple rolled out new kids safety features this year, including letting parents share their children’s age ranges with app developers. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

RootstockLabs has announced a significant milestone: the Rootstock RIF token is now listed on Korbit, a leading South Korean cryptocurrency exchange. This strategic move opens new doors for accessibility and marks a focused push into the vibrant East Asian market. For investors and crypto enthusiasts, this listing comes packed with commemorative events, including airdrops and trading competitions, making it a pivotal moment for the ecosystem. What Does the Rootstock RIF Korbit Listing Mean for Investors? This listing is more than just another token on an exchange. It represents a bridge between Bitcoin’s foundational security and South Korea’s dynamic crypto economy. Korbit’s users now have direct access to Rootstock RIF , the native token powering the Rootstock network—a Bitcoin Layer 2 solution. This integration simplifies the process for users to engage with Bitcoin-based decentralized finance (DeFi), which has traditionally required more technical steps. Therefore, it significantly lowers the barrier to entry. How Can You Participate in the Korbit RIF Airdrop Events? To celebrate the listing, Korbit is hosting several engaging events with substantial Rootstock RIF rewards. Participation is straightforward but requires specific actions. Here are the key opportunities: Bank Link Airdrop: Users who link a Shinhan Bank account and agree to receive marketing materials are eligible. Quiz Winners: The first 2,500 participants to correctly complete a quiz will receive tiered RIF rewards. Deposit & Trade Bonus: The first 300 users who deposit over 900 RIF and complete a trade will each get 667 RIF. Trading Competition: A weekly contest will distribute 700,000 RIF among the top 100 traders by cumulative volume. These initiatives are designed to boost initial liquidity and user engagement on the platform. Why is Rootstock Targeting East Asia for Institutional Growth? The listing is part of a broader, strategic vision. RootstockLabs has clearly stated that its business focus for the coming year will center on institutional collaboration in East Asia, specifically naming South Korea and Japan. The company operates a Bitcoin collateral vault, a core DeFi primitive. Their goal is to attract South Korean institutional clients interested in depositing Bitcoin or U.S. dollars into this vault to be used as collateral for various financial operations.

The widely watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index has held steady at a reading of 24, firmly in the ‘extreme fear’ zone. This persistent sentiment reading offers a crucial, data-driven snapshot of investor psychology. For anyone involved in crypto, understanding this index is not just academic—it’s a vital tool for navigating turbulent markets. Let’s break down what this prolonged period of extreme fear means and how you can interpret it for your investment decisions. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us Right Now? A score of 24 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a clear signal. The market is experiencing intense pessimism. This index, compiled by Alternative.me, acts as a sentiment thermometer. It ranges from 0 (maximum fear) to 100 (maximum greed). The current stagnation at 24 suggests a market paralyzed by uncertainty, where selling pressure and negative news are outweighing any bullish optimism. This isn’t a fleeting moment of panic; it’s a sustained state of caution that colors every trade and headline. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? This sentiment score isn’t a guess. It’s a composite index built from several market data points. Knowing its components helps you see beyond the single number. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index formula includes: Volatility (25%): Sharp price swings, especially downward, increase fear. Market Volume (25%): High volume during downturns signals panic selling. Social Media (15%): The tone and volume of conversations on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Polls of market participant sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): A rising BTC dominance often signals a ‘flight to safety’ from altcoins. Google Trends (10%): Search volume for terms like ‘Bitcoin crash’. Therefore, the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading reflects a confluence of negative data across all these fronts. Should You Be Afraid When the Index Shows Extreme Fear? This is the critical question for investors. While extreme fear feels alarming, historically, it has often presented contrarian opportunities. The core principle behind the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is that excessive fear can lead to undervalued assets, while extreme greed can signal a market top. However, this is not a simple buy signal. You must consider: Your Risk Tolerance: Can you handle further potential downside? Investment Horizon: Are you trading short-term or investing for years? Market Context: What macro-economic factors are driving the fear? Blindly buying during extreme fear is risky, but completely ignoring the signal may mean missing a long-term entry point. The key is disciplined strategy, not emotion. Actionable Insights in a Fear-Driven Market So, what should you actually do when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is this low? First, avoid making panic-driven decisions. Use this time for research and portfolio review. Consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to build positions gradually, reducing the impact of volatility. Secondly, reassess your portfolio’s fundamentals. Are the projects you hold still solid, or was your investment based on hype? Finally, use tools like this index to plan, not to react. Set your entry and exit points based on logic before sentiment overwhelms you. Conclusion: Navigating the Sentiment Storm The Crypto Fear & Greed Index stuck at 24 is a powerful reminder that markets are driven by human emotion as much as by code and technology. While it signals a challenging environment, it also provides a structured way to gauge the market’s mood. By understanding its components and historical context, you can transform fear from a paralyzing force into a strategic data point. Remember, the most successful investors often demonstrate courage when others are fearful, but they do so with careful planning and a clear mind. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable predictor of price? A: It is a reliable indicator of current sentiment, not a direct price predictor. It shows investor emotion, which can influence but does not guarantee future price movement. Q: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A: The index is updated daily, providing a near real-time pulse on market sentiment. Q: Should I only look at the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for Bitcoin? A: While it is heavily influenced by Bitcoin, it reflects overall cryptocurrency market sentiment, as Bitcoin’s movements typically dictate the trend for altcoins. Q: Has the index ever been wrong? A: Sentiment can remain ‘extreme’ for extended periods during prolonged bear markets. The index signals opportunity zones but does not time the exact market bottom. Q: Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index score? A: You can view the live index on its official website, Alternative.me, or on many major cryptocurrency data platforms. Q: Can I use this index for day trading? A> It is more valuable for medium to long-term strategic decisions than for short-term day trading, as sentiment shifts can be slow.

This historic spot gold all-time high signals a powerful shift in global markets, capturing the attention of investors worldwide. For those accustomed to the volatility of cryptocurrencies, this gold rally offers a fascinating contrast in safe-haven asset behavior. Let’s delve into what’s driving this unprecedented move and explore its potential implications. What’s Fueling the Historic Spot Gold Rally? The journey to this spot gold all-time high is not a random event. Several powerful economic forces have converged to create the perfect storm for gold’s ascent. Understanding these drivers is crucial for any investor looking to navigate the current financial landscape. Firstly, persistent global inflation concerns have eroded confidence in fiat currencies. Investors are turning to gold, a classic store of value, to protect their wealth. Secondly, geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty have increased the demand for safe-haven assets. When stocks and digital assets wobble, gold often shines brightest. Why Does This All-Time High Matter for Your Portfolio? Reaching a new spot gold all-time high is more than just a headline; it’s a critical market signal. This milestone confirms gold’s enduring role in a diversified investment strategy. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, it highlights the importance of balancing a high-growth, digital portfolio with tangible, time-tested assets. Consider these key takeaways for your investment approach: Diversification is Key: Gold’s inverse relationship with riskier assets can provide crucial portfolio stability. Inflation Hedge: Gold has historically preserved purchasing power during periods of currency devaluation. Market Sentiment Indicator: A strong gold price often reflects broader investor caution and a search for safety. Spot Gold vs. Digital Gold: A New Dynamic? This record-breaking price for physical spot gold invites an interesting comparison with Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold.’ While both are seen as hedges against traditional finance, their recent performances can tell different stories. The surge in physical gold underscores a flight to a proven, tangible asset during uncertainty. However, this doesn’t diminish crypto’s potential. Instead, it emphasizes a strategic viewpoint: a modern portfolio might benefit from holding both. Physical gold offers millennia of history as a value reserve, while digital assets represent technological innovation and future potential. The new spot gold all-time high reminds us that both can play vital, complementary roles. Actionable Insights: What Should Investors Do Now? Witnessing a historic spot gold all-time high can trigger a fear of missing out (FOMO). However, a disciplined strategy is better than a reactive one. Here is a simple framework to consider. First, assess your current asset allocation. Is your portfolio overly exposed to one type of risk? Second, consider dollar-cost averaging into gold ETFs or physical bullion to gain exposure without timing the market. Finally, use this event as a learning moment about macroeconomic trends and how different asset classes, from crypto to commodities, interact. Conclusion: A Golden Moment in Market History The breach of $4,500 for spot gold is a landmark event that reinforces the metal’s timeless appeal. This spot gold all-time high is a powerful testament to its role as a financial sanctuary during turbulent times. For the astute investor, it serves as both a validation of gold’s core principles and a prompt to review and balance their entire investment strategy for the road ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does ‘spot gold’ price mean? The spot price is the current market price at which gold can be bought or sold for immediate delivery and payment, as opposed to futures contracts for delivery later. What usually happens after gold hits an all-time high? While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, a new high can attract more investment, but it may also lead to short-term profit-taking and volatility. The long-term trend depends on the underlying economic drivers. Is it too late to invest in gold after this rally? Market timing is extremely difficult. Many investors use gold as a long-term hedge, not a short-term trade. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your goals is always recommended. How can I easily invest in spot gold? Average investors typically gain exposure through Gold Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) that track the price, shares in gold mining companies, or by purchasing physical bullion from reputable dealers. Does a strong gold price mean a weak stock market? Not necessarily, but it often indicates rising risk aversion. Gold and stocks can rise together in certain environments, like during expansive monetary policy, but they frequently have an inverse correlation during crises.

This action highlights the persistent dangers lurking in the unregulated corners of the crypto market and serves as a stark warning for investors. What is the SEC Pyramid Scheme Case About? The SEC alleges that the groups operated a multi-level marketing fraud, posing as financial experts to lure victims. They promised outsized profits from artificial intelligence-based investments, directing people to trade on fraudulent platforms. The charged entities include Morocoin Tech Corp., Berge Blockchain Technology Co. Ltd, Cirkor Inc., and investment clubs AI Wealth Inc, Lane Wealth Inc., AI Investment Education Foundation Ltd, and Zenith Asset Tech Foundation. How Did This Crypto Fraud Operate? The scheme relied on a classic playbook with a modern, tech-savvy twist. Promoters used the allure of AI and cryptocurrency to create an air of sophistication and inevitability. Here is how they allegedly executed the plan: False Expertise: The groups presented themselves as seasoned financial and technology experts. AI Hype: They dangled the promise of proprietary AI algorithms that could guarantee trading profits. Fake Exchanges: Victims were funneled to the three charged exchanges, which were likely controlled by the fraudsters. Pyramid Structure: The scheme likely encouraged existing members to recruit new investors, with payouts based on recruitment rather than real investment success. This combination of buzzwords and complex technology made the SEC pyramid scheme appear legitimate to unsuspecting investors. Why is the SEC’s Action So Significant? This case is more than just a large fraud bust. It represents a clear signal from regulators. The SEC is actively policing the crypto space for traditional financial crimes like pyramid and Ponzi schemes, regardless of the technological wrapper. For the crypto industry, such enforcement is a double-edged sword. While it protects consumers, it also underscores the regulatory scrutiny that all platforms now face. The charges demonstrate that the SEC will pursue not just the primary architects but also the supporting infrastructure, like the exchanges that facilitated the fraud. How Can You Avoid Crypto Investment Scams? The shocking details of this SEC pyramid scheme charge are a powerful reminder to practice vigilance. Here are actionable steps to protect your capital: Verify Everything: Check if an exchange is properly registered. Be deeply skeptical of “guaranteed” returns, especially those tied to AI or secret strategies. Understand the Product: If you cannot clearly explain how an investment makes money, it is a major red flag. Beware of Recruitment Pressure: Legitimate investments do not require you to recruit friends and family to turn a profit. Consult Independent Sources: Do not rely solely on information provided by the promotion. Seek out independent reviews and news. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto? This enforcement action will likely accelerate two trends. First, increased due diligence by investors who are now more aware of schemes disguised as innovation. Second, continued and possibly intensified regulatory actions from the SEC and other bodies worldwide. The era of the “wild west” in crypto is closing, and platforms operating in gray areas will face significant legal risks. In conclusion, the SEC’s decisive move to charge these entities in a $14 million pyramid scheme is a crucial development. It dismantles a harmful fraud, educates the public on modern scam tactics, and reinforces the message that regulatory oversight in cryptocurrency is real and active. While innovation should thrive, it must do so on a foundation of transparency and legality, not deception. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Which companies did the SEC charge in this pyramid scheme? A1: The SEC charged three cryptocurrency exchanges—Morocoin Tech Corp., Berge Blockchain Technology Co. Ltd, and Cirkor Inc.—and four investment clubs: AI Wealth Inc, Lane Wealth Inc., AI Investment Education Foundation Ltd, and Zenith Asset Tech Foundation. Q2: How much money did investors lose in this scheme? A2: According to the SEC’s investigation, the alleged pyramid scheme defrauded investors of a total of $14 million. Q3: What was the main promise used to lure victims? A3: The groups allegedly posed as financial experts and promised profits from artificial intelligence (AI)-based investments, directing people to trade on their fraudulent cryptocurrency exchanges. Q4: Is this a common type of fraud in cryptocurrency? A4: Yes, pyramid and Ponzi schemes that use the hype around new technologies like AI and crypto are unfortunately common. They exploit a lack of understanding and the promise of high, quick returns. Q5: What should I do if I think I’ve been targeted by a similar scam? A5: You should immediately stop any further investments, gather all documentation (emails, transaction records, promises made), and report it to the SEC’s whistleblower program or the relevant financial authority in your country. Q6: Does this mean all AI-related crypto projects are scams? A6: No, not at all. Many legitimate projects utilize AI. However, this case highlights that scammers frequently misuse popular buzzwords like “AI” to appear credible. Always conduct thorough, independent research.

Large altcoins slow down. Liquidity seeks the following place to expand. During such times, there are projects, which begin to slowly crawl before they can even be known to the rest of the market. Such a trend has already established itself around a single fresh DeFi crypto that has already risen over 250% when some of the most popular altcoins are performing flat or poorly. The large holder’s early positioning is attracting more attention with allocation currently standing at more than 99%. A Yield and Risk Control Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a developing crypto DeFi, which is based on lending and borrowing. Fundamentally, the protocol enables the users to provide assets and obtain yield, and borrowers to obtain liquidity by placing collatorals. On the P2C side consumers inject funds into pools and gain APY according to actual borrowing demand. To illustrate this, a reliable supplier of assets can issue yield, which will change with usage, rather than speculation. Borrowers on the P2P side are presented directly with terms of lending. The lending to value ratios are set in advance. There are liquidation cutoffs. In the case where the borrower has surpassed the stipulated LTV, collateral may be sold to secure the lenders. These mechanics are used to take away the unexpected shocks, and preserve stability of the system. Exposure to presale activity has also contributed significantly to the initial development in tandem with the protocol design. The token has done so by increasing the phases in a structured way and has increased by about 250% since its entry level was significantly low. Demand has not been frenzied but steady which is usually an indicator of buildup and not of short term speculation. The Next Transition Point, V1 Launch and Security It is no wonder analysts are keeping a close eye on MUTM, and timing of this case is one of the reasons. The protocol is currently looking to undergo its V1 release that will bring it out of the development stage to active use. Most DeFi crypto projects traditionally start to reprice as soon as the users are able to borrow, lend, and interoperate on chain. Another big concern has been security. Mutuum Finance has completed a CertiK token scan with excellent rating and full Halborn security review is underway. Another level of protection is included by a bug bounty program. Such measures are important since the lending procedures pertain to direct use of user funds. Serious capital usually holds down its investments until it has the green flag. According to this arrangement, there can be a conservative price model in which some analysts suggest that MUTM may experience a 3x move on its current price once the first step to V1 adoption takes place. This perception is linked to increase in usage, and not market hype. mtTokens and Oracle Infrastructure The major characteristic of this protocol is the mtTokens. Upon the supply of assets, the users are given the mtTokens that reflect their voting power in the pools. These tokens increase in value when borrowers pay interests. This establishes the reason to hold other than trade short term. The other factor is the buy and distribute model. Protocol revenue is partially spent on purchasing MUTM tokens at the open market and allocating them to the holders of the mtTokens. This forms continuous pressure of buying which is directly related to use. The role of oracles is also here. There is a need for accurate price feeds to handle LTV ratios and liquidations. Quality oracle data assists in safeguarding the system and has the lending activity foreseeable. In these mechanics put together, analysts describe a more positive picture in which long-term protocol usage would help justify a 5x-7x long-term growth. In this model, there is an assumption that there is a smooth increase in demand for borrowing, but not abrupt increases. Why MUTM is compared to Early Aave Other observers liken Mutuum Finance to the early Aave, not in scale, but in form and in time. Aave succeeded through prioritizing loans before rolling out functions subsequently. It focused on definite regulations, stable interests paying, and excellent security before the mass media coverage came into play. The same applies to Mutuum Finance. It is in its infancy stage. There are reduced liquidity requirements. Price elasticity is in large measure. Meanwhile, the protocol is constructed with actual DeFi use as opposed to narrative hype. This is what has made MUTM to be referred to as a fresh crypto with asymmetric upside. It does not need huge inflows to transfer. It is also not reliant on social trends to operate. Allocation thumbs 99% and bigger holders move in is still being shifted into as attention shifts. Although most leading altcoins have a hard time getting a fresh wave, this crypto DeFi is at the point in which the structure, usage, and timing are starting to cooperate.

After failing to sustain momentum above key psychological and technical levels, market sentiment has shifted toward caution, with investors closely monitoring liquidity behavior and exchange flows for early signals of regime change. Related Reading: The Gold-to-Bitcoin Rotation Narrative Gains Strength: A Data-Driven Review Recent analysis from Arab Chain, based on CryptoQuant’s Exchange Inflow Value (7-day cumulative) metric, highlights a notable divergence in liquidity patterns between major exchanges. The data aggregates Bitcoin and Ethereum inflows, providing a broader view of risk positioning across the two largest crypto assets. On November 24, when Bitcoin was trading around $88,438, Coinbase recorded seven-day cumulative inflows totaling approximately $21.0 billion. In contrast, Binance saw lower, though still significant, inflows near $15.3 billion. What stands out is that these elevated inflows occurred while prices were already well below prior highs. Rather than signaling aggressive accumulation, the data points to increased exchange activity consistent with portfolio rebalancing, hedging, or preparation for potential distribution. Exchange Inflows Signal Liquidity Tightening Despite Stable Bitcoin Prices By December 21, Bitcoin was trading near $88,635. Only marginally higher than late-November levels and still locked within a narrow consolidation range. While price action showed little progress, exchange flow data pointed to a notable shift in market conditions. Updated on-chain figures indicate that liquidity entering major trading venues declined sharply over the span of just a few weeks, underscoring a cooling in overall market activity. Coinbase, often used as a proxy for institutional and US-based flows, saw seven-day cumulative inflows fall to roughly $7.8 billion. That represents a steep drop of more than 60% compared with inflow levels observed in late November. Binance also experienced a contraction, but the decline was materially less severe, with inflows totaling about $10.3 billion over the same period. As a result, Binance surpassed Coinbase in net inflows during December, reversing the earlier dynamic. This divergence suggests that while broad liquidity has tightened, trading activity has become more concentrated on venues associated with shorter-term positioning and active risk management. At the same time, the absence of a significant price reaction highlights how Bitcoin has continued to trade sideways even as fresh capital flows slowed. Taken together, the data points to a market operating with reduced turnover and lower urgency on both the buy and sell side. Bitcoin’s ability to remain range-bound amid shrinking inflows reflects a quieter, more constrained liquidity environment compared with conditions seen just one month earlier.

The structure now reflects a clear shift in short-term trend dynamics, with price firmly below its major daily moving averages. Notably, Bitcoin has lost the 111-day and 200-day simple moving averages. Both of which have started to roll over and act as dynamic resistance rather than support. The rejection from the $110,000–$115,000 zone marked a decisive lower high, followed by an impulsive sell-off toward the mid-$80,000 range. Since then, price action has compressed into a narrow consolidation, suggesting temporary stabilization rather than a confirmed reversal. However, the inability to reclaim the declining moving averages indicates that upside attempts remain fragile. Related Reading: Ethereum Traders Chase Upside With Historic Leverage – Breakout Fuel Or Fragile Setup? Volume behavior adds to the cautious outlook. Selling pressure expanded during the initial breakdown, while subsequent rebounds have occurred on muted volume, signaling limited conviction from buyers. This imbalance suggests that dip-buying demand is present but not strong enough to force a trend shift. From a technical perspective, the $85,000–$88,000 area has become a critical near-term support zone. A sustained hold could allow for range formation. Failure to defend this level would increase the risk of a deeper retracement. For sentiment to improve, Bitcoin would need to reclaim the $95,000–$100,000 region and stabilize above its key daily averages.

Have you felt a subtle shift in the crypto winds? The latest data reveals a crucial signal: the Altcoin Season Index has climbed two points to 18. This movement, while seemingly small, often acts as an early whisper of changing market tides. For investors tracking the eternal dance between Bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies, this index serves as a vital compass. Let’s decode what this rise truly means for your portfolio. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? Before we dive into the implications of the recent increase, it’s essential to understand the tool itself. CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index is a specialized metric designed to measure market sentiment and capital flow. It performs a simple yet powerful comparison: it tracks the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped assets) against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. The mechanism is straightforward. The index declares a full-blown “ altcoin season ” when 75% of these top coins outperform Bitcoin. A score of 100 represents this peak. Conversely, a low score indicates a “Bitcoin season,” where the pioneer cryptocurrency dominates the gains. Therefore, the current reading of 18 suggests the market is still firmly in Bitcoin’s grip, but the two-point rise hints at nascent stirrings elsewhere. Why Does a Rising Altcoin Season Index Matter? A moving index is more than just a number; it’s a narrative of investor behavior. The recent uptick to 18, though far from the altcoin season threshold, is significant for several reasons. Early Signal: Major market rotations rarely happen overnight. Small, consistent increases in this index can foreshadow a broader trend where capital begins to trickle from Bitcoin into altcoins. Sentiment Gauge: It reflects growing investor confidence in projects beyond Bitcoin. When the index rises, it often means traders are starting to hunt for higher returns in the altcoin space. Portfolio Strategy: For the savvy investor, monitoring this index helps in timing portfolio rebalancing, potentially shifting weight from BTC to select altcoins as the trend develops. However, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. An index at 18 is a far cry from 75. This indicates we are in the very early, speculative stages of any potential shift. Navigating the Current Market: Bitcoin Season vs. Altcoin Hope So, are we still in a Bitcoin season? Absolutely. The low score confirms that Bitcoin continues to command the lion’s share of market strength and investor attention. This dominance is often driven by macroeconomic factors, institutional adoption, and its status as a digital gold. Yet, the two-point rise in the Altcoin Season Index injects a dose of intrigue. It asks a compelling question: Is this the calm before the storm, or merely a false dawn? History shows that altcoin seasons are often preceded by such tentative index movements. They can explode after Bitcoin’s price stabilizes following a major rally, as investors seek amplified gains. Therefore, the current landscape presents a dual reality: a present dominated by Bitcoin and a future pregnant with possibility for altcoins. The key is to watch for consistency. Will the index continue to climb in the coming weeks, or will it fall back? Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors What should you do with this information? Panic buying altcoins is not the answer. Instead, adopt a strategic and measured approach. Monitor, Don’t Chase: Use the Altcoin Season Index as a weekly monitoring tool, not a daily trading signal. Look for sustained upward trends over weeks. Research Fundamentals: If a rotation begins, not all altcoins will rise equally. Focus on projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear utility. Manage Risk: Any shift into altcoins should be gradual. Consider them a higher-risk, higher-reward portion of your portfolio and size your positions accordingly. Watch Bitcoin: Remember, Bitcoin remains the market anchor. Significant BTC price drops usually drag down the entire market, regardless of the index reading. The Bottom Line: A Signal Worth Watching The rise of the Altcoin Season Index to 18 is a noteworthy development in the crypto ecosystem. It is not a siren call for an immediate altcoin boom, but rather a flicker on the radar—a hint that patient capital may be starting to evaluate opportunities beyond Bitcoin. For informed investors, this is a time for heightened research and preparation, not impulsive action. The index provides a valuable framework for understanding market cycles, reminding us that crypto markets are perpetually in flux, rotating between dominance and diversification. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a good Altcoin Season Index score to start buying altcoins? There’s no magic number. A sustained rise above 25-30 can indicate strengthening momentum, but always combine this with fundamental research on individual projects. Never invest based on a single metric. Q2: Does a rising index guarantee altcoin profits? No. The index measures past performance relative to Bitcoin. It indicates a trend, not a guarantee of future profits. Altcoins remain highly volatile and risky assets. Q3: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? The index is typically updated daily, tracking the rolling 90-day performance of the top 100 coins against Bitcoin. Q4: Can we have a “Bitcoin and Altcoin season” at the same time? Technically, the index defines the seasons as mutually exclusive. However, in broad market bull runs, both Bitcoin and major altcoins can appreciate, with altcoins simply outperforming on a relative basis. Q5: Where can I check the current Altcoin Season Index? The index is publicly available on CoinMarketCap’s website under their market analysis or research tools section. Share This Insight!

56264823,648071,1766538015,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,"Ethereum Pulls Back on ETF Outflows, but Corporate Treasuries Continue to Add Exposure",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-pulls-back-on-etf-outflows-but-corporate/,"Ethereum’s (ETH) market structure is showing a clear split between financial products and direct balance-sheet accumulation. While U.S.-listed Ethereum ETFs have struggled to attract consistent inflows in recent sessions, corporate treasuries are quietly increasing their exposure, creating a mixed signal for investors heading into the final days of 2025. Recent ETF data highlights this contrast. According to flow trackers, several Ethereum ETFs recorded flat or negative flows, including a session where BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF posted zero net inflows. ETF Demand Softens as Ethereum Trades Near Key Levels Ethereum has momentarily held above the $3,000 psychological level despite the ETF withdrawals, signaling that selling pressure has not translated into a broad market breakdown. The Ethereum Price action has remained range-bound, with resistance forming above recent highs and buyers continuing to defend lower support zones. Analysts note that ETF flows have historically amplified short-term momentum, but their absence often leads to consolidation rather than sharp declines. The uneven ETF activity also reflects market concentration. While some Ethereum funds briefly recorded inflows earlier in the week, most products showed little to no activity. This points to selective positioning rather than a coordinated institutional exit, even as risk appetite remains muted across crypto markets. Corporate Accumulation Offsets Ethereum ETF Weakness In contrast to the hesitation among ETF investors, corporate buyers have continued to accumulate Ethereum directly. Bitmine Immersion Technologies , now the largest known corporate holder of ETH, has surpassed 4 million ETH in total holdings, representing more than 3% of the circulating supply. The firm added nearly 100,000 ETH in a single week, buying into recent price weakness at an average cost of around $3,000. This steady accumulation highlights a longer-term thesis centered on Ethereum’s role in staking, tokenization, and blockchain-based financial infrastructure. Unlike ETF flows, which are often driven by short-term sentiment and portfolio rebalancing, corporate treasury strategies tend to reflect multi-year positioning. A Market Divided Between Caution and Conviction The divergence between ETF flows and direct corporate accumulation underscores a market in transition. Financial products tied to Ethereum appear sensitive to macro conditions and regulatory clarity, while some firms are using price pullbacks to build strategic exposure. As 2026 approaches, Ethereum’s price may continue to reflect this balance, limited upside without renewed ETF demand, but firm underlying support from long-term holders willing to accumulate outside traditional investment vehicles.

In the fresh move, ED carried out coordinated searches across three states. These raids were linked to a case involving fake investment platforms that allegedly duped investors in India and overseas. The Enforcement Directorate reportedly raided 21 residential and office locations across Karnataka, Maharashtra and New Delhi. This was part of a money laundering investigation. The searches were conducted under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The case was registered against 4th Bloc Consultants and several other individuals. ED finds web of crypto wallets According to the ED, the probe comes out of an FIR and intelligence inputs shared by the Karnataka state police. The authorities have described it as an organised and multi-year financial fraud operation. The accused allegedly ran a network of fake crypto investment platforms that closely looked like actual trading websites. The platforms under investigation used to promise unusually high returns. However, they targeted both Indian residents and foreign nationals. The scammers lure them with claims of quick and regular profits through digital assets. Investigators highlighted that the operators used photographs of well-known personalities and so-called crypto experts without permission to build credibility. The report added that several early investors were paid small returns to establish trust before larger sums were asked for. These tactics mirror classic multi-level marketing and pig-butchering scams. The ED said the group relied heavily on social media platforms to promote the schemes. This includes Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Telegram. However, referral bonuses were offered to expand the investor base. This takes a dark turn as funds were allegedly routed through a web of crypto wallets, shell companies and foreign bank accounts. Crypto scams traced back to 2015 Officials have marked that the proceeds of crime were moved using peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto transfers. The scammers also used hawala channels before converting them into cash or parking them in bank accounts. It added that some funds were also used directly for crypto transactions. Authorities also traced movable and immovable assets in India and abroad. These assets were allegedly acquired using the funds gathered from fraud. The ED had stated that the syndicate had been operating since at least 2015. No arrests have been announced so far. In a public advisory, the agency issued a warning for investors against engaging with several websites suspected to be part of the scam network. This includes goldbooker.com, cryptobrite.com, hawkchain.com, cubigains.com, bitminerclub.com and others. It has urged immediate cessation of any related activity. Meanwhile, digital assets are not legal tender in the country. The global crypto is dealing with high selling pressure.

Anthony Pompliano, a prominent voice in crypto investing, presents a compelling counter-narrative. He suggests that this current stability might be the very factor that prevents a devastating Bitcoin price crash in early 2026. This perspective challenges the common fear that flat periods signal impending doom, offering a fresh lens for long-term holders. Could Lower Volatility Actually Prevent a Bitcoin Price Crash? In a recent CNBC interview, Pompliano, founder of Pomp Investments, made a striking observation. He directly linked Bitcoin’s recent subdued price action to a reduced risk of a severe downturn. Historically, parabolic rallies have often been followed by brutal corrections. However, the current environment appears different. Pompliano argues that with Bitcoin price volatility at lower levels, the conditions for a catastrophic 70-80% drop are simply not present. This maturation of the market acts as a natural buffer. Think of it this way: a market that climbs slowly on a steady path is less likely to plunge off a cliff than one that rockets up a sheer mountain face. The reduced speculative frenzy means fewer weak hands are in the game, creating a more solid foundation. Therefore, while the excitement of massive green candles might be missing, the trade-off is significant stability. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Long-Term Performance? It’s easy for investors to feel disappointed when short-term expectations aren’t met. Pompliano urges a shift in focus to the bigger picture. He highlights Bitcoin’s undeniable long-term track record: The asset has gained 100% over the past two years . It has soared an impressive 300% over the past three years . These figures underscore a crucial point: Bitcoin’s value proposition is not defined by quarterly performance, but by its multi-year growth trajectory. The potential absence of a sharp Bitcoin price crash in 2026 would further validate this journey toward becoming a less volatile, more institutional-grade asset. How Should Investors Navigate This New Phase? This analysis provides actionable insight for anyone holding BTC. The traditional cycle of “boom and bust” may be softening. For investors, this evolving dynamic suggests a few key strategies: Reassess Risk: The probability of a historic, portfolio-wrecking crash may be lower than in previous cycles. Embrace Patience: Extraordinary bull run returns may moderate, but so might the depths of the bears. Focus on Fundamentals: Network security, adoption trends, and macroeconomic factors become even more critical indicators than daily price swings. In essence, Bitcoin is potentially transitioning from a high-octane speculative asset to a more resilient store of value. This doesn’t eliminate risk, but it does reshape it. Conclusion: Stability Over Speculation Anthony Pompliano’s take reframes market sentiment. A muted year-end is not a failure, but a potential sign of strength and maturity. The fear of a major Bitcoin price crash in early 2026 is mitigated by the very lack of euphoria that some investors lament. This creates a more sustainable path forward, favoring those with long-term conviction over short-term speculators. The journey of Bitcoin continues to be revolutionary, but its path may be becoming less treacherous. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does Pompliano’s analysis mean Bitcoin won’t drop at all in 2026? A: No. He suggests a sharp, catastrophic crash (like 70-80%) is unlikely, but regular market corrections and volatility are still expected. Q: Why does lower volatility prevent a major Bitcoin price crash? A: Extreme crashes often follow periods of extreme, unsustainable speculation and leverage. Lower volatility typically indicates a market with stronger hands and less reckless buying, creating a sturdier price floor. Q: Should I change my investment strategy based on this? A: It reinforces a long-term, disciplined strategy like dollar-cost averaging (DCA). It suggests panic selling during normal downturns may be less justified, but always do your own research. Q: Has Bitcoin’s volatility decreased permanently? A> While the overall trend is toward lower volatility as the market matures and institutional participation grows, Bitcoin will likely remain more volatile than traditional assets like stocks for the foreseeable future. Q: What are the biggest risks to Bitcoin if not a price crash? A> Key risks include regulatory crackdowns in major economies, critical technological flaws, severe global macroeconomic crises, or the rise of a superior competing technology.

Originally slated for release this month, the launch is now pushed to March 2026. This decision stems from a fundamental strategic shift: AMO Labs is pivoting from general electric vehicle data collection to focus exclusively on Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) system. For holders of AMO Coin and observers of the crypto-mobility intersection, this announcement raises crucial questions about strategy, timing, and future value. Why is AMO Labs delaying the D2E 2.0 launch? The core reason is a complete revision of the company’s business strategy. AMO Labs stated it must align with rapidly changing global mobility trends. Initially, the platform aimed to gather data from a broad range of electric vehicles, including brands like BYD. However, the company now believes the most valuable, high-fidelity data comes from Tesla’s advanced FSD system. This pivot isn’t a simple adjustment; it requires building a more advanced and complete technological infrastructure from the ground up, making the previous launch schedule impossible. What does focusing on Tesla FSD mean for AMO Coin? This strategic shift carries significant implications for the AMO Coin ecosystem. By concentrating on Tesla FSD, AMO Labs is betting on quality over quantity. Tesla’s system represents one of the most sophisticated and widely deployed autonomous driving suites globally. Therefore, data from these vehicles is potentially more valuable for training AI models and creating mobility-related blockchain services. This focus could position AMO Coin as a specialized token within a high-growth niche, but it also introduces new dependencies and challenges. Potential Benefit: Access to superior, real-world autonomous driving data. Key Challenge: Reliance on a single manufacturer’s ecosystem and technology stack. Long-term Vision: Creating a premium data marketplace for AI and mobility developers. How will this delay impact the crypto mobility sector? The delay of AMO Labs’ D2E 2.0 platform sends a clear signal about the maturation of blockchain applications in real-world sectors. It highlights that integrating complex, physical-world systems like autonomous vehicles with blockchain requires more time and specialized focus than initially anticipated. This move may encourage other projects in the space to prioritize depth and data quality over speed to market. For investors, it underscores the importance of due diligence on a project’s underlying technology partnerships and its adaptability to market shifts. What are the actionable insights for crypto investors? For anyone following AMO Coin or similar tokens, this development offers several lessons. First, it demonstrates that serious blockchain projects in sectors like mobility must be flexible and respond to technological advancements. The pivot to Tesla FSD shows strategic agility. Second, long delays, while frustrating, can sometimes indicate a commitment to building a robust product rather than releasing a subpar one. Investors should monitor AMO Labs’ progress in building its new Tesla-focused system and any new partnerships that emerge from this strategic shift. In conclusion, AMO Labs’ decision to delay D2E 2.0 until 2026 is a bold strategic gamble. By shifting focus entirely to Tesla’s FSD data, the company is aiming for a higher-value, more specialized position in the crypto-mobility landscape. While the wait is extended, the potential payoff involves creating a unique data asset on the blockchain. The success of this pivot will ultimately depend on AMO Labs’ execution and the evolving landscape of autonomous vehicle technology. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: When is the new launch date for AMO Labs’ D2E 2.0 platform? A: The launch has been rescheduled for March 2026. Q: Why did AMO Labs change its focus to Tesla FSD? A: The company revised its strategy to align with global mobility trends, believing Tesla’s FSD system provides more advanced and valuable data for its blockchain platform. Q: What was the original focus of the D2E 2.0 platform? A: It was initially designed to collect and utilize data from a broad range of electric vehicles, including manufacturers like BYD. Q: How might this affect the value of AMO Coin? A: The long-term impact is unclear. The focus on a premium data source (Tesla FSD) could increase the platform’s potential value, but the long delay may test investor patience in the short term. Q: Is AMO Labs partnering with Tesla? A: The announcement describes a focus on Tesla’s FSD data but does not specify a formal partnership with Tesla, Inc.

The Heybit shutdown is scheduled for January 30, 2026, marking the end of its operations worldwide. This decision comes two years after the company exited the challenging South Korean market, signaling persistent difficulties in the evolving crypto landscape. Why is the Heybit Shutdown Happening? Heybit Global made the official announcement on December 23. The company stated that concluding its operations was a necessary step. They cited significant changes in both the business environment and the global regulatory framework as the primary reasons. Essentially, it became too difficult to continue running the service sustainably under the new conditions. The precise time for the Heybit shutdown is 9:00 a.m. UTC on the specified date. This gives users a clear, two-year window to manage their assets and transition to other platforms. The extended notice period is crucial for user security and fund safety. What Does This Mean for Current Heybit Users? If you have assets on Heybit, you must take action before the deadline. The platform is not closing immediately, but planning your exit strategy is essential. Here are the key steps every user should follow: Withdraw All Funds : Ensure you move your cryptocurrency and any fiat balances to your private wallet or another reputable exchange well before January 2026. Download Your Records : Export your transaction history, tax documents, and account statements for your personal records. Disable Services : Cancel any recurring buys, automated trading strategies, or linked payment methods associated with your Heybit account. Proactive management is your best defense against potential last-minute technical issues or support delays as the final date approaches. How Does Regulatory Change Impact Crypto Services? The mention of a shifting “regulatory environment” is a common yet powerful challenge for crypto businesses. Governments worldwide are creating new rules for digital assets. These regulations aim to protect consumers and prevent illegal activities but can also increase operational costs and complexity for companies. For a service like Heybit, which focused on wealth management, compliance can become particularly burdensome. The need for stricter licensing, enhanced reporting, and greater capital reserves can make it unfeasible for some platforms to continue, leading directly to a service shutdown . What Can We Learn from the Heybit Exit? The planned Heybit shutdown serves as a stark reminder of the volatility and uncertainty inherent in the cryptocurrency industry. While innovation is rapid, the market is also consolidating. Users should always prioritize the security and longevity of the platforms they use. This event underscores several critical lessons for crypto participants: Not Your Keys, Not Your Crypto : The fundamental principle of holding your own private keys remains paramount. Diversify Your Platforms : Avoid keeping all your assets on a single exchange or service. Stay Informed : Follow official announcements from any platform you use to avoid being caught off guard by changes. In conclusion, the orderly wind-down of Heybit provides a clear example of how a crypto business can responsibly exit the market. By giving users ample notice and a specific timeline, they are allowing for a safe transition of assets. However, it ultimately reinforces the need for personal responsibility and vigilance in managing digital wealth. The crypto ecosystem continues to mature, and such events are part of its ongoing evolution toward greater stability and regulation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: When exactly is Heybit shutting down? A: All Heybit Global services will end at 9:00 a.m. UTC on January 30, 2026. Q: Why is Heybit closing? A: The company stated that changes in the business and regulatory environment made it too difficult to continue operations. Q: Is my money safe until the shutdown? A: The platform is operational until 2026. However, it is strongly advised to withdraw your funds to a personal wallet or another exchange well before the deadline to avoid any last-minute issues. Q: What should I do if I have a Heybit account? A: You should plan to withdraw all assets, download your account history and statements, and cancel any automated services linked to your account. Q: Did Heybit already shut down in South Korea? A: Yes, Heybit withdrew from the South Korean market approximately two years before this global shutdown announcement. Q: Are other crypto platforms at risk of shutting down? A> The regulatory landscape is challenging globally. While not all platforms will shut down, it highlights the importance of using reputable, well-established services and never leaving large sums on any exchange indefinitely.

Sources close to the situation noted that this project was permitted to collect funds through one of the country’s programs, which offers tax incentives for cultural projects. Brazil’s Federal Register revealed that this approval process enabled the initiative to raise approximately 1.09 million reais, equivalent to around $197,000. These funds were primarily collected from private firms and individual donors to develop an instrumental concert that utilizes financial data to compose music, incorporating ideas generated from art, mathematics, economics, and physics. Nonetheless, sources pointed out that this news did not disclose whether any blockchain technology would be involved in the performance. It was mentioned that the concert will take place in Brasília, Brazil’s modern, planned federal capital. Brazil takes a different approach in the crypto industry Just recently, reports noted that the new orchestral project description has been released. In this project description, it was revealed that the initiative will utilize an algorithm that enables it to transform monetary numerals into musical notation easily. This process will be made possible by monitoring the price shifts of Bitcoin and related technical data in real-time during the show. These data inputs are essential in this show as they help shape melody, rhythm, and harmony while the orchestra executes the live performance. Additionally, this method aims to provide individuals with an auditory experience of BTC’s fluctuations by transforming market sentiment into music, blending traditional orchestral instruments with data-inspired compositions. Meanwhile, sources familiar with the situation stated that the approval confirmed the newly adopted initiative meets the requirements of Brazil’s Rouanet Law and marks the completion of a technical review, permitting sponsors to deduct their donations from taxes effectively. Following this statement, individuals in the crypto ecosystem ignited heated discussions. To address this controversy, Brazilian officials attempted to explain that the new orchestral project falls under the “Instrumental Music” category, which, according to their argument, affects the application process for tax benefits. They also pointed out that the fundraising is scheduled to conclude by December 31. On the other hand, several analysts decided to weigh in on the topic of discussion. They argued that such a project builds upon previous experiments in algorithmic art that have employed crypto-related and other real-world data as inspiration for innovative works. Brazil secures recognition of programmable digital art that responds to BTC’s price changes A group in San Francisco, primarily focused on programmable digital art, launched a piece in 2020. This piece adapted its appearance in response to the price fluctuations of Bitcoin. This initiative was known as Right Place & Right Time by artist Matt Kane. It utilized the cryptocurrency’s live market data to prevent fluctuations in Bitcoin’s value from altering the artwork’s visuals. Notably, this work was introduced via Async Art, a blockchain platform for programmable, interactive digital art (NFTs). At that time, Kane arranged the artwork into a main “Master” image, consisting of several separate layers. Each layer responded to the price movement of BTC, with data changes greatly impacting aspects such as size, rotation, and positioning with time. Additionally, sources identified another artist in a similar field. This artist was called Refik Anadol. He reportedly utilized AI, algorithms, and large datasets to create immersive installations. These installations could transform various sources, such as environmental details and historical records, into visual art that changes over time.

This shocking development serves as a stark warning to investors and highlights the growing regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrency misconduct worldwide. What Exactly Was This NFT Fraud Scheme? The executive deceived approximately 30 investors out of over 3 billion won (about $2.2 million) through a sophisticated deception strategy. The scheme centered around false promises that the project’s token would be listed on a major South Korean exchange, creating artificial demand and misleading investors about the project’s legitimacy and potential value. What made this NFT fraud particularly effective was its use of celebrity endorsement. The project leveraged a former national soccer player for promotion, lending credibility to what was essentially a fraudulent operation. This case demonstrates how bad actors can exploit both technological novelty and social influence to perpetrate financial crimes. How Did Authorities Uncover This Elaborate Scam? South Korean regulators have been increasingly vigilant about cryptocurrency misconduct, especially following several high-profile cases in recent years. The investigation revealed several red flags that investors should watch for: Unverified exchange listing claims that couldn’t be confirmed through official channels Celebrity endorsements that seemed disproportionate to the project’s actual development Pressure tactics emphasizing limited-time opportunities to invest Vague technical documentation and unrealistic return projections The seven-year sentence reflects South Korea’s serious approach to NFT fraud and financial crimes in the digital asset space. This punishment sends a clear message to other potential offenders about the consequences of exploiting investors in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. What Does This Mean for NFT Investors Worldwide? This case provides crucial lessons for anyone considering NFT investments. First, celebrity endorsements should never replace thorough due diligence. Second, exchange listing promises require verification directly from the exchanges themselves. Third, regulatory frameworks are catching up with cryptocurrency innovations, providing better protection for investors. The NFT fraud case also highlights the importance of understanding jurisdictional differences in cryptocurrency regulation. South Korea has implemented some of the world’s strictest cryptocurrency regulations, including real-name trading systems and comprehensive reporting requirements. However, regulatory approaches vary significantly across countries, creating both challenges and opportunities for global investors. How Can You Protect Yourself from Similar NFT Scams? Protecting yourself requires a combination of skepticism, research, and understanding of basic investment principles. Here are actionable steps every investor should take: Verify all claims independently rather than relying on promotional materials Research the team’s background and previous project history Understand the technology behind any NFT project before investing Check regulatory compliance in the project’s home jurisdiction Diversify investments to mitigate potential losses from any single project This South Korean NFT fraud case represents a turning point in how authorities worldwide approach cryptocurrency crimes. As digital assets continue to gain mainstream acceptance, regulatory frameworks and enforcement mechanisms are evolving rapidly to protect investors while fostering innovation. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Crypto Accountability The seven-year sentence for this cryptocurrency CEO marks a significant moment in the maturation of digital asset markets. It demonstrates that authorities worldwide are developing the expertise and legal frameworks necessary to prosecute sophisticated NFT fraud schemes effectively. For legitimate projects and ethical entrepreneurs, this development represents progress toward a more trustworthy ecosystem. For investors, it provides reassurance that regulatory protections are strengthening even as market opportunities expand. Frequently Asked Questions What was the main method used in this NFT fraud scheme? The CEO falsely claimed the project’s token would be listed on a major South Korean exchange and used a former national soccer player for promotion, deceiving investors about the project’s legitimacy and potential value. How much money was involved in this fraud case? The scheme defrauded approximately 30 investors out of over 3 billion won, which is equivalent to about $2.2 million USD. What sentence did the crypto CEO receive? The executive was sentenced to seven years in prison, reflecting South Korea’s serious approach to cryptocurrency-related financial crimes. Why is this case significant for the broader cryptocurrency industry? This case demonstrates that authorities are developing effective methods to prosecute sophisticated digital asset fraud and sends a strong deterrent message to potential offenders worldwide. What should investors look for to avoid similar NFT scams? Investors should verify exchange listing claims directly with exchanges, research team backgrounds thoroughly, understand the underlying technology, check regulatory compliance, and maintain healthy skepticism about celebrity endorsements. How are South Korean regulations different from other countries? South Korea has implemented strict measures including real-name trading systems, comprehensive reporting requirements, and active enforcement against cryptocurrency misconduct.

56264825,648090,1766541608,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56264825.jpeg,Bitcoin Enters Risk-Off Regime: Sentiment and On-Chain Data Align,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-enters-risk-off-sentiment-on-chain-data/,"Bitcoin continues to trade below the psychologically important $90,000 level, reinforcing a cautious tone across the market as more analysts begin to warn that the current cycle could be transitioning toward a broader bear phase in 2026. Despite several attempts to regain upside momentum, price action has remained fragile, with volatility picking up and confidence fading among short-term participants. Recent on-chain insights from analyst Axel Adler add weight to the growing risk-off narrative. Market sentiment, which reached euphoric levels earlier this month, has undergone a notable reversal. After peaking in early December, optimism quickly faded as prices failed to sustain higher levels, triggering a steady deterioration in sentiment indicators. The latest readings now place sentiment firmly below neutral, reflecting a clear cooling in trader conviction. This shift is particularly notable because it follows a failed seasonal rebound attempt, often referred to as the “Santa rally,” which historically tends to support prices. Instead, the market’s inability to capitalize on that window has reinforced the view that short-term conditions have deteriorated. The downward turn in sentiment metrics suggests that traders are increasingly defensive, with reduced risk appetite and lower willingness to add exposure at current levels. As Bitcoin remains capped below key resistance, sentiment dynamics point to a market that is no longer driven by momentum but by caution, uncertainty, and a reassessment of the medium-term outlook. Bitcoin Trades Below Key Cost Bases as Recovery Signals Remain Elusive Bitcoin continues to trade under pressure, with price hovering near the $87,400 level, a zone that analysts view as structurally weak in the short term. According to insights shared by Axel Adler, Bitcoin is currently trading below all major short-term holder realized price benchmarks, highlighting the fragility of recent demand. The closest overhead barrier is the short-term holder, 1-week to 1-month realized price around $90,300, a level now acting as immediate resistance rather than support. Above that, resistance intensifies sharply. A dense supply cluster emerges between $100,400 and $101,500, where the 1-month to 3-month short-term holder realized price converges with the aggregate short-term holder realized price. This zone also aligns closely with the 365-day simple moving average near $101,800, reinforcing its importance as a longer-term inflection area. Additional moving average resistance is positioned even higher, with the 111-day and 200-day SMAs near $104,300 and $107,900, respectively. Trading below short-term holder cost bases implies that the most recent buyers are sitting on unrealized losses. As a result, relief rallies toward breakeven levels risk triggering renewed selling. For market conditions to improve meaningfully, Bitcoin would need to reclaim and hold above the $90,000 area. Until then, the absence of strong spot demand leaves the market exposed to further downside, despite long-term support anchored near the aggregate realized price at $56,300. Price Pulls Back to Key Weekly Support: Trend Structure Is Tested Bitcoin is consolidating near the $87,700 level on the weekly chart, following a sharp rejection from the $110,000–$115,000 region earlier this cycle. The chart shows a clear loss of momentum after the parabolic advance that defined most of 2024 and early 2025, with price now correcting toward its rising long-term averages. Notably, Bitcoin is trading just above the weekly 111-day simple moving average, which has historically acted as an important trend gauge during bull market corrections. The pullback has so far remained orderly. Despite several weeks of downside pressure, the price has not broken decisively below the ascending structure that began in late 2023. However, the loss of the faster weekly moving average, combined with lower highs since the peak, suggests that the market is transitioning into a consolidation or corrective phase rather than an immediate trend continuation. Volume dynamics reinforce this view. Selling pressure has increased during down weeks, while recovery attempts have lacked strong follow-through, pointing to cautious positioning among participants. Meanwhile, the 200-day weekly moving average remains far below current levels, underscoring that the broader trend is still intact, albeit stretched. From a structural perspective, holding the $85,000–$88,000 area is critical. A sustained breakdown below this zone would expose deeper downside risk, while stabilization here could allow Bitcoin to build a base before attempting another directional move.

That context explains why crypto market commentator Brad Kimes, widely known on X as Digital Perspectives, reiterated a long-standing message that continues to resonate with many XRP holders: “Never sell your XRP.” His comment was in anticipation of the upcoming XRPL Lending Protocol. Why You Shouldn’t Sell Your XRP The comment from Digital Perspectives was a response to a post from Ed Hennis, a software engineer at Ripple, who recently outlined the upcoming proposal for the XRPL Lending Protocol. The proposal introduces fixed-term, fixed-rate, underwritten credit directly at the protocol level of the XRP Ledger. This approach is interesting because it moves lending away from smart-contract layers into a standardized, protocol-native system governed by validator consensus. Related Reading: Here’s Why The XRP Price Keeps Crashing According to the explanation by Ed Hennis, the proposed loans on the XRPL Lending Protocol are going to be done with structured, clear terms, predictable interest, and explicit authorization, features that real-world institutions expect before committing capital. Therefore, Digital Perspectives’ “never sell” message is a reflection of a longer-term view where holders never sell their XRP and instead use them as collateral for loans. Instead of relying on generalized liquidity pools like most lending protocols, the design of the XRPL Lending Protocol places each loan inside a segregated Single Asset Vault. This structure isolates risk to a specific credit facility and avoids the cross-contamination that has plagued many DeFi lending platforms during periods of market stress. Therefore, the XRPL Lending Protocol reduces execution risk and creates a framework that resembles traditional credit markets more closely than existing crypto lending models. Real-World Applications Of The XRPL Lending Protocol Most decentralized lending systems today depend on heavy overcollateralization to offset volatility and the risk of anonymity. That approach might work for traders, but it is inefficient for real businesses that operate on predictable cash flows and underwritten credit lines. Enterprises are accustomed to borrowing without locking up more capital than the value of the loan itself, and that mismatch has kept many institutions on the sidelines. Related Reading: Ripple Reveals How It’s Hijacking A $16 Trillion Industry Using The XRP Ledger The XRPL’s approach introduces undercollateralized, institutionally underwritten lending alongside existing overcollateralized models. This expands the range of viable borrowers and aligns on-chain credit with how financing actually works in traditional markets. As noted by Hennis, real-world use cases of XRPL’s lending protocol include market makers borrowing XRP/RLUSD for inventory and arbitrage, Payment Service Providers (PSPs) borrowing RLUSD to pre-fund instant merchant payouts, and fintech lenders accessing short-duration working capital. The feature is slated to be available for voting at the end of January 2026. From there, the voting decision is up to validators on the XRP Ledger. Once the lending protocol goes live and XRP begins to play a direct role in institutional credit markets, selling XRP at that stage may be short-sighted.

This massive Trump Media Bitcoin transfer , reported by blockchain tracker Lookonchain, has sent ripples through financial and crypto circles, raising urgent questions about its purpose and the broader implications for political finance in the digital age. What Do We Know About This Trump Media Bitcoin Transfer? The transaction occurred roughly eight hours before public reporting. The funds moved from the presumed Trump Media-linked wallet to a cryptic address beginning with ‘bc1qq’. However, the ultimate purpose remains shrouded in secrecy. Was this a strategic sale, a move to a new custodian, or something else entirely? The lack of clarity is what makes this event so significant. Blockchain’s transparency shows the movement, but its inherent privacy often hides the ‘why’. Why Is This Massive Bitcoin Movement So Significant? This isn’t just another large crypto transaction. The potential link to a high-profile political figure’s business venture adds multiple layers of scrutiny. Firstly, it highlights the growing intersection of major political entities and the volatile cryptocurrency market. Secondly, the sheer scale demands attention. A Trump Media Bitcoin transfer of this magnitude can influence market sentiment and spark regulatory discussions. Consider the key questions this event prompts: Market Impact: Could a potential sale of 2,000 BTC exert selling pressure on Bitcoin’s price? Strategic Motive: Is this related to corporate treasury management, liquidity needs, or portfolio rebalancing? Transparency: What does this say about the visibility of financial movements for entities tied to public figures? Navigating the Murky Waters of Crypto and Politics The incident perfectly illustrates a central tension in cryptocurrency: public ledgers versus private actors. Anyone can see the transaction, but identifying the parties and their intent is challenging. This Trump Media Bitcoin transfer therefore becomes a case study. It forces observers to confront how traditional financial scrutiny applies—or fails to apply—to blockchain-based assets held by politically adjacent companies. For investors and analysts, the event is a reminder: Always verify on-chain data through multiple sources like Lookonchain. Distinguish between observable facts (the transfer) and speculation (the purpose). Consider the broader narrative impact on crypto adoption and regulation. The Unanswered Questions and Lasting Implications Until the entity behind the wallet clarifies the move, speculation will continue. The primary mystery is the fundamental purpose. A sale could indicate a need for fiat currency or a bearish outlook on Bitcoin’s short-term price. A custody change might suggest seeking enhanced security or different financial partners. The silence amplifies the intrigue. Ultimately, this high-profile Trump Media Bitcoin transfer underscores cryptocurrency’s evolving role. Digital assets are now held by diverse institutions, from tech firms to media companies. Their management of these assets is becoming a new frontier for corporate strategy and public accountability. This event may prompt more entities to proactively communicate their crypto treasury strategies to avoid market uncertainty. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How do we know the wallet is linked to Trump Media? A1: Blockchain analytics firms like Lookonchain use clustering techniques to associate wallet addresses with entities. This link is based on their analysis, though official confirmation from Trump Media is pending. Q2: Can the recipient address (bc1qq…) be traced? A2> Blockchain is transparent. Future transactions from that address can be tracked, but identifying the actual owner requires off-chain information, which is often private. Q3: What does a transfer this large mean for Bitcoin’s price? A3: A direct sale on an exchange could create temporary selling pressure. However, if the coins were simply moved to cold storage, the market impact would be neutral. The intent is crucial. Q4: Are transactions like this common for large companies? A4: Yes. Companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy actively manage their Bitcoin treasuries, making large transfers for operational or strategic reasons. The political connection here adds a unique layer of interest. Q5: What should I watch for next? A5> Monitor for any official statement from Trump Media or DJT. Also, watch the recipient address for any further movements that might reveal its purpose, such as deposits to a known exchange wallet. Q6: Does this affect the legitimacy of cryptocurrency? A6> Not directly. It demonstrates that major, newsworthy entities are actively using blockchain networks, reinforcing crypto’s role in modern finance, albeit with ongoing transparency debates.

In doing so, the computing power has become a key resource in aiding blockchain networks. Cloud mining as one of the models where users can take part in this infrastructure even without possessing physical equipment is increasingly becoming the focus of both new and known market players. Fleet Mining has a special Christmas cloud mining event and it is a combination of stable mining production and the element of 2x cashback reward structure. A single account can earn a total of more than $200,000 . through deposit cashback and a contract cashback, which is quite a structured and transparent chance to participate in the event. Why Cloud Mining is So Interesting to Commoners Cloud mining makes it easier to get involved in blockchain infrastructure by eliminating the normal barriers. Users do not have to buy mining machines, control the use of electricity, or take care of technical maintenance. Instead, mining farms are operated on a professional level and the computing power is distributed automatically by the platform. To users who would rather have an unambiguous and manageable model of participation, cloud mining provides: • None of the ownership or care of hardware. • None of the technical set up and operational learning curve. • Daily settlement of profits by automated system functioning. • Clear expenses and clear terms of contract. Fleet Mining also adds to this model by combining renewable energy sources and AI-based computing resources management to aid in the reduction of overheads in operations and efficiency. The Benefits of the Fleet Mining Platform Fleet Mining has a big long term international system that is geared towards stability: • There were 97 mining farms implemented in the world which were wind and solar-powered. • More than 3 million mining equipment at a time. • AI-assisted hash power distribution in order to maximize computing efficiency. • Clear cloud mining contracts with automatic settlement per day. This infrastructure facilitates the ability of Fleet Mining to sustain the stable mining production and high-value incentive programs during the large events like Christmas. Christmas Double Cashback Structure The Christmas event will provide a two-stage reward system, in which the users can gain at two phases of engagement. Deposit Cashback The users get an automatic cashback during the period in which they are participating in the event, with a one-time deposit to the account: • $1,000–$4,999: 2% cashback • $5,000–$9,999: 3% cashback • $10,000–$29,999: 6% cashback • $30,000–$99,999: 13% cashback • $100,000 and above: up to 20% cashback Increased deposit levels offer more initial value which facilitates increased mining capacity in the beginning. Contract Cashback Besides deposit bonuses, users may get an add-on cashback contract-based: • Cashback on contracts can be up to $50,000 and above. • Increasing contract values will open increasing cashback ratios. • Deposit cashback and contract cashback can be used as standalone and combined. This structure enables one participation to create several reward layers. Example of Reward Stacking The user makes a deposit of $100,000 which is deposited in the Christmas event and earns a maximum of $20,000 as deposit cashback. Additional cashback to the contract is provided after a user buys a valid cloud mining contract. Combination of rewards enhances the effective mining power in relation to the normal periods of participation. Supported Cryptocurrencies Fleet Mining sponsors mining and settlement on a variety of mainstream digital assets, such as: BTC, ETH, XRP, DOGE, USDT, USDC, and BCH. How the Mining Process Works 1. Pay for an account at Fleet Mining . 2. Make a deposit and get a cashback of the same amount automatically. 3. Choose a cloud computing agreement. 4. The AI system of Fleet Mining automatically assigns hash power on-the-fly once it is switched on. 5. Mining is automatic and the profits are settled on a daily basis. Users can also withdraw profits or use them to increase the mining capacity. Other Incentive of participation The referral program of Fleet Mining is still active during the period of Christmas: • Referral commission rate: 4.5% • No limit on referrals • No extra cost of participation. Conclusion The Christmas cloud mining event of Fleet Mining is developed as a structured incentive program but not as a promotion of a short-term character. It is a combination of automated cloud mining, transparent contracts and a two-tier cashback reward system to make its participants have a better and more efficient opportunity to participate in blockchain computing infrastructure throughout the holiday period.

This decision directly impacts trading strategies and portfolio management for users engaged with these markets. Let’s break down what this OKX delist action means, the critical timelines involved, and the essential steps every affected trader must take. What Exactly Is OKX Delisting? OKX has officially stated that it will remove the DEGEN/USDT and CETUS/USDT perpetual futures trading pairs from its platform. The delisting is scheduled for 8:00 a.m. UTC on December 26. Perpetual futures are popular derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on an asset’s future price without an expiry date. Therefore, this OKX delist means all open positions for these specific contracts must be closed or settled before the deadline. Why Would an Exchange Delist Futures Contracts? Exchanges like OKX periodically review their listed products. The decision to delist perpetual futures for DEGEN and CETUS likely stems from a combination of factors designed to maintain a healthy trading ecosystem. Common reasons include: Low Liquidity: When trading volume for a contract dries up, it can lead to poor price execution and increased risk for traders. Risk Management: Exchanges must manage their overall exposure. Volatile or less-established tokens can pose higher systemic risks. Strategic Refocus: Platforms often streamline offerings to concentrate resources on markets with stronger user demand. While OKX has not specified the exact reason, such delist actions are a standard part of exchange operations to ensure market integrity. Key Dates and Immediate Actions for Traders Time is of the essence. The clock is ticking toward the December 26 cutoff. Here is your actionable checklist: Mark Your Calendar: All trading for DEGEN/USDT and CETUS/USDT perpetual futures will halt at 8:00 a.m. UTC on Dec. 26. Close Open Positions: You must actively close any open long or short positions in these contracts before the deadline. Do not wait for automatic settlement. Cancel Open Orders: Remember to cancel any pending limit or stop orders tied to these futures pairs to avoid unexpected execution attempts. Withdraw Funds: After closing positions, you can withdraw your USDT margin from the futures account if desired. Ignoring this OKX delist notice could lead to the exchange automatically settling your position at the mark price, which may not align with your trading strategy. What Does This Mean for DEGEN and CETUS Tokens? It’s crucial to understand that this delist action applies specifically to the perpetual futures derivatives on OKX. As of this announcement: The underlying DEGEN and CETUS tokens may still be available for spot trading on OKX and other exchanges. The decision primarily affects leverage traders and does not necessarily reflect on the fundamental value of the tokens themselves. Traders should monitor official channels of both OKX and the token projects for any further updates. However, the removal of a major derivatives market can sometimes impact spot market sentiment and liquidity, so staying informed is key. Navigating the Aftermath and Protecting Your Portfolio This event serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic nature of crypto markets. To safeguard your investments, consider these insights: Diversify Across Exchanges: Avoid concentrating all derivative trading on a single platform. Stay Alert to Notices: Regularly check the announcements section of any exchange you use. This OKX delist was posted on their official website. Have an Exit Strategy: Always know how you will exit a derivatives position, especially in less liquid markets. Proactive management is your best defense against unexpected exchange actions. Final Summary: A Proactive Approach is Essential The decision by OKX to delist perpetual futures for DEGEN and CETUS is a clear operational update that requires immediate attention from involved traders. By understanding the reasons, adhering strictly to the December 26 deadline, and managing your positions proactively, you can navigate this change smoothly. Always prioritize risk management and use official exchange communications as your primary source of truth in the fast-evolving world of crypto derivatives. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade DEGEN and CETUS on OKX after December 26? A1: This delisting only affects the specific DEGEN/USDT and CETUS/USDT perpetual futures contracts. You will need to check OKX’s spot market listings to see if the tokens are still available for regular trading. Q2: What happens if I forget to close my position before the deadline? A2: OKX will likely settle all remaining open positions at the mark price around the delisting time. This automatic settlement may result in a price less favorable than if you had actively closed the position yourself. Q3: Will this delisting affect the price of DEGEN and CETUS tokens on other exchanges? A3: While the direct impact is on OKX’s futures market, reduced trading avenues can sometimes influence overall market sentiment and liquidity for a token. It’s wise to monitor the broader market reaction. Q4: Are other exchanges likely to delist these futures contracts too? A4: Not necessarily. Each exchange makes independent listing decisions based on its own criteria. There is no automatic chain reaction, but it’s a good practice to check announcements from other platforms where you trade. Q5: Is my funds safe during this delisting process? A5: Yes, your funds are safe. The process involves closing your derivative contract positions. Any remaining margin (USDT) in your futures account will remain yours to withdraw or use for other trades. Q6: Where can I find the official OKX announcement? A6: The official notice is posted on the OKX website under their announcements or support section. Always rely on these official channels for the most accurate and timely information.

The institutional investor, believed to be a subsidiary of LD Capital, acquired an additional 6,379 ETH worth approximately $130 million through a leveraged loan. This bold Trend Research ETH purchase strategy reveals much about institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential, even during challenging market conditions. Why Is Trend Research Doubling Down on ETH? The latest Trend Research ETH purchase represents a continuation of an accumulation strategy that began last November when Ethereum traded around $3,400. According to reports from AmberCN, the entity now holds a staggering 580,000 ETH valued at $1.72 billion. What makes this transaction particularly noteworthy is the context: Trend Research currently faces an unrealized loss of approximately $141 million on its existing holdings. This raises important questions about institutional investment psychology in cryptocurrency markets. Why would an experienced investor increase exposure to an asset showing paper losses? The answer likely involves several strategic considerations: Long-term conviction in Ethereum’s fundamental value proposition Dollar-cost averaging strategy during price corrections Portfolio rebalancing to maintain target allocations Leveraged positioning to amplify potential upside Understanding the $141 Million Unrealized Loss An unrealized loss represents paper losses that haven’t been locked in through selling. For Trend Research, this $141 million figure reflects the difference between their average purchase price and current market value. However, institutional investors often view such metrics differently than retail traders. Seasoned investors understand that volatility creates both risk and opportunity. The substantial Trend Research ETH purchase during a downturn suggests they see current prices as attractive entry points rather than reasons for concern. This perspective aligns with traditional investment wisdom about buying quality assets during market fear. The Leveraged Loan Strategy Explained Trend Research executed this latest Trend Research ETH purchase using a leveraged loan structure. This approach allows investors to: Amplify purchasing power without liquidating other positions Maintain exposure to potential upside while managing cash flow Potentially benefit from tax advantages in certain jurisdictions Implement sophisticated portfolio management strategies However, leverage introduces additional risks, particularly in volatile cryptocurrency markets. Margin calls and forced liquidations become concerns during sharp price declines. Trend Research’s willingness to employ leverage despite existing paper losses demonstrates remarkable confidence in their market thesis. What This Means for Ethereum’s Market Structure Large-scale institutional accumulation like the Trend Research ETH purchase significantly impacts market dynamics in several ways: First, it reduces circulating supply as ETH moves from exchanges to long-term holding addresses. Second, it establishes stronger support levels as institutional buyers provide consistent demand. Third, it signals to other market participants that sophisticated investors see value at current prices. This accumulation pattern suggests institutions are positioning for what they believe will be the next major market cycle. Their actions often precede broader market movements, making such transactions important indicators for attentive observers. Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors The Trend Research ETH purchase offers valuable lessons for investors of all sizes: Institutional time horizons differ significantly from retail traders Paper losses don’t necessarily trigger panic selling among experienced investors Strategic accumulation during downturns can build substantial positions Leverage represents a double-edged sword requiring careful management Most importantly, this transaction reinforces that cryptocurrency markets continue maturing, with institutional players implementing sophisticated strategies previously reserved for traditional assets. Conclusion: A Bold Bet on Ethereum’s Future The latest Trend Research ETH purchase demonstrates that conviction often outweighs short-term paper losses in institutional cryptocurrency investing. While the $141 million unrealized loss seems staggering, Trend Research’s response—doubling down with another $130 million purchase—speaks volumes about their long-term outlook. This move highlights the growing sophistication of cryptocurrency markets and the strategic approaches institutional investors bring to the space. As Ethereum continues evolving with technological upgrades and expanding use cases, accumulation by entities like Trend Research suggests they anticipate substantial future value creation. Frequently Asked Questions What is Trend Research? Trend Research is believed to be a subsidiary of LD Capital, an institutional investment firm active in cryptocurrency markets. They focus on research-driven investment strategies in blockchain and digital assets. Why would anyone buy more of an asset showing losses? Experienced investors often increase positions during price declines if they believe the asset’s long-term fundamentals remain strong. This strategy, called dollar-cost averaging, can lower average purchase prices over time. What is an unrealized loss? An unrealized loss represents a decrease in an investment’s value that hasn’t been locked in through selling. It’s a “paper loss” that could reverse if prices recover. How does a leveraged loan work for crypto purchases? A leveraged loan allows investors to borrow funds to purchase more assets than their cash would normally allow. This amplifies both potential gains and losses. Does this large purchase guarantee Ethereum’s price will rise? No single transaction guarantees price movement. However, substantial institutional accumulation typically indicates strong conviction and can influence market sentiment and structure. Should retail investors follow Trend Research’s strategy? Retail investors should never blindly follow institutional strategies. Their risk tolerance, time horizons, and portfolio structures differ significantly from most individual investors.

The S&P 500 closed at a record on Tuesday after an upward revision to third-quarter GDP showed annualised growth of 4.3%, a report that also pushed bond yields higher and kept growth stocks in demand. In crypto, Bitfinex analysts said Bitcoin has bounced decisively from the low $80,000 support zone identified earlier. “However, the recovery now faces a substantial headwind in the form of a dense overhead supply cluster accumulated by top buyers between $94,000 and $120,000,” they added. “This concentration of supply has created a distinctly top-heavy market structure, where rebound attempts are increasingly capped by sell pressure. This dynamic is reminiscent of early 2022, when recoveries during the initial stages of a bearish phase repeatedly failed to gain traction.” MSCI’s regional gauge of Asia Pacific stocks extended gains into a fourth straight session, rising about 0.2% at the open.

Fed Leadership Uncertainty Keeps Markets On Edge On the policy front, Trump has also kept markets guessing about the next Federal Reserve chair, repeating that he wants a rate cutter in place as he nears an announcement. In Asia, investors tracked signals out of Beijing and New Delhi, where the Reserve Bank of India moved to ease tight conditions with fresh liquidity measures that include bond purchases and a dollar rupee swap.

This action, reported by on-chain analytics platform The Data Nerd, involves 5.68 million ETHFI being withdrawn from the Ether.fi liquid staking protocol. For investors and market watchers, this raises immediate questions about the fund’s strategy and the potential implications for the ETHFI ecosystem. What Does It Mean When Arrington Capital Unstakes ETHFI? When a major institutional player like Arrington Capital makes a move, the market takes notice. The transaction, executed roughly five hours before the report, represents a substantial shift of assets. Unstaking typically involves converting a liquid staking derivative, like ETHFI, back into its underlying asset or moving it to another platform. This action by Arrington Capital could signal several things: a routine portfolio rebalance, a strategic shift in their DeFi exposure, or a response to changing market conditions surrounding ETHFI. Understanding the ETHFI and Ether.fi Ecosystem To grasp why this move matters, you need to understand the players. Ether.fi is a leading liquid staking protocol on Ethereum. It allows users to stake their ETH and receive a liquid token, eTH, in return, which can be used across other DeFi applications. ETHFI is the native governance token of the Ether.fi ecosystem. Therefore, when Arrington Capital unstakes ETHFI, it is moving a significant amount of governance and utility tokens tied to this specific protocol. Liquid Staking: Allows staked assets to remain “liquid” and usable elsewhere. Governance Tokens: Like ETHFI, grant holders voting rights on protocol decisions. Institutional Activity: Large moves can influence token perception and liquidity. Why Would a Hedge Fund Like Arrington Capital Unstake? Analyzing the potential reasons behind Arrington Capital’s decision to unstake provides crucial context. Hedge funds operate with specific risk-reward frameworks. Their decision to unstake ETHFI could be driven by profit-taking after a price increase, reallocating capital to new opportunities, or adjusting to revised risk assessments of the liquid staking sector. It is not necessarily a negative signal but a calculated maneuver reflective of their investment thesis. The Broader Impact on ETHFI and Liquid Staking So, what could this mean for the average ETHFI holder or someone interested in liquid staking? Large unstaking events can temporarily increase selling pressure on the token. However, they also highlight the mature, liquid nature of the market where institutions can enter and exit sizable positions. The fact that Arrington Capital was staking with Ether.fi in the first place underscores institutional confidence in the protocol’s infrastructure. The key takeaway is to monitor the fund’s next move—do they sell, hold, or redeploy the capital? Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Watching whales like Arrington Capital is educational, but how should you react? First, avoid panic. Institutional moves are one data point among many. Second, use tools like The Data Nerd to track on-chain flows yourself. Third, consider the fundamentals of the project—has anything changed with Ether.fi’s technology or roadmap? The decision by Arrington Capital to unstake ETHFI is a case study in portfolio management, not a direct investment signal for retail. In conclusion, the move by Arrington Capital to unstake $4 million in ETHFI is a noteworthy event in the DeFi landscape. It demonstrates the active role institutions play in governance token economies and the liquidity of modern staking protocols. While it may cause short-term speculation, the long-term health of projects like Ether.fi depends on adoption and utility, not single transactions. Observing these flows is essential for a complete market picture. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Arrington Capital? A1: Arrington Capital is a well-known cryptocurrency and blockchain-focused hedge fund founded by tech investor Michael Arrington. Q2: What does “unstaking” ETHFI mean? A2: Unstaking ETHFI refers to the process of withdrawing the ETHFI tokens from a staking contract or protocol, like Ether.fi, making them liquid and transferable again. Q3: Does Arrington Capital unstaking ETHFI mean they are selling it? A3: Not necessarily. Unstaking simply means moving the tokens out of the staking contract. They could be moving them to a different wallet, holding them, or preparing to sell. The action itself does not confirm a sale. Q4: How can I track moves like this myself? A4: You can use on-chain analytics platforms and blockchain explorers (like Etherscan) to track large wallet transactions tagged to known entities. Q5: What is Ether.fi? A5: Ether.fi is a decentralized, non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on Ethereum that allows users to earn staking rewards while maintaining liquidity. Q6: Should I unstake my ETHFI because Arrington Capital did? A6: You should not make investment decisions based solely on the actions of a single entity. Always conduct your own research (DYOR) and consider your individual investment strategy and risk tolerance. Found this analysis of Arrington Capital’s move insightful? The world of crypto moves fast, and sharing knowledge helps everyone navigate it better.

56268889,648061,1766545226,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56268889.jpeg,"Here’s How Many Transactions XRP Must Process To Reach A $2,000 Price Tag",https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-to-reach-a-2000-price-tag/,"Crypto analyst Rob Cunningham has detailed the conditions and how many transactions XRP would need to handle to reach a $2,000 valuation. He explained that the token must process sovereign-scale settlement volumes and eliminate liquidity stress to achieve its full potential. The Transaction Threshold For A $2,000 XRP In a rather lengthy X post this Monday, Cunningham outlined a new framework for understanding XRP’s potential price trajectory. He emphasized that the most important question for cryptocurrency is the price at which it eliminates pre-funding, slippage, and liquidity stress for sovereign-scale settlement . The analyst evaluated this using metrics such as global settlement volume , order-book depth, central-bank-scale transaction sizing, and the need to avoid balance-sheet drag. According to his analysis, the minimum clean operating range for XRP lies between $1,500 and $3,000 per coin. At a $2,000 valuation, XRP’s network would need to hold $200 trillion in value and process up to $2 quadrillion in daily transactions with a tenfold velocity. Cunningham described XRP at the $2,000 level as a rail , a reserve, and a unit of account bridge . He stated that if the cryptocurrency could achieve this valuation, liquidity would effectively become invisible, and the cost of capital could approach zero, making XRP function more like energy than conventional money. The analyst also asserted that beyond the $1,500 to $3,000 range, XRP ceases to be “priced” in conventional terms and is instead evaluated based on its functional utility. He declared that XRP would reprice faster than any other asset in history. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, which usually move based on earnings, narratives, or market cycles, XRP would be repriced like infrastructure—fast, violent, and discolored. Analyst Compares XRP Move To Oil Discovery And Predicts Explosive Rally In his analysis, Cunningham also predicted that XRP’s price will eventually be driven by its structural role rather than typical market factors. He explained that once the market recognizes Ripple Labs and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as essential to global settlements, three key dynamics could kick in simultaneously. First, it could optionally collapse as XRP stops being one of many cryptocurrencies and becomes a required input. Second, the future value could exceed the present value . Third, the “float” becomes functionally illiquid, as long-term holders remain firm and institutions must acquire XRP regardless of price. The analyst has compared this rare combination of factors to oil discoveries, wars, shifts in reserve currency, or recognition of monopoly infrastructure. The analyst also outlined a three-phase acceleration pattern for XRP, emphasizing that the token’s growth would occur in leaps, with rapid bursts of 3X to 10X. The first phase, Recognition Shock, could last weeks to three months, triggered by clear regulatory finality and treasury-level integration . The second phase, Future Value Compression, may last three to twelve months as the market prices XRP to prevent scarcity . The final phase, Infrastructure Pricing, could span one to three years, with XRP no longer priced but managed.",XRP|Recognition Shock|ripple|ripple labs|Rob Cunningham|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-24 03:00:26

After reaching a historic all-time high in November 2024, the network has struggled to reclaim its former momentum. This loss of momentum reflects technical exhaustion and a market recalibration after an aggressive run-up. Thus, SOL has entered a new phase as investors assess whether fresh demand can emerge or if the network needs a new catalyst to reassert leadership. How Solana Momentum Fades After The November Peak Crypto trader Ardi has revealed on X that market interest has noticeably thinned ever since Solana set its $296 all-time high in November 2024. On-chain data has shown that buying pressure has been dominated almost by the retail-sized wallets, particularly those making purchases between $0 and $1,000. Related Reading: Solana Faces Critical Test Near $100 as Macro Pressure and Network Upgrades Collide Ardi argues that while many observers point to micro conditions to explain the stalled price action, the tape reveals that the distribution has begun before the peak. The selling volume had already been accelerating for months before October 10, signaling that major players were planning their exits long before the drawdown. The data also confirms a massive divergence between demographics. Meanwhile, the mid-sized wallets involving $0 to $100,000, and the institutional-sized wallets involving $100,000 to $10 million in volume have been in a steady downtrend for roughly 13 months. Over the same period, retail wallets have shown a consistent uptrend, and are clearly convinced that SOL is still trading at a deep discount price. This imbalance leads to the ultimate question: Is Solana’s value now intrinsically tied to memecoins? The correlation between SOL’s demand and the memecoin actively on the network has been near-perfect, which means that without the frenzy of the meme sector, most bids would largely be disinterested. What Comes After Memes Will Decide Solana’s Future An investor and trader, Jas pointed out that 2025 has definitely been a reset for Solana, but it isn’t over for the altcoin. SOL active monthly traders have fallen from roughly 30 million to under 1 million, a staggering 97% drop in network activity. The speculative engine was the memecoin boom that fueled its rise and also exposed its biggest vulnerability. Related Reading: Solana at a Breaking Point: Fading Memecoin Hype and Alameda Unlocks Test the $140 Support Zone Furthermore, SOL is down nearly 58% from its yearly high. SOL’s network revenue dropped fivefold year-over-year from $2.5 billion in 2024 to $500 million in 2025. The contrast with Ethereum is hard to ignore, and ETH generated $1.4 billion in revenue this year and outperformed SOL by 56% year-to-date. “SOL’s future may depend less on memes and more on what follows them,” Jas noted.

That’s the staggering reality revealed by security firm CertiK in their latest report. This massive loss highlights critical vulnerabilities that every crypto investor and developer needs to understand immediately. What’s Causing These Massive Web3 Security Breaches? CertiK’s analysis reveals a disturbing trend in Web3 security. Hackers have shifted their focus from individual protocol vulnerabilities to systemic weaknesses. The numbers tell a sobering story: $3.35 billion lost through various security incidents across the blockchain space. This represents more than just stolen funds. It reflects fundamental challenges in how we secure decentralized systems. The report indicates that traditional security approaches are no longer sufficient against sophisticated attackers targeting the Web3 infrastructure itself. Why Are Supply Chain Attacks So Devastating? The most alarming finding concerns supply chain attacks. These accounted for approximately half of all losses, totaling $1.45 billion. But what exactly makes these attacks so effective and dangerous? Systemic vulnerability : Attackers target services used by multiple companies Amplified damage : A single breach can compromise numerous projects Difficult detection : These attacks often go unnoticed until it’s too late The Bybit hack in February serves as a prime example. This wasn’t just about one exchange’s security failure. It demonstrated how weaknesses in shared infrastructure can create ripple effects throughout the entire Web3 security landscape. How Is AI Changing the Phishing Game? CertiK’s report contains another crucial warning about artificial intelligence. Hackers now use AI to create sophisticated phishing sites and messages that are nearly indistinguishable from legitimate communications. This represents a new frontier in Web3 security threats. Traditional phishing detection methods struggle against AI-generated content. These systems can create personalized messages, mimic official communication styles perfectly, and adapt their approaches based on user responses. The implications for Web3 security are profound and concerning. What Can You Do to Protect Your Assets? While the numbers are alarming, there are practical steps everyone can take to improve their Web3 security posture. Understanding these threats is the first step toward better protection. Verify everything : Double-check URLs, email addresses, and communication sources Use hardware wallets : Keep significant assets in cold storage whenever possible Stay informed : Follow security updates from projects you invest in Enable multi-factor authentication : Add extra layers to all your accounts Remember that Web3 security isn’t just about technology. It’s about developing healthy skepticism and verification habits. The most sophisticated security systems can still fail if users don’t practice basic safety measures. The Future of Web3 Security: What Needs to Change? The $3.35 billion loss represents a wake-up call for the entire industry. Web3 security must evolve from reactive patchwork to proactive, systemic protection. This requires collaboration across projects, better security standards, and increased user education. Developers need to prioritize security from the ground up. Investors must demand transparency about security practices. The industry as a whole needs to share threat intelligence and develop collective defense mechanisms. Only through coordinated effort can we strengthen Web3 security against these sophisticated threats. The CertiK report delivers a clear message: Web3 security is at a critical juncture. While the technology promises decentralization and financial freedom, these benefits mean nothing without robust protection. The $3.35 billion lost this year represents both a warning and an opportunity. It’s time for the industry to mature its security practices before more value disappears into the digital void. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is a supply chain attack in Web3 security? A supply chain attack targets services or infrastructure components used by multiple companies. Instead of hacking individual protocols, attackers compromise shared tools, libraries, or service providers, creating widespread damage across many projects simultaneously. How does AI make phishing more dangerous for Web3 users? AI can generate highly convincing phishing content that mimics legitimate communications perfectly. It can create personalized messages, adapt to user responses, and bypass traditional detection methods that look for specific patterns or errors. Are decentralized platforms inherently less secure? Not inherently, but they face different security challenges. While decentralization eliminates single points of failure, it also distributes security responsibility. This requires users to be more vigilant and projects to implement stronger security measures throughout their ecosystems. What should I look for in a Web3 project’s security practices? Look for regular security audits by reputable firms, transparent reporting of incidents, bug bounty programs, and clear communication about security updates. Projects should also have incident response plans and insurance where appropriate. Can hardware wallets protect against all Web3 security threats? Hardware wallets provide excellent protection against many threats, particularly those involving private key theft. However, they don’t protect against all Web3 security risks, such as smart contract vulnerabilities or protocol-level attacks on the networks themselves. How often should I review my Web3 security practices? Review your security practices at least quarterly, or whenever you hear about major security incidents. Regular updates to software, password changes, and security setting reviews should become routine habits for anyone involved in Web3. Found this Web3 security analysis valuable?

According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT market, BTC is currently trading at $86,977.44. This sudden movement has sent ripples through the digital asset space, prompting investors to ask: what’s driving this decline, and is it a temporary dip or the start of a larger trend? What Caused the Bitcoin Price to Fall Below $87,000? Market analysts point to several converging factors for today’s Bitcoin price action. First, broader macroeconomic concerns have resurfaced, with uncertainty around interest rate policies creating risk-off sentiment across all asset classes. Secondly, significant sell pressure emerged from a cluster of large wallet addresses, often referred to as ‘whales,’ moving coins to exchanges. This typically signals an intent to sell and can trigger automated stop-loss orders, accelerating the downward momentum. Furthermore, technical indicators had been flashing warnings. The $87,000 level had acted as strong support in recent weeks. However, once this level broke, it transformed into a resistance zone, inviting more selling. The move highlights the volatile nature of crypto markets, where sentiment can shift rapidly based on technical breaks and on-chain data. Is This a Buying Opportunity or a Warning Sign? For seasoned traders, a pullback in the Bitcoin price presents a classic dilemma. Is this a healthy correction within a longer bull market, or a sign of deeper weakness? Let’s break down the perspectives. The Bull Case: Corrections are normal and necessary. They shake out weak hands and allow the market to consolidate before its next leg up. Key long-term fundamentals, like institutional adoption through ETFs and the upcoming halving event, remain intact. The Bear Case: The break of a major support level like $87,000 is technically bearish. It could indicate that the recent rally was overextended and that further downside toward $84,000 or lower is possible before finding a true bottom. Therefore, your strategy depends entirely on your investment horizon. Short-term traders might see volatility, while long-term holders may view this as a chance to accumulate at a slightly lower cost. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Navigating such market moves requires a clear plan. Here are some immediate steps to consider. Review Your Portfolio Allocation: Ensure your exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies aligns with your overall risk tolerance. A sharp drop is a good reminder to check your asset allocation. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Fear of missing out (FOMO) on rallies and fear of further loss during dips are the two biggest enemies of rational investing. Stick to your predefined strategy. Monitor Key Levels: Watch how the market reacts around the $86,500 and $85,000 levels. A strong bounce could signal resilience, while a break lower may indicate more pain ahead. Remember, the Bitcoin price is influenced by a complex mix of technicals, macroeconomics, and on-chain flows. No single factor tells the whole story. Conclusion: Navigating Market Volatility with Confidence Today’s drop in the Bitcoin price below $87,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the cryptocurrency market’s inherent volatility. While unsettling, these movements are part of its DNA. The key for investors is not to predict every swing but to understand the underlying forces and maintain a disciplined approach. By focusing on long-term trends, sound risk management, and the fundamental value proposition of decentralized digital assets, you can navigate these dips with greater confidence and clarity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why did Bitcoin’s price drop suddenly? The drop is likely due to a combination of technical selling after breaking the $87,000 support level, increased sell orders from large holders, and a cautious broader market sentiment. Should I sell my Bitcoin now? This is a personal decision based on your investment goals and risk tolerance. Panic selling during a dip often locks in losses. Many investors use these periods to reassess their strategy rather than make impulsive moves. How low could the Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact price levels is impossible. However, traders often watch previous support zones, like $85,000 or $84,000, to gauge where buying interest might return. Is this the end of the Bitcoin bull market? A single-day drop does not define a bull or bear market. Bull markets are characterized by higher highs and higher lows over a sustained period. This could simply be a correction within that larger trend. What is the best thing to do during a price drop? The best action is often to do nothing rash. Review your original investment thesis, ensure you are not over-leveraged, and consider if your long-term outlook has changed. For some, it may be a strategic buying opportunity. Where can I get reliable Bitcoin price information? Use reputable aggregate sites or data from major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken for real-time prices. Always cross-reference information. Found this analysis of the Bitcoin price movement helpful? Market insights are best when shared.

Its tiered access and strategic whitelist offer a chance to secure tokens at the lowest entry level, setting the stage for potential exponential growth before broader market momentum kicks in. Hesitation could mean missing the jump entirely. While Apeing gears up for its moment, Bitcoin continues to set the stage as the market anchor. With large institutional moves and strategic liquidity injections, BTC provides the foundation on which altcoins like Apeing can rally. Meanwhile, Cardano refines its vision, rolling out enterprise integrations and privacy-focused upgrades to strengthen its ecosystem. Together, these three playmakers create a backdrop where early action matters more than ever. Why Apeing Is the Spotlight of the Best Upcoming Crypto Scene Apeing stands out in the crowded altcoin arena, making it one of the best upcoming crypto opportunities for 2025. Its unique tiered approach ensures early participants access Stage 1 at a fraction of the listing price, giving both small-scale traders and serious investors a clear advantage. By using a whitelist, Apeing reduces chaotic public-entry competition, letting strategic participants maximize gains before the wider market hype fully kicks in. The narrative driving Apeing is simple but powerful. While others endlessly debate charts and indicators, Apeing rewards instinctive, timely action. Historical patterns in crypto confirm that those who act first, taking bold yet measured steps, often capture outsized returns. Its combination of structured early access, active community engagement, and market readiness cements Apeing as more than hype; it’s a calculated opportunity in the best upcoming crypto space. Bitcoin Holds the Fort: Institutional Moves Shape Market Momentum Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem, trading near $87,908.77 with a market cap of $1.755 trillion. Approximately 19.97 million BTC are in circulation out of a maximum of 21 million, emphasizing scarcity and long-term value. Daily trading volumes hover around $36.16 billion, reflecting consistent activity from both retail and institutional investors. Its dominance ensures that market sentiment often pivots around BTC’s movements, creating a reference point for altcoins and shaping overall liquidity and investor confidence. Recent institutional strategies underscore Bitcoin’s role as a market anchor. Several firms have paused fresh BTC acquisitions, redirecting $748 million into dividend reserves, signaling a focus on accumulation rather than immediate trading. This careful, strategic approach stabilizes the broader market, providing predictability that benefits the entire crypto ecosystem. Investors interpret these moves as long-term confidence in BTC’s fundamentals, reinforcing its reputation as a reliable store of digital capital amid volatile market conditions. Cardano Shapes the Future: Upgrades and Enterprise Momentum Cardano continues its research-driven expansion, trading at roughly $0.366 with a 24-hour volume of $537 million. The network emphasizes enterprise adoption, proof-of-stake efficiency, and privacy-enhancing protocols, positioning itself as a strong Layer 1 contender. Active community participation strengthens governance and ecosystem development, supporting projects that aim for real-world impact. These strategic focuses make Cardano a blockchain that balances sustainability with technological innovation, attracting developers and enterprises while maintaining network security and scalability. Recent announcements highlight Cardano’s commitment to practical applications and ecosystem growth. By integrating tier-1 stablecoins and advancing privacy-focused projects like Midnight, the network broadens DeFi and enterprise capabilities. These developments solidify Cardano’s long-term roadmap, enhancing investor confidence in its scalability, governance, and adoption potential. As the blockchain matures, its focus on real-world utility, energy efficiency, and technological upgrades ensures that Cardano remains a sustainable and forward-thinking platform in the competitive Layer 1 landscape. Stage Importance: Why Early Access Matters In the world of crypto, timing is everything. Stage 1 of Apeing provides the lowest entry tier, offering participants tokens at $0.0001 before broader market exposure. Early entry often means immediate upside once the coin lists at $0.001, delivering a potential 10× return before wider momentum builds. Understanding these stages is crucial for those looking to maximize gains and avoid public-sale chaos. Stage-based access also aligns incentives with community engagement. Participants gain not only financial exposure but also a sense of strategic positioning. This approach prevents reckless market behavior and creates a loyal base of early adopters ready to support long-term project growth, making Apeing a standout in the competitive landscape of the best upcoming crypto.

The price is trading below $2,950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a rising channel with support at $2,980 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it settles below the $2,880 zone. Ethereum Price Faces Rejection Ethereum price failed to stay above the $3,000 pivot level and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin . ETH price dipped below $2,980 to enter a bearish zone. The bears were able to push the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,775 swing low to the $3,075 high. Besides, there was a break below a rising channel with support at $2,980 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,980 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

The first key resistance is near the $3,000 level. The next major resistance is near the $3,050 level. A clear move above the $3,050 resistance might send the price toward the $3,120 resistance. An upside break above the $3,120 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,200 resistance zone or even $3,220 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,000 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,880 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,775 swing low to the $3,075 high. The first major support sits near the $2,845 zone. A clear move below the $2,845 support might push the price toward the $2,800 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,775 region.

XRP Positive/Negative Sentiment Has Gone Down In a new post on X, analytics firm Santiment has discussed about the latest trend in the Positive/Negative Sentiment for XRP. This indicator measures the ratio between the positive and negative comments related to the asset that are appearing on the major social media platforms. The metric works by going through social media posts/comments/threads to separate for those making mentions of the cryptocurrency and putting them through a machine-learning model. This model classifies each post as “positive” or “negative.” The indicator counts up the number of comments in each category and finds the ratio between them. Related Reading: Bitcoin Perps Heat Up Again As Leveraged Longs Rise When the value of the Positive/Negative Sentiment is greater than 1, it means posts pertaining to a bullish sentiment are dominant on social media. On the other hand, the metric being under the threshold implies a bearish mentality is shared by the majority of users on these platforms. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the XRP Positive/Negative Sentiment over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP Positive/Negative Sentiment saw a huge spike earlier in the month, implying positive comments related to the coin shot up on social media platforms. What followed this burst of optimism among retail traders, however, was a drop in the cryptocurrency’s price. This pattern of the asset going against the crowd expectations is something that has been witnessed in digital asset markets throughout history. Based on the historical trend, the analytics firm has defined regions where the likelihood of a reversal move becomes notable. The positive sentiment spike witnessed earlier in the year broke into the “greed zone,” corresponding to the area where price corrections tend to happen. Since the plunge in the XRP price, sentiment among retail social media users has deteriorated fast, with the Positive/Negative Sentiment plummeting all the way to a value of 1.01. At this value, bearish comments aren’t dominant yet, but the fact that negative posts are balancing out the positive ones is still something to take note of. In fact, this value is firmly inside Santiment’s “fear zone,” implying that the current degree of bearish sentiment is already significant.

XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $1.90, down 1.3% over the last 24 hours.

Headlines erupted, and the crypto community cheered. However, a crucial reality check hides behind this dazzling nominal figure. When you adjust for inflation, the inflation-adjusted BTC price tells a different, more sobering story. According to a detailed analysis, Bitcoin’s real value hasn’t yet breached the $100,000 barrier. Why does this gap exist, and what does it mean for your investment strategy? What is the Real Inflation-adjusted BTC Price? Alex Thorn, Head of Research at Galaxy Digital, applied a critical lens to Bitcoin’s headline number. By benchmarking the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) to 2020 and adjusting Bitcoin’s price accordingly, he calculated the asset’s true purchasing power. The result? Bitcoin’s real, inflation-adjusted all-time high sits at $99,848. This means the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar has eroded so significantly that today’s record high doesn’t buy as much as it seemingly should. Why Your Dollar Buys Less: The Silent Tax of Inflation To understand the inflation-adjusted BTC price , you must first grasp inflation’s relentless effect. Since 2020, the real purchasing power of the U.S. dollar has fallen by approximately 20%. Think of it this way: The Same Basket Costs More: What $100 bought in 2020 now requires about $120. CPI as the Benchmark: The government uses the CPI to track the average price change of a basket of consumer goods and services. A 20% Erosion: This decline is the “silent tax” that diminishes the value of cash holdings over time. Therefore, a nominal price record doesn’t automatically translate to a real-value record. The inflation-adjusted BTC price cuts through the noise to show the asset’s strength against this erosion. How Do We Calculate the True Bitcoin Value? The calculation is straightforward but powerful. Analysts take Bitcoin’s nominal price and adjust it downward to reflect the dollar’s lost purchasing power. They use monthly CPI data from 2020 to the present. For instance, if the CPI shows a 20% increase since the base year, a $126,000 Bitcoin today has the equivalent purchasing power of roughly $105,000 in 2020 dollars. The fact that the adjusted figure is below $100,000 highlights how substantial inflation has been. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Investors? This analysis is not meant to spread fear but to foster clarity. Understanding the inflation-adjusted BTC price provides a more accurate benchmark for success. Here are the key takeaways: Context Over Hype: It separates nominal price hype from genuine purchasing power growth. A Sturdier Benchmark: The $100,000 level becomes a more meaningful psychological and financial target to watch. Long-Term Perspective: It reinforces Bitcoin’s narrative as a hedge against currency debasement. The very need for this adjustment proves why such an asset is valuable. Essentially, Bitcoin’s journey to a true, inflation-smashing high is still underway. The next major headline should be when the inflation-adjusted BTC price decisively crosses the $100,000 threshold. The Compelling Conclusion: Look Beyond the Nominal Number Bitcoin’s surge to $126,000 is an undeniable testament to its growing adoption and market strength. However, the wise investor looks deeper. The inflation-adjusted BTC price reveals that in terms of real-world purchasing power, Bitcoin’s peak is still ahead. This perspective doesn’t diminish Bitcoin’s achievement; it reframes it. It highlights the relentless pressure of inflation and sets a clearer, more honest target for the next bull run. True victory isn’t just a number on a screen—it’s a number that holds its value against the test of time. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does ‘inflation-adjusted BTC price’ mean? A: It means Bitcoin’s price is recalculated to account for the decrease in the U.S. dollar’s purchasing power due to inflation. It shows what the price would be if the dollar had the same value as it did in a base year (like 2020). Q: Why is the inflation-adjusted price lower than the nominal price? A: Because inflation has made each dollar worth less. A $126,000 Bitcoin today can buy fewer goods and services than a $126,000 Bitcoin could have in 2020, so its real value is adjusted downward. Q: Is Bitcoin still a good hedge against inflation if its adjusted price is lower? A: Yes, absolutely. The fact that we are even having this conversation proves the point. While its adjusted price hasn’t set a new real high yet, its nominal price soaring while the dollar weakens demonstrates its potential as a store of value compared to cash. Q: How often is the CPI data updated, and how is it used? A: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics releases CPI data monthly. Analysts use this data stream to continuously calculate the real purchasing power of currency and, by extension, the real value of assets like Bitcoin. Q: Should I wait for the inflation-adjusted price to hit $100k before investing? A> Not necessarily. Investment decisions should be based on a broader strategy, including your financial goals and risk tolerance. This metric is a tool for understanding true value, not a direct investment signal.

The latest signs indicate that consumer sentiment remains broadly positive regarding the economic outlook, even as prices continue to rise and financial markets become jittery. And while inflation has increased the price of goods and services on a day-to-day basis, and fluctuations in the equity market have added to the pressure on the growth trend, they have not been large enough to alter the overall optimism significantly. The overall consumer sentiment index hit 109.9 in December, according to the Bank of Korea’s report on Wednesday. That was a 2.5 point decrease from November’s eight-year high, but well above a neutral 100, which helps demarcate optimism from pessimism. At this metric, consumer sentiment is strong enough to provide robust support for durable growth in consumer spending, and with it, working hours and wages. Here, the point is that optimism moderation was coupled with a widening range of consumer prices and greater currency volatility. Those measures have somewhat subdued household sentiment, but in general, confidence is stronger than in past eras of economic uncertainty. Rising prices and currency swings weigh on confidence Inflation remained a problem for households as they approached the end of last year, despite the continued rise in costs of food, utilities, and services. These price pressures “partially dampened” some of the optimism experienced in November, when confidence peaked at its highest level in eight years, the Bank of Korea said. The slight decrease was the result of higher consumer prices and a greater exchange rate volatility, the central bank added. Still, exports have been broadly resilient this year, bolstered by strong semiconductor shipments. That’s despite higher US tariffs on Korean goods that have impacted Seoul’s second-largest export market. Importantly, the fall in confidence was modest. The index remained well above the neutral range, suggesting that households were still broadly optimistic about their income outlook, labour market conditions, and future spending, even though they may be more cautious of short-term risks. Strong exports and housing optimism support the outlook Sentiment was also reflected in external demand, with exports performing relatively well for the year overall. Strong chip sales have also proved to be a significant boost, helping South Korea cope with poor performance elsewhere, which has continued to be marked by global trade uncertainty. Even with the United States slapping tariffs on some Korean goods, which have put the brake on shipments to Seoul’s second-largest export market, that resilience has been on. Elsewhere, robust demand for advanced chips has supported the impact and helped underpin overall export momentum. This consumer sentiment strength has been reflected in the Bank of Korea’s economic forecasts. In November, it revised its growth forecast for this year to 1% and for the future to 1.8%, due to sustained domestic consumption and export support from abroad. Housing expectations were also a significant factor in shaping consumer sentiment. A sub-index measuring expectations for home prices rose for a second-straight month, up 2 points to 121. In parts of Greater Seoul, this includes prices for apartments, which have also climbed, although at a slower pace. The index of consumer expectations regarding household debt, meanwhile, remained steady at 96 for the second consecutive month. This persistence suggests that concerns over borrowing have not increased, despite house prices remaining stable. The Bank of Korea stated that there are still risks to the economy, including a weak Korean won and high home prices in Seoul, which are likely to persist. The central bank stated that those factors could impact financial stability. Keeping consumer confidence above the neutral level for an eighth consecutive month suggests that households continue to have greater expectations for the future as 2026 begins, it added.

The South Korean crypto exchange giant has announced a critical, temporary suspension of its crypto deposits and withdrawals . This planned pause is a proactive step for security and transparency, but it requires your immediate attention to avoid any trading disruptions as the year ends. What’s Happening with Bithumb’s Services? Bithumb will temporarily halt all crypto deposits and withdrawals for a 10-hour window. This suspension is scheduled for December 31st, from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. UTC. The primary reason for this pause is to conduct a mandatory, regular asset audit. Therefore, this is a standard operational procedure, not a reaction to any security incident. However, it’s crucial to understand what this means for your account. During this period, you will not be able to move funds onto or off the Bithumb platform. Let’s break down exactly what is and isn’t affected. What Services Are Affected (And What Aren’t)? Knowing the scope of this suspension helps you plan your crypto activities accordingly. Here is a clear breakdown: Paused Services: All cryptocurrency deposit and withdrawal functions will be completely inactive. Available Services: Crucially, spot trading on the Bithumb exchange will continue to operate normally. You can still buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies within your account balance. This distinction is vital. The audit focuses on verifying the assets Bithumb holds, not on the trading engine itself. Think of it as a bank counting its cash in the vault while the teller windows remain open for transactions between account holders. Why Are Regular Crypto Exchange Audits So Important? You might wonder why a major exchange like Bithumb needs to pause services for an audit. The answer lies in trust and security. Regular asset audits are a cornerstone of a reputable cryptocurrency exchange’s operations. They serve several key purposes: Proof of Reserves: Audits verify that the exchange holds the full amount of customer assets it claims to, a practice often called Proof of Reserves. Regulatory Compliance: In South Korea’s strict regulatory environment, such audits are often mandatory to ensure compliance with financial laws. User Confidence: Transparent audits build user confidence by demonstrating the exchange’s solvency and operational integrity. Therefore, while a temporary halt on Bithumb crypto deposits and withdrawals is an inconvenience, it ultimately contributes to a safer and more transparent ecosystem for all users. Actionable Steps for Bithumb Users Before Dec. 31 Don’t get caught off guard. To ensure a smooth experience, consider these simple steps before the suspension window begins: Plan Your Transfers: If you need to deposit funds for trading or withdraw profits, complete these actions well before 8:00 a.m. UTC on December 31st. Review Open Orders: Ensure any time-sensitive trading strategies do not rely on the ability to move assets during the 10-hour window. Stay Informed: Monitor official Bithumb announcements for any updates, though such planned audits typically proceed on schedule. By taking these precautions, you can navigate this routine maintenance without any impact on your crypto strategy. Conclusion: A Sign of Strength, Not Weakness In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, transparency is paramount. Bithumb’s decision to conduct this audit and temporarily pause crypto deposits and withdrawals reflects a commitment to robust financial practices. While it requires minor planning from users, this procedure reinforces the exchange’s dedication to security and regulatory compliance. Ultimately, such measures are designed to protect user assets and maintain the long-term health of the trading platform. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade on Bithumb during the suspension? A1: Yes. Spot trading will remain fully operational. Only the deposit and withdrawal functions for cryptocurrencies will be paused. Q2: Will my funds be safe during the audit? A2: Absolutely. The audit is a verification process. Your assets remain secure in Bithumb’s wallets. The pause is a procedural step to ensure an accurate snapshot of holdings. Q3: Does this affect Korean Won (KRW) deposits or withdrawals? A3: The announcement specifies cryptocurrency services. Typically, fiat currency (KRW) channels are managed separately and may not be affected, but you should check Bithumb’s official notice for complete details. Q4: What happens if I try to initiate a transaction during the pause? A4: The interface for crypto deposits and withdrawals will likely be disabled or will reject any transaction attempts during the 10-hour window. Your request will not be processed until services resume. Q5: Are other exchanges doing similar audits? A5: Yes. Regular asset audits are becoming a standard best practice for major, compliant cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide to ensure transparency and build trust. Q6: Will services resume exactly at 6:00 p.m. UTC? A6: Bithumb aims to restore services at the stated time. However, in rare cases, audits can take slightly longer. It’s always wise to allow for a small buffer before initiating critical transactions immediately after the deadline. Found this guide on Bithumb’s essential service update helpful?
