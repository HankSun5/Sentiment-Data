Investors are moving out of saturated meme tokens and back into assets with clearer narratives and forward-looking momentum. XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE are two names that keep surfacing on analyst dashboards—each for very different reasons, yet both riding a wave of renewed interest. Why Analysts Are Backing MAGACOIN FINANCE for 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE, now in Stage 3 of its rollout, has surpassed millions in funding across its early stages. The project stands out for its capped supply (170 billion tokens), zero-tax design, and smart contract audit by HashEx. But the bigger story lies in how it’s positioning itself—not just as another meme token, but as a commentary on power, decentralization, and community control. Analysts have noted its early-stage similarities to Dogecoin’s community roots, but without the infinite supply and loosely defined direction. Instead, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers something sharper: cultural positioning mixed with transparent rollout mechanics and no venture capital ownership. It’s this blend of structure and narrative that has prompted some desks to frame MAGACOIN FINANCE as the “XRP of the memecoin sector.” While XRP builds utility through institutions, MAGACOIN FINANCE leans on social ideology—yet both are pushing toward longevity, not just short-term pumps. XRP Clears Room for MAGACOIN FINANCE XRP, long a symbol of institutional crypto, is benefiting from the thaw in regulatory tensions and rising odds of ETF approval. Its settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year cleared a major hurdle, making it more accessible to funds, treasuries, and retail platforms. With Bloomberg analysts now placing XRP ETF approval odds above 90%, the token is drawing significant inflows, even as the broader market shows signs of fatigue. But this attention isn’t confined to legacy altcoins. It’s also spilling over into a new class of assets built on narrative and ideology. At the center of that shift is MAGACOIN FINANCE—a decentralized political memecoin that’s gaining ground as older meme coins slow down. DOGE and SHIB Cool Off as Traders Hunt Fresh Momentum Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, once unstoppable, are now retracing. DOGE is down nearly 50% year-to-date, with SHIB following a similar trendline. Neither token has introduced major protocol upgrades or ecosystem shifts in recent months, leaving traders to weigh opportunity cost. As capital exits from these positions, attention is turning toward meme assets that still feel early—and MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing that momentum. Its community has grown steadily across social platforms, and discussion around future exchange listings is building. While DOGE and SHIB remain cultural staples, they’re no longer driving portfolio gains. Instead, they’re digesting previous highs while newer entrants take their place in the spotlight. Bottom Line: New Cycle, New Contenders XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE represent different ends of the crypto spectrum—one institutional, the other ideological. But both are demonstrating staying power in a market that’s actively sorting substance from noise. With ETFs, audits, community growth, and clear narratives, they’ve emerged as assets that can carry into the next cycle. DOGE and SHIB aren’t gone—but their roles are shifting. No longer the face of momentum trades, they’re watching from the sidelines as newer, sharper projects take the lead.

Meanwhile, SRM Entertainment completes its historic $100 million TRX treasury launch , staking 365 million tokens with a 10% annual yield, targeting corporate balance sheet adoption. A strong technical foundation emerges with the price above the 20-day ( $0.2764 ), 50-day ( $0.2671 ), 100-day ( $0.2566 ), and 200-day ( $0.2392 ) EMAs, as institutional treasury strategies drive unprecedented corporate adoption. Source: Cryptonews The market cap reaches $26.89 billion, with a steady daily volume of $477.09 million supporting structural consolidation momentum. The following analysis synthesizes ChatGPT’s 42 real-time technical indicators, corporate treasury developments, institutional adoption metrics, and ecosystem growth data to assess TRX’s 90-day price trajectory amid the emerging altcoin treasury movement. Technical Foundation: Bullish Structure Above All EMAs TRON’s current price of $0.2834 reflects a decline of -1.25% from its opening price of $0.2870 , establishing a tight trading range between $0.2880 (high) and $0.2812 (low). This controlled volatility demonstrates uptrend stability within established parameters. RSI at 58.54 remains in healthy bullish territory, with substantial room for continued appreciation without concerns of overbought conditions. Source: TradingView MACD indicators show early bullish development, with the MACD line at 0.0008 trading above zero, confirming a positive momentum direction. The positive histogram at 0.0007 suggests building momentum acceleration, despite a slight signal line divergence. The exceptional technical strength stems from its price positioning above all major EMAs, a rare bullish alignment that indicates a robust trend structure. Trading above the 20-day EMA ( $0.2752 ), 50-day EMA ( $0.2709 ), 100-day EMA ( $0.2623 ), and 200-day EMA ( $0.2454 ) creates multiple support levels confirming sustained uptrend validity. Corporate Treasury Shift: $100M TRX Staking Strategy SRM Entertainment has achieved a major milestone, completing its $100 million TRON treasury launch by staking 365 million TRX tokens through the JustLend protocol, targeting an annual return of 10%. SRM Entertainment, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRM) announced the completion of its $100 million TRON treasury strategy deployment. The company has staked 365,096,845 TRX on JustLend to earn up to 10% annualized returns, combining staking rewards and energy rental income.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 30, 2025 The treasury strategy combines staking yields with energy rental income, creating diversified return streams that appeal to corporate treasury managers seeking yield enhancement. SRM is also rebranding to Tron Inc. with Justin Sun as an advisor. SRM Entertainment’s unique business model extends beyond crypto, manufacturing souvenirs for Disney, Universal Studios, and Six Flags, demonstrating how mainstream corporations can integrate cryptocurrency treasury strategies. The company’s $150 million market valuation, following a 13.5% stock surge, validates investor approval of crypto treasury adoption. This development positions TRON alongside Ethereum, Solana, and XRP in the emerging altcoin treasury movement, where corporations diversify balance sheets beyond Bitcoin. The 10% yield potential substantially exceeds traditional corporate cash management returns, driving institutional interest. Historical Performance: Steady Recovery Building Momentum TRON’s 2025 price action exhibits remarkable stability compared to the broader cryptocurrency market’s volatility. January-March saw consistent trading ranges of $0.25 – $0.27 , establishing a strong base for current appreciation. April and May saw minor corrections to the $0.24–$0.25 levels, representing healthy consolidation that created accumulation opportunities without breaking the technical structure. June’s recovery to a $0.27 closing price established momentum continuation patterns that support current technical positioning. Current price action above $0.28 represents the extension of the established uptrend, with corporate treasury validation providing fundamental support for continued appreciation. Support & Resistance: EMA Stack Provides Multiple Safety Nets Immediate support emerges at today’s low around $0.2783 , reinforced by the strong 20-day EMA support at $0.2752 . This confluence creates an initial foundation for any short-term retracements during the current institutional positioning. The exceptional support structure extends across multiple EMA levels, including the 50-day EMA at $0.2709 , the 100-day EMA at $0.2623 , and the 200-day EMA at $0.2454 . This tiered support system provides multiple safety nets that appeal to risk-conscious institutional investors. Resistance begins at today’s high around $0.2829 , followed by the key psychological level at $0.2850–$0.2900 . Breaking above this zone would indicate acceleration toward major psychological resistance at $0.3000–$0.3100 . Strong resistance emerges at previous range highs around $0.3900–$0.4000 , representing the December 2024 all-time highs. Stablecoin Infrastructure: USDT Dominance Drives Utility TRON’s leadership in stablecoin settlements also creates sustainable demand drivers beyond speculative trading. The network processes five times more USDT transactions than Ethereum, demonstrating superior efficiency for institutional settlement needs. $USDT supply on #TRON has surpassed $80B, now representing over 50% of all circulating #USDT . This solidifies TRON’s position as the dominant stablecoin settlement layer. Track stablecoin flows with Glassnode: https://t.co/Lk7vkD8US6 pic.twitter.com/S6dfTYFhgz — glassnode (@glassnode) June 27, 2025 Daily transactions have nearly doubled since September 2023 , indicating accelerating adoption across both retail and institutional segments. Market Metrics: Steady Growth Supporting Corporate Adoption TRON maintains a $26.7 billion market capitalization with moderate 1.35% market dominance, positioning TRX as an established infrastructure rather than a speculative altcoin. The $434.17 million daily trading volume provides adequate liquidity for institutional participation. The circulating supply of 94.78 billion TRX represents a complete token distribution, eliminating concerns about supply overhang that affect other projects. This transparency appeals to corporate treasury managers requiring predictable tokenomics. The volume-to-market cap ratio of 1.46% indicates healthy trading activity without excessive speculation. Current pricing is 36% below December 2024 all-time highs, providing attractive entry points for institutional investors while maintaining substantial appreciation from 2017 lows. Social Sentiment: Corporate Validation Drives Community Optimism LunarCrush data reveals strong community engagement with a Galaxy Score of 50, indicating positive sentiment momentum. The 86% positive sentiment reflects the community’s enthusiasm for corporate treasury developments and technical performance. Social dominance of 0.6% with 337.94K total engagements demonstrates steady community interest without speculative excess. This balanced engagement profile supports sustainable appreciation rather than pump-and-dump patterns. Recent social themes focus on corporate treasury adoption, Nasdaq milestone achievements, and technical breakout potential. 90-Day TRX Price Forecast Corporate Treasury Expansion (Bull Case – 40% Probability) Additional corporate treasury adoptions following SRM’s success could drive appreciation toward $0.35–$0.40 , representing 24–42% upside. This scenario requires successful institutional onboarding and sustained yield generation from staking strategies. Technical targets include $0.30 psychological resistance, followed by $0.35 and $0.40 based on historical levels. Corporate treasury momentum could attract additional institutional interest, creating sustained demand above speculative patterns. Gradual Appreciation (Base Case – 45% Probability) Continued steady growth within the current uptrend channels could target $0.32–$0.35 over the next 90 days . This scenario reflects sustained technical momentum, albeit without a dramatic acceleration in corporate adoption. Support at the EMA structure between $0.2450 and $0.2750 would likely hold during normal consolidation periods. Volume maintaining current levels around 120–140 million TRX daily supports measured appreciation. Technical Correction (Bear Case – 15% Probability) Breaking below the 50-day EMA support at $0.2709 could trigger a correction toward $0.2450–$0.2600 . This scenario would require broader market weakness or disappointments in corporate treasury strategy. The strong EMA support structure limits downside risk, with the 200-day EMA at $0.2454 providing key long-term trend support. TRX Forecast: Infrastructure Excellence Meets Corporate Validation TRON’s positioning reflects the convergence of technical strength, corporate treasury validation, and infrastructure advantages in stablecoin settlements. The 42-signal analysis reveals a cryptocurrency positioned for institutional adoption beyond speculative trading. SRM Entertainment’s $100 million treasury launch sets a precedent for corporate TRX adoption through yield-generating strategies. Technical indicators confirm a bullish structure, with the price above all major EMAs, while RSI positioning and positive MACD development suggest that momentum is building. Current consolidation above $0.28 , with corporate validation, creates optimal positioning for accelerated institutional adoption. The combination of technical strength, yield generation potential, and infrastructure advantages positions TRX for sustained appreciation as corporate treasury strategies expand throughout 2025 .

47482546,https://cryptonews.com/?p=379067,1751668339,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/47482546.jpeg,"Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana and Cardano by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/gemini-ai-xrp-solana-cardano-price-predictions-2025/,"Google’s Gemini predicts that leading altcoins may find new price highs through the latter part of 2025. See, in the last 24 hours Bitcoin rose to $109,997, which put it just 1.6% short of beating its historic price peak of $111,814 on May 22. Clearly bulls are looking to recapture that ground fast, which bodes well for various other leading cryptocurrencies, since Bitcoin clearly sets the pace of growth for the rest of the industry. This persistent market optimism has led many to believe that the next bull cycle could eclipse the legendary 2021 bull market, with altcoins expected to chart unprecedented highs. Here are several digital assets that Gemini has identified as having strong growth potential in the coming months. XRP (Ripple): Google’s Gemini Expects a Smooth Doubling for This Global Payments Leader According to Gemini’s forecasts, Ripple’s XRP could reach $20 by late 2025—effectively increasing ninefold from its present price of around $2.23. This positive projection is driven by growing institutional integration, strengthened regulatory clarity, and speculation regarding a potential XRP spot ETF approval, which would broaden access to institutional and retail buyers. XRP continues to enjoy worldwide recognition for facilitating quick, low-cost, and compliant cross-border payments. In 2024, the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) lauded XRP for its effectiveness in facilitating instant international remittances without intermediaries. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! UN Endorses @Ripple and @StellarOrg as Cornerstones of New Global Payments Network! #XRP and #XLM will run the new financial system! pic.twitter.com/ufewexCKmR — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 13, 2024 A landmark U.S. court decision ruled that XRP’s retail sales did not constitute securities transactions, delivering a major setback to the SEC’s long-standing claims. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed in March that the protracted legal battle had finally concluded, removing a major obstacle and lifting market sentiment for XRP and the broader altcoin space. In the short term, resistance around $3 remains a key test. Should XRP surpass this barrier in the coming months, a move toward $5 (Gemini’s most conservative target) by year-end becomes increasingly feasible. However, getting to Gemini’s most ambitious target of $20 would require serious political developments, mainly a framework for regulating crypto in the US and a peaceful solution to the Middle East crisis. It’s also worth noting that XRP is clearly the best-performing coin among the projects with billionaire market caps. In the last 365 days, its price has risen 397% compared to Bitcoin’s meager 88%. Solana ($SOL): Gemini Projects This High-Throughput Blockchain Could More-Than-Treble by New Year Solana ($SOL) remains a formidable player in the smart contract ecosystem, second only to Ethereum in terms of decentralized application deployment and user activity. With its market cap now approaching $80.5 billion, SOL continues to attract developer interest and institutional funds. Speculation is mounting around the potential approval of a Solana spot ETF in the U.S., which could mirror the substantial capital inflows seen for Bitcoin and Ethereum after their ETF launches. Moreover, discussions of including SOL within a proposed U.S. digital asset reserve are enhancing its standing among large-scale investors. From a technical perspective, Solana has reversed its previous downtrend. After sliding from highs above $250 in January to lows near $100 in April, it recently broke out from a descending wedge pattern in early April—a formation typically viewed as bullish—and now trades for $150. Gemini’s projections place SOL at $500 by the end of 2025, up from its current trading price of around $150, more than tripling its value. A bullish summer could see SOL reaching $300, while a subsequent rise into the $500 range is considered well within reach. Some analysts even believe Solana can hit the the $1,000 milestone, but it would require the green light of US crypto legislation to catalyze such a big price movement. Cardano ($ADA): Google’s Gemini Predicts a Massive 10X Upsurge for This Smart Contract Pioneer Cardano ($ADA) was recently sighted in the crosshairs of US President Donald Trump, who took to his social media platform, Truth Social, to post a proposal to include ADA as part of a US Strategic Crypto Reserve strategy. Unlike Bitcoin, which the plan suggested the government could directly acquire, Cardano would be sourced exclusively via law enforcement seizures. Created by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano staked its reputation on a rigorous, research-driven development approach and emphasis on scalability and environmental sustainability. With a market valuation near $21 billion, ADA remains a key competitor to Ethereum and is closing in on rapidly growing blockchains like Solana. Gemini’s models suggest ADA could reach $5.66 by the end of this year—a near tenfold jump from its current level of $0.58. Technically, ADA has been consolidating within a descending wedge pattern since late 2024. A breakout above its $1.10 resistance could trigger a short-term rally toward $1.50. Under a strong bull market scenario, even Gemini’s most conservative upside target of around $3 could see ADA surpassing its previous all-time high of $3.09. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): Meme-Driven Layer-2 Solution Primed for a Breakout While Google’s Gemini excels in evaluating established assets, it may not fully account for the explosive potential of early-stage projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . This presale-phase, meme-inspired Layer-2 protocol merges viral marketing with technical innovation. Although $HYPER is not yet trading on major exchanges such as Gemini, its presale has already raised over $1.9 million, with early backers eyeing potential 10X returns post-launch. Leveraging Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) architecture, Bitcoin Hyper integrates smart contract capabilities into the Bitcoin ecosystem through its proprietary Layer-2 network. Its Canonical Bridge supports rapid and cost-efficient transactions alongside an expanding suite of DeFi and NFT functionalities. Recent security audits by Coinsult found no key vulnerabilities, enhancing investor confidence. The native $HYPER token powers governance, staking, fees, and access to its ecosystem, while staking yields currently reach as high as 408% APY.

DOGE is trading below all major EMAs with a massive 636.62M volume surge as it tests key support at the $0.155–$0.160 zone. Strong selling pressure emerges as the price falls below the 20-day EMA ( $0.16855 ), 50-day EMA ( $0.17932 ), 100-day EMA ( $0.19104 ), and 200-day EMA ( $0.20457 ), amid heightened political drama, introducing volatility. Source: Cryptonews The market cap stands at $24.33 billion , with an explosive 42.16% volume surge to $908.02 million , validating institutional repositioning during periods of uncertainty. The following analysis synthesizes ChatGPT’s 42 real-time technical indicators, political developments, sentiment metrics, and technical patterns to assess DOGE’s 90-day trajectory amid escalating political tensions and chart pattern formations. Technical Breakdown: Bearish Structure Dominates All Timeframes Dogecoin’s current price of $0.16241 reflects a major 5.58% daily decline from its opening price of $0.17201, establishing a concerning trading range between $0.17296 (high) and $0.16128 (low). This $0.01168 intraday spread indicates high volatility during periods of political uncertainty. Source: TradingView RSI at 43.57 approaches oversold territory without reaching extreme levels, indicating balanced momentum despite intense selling pressure. This positioning suggests DOGE remains vulnerable to further declines without immediate reversal signals from technical indicators. MACD indicators display conflicting readings with the MACD line at 0.00176 , trading slightly above zero, which suggests underlying bullish momentum. However, the negative histogram at -0.00733 indicates strong bearish momentum divergence requiring careful monitoring for breakdown cues. Source: TradingView Political Drama Impact: Musk-Trump Tensions Drive Volatility The political feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has introduced volatility to DOGE, with speculation surrounding the DOGE agency creating uncertainty among investors. This political drama represents a departure from traditional meme-driven rallies, introducing systematic risk to DOGE’s price action. Donald Trump on whether or not he’ll deport Elon Musk amid their feud: “I don’t know. We’ll have to take a look. We may have to put DOGE on Elon, You know what DOGE is? DOGE is the monster that might have to go back and eat Elon.” pic.twitter.com/eO4FB0QTTh — Pop Base (@PopBase) July 1, 2025 Elon Musk’s speculation about a new American party has generated increased attention for potential meme coin boom scenarios, although current political tensions have overshadowed these bullish narratives.

Time for a new political party that actually cares about the people. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 30, 2025 The timing of political developments coincides with technical breakdown patterns, amplifying downward pressure. Ascending Triangle Formation: Bulls Maintain Hope Despite Breakdown Technical analysts identify a large ascending triangle pattern on weekly charts, representing a classic bullish structure despite current price weakness. The pattern shows DOGE holding trendline support around $0.17 , though the recent breakdown challenges this bullish thesis. $DOGE Weekly Chart Update $DOGE is forming a large ascending triangle pattern on the weekly — a classic bullish structure!

This pattern typically resolves with upward breakouts, though current political tensions complicate traditional technical analysis assumptions. Source: TradingView Multiple bounces off key support zones indicate institutional interest in DOGE accumulation during periods of weakness, although the recent breakdown below triangle support raises questions about the pattern’s validity. The next few weeks will be key in determining whether bulls can reclaim triangle support or bears continue driving prices lower. Historical Context: Sharp Correction from January Highs DOGE’s 2025 performance exhibits extreme volatility following January’s strong close at $0.33 , representing the local high for the year. The subsequent correction to February’s $0.20 and stabilization around $0.17 in March and April established the current trading ranges. May’s modest recovery to $0.19, followed by June’s decline to $0.16, demonstrates DOGE’s inability to sustain momentum without major catalysts. Current price action represents the continuation of the correction cycle that began after January’s peak performance. The 51% decline from January highs to current levels reflects DOGE’s high-beta nature and sensitivity to sentiment shifts. This historical context provides perspective on current weaknesses while highlighting DOGE’s potential for dramatic reversals during periods of positive catalysts. Support & Resistance: Key Levels Define Next Direction Immediate support emerges at today’s low of around $0.16128 , reinforced by the key support zone at $0.15500-$0.16000 . This confluence represents the most significant technical level for determining DOGE’s near-term direction and potential for deeper correction. Major support zones extend from $0.14000 to $0.15000, representing historical accumulation levels, followed by strong support from $0.12000 to $0.13000, corresponding to previous cycle lows. These levels provide multiple safety nets during extended correction scenarios. #Dogecoin is at the third touchpoint of an ascending channel, making it the ideal buy level before a huge surge $Doge /M1 pic.twitter.com/ZiYlzKPAaG — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) July 4, 2025 Resistance begins immediately at the 20-day EMA, located at $0.16855 , representing the first hurdle for any potential recovery attempts. The key resistance cluster lies between the 50-day EMA ( $0.17932 ) and the 100-day EMA ( $0.19104 ), creating a challenging overhead supply. Market Metrics: High Volume Confirms Selling Pressure DOGE maintains a $24.33 billion market capitalization with an exceptional 24-hour trading volume of $908.02 million , representing a massive 42.16% surge. The volume-to-market cap ratio of 3.74% suggests intense selling pressure during periods of political uncertainty. The high volume surge to 636.62M DOGE confirms institutional repositioning during breakdown attempts, validating technical analysis rather than suggesting accumulation. This volume pattern supports a bearish interpretation of current price action. Source: CoinMarketCap Current pricing represents a 78% discount to the all-time highs achieved in 2021 , although comparison to recent highs shows a 51% decline from the January 2025 peaks. This positioning provides long-term value arguments while acknowledging significant technical damage. Social Sentiment: Community Optimism Fights Technical Reality LunarCrush data reveals resilient community engagement with 83% positive sentiment despite recent price weakness. The social dominance of 2.95% with 2.71 million total engagements demonstrates DOGE’s ability to maintain attention during correction periods. Recent social themes have focused on ascending triangle formations, accumulation opportunities, and long-term bullish scenarios targeting the $1 level. The prophecy: $1 $DOGE pic.twitter.com/SESlJ33hMT — Chimp of the North (@cryptochimpanz) July 4, 2025 Community discussions emphasize technical patterns while acknowledging the short-term political headwinds that affect price action. The disconnect between social sentiment ( 83% positive) and technical indicators (bearish) represents typical DOGE community behavior during correction periods. This resilient sentiment provides fundamental support for eventual recovery scenarios. 90-Day DOGE Price Forecast Political Resolution Rally (Bull Case – 30% Probability) Resolution of Musk-Trump political tensions, combined with a breakout from an ascending triangle, could drive the recovery toward $0.25–$0.29 , representing a 54–79% upside. This scenario requires political clarity and successful defense of $0.155–$0.160 support zone with volume confirmation. Source: TradingView Technical targets include $0.20 , $0.25 , and $0.29 based on triangle pattern measurements and historical resistance levels. The meme coin narrative could resurface strongly if political uncertainties resolve favorably for DOGE-related speculation. Extended Correction (Base Case – 50% Probability) Continued political uncertainty and technical breakdown could drive DOGE toward $0.12–$0.14 , representing a 14–26% downside. This scenario assumes ongoing political tensions and failure to hold key support levels during summer trading periods. Source: TradingView Support at $0.155–$0.160 would likely fail during an extended correction, with volume normalizing around 400–500 million DOGE daily. This sideways-to-downward action provides better accumulation opportunities for long-term holders seeking lower entry points. Deep Correction (Bear Case – 20% Probability) Severe political escalation or broader market weakness could trigger a correction toward $0.10–$0.12 , representing a 26–38% downside. This scenario would require strong negative catalysts beyond current political tensions. Source: TradingView The strong community sentiment and meme coin resilience limit extreme downside scenarios, with major support at $0.12–$0.13 providing key long-term trend support for future recovery cycles. DOGE Forecast: Political Drama Meets Technical Breakdown DOGE’s current positioning reflects the convergence of political uncertainty, technical breakdown, and community resilience. The 42-signal analysis reveals that the cryptocurrency is positioned at a key juncture between pattern continuation and a major correction. Current consolidation around $0.16 with critical support at $0.155 – $0.160 creates a decision point for DOGE’s trajectory. The combination of political drama, technical weakness, and community optimism positions DOGE for volatile price action as catalysts develop throughout Q3 2025 .

As optimism for the future of digital currencies gains momentum, three standout ventures are leading the discussion. This article reveals which tokens are poised for substantial growth and why they are generating so much buzz. Hyperliquid Gains Soar Amid Key Price Levels and Momentum Hyperliquid showed steady gains with a weekly change of 8.21% and a monthly gain of 7.47%. Over the last six months, the coin surged by 54.82%, reflecting a robust upward movement. Price action during these periods reveals an asset building momentum while recovering from lower levels, indicating increasing trader confidence. The current trading range shows levels migrating between $31.70 and $46.60, demonstrating a balanced market dynamic. Bulls maintain the upper hand as the coin trades above the nearest support at $23.85, while buyers challenge resistance at $53.65. A second layer of resistance at $68.55 and support at $8.95 provide reference points for traders. Market indicators portray a nearly neutral trend with the RSI at 53.42 slightly favoring bullish momentum. Traders may consider accumulating positions near support levels while monitoring for movements above resistance, which could signal higher targets. A cautious approach is advisable if price action moves toward the lower bound, as slipping below $23.85 may trigger a bearish correction. AVAX Recent Swings and Key Levels to Watch AVAX experienced mixed price movements recently, with a weekly increase of about 5.7% followed by a monthly drop of around 13.84%. Over the past six months, the coin declined nearly 57.31%, indicating cautious trading and heightened selling pressure. The price action in the last month shows the market struggled to maintain upward momentum, with investors reacting to broader market concerns. The significant six-month decline underscores a prolonged period of downward pressure affecting trader sentiment and valuation. Price volatility and frequent adjustments have shaped AVAX’s trajectory, with investors closely monitoring temporary gains amidst an overall bearish backdrop. At present, AVAX is trading in a range between $14.82 and $21.92, with key support at $11.69 and resistance near $25.89. Current indicators, such as the Awesome Oscillator at -0.885 and a Momentum Indicator near -0.014, suggest a slight leaning toward sellers. The RSI at 46.86 implies that pressure is building on the downside, despite recent weekly gains indicating a hint of recovery. Bears are currently dominant due to the lack of a sustained upward trend, yet bulls may find opportunities if prices bounce off support. A move above $25.89 could push prices toward the next resistance at $32.99, while a slip below $11.69 may lead to drops toward $4.59. Trading within these levels suggests buying at lower extremes and potential short positions near resistance, making tighter stop-loss management advisable. Toncoin: Recent Sell-off and Key Levels to Watch Toncoin experienced a notable downtrend over the past six months, with its price dropping nearly 50.82%. In the last month, the coin’s price fell about 11.47%, indicating continued bearish pressure in the market. The trading range has been volatile, with small weekly gains of 0.04% failing to reverse the larger downward momentum. The coin's struggle to regain upward strength reflects overall weakness and uncertainty in recent sessions. Currently, Toncoin trades between $2.55 and $3.34, with immediate resistance near $3.76 and support around $2.18. Additional barriers are noted at $4.56 on the upside and $1.39 on the downside. Key indicators, including an Awesome Oscillator at -0.139 and an RSI of 42.08, highlight a lingering bearish bias. Without a clear trend, traders might look for buying opportunities near support levels or consider short plays if the price fails to break resistance. Observing price action within these levels is crucial for short-term strategies. Conclusion HYPE , AVAX , and TON are gaining traction in the crypto sector. These projects are starting to define the future of the industry. They offer fresh possibilities and innovative solutions. Each one brings unique features and potential. This prominence suggests promising developments ahead. These projects are not just trends but pivotal players. They indicate a more robust direction for the sector. Expectations are high for what they will achieve next. The conversation around them reflects the growing optimism. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

47484438,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=783458,1751670001,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/47484438.jpeg,"Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 As Analyst Calls It A ‘Powder Keg’",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-price-targets-3000/,"The Ethereum price is flashing major upside signals as on-chain and market activity align toward a potential breakout to the $3,000 level. With crypto exchange balances falling to their lowest in nine years, stablecoin rails hitting record highs, and Spot Ethereum ETF inflows spiking last month, analysts now describe ETH as a “powder keg” primed for explosive movement. Ethereum Price Eyes A $3,300 Breakout The Ethereum price action is drawing attention as it continues to trade within a well-defined consolidation range, hovering near $2,555 at the time of writing. Based on a recently released technical analysis by crypto analyst Pentoshi on X social media, ETH could be on the verge of a significant move, with $3,300 marked as the next bullish target in the near term. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts $10,000 ATH For Ethereum This Cycle, Here’s Why The crypto expert’s chart reveals that since early May 2025, Ethereum has been locked between two key levels—a support zone around $2,190 and resistance near $2,750. This range has remained intact for over eight weeks, signaling a period of accumulation and low volatility after the sharp decline experienced in the first quarter of the year. Pentoshi has pinpointed $2,100 as the key downside risk in his bullish outlook, aligning closely with the lower support zone marked on the chart. While the next bullish extension and major resistance level has been identified as $3,300, the analyst expects Ethereum to make a move toward this price level within the next three months. He suggests that the current setup offers a favorable risk-reward profile, estimating a potential upside of roughly 3.2x compared to the downside risk. Analyst Calls Ethereum A “Powder Keg” In other news, Eric Conner refers to Ethereum as a “powder keg,” highlighting a growing convergence of fundamental factors that are building up pressure and positioning the cryptocurrency for a potentially parabolic move in the market. Related Reading: The Ethereum Waiting Game: Breakout To $2,800 Or Crash To $2,000? The analyst reports that Stablecoin activity on Ethereum has reached historic highs, with the total market capitalization of on-chain dollar-denominated assets hitting $251 billion—a record that also marks 21 consecutive months of uninterrupted growth. In parallel, Ethereum Spot ETFs have brought in $1.17 billion in net inflows during June alone, marking a major shift in investors’ appetite for ETH exposure. Even more notable, the amount of Ethereum available for trading is now at its lowest level in nearly a decade, with only nine million ETH tokens on centralized crypto exchanges. This nine-year low in exchange balances signals a drying float, where any fresh demand has an outsized impact on price. Conner has stated that large-scale crypto investors are beginning to take note. He reports that wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH have accumulated more than 800,000 tokens daily during the peak week in June, marking the most aggressive absorption by whales since 2017. Currently, price action mirrors tension, and the analyst warns that if Ethereum decisively clears the $2,600 resistance level, the combination of supply scarcity, ETF-driven demand, and explosive stablecoin usage could unleash a violent and rapid breakout.

The latest example is a major partnership with Major League Rugby’s Seattle Seawolves. As of July, BlockDAG (BDAG) is now the Official Blockchain Partner of the Seawolves for the 2025 season. This marks a step toward blending Web3 tools with how fans enjoy sports. The Seattle Seawolves, founded in 2017, are two-time MLR champions and one of the league’s original teams. Known for strong play and loyal support, they stand for discipline, strength, and teamwork. These same values reflect BlockDAG’s aim to build better digital systems and strong user communities. But this deal isn’t just about branding. It shows a shift where blockchain becomes something fans can see and use. From ownership to digital access, this is a new way for fans to connect with their team. Bringing Fans Closer With Digital Access A key part of the BlockDAG-Seawolves deal is the use of blockchain tools like NFTs and fan tokens. These are not just digital items to collect. They open doors to real fan moments. Fans will be able to trade digital keepsakes, take part in team polls, and view premium content. From owning a key match moment as an NFT to joining special Q&As with players, fans now have new ways to stay connected to their team. Nicolaas van den Bergh, Chief Marketing Officer at BlockDAG, shared: “This partnership helps reshape fan experiences by building stronger ties through trust, creativity, and shared digital moments.” Stories, Content, and Inside Views The partnership also includes a co-branded content series shared on Seawolves’ official pages each month. These videos and posts will include game clips, fan input, interviews, and match polls. All of it aims to grow the team’s digital fan world and bring fans closer to the action. There will also be personal content led by players, giving fans a closer look at the behind-the-scenes life. From practice to game-day rituals, these stories are meant to create real bonds between the team and its supporters. This approach fits well with BlockDAG’s larger goals. For BlockDAG, building in Web3 is not only about tech. It’s about giving people ways to join in, be part of the story, and help shape the experience. A New Chapter in Sports and Digital Connection Shane Skinner, CEO of the Seattle Seawolves, shared his thoughts on the new partnership: “We are thrilled to partner with a leading blockchain innovator like BlockDAG to deliver immersive, digital-first experiences to our passionate fanbase.” His comment shows the deeper goal behind the partnership. The Seawolves are not using blockchain just for hype. They aim to improve how fans connect with the team and create lasting loyalty in a digital space. From BlockDAG’s side, sports offer a clear path to connect with more people. With over 200,000 BDAG holders and a crypto presale that has passed $329.5 million, the platform is growing from a focus on tech tools to building its presence in culture and trust among fans. The Seawolves collaboration is one of two major sports deals BlockDAG revealed in July. The other is with the Seattle Orcas, a cricket team in Major League Cricket. These two moves highlight a plan to reach new groups of people, from rugby followers in North America to cricket fans across the world. More Than a Deal, It’s a Direction The BlockDAG-Seawolves partnership is more than just a single news update. It shows where Web3 could go next. Sports bring people together. They carry emotion, community, and now, with help from blockchain, the chance for fans to play a more active digital role. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release coming on August 11 and BDAG coins still available at a set price of $0.0016, BlockDAG is showing signs of growing far beyond early crypto circles. It’s stepping into real-life places, from sports arenas to fan screens. For those who follow the Seawolves, this could be a fresh way to enjoy the game. For the larger crypto space, it sends a strong message: BlockDAG is not just building a network. It’s helping shape how people share, connect, and experience sports in a digital age.

Our Jito price prediction expects the JTO price to record a maximum of $8.56 in 2025. In 2030, we expect the JTO price to achieve $57.27. In December 2023, the Jito (JTO) token airdrop garnered significant attention for the Solana blockchain , which had been facing challenging times. The event also highlighted the importance of liquid staking on Solana while empowering holders to influence platform governance. Based on these developments, we’ve compiled our Jito price prediction, explored the factors behind these forecasts, and provided insights into the role and utility of the JTO token.

JTO/USDT Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and currently hovers around the 47 level, showing that bears control price momentum. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours.

The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the JITO price from an immediate surge. However, if the JITO price successfully breaks above $2.257, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $2.545. JTO/USDT Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, JITO price may drop below the immediate support line at $1.88, resulting in a correction to $1.557. Is Jito a good investment? For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network’s largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2025 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Why is the JTO down today? JTO’s price gained strong selling pressure around local highs, resulting in a strong decline. This created a push below $2. Will the JTO price recover? If buyers hold above the $2 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will JTO reach $10? JTO price might reach the $10 mark in 2025 if buying demand surges and Jito attracts altcoin investors. However, our JTO price prediction states it might reach the $10 level by 2026. Will the JTO price reach $100? Due to the effort of the Solana community, JITO Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment. Recent news/ Opinion on JTO news SOL Strategies has announced the launch of a new initiative to support critical infrastructure within the Solana ecosystem. The Canada-based public company revealed on June 26 that it has established a Strategic Ecosystem Reserve (SER), starting with a purchase of over 52,000 Jito (JTO) tokens, valued at more than $100,000. Jito price prediction July 2025 Over the last few days, JTO coin prices have aimed to surge above crucial Fib levels. If the BTC price aims for a hold above $110K this month, we might see a solid surge in the JTO price. According to technical analysis, the JTO price might record a maximum level of $2.9 and a minimum of $1.3, with an average value of $2.1 throughout July. Jito price prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high Jito Price Prediction July 2025 $1.3 $2.1 $2.9 Jito price prediction 2025 According to JTO tokenomics, additional Jito tokens will be released at the start of 2025 and will continue throughout the year. This increase is likely to exert downward pressure on the value of Jito crypto. However, 2025 is also expected to showcase the significant impact of the Bitcoin Halving, which could propel crypto markets and tokens to new all-time highs, potentially boosting the Jito token price. A comprehensive technical analysis of past pricing trends suggests that in 2025, Jito is anticipated to have a minimum price of $1.1. Its maximum price could reach $8.56, with an expected average trading value of $7.34.

Unlike many meme coins that rely purely on hype, it’s positioning itself a bit differently—mixing familiar meme energy with a pointed political angle and a zero-tax setup. That’s helped it catch the eye of investors who care about more than just quick flips. It brings together aspects of Dogecoin and SHIBA INU, but with a clearer ideological stance, which broadens its appeal. From casual meme fans to people who appreciate decentralized projects like Ethereum and Cardano, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing a diverse crowd. At this stage, its long-term path looks likely to depend on whether it can keep that community engaged as the market continues to shift. Community Still the Driving Force for MAGACOIN FINANCE Amid all these big institutional moves and network upgrades, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to stand out for a simpler reason: steady community momentum. Conversations on social media platforms and crypto forums have kept picking up, largely thanks to its decentralized governance model and unmistakable political branding. While it gets compared to the early days of Dogecoin and SHIBA INU, MAGACOIN FINANCE sets itself apart by putting ideology and a community-led structure at its core. As the broader altcoin world adjusts to new regulations and tech developments, this authentic, bottom-up energy could be its biggest strength. Solana’s First Staking ETF Could Open New Doors Over in the broader altcoin market, Solana is about to mark a milestone. On July 2, the REX-Osprey SOL+Staking ETF is set to launch, making it the first U.S.-listed ETF that combines direct Solana exposure with on-chain staking rewards. That means traditional investors can now access staking income alongside typical price movements, which could be a pretty compelling option. Analysts generally view this as a step forward that may encourage more institutional players to become involved with altcoins. Some projections for SEC approval of a straightforward spot Solana ETF by 2025 are now as high as 95%. This could also set the stage for similar products tied to networks like XRP and Litecoin. Still, not everyone’s jumping in headfirst. There are concerns about Solana’s ongoing unlock schedules and lighter network usage at present, which may keep larger investors on the sidelines in the near term. Polygon (MATIC) Navigates an Important—and Tricky—Upgrade Polygon is also going through a big moment with its upgrade to Polygon 2.0, which means moving from the old MATIC token over to the new POL asset. It’s a complex process, highlighted by Binance having to temporarily pause MATIC deposits and withdrawals on July 1. For now, MATIC is running into some resistance on the charts. Looking ahead, most forecasts for 2025 suggest a moderate upside, generally clustering around $0.27 to $0.29, while more optimistic views point closer to $0.47. However, much of that hinges on how smoothly this transition unfolds and whether Polygon can continue to expand its reach across DeFi, NFTs, and scaling solutions. The Takeaway: MAGACOIN FINANCE Stays the Course as Altcoins Shift As Solana rolls out its first staking ETF and Polygon pushes through a critical upgrade—plus MATIC testing resistance—the altcoin market is evolving. Through all of this, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out its own lane by blending meme appeal with political messaging and a community-first approach. It’ll be worth watching how this mix plays out as the next chapter for decentralized, culturally driven crypto projects unfolds.

This surge sets the stage for other digital currencies to shine. Discover the top three altcoins poised for significant growth, ready to ride the wave of Bitcoin's impressive rally. Find out which coins are primed to take off next. SUI Price Recap: Past Weakness Followed by Recent Rally SUI experienced a 9.55% decline over the past month and a steep 44.39% drop over the last six months. A recent surge saw a 12.94% gain in the past week, indicating a brief recovery amid ongoing uncertainty. The price performance shows marked volatility, reflecting shifting market sentiment and periods of bearish pressure following significant downturns. The current trading range is between $2.19 and $3.48, with immediate resistance at $4.19 and support found at $1.59. Technical indicators present a mixed picture; momentum is modest, and the RSI hovers around 50, suggesting balance after the recent bounce, while other measures indicate lingering weakness. Bulls have gained recently, but the trend remains unclear. Traders might consider waiting near support levels for opportunities to buy, while sellers could target resistance levels. Cosmos (ATOM) Price Trends and Key Trading Levels Cosmos experienced a 7.5% drop over the past month and a steep decline of nearly 44% over the last six months. Price action over the past week showed a modest gain of about 4.8%, highlighting a coin that has struggled to maintain upward momentum. Overall, the trend points to ongoing weakness, with historical price behavior indicating a longer-term bearish sentiment. Despite the brief recovery, challenges remain in reversing the downturn, leaving investors cautious about future movement. The current trading band for Cosmos rests between $3.56 and $4.63. Immediate support is positioned at $3.03, with resistance at $5.16. The relative strength index around 48.51 reflects a balance between buying and selling pressures, though negative readings from momentum measures suggest bears remain dominant. The recent uptick hasn't significantly shifted the trend, prompting traders to watch for a potential bounce near support or a breakout at resistance as market conditions evolve. Ethena (ENA) Price Snapshot: Past Performance and Current Levels Over the past month, ETHENA experienced a notable drop of 22.18% from its price levels, while a one-week uptick of 5.04% offered a brief glimpse of recovery. Over the last six months, the coin suffered a steep decline of 78.64%. Price movements ranged between $0.2011 and $0.3549, marking clear volatility. Data shows that ETHENA’s performance has been considerably downbeat, emphasizing the impact of bearish market influences and investor caution. Currently, the coin trades within a range that sets a strong support at $0.13 and offers a nearest resistance of $0.44, with a second resistance level at $0.59. Trading decisions depend on whether bulls can push the price above these resistance areas or if bears will keep the coin anchored near its low points. The momentum indicator sits very low at -0.0049, suggesting bears dominate given the falling moving average. Traders might consider short-term buying opportunities near the support level or betting on a break above the $0.44 resistance. Conclusion As Bitcoin crosses the $110k mark, attention now shifts to other promising coins. SUI , known for its strong community and unique features, is expected to gain traction. ATOM shows potential due to its interoperability between different blockchains. ENA , with its innovative technology, could also see significant growth. These altcoins are positioned to perform well in the coming days. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently announced that the company submitted its application to the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), signaling Ripple’s intention to operate under both federal and state oversight. Already holding a BitLicense from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), Ripple’s potential federal charter would place it under more comprehensive regulatory supervision. According to Garlinghouse, the goal is to enhance public and institutional trust. Direct Access to the Federal Reserve In addition to its OCC application, Ripple is also pursuing a master account with the Federal Reserve through its subsidiary , Standard Custody. If approved, this account would allow Ripple to hold reserves for RLUSD directly with the central bank. Such access could provide Ripple with a substantial advantage, offering enhanced transparency and security for stablecoin holders. True to our long-standing compliance roots, @Ripple is applying for a national bank charter from the OCC. If approved, we would have both state (via NYDFS) and federal oversight, a new (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market. Earlier in the week via… https://t.co/IdiR7x3eWZ — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) July 2, 2025 This level of direct integration with the Federal Reserve would set RLUSD apart from most stablecoins on the market, aligning it more closely with financial institutions that prioritize regulatory clarity and central bank engagement. Implications for XRP and RLUSD Ripple’s regulatory push has sparked discussion within the crypto community, especially regarding its potential impact on the utility and value of XRP. A prominent analyst, known as “XRP Investing,” suggested that with federal approval and Fed access, Ripple could be seen as operating on par with traditional banking giants like JPMorgan. He argued that RLUSD would become significantly more credible under this framework, and XRP could be increasingly adopted for international settlements. This sentiment reflects broader expectations that institutional players are more likely to engage with digital assets that operate under strict compliance regimes and central bank connectivity. Assessing XRP’s Price Potential To estimate XRP’s possible future valuation under various scenarios, ChatGPT was asked to model several assumptions. One approach evaluates XRP’s role in facilitating global payments. If Ripple captures 10% of SWIFT’s estimated $150 trillion annual volume, and XRP is used with a turnover rate of 25, the total required liquidity would be around $600 billion. With approximately 55 billion XRP tokens in circulation, this results in a baseline valuation near $10.91 per coin, assuming purely utility-based demand. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another perspective considers XRP’s use in supporting RLUSD’s transaction volume. If RLUSD grows to match USDC’s $32 billion market cap and XRP bridges half of its $100 billion in yearly transfers with a turnover rate of 20, $5 billion in XRP liquidity would be needed. Given full regulatory oversight from both the OCC and NYDFS, plus direct Fed access, a strong trust premium could apply, projecting XRP’s price to approximately $13.65. Ripple’s ambitions also extend into facilitating the transfer of tokenized real-world assets, such as bonds and real estate. With the tokenization market expected to reach over $16 trillion by 2030, Ripple capturing even a small share could require XRP to support large transaction volumes. If 3% of that market is routed through Ripple and XRP manages a quarter of that on-chain, the liquidity need could hit $120 billion. Accounting for speculative and institutional demand, this model suggests a potential price of about $21.80 per token. A final valuation scenario relies on projected transaction activity. If XRP processes $30 billion in daily settlement volume once adopted by banks, and the market applies a Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio typical of high-utility blockchains (25–30), the total implied market cap could approach $900 billion. Divided by the current supply, XRP’s estimated value would fall around $16.36. While all projections remain speculative, they demonstrate the possible valuation range for XRP if Ripple achieves full regulatory integration and expands its role in institutional finance. Approval of a national bank charter, combined with access to a Federal Reserve master account, would not only enhance RLUSD’s stability but also position XRP as a credible bridge asset in global financial systems.

Yet this massive pool of paper gains cuts both ways, signaling both strong bullish sentiment and a latent risk of sudden sell pressure. Bitcoin’s rally above $107,000 raised unrealized profits to around $1.2 trillion. Source: Glassnode Investors are HODLing on to their Bitcoins Despite the theoretical windfall, BTC investors have demonstrated notable restraint. Data shows that realized profits are declining, long-term holder supply has reached new highs, and selling pressure from short-term holders has eased. This mix of massive unrealized gains and cautious behavior is representative of the market’s current dynamics. Bitcoin recently saw a sell-off to about $99,000 prompted by geopolitical tension between Israel and Iran. Yet, prices rebounded to $107,000 after a cease-fire, with support emerging near the $98,300 cost basis of short-term holders—a level that analysts say consolidates the bullish narrative. Off-chain capital inflows from institutional sources, such as U.S. spot BTC ETFs , averaging $298 million per week, also bolster demand even as existing investors hold steady. The combination of patient holders and fresh institutional liquidity paints a picture of a deepening, mature market. However, the situation is precarious. While holding remains dominant, a shift in sentiment could unleash significant selling pressure. Analysts warn that current price levels are “insufficient to trigger significant profit-taking,” and note that the market may need to move higher (or lower) to unlock additional supply. History says pressure to sell is due Historical precedent amplifies the concern of wholesale profit-taking. CryptoQuant’s network unrealized profit/loss (NUPL) indicator has previously flashed sell signals when unrealized profits spiked, often ahead of market pullbacks. Similarly, previous reports note that long-term holders historically start spending and increasing sell-side pressure when their average unrealized gains reach around 350%, which reportedly happens near the $100,000 price zone. This suggests that rising prices could shift sentiment even among staunch holders, creating a feedback loop of profit-taking and price corrections. Despite these risks, the institutional cohort continues to strengthen Bitcoin’s market foundation. The Gemini‑Glassnode Q2 report shows over 30% of circulating BTC now resides in centralized entities, including ETFs, exchanges, custodians, and sovereign treasuries. Moreover, off-chain venues now account for over 75% of trading volume , signaling that price discovery is migrating toward regulated, institutional platforms. That’s a structural evolution that, while supporting liquidity, could also mean more organized and potentially sudden sell pressure from big stakeholders. Analysts continue to monitor the market Several analysts note that a meaningful price move, either surpassing the $110,000–$112,000 resistance or slipping below the recent $98,000–$99,000 support band, may be required to dislodge the market’s current equilibrium. As the market stands, Bitcoin’s $1.2 trillion in unrealized gains signals both its maturity and vulnerability. The enormous paper profits reflect investor confidence and institutional backing. At the same time, it signals a latent pool of potential selling fuel, one that could ignite if sentiment cracks or technical levels fail. For now, HODLing remains the dominant behavior, institutional inflows power momentum, and averages of realized profit and liveliness continue to decline.

On-chain data shows sustained negative exchange netflows of around 100,000 LINK per week, which indicates that whale entities are absorbing sell pressure without significant price disruption. LINK Faces Critical Test CryptoQuant stated that this trend contrasts with occasional retail-driven spikes, such as March 2025’s 5 million LINK deposit surge. Retail activity has stayed flat, as evidenced by the daily active addresses hovering between 28,000 and 32,000, while transaction counts remain stagnant at around 9,000 per day. Despite increased oracle utility, retail failed to capitalize on a minor activity bump seen in late 2024. Whale urgency is evident as exchange withdrawals peaked at 3,000 transactions per day in Q4 2024 and remain elevated, thereby steadily draining exchange reserves, which have fallen approximately 40% year-to-date. Neutral leverage metrics are preventing volatility and have allowed systematic accumulation without triggering a breakout above $15. A resolution to this deadlock will require a spike in retail participation to ignite momentum or a slowdown in whale withdrawals to weaken accumulation. Until a catalyst emerges, LINK’s structure matches Bitcoin’s 2023 consolidation phase before its surge in 2024. While this accumulation standoff continues on-chain, Chainlink has been expanding its broader ecosystem through partnerships. Collaborations With Mastercard and Visa Last month, the decentralized oracle network partnered with Mastercard to allow 3 billion cardholders to purchase crypto directly on-chain using fiat payments. The collaboration utilizes interoperability infrastructure and Mastercard’s global network to remove barriers to crypto access. Partners like Zerohash, Shift4, Swapper Finance, and XSwap support liquidity, compliance, and fiat-to-crypto conversion, bridging traditional payments with decentralized finance environments. Chainlink also completed a pilot under the HKMA’s e-HKD+ initiative with Visa, wherein the duo tested cross-border investment transactions using CBDCs and stablecoins. In the trial, ANZ’s AUD-backed stablecoin A$DC was converted into e-HKD and used to invest in a tokenized money market fund. Chainlink’s CCIP enabled asset transfers between ANZ’s private blockchain and Ethereum’s public testnet, while Visa’s VTAP managed the token lifecycle. The pilot demonstrated instant, compliant investment fund access, which reduced settlement times from days to just seconds, even on weekends.

LINK is stuck at a technical fork, with on-chain signals showing a cautious tone among whales. BONK, however, is picking up steam with a surge in trading volume and buyer activity. But BlockDAG (BDAG) ? It’s taking a bold route, slashing its presale entry price to just $0.0016, even as its batch 29 price hits $0.0276. This firm stance, tied to its upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11, is shaking up how crypto holders think about entry points. BlockDAG Freezes Presale at $0.0016 Ahead of GLOBAL LAUNCH Release BlockDAG has made a bold and strategic move by locking its presale price at $0.0016 ahead of its highly anticipated GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. This rare decision aims to shield retail participants from last-minute price jumps, giving them the same access as early buyers had. Despite the batch 29 price currently sitting at $0.0276, this limited-time pricing dramatically lowers the entry point and sets up buyers for stronger returns. With over 23.6 billion coins sold and $329.5 million already raised, BlockDAG’s presale is quickly becoming one of 2025’s headline crypto stories. The 2,660% ROI since batch 1 is already impressive, and the fixed $0.0016 price only boosts the potential upside. It’s no surprise that those tracking the best crypto for the 2025 bull run are zeroing in on BlockDAG, not just for its numbers, but for its calculated, user-focused approach. Rather than chasing volatile price swings, BlockDAG is dialing in stability. Freezing the price helps eliminate last-minute FOMO anxiety, giving new buyers a clear and confident way in. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release countdown now underway, BlockDAG isn’t just another presale; it’s shaping up as a well-timed opportunity for those planning ahead. BONK Price Update: Momentum Builds as Traders Target Resistance BONK is heating up. Trading volume jumped 98.33% to $160.5 million, and the buy-sell delta hit +127 billion tokens, hinting at strong accumulation. After bouncing off $0.000013, BONK touched $0.00001480 before settling near $0.00001446, showing that bulls are holding their ground. Open interest is also on the rise, up 6.68%, which adds weight to the idea that traders expect another leg up. Still, $0.000015 looms as a tough resistance. If BONK clears it, a stronger rally could follow. If not, a pullback to test lower supports may be next. Indicators show a slightly overbought setup, so short-term dips wouldn’t surprise anyone. But the volume and open interest growth point to growing confidence. That’s why BONK remains on watch as a high-energy play in this current price cycle. LINK Price Forecast at a Crossroads as Bulls and Bears Pause Right now, the LINK price forecast is in limbo. Whale wallets are quiet, token movement off exchanges is slowing, and that’s a red flag for bullish momentum. LINK is holding above a short-term support zone, but the energy isn’t there to push decisively in either direction. All eyes are on the $13.5 to $13.9 range. A breakout or breakdown here could set the tone for the next move. The RSI sits in neutral territory, signaling indecision among traders. Until accumulation picks up again or a clearer trend forms, LINK’s next move is still uncertain. Whether it rallies or retreats will likely come down to how buyers respond in the next few sessions. BDAG Stands Out With Stable Entry & Long-Term Focus With BONK testing resistance and LINK caught in wait-and-see mode, BlockDAG is playing a different game. By freezing its presale at $0.0016, it strips out guesswork and gives buyers a firm entry, something rare this close to launch. Instead of reacting to market noise, BlockDAG is creating its own momentum. The GLOBAL LAUNCH release is dropping on August 11, and holders are noticing. For those tired of chasing spikes and looking for clarity, BlockDAG may just be the best crypto for the 2025 bull run , offering both structure and upside without the chaos.

Moving on to smart contract platform Ethereum ( ETH ), Martinez says he expects more choppiness until the top altcoin closes outside the $2,227-$3,385 range. “Heard a company added an inflationary asset like ETH to its balance sheet, and suddenly everyone’s bullish again. But let’s be real: I expect more chop until we get a sustained close outside the $2,227-$3,385 range.” Source: Ali Martinez/X ETH is valued at $2,579 at time of writing, a marginal increase on the day.

47488531,https://timestabloid.com/?p=73426,1751673647,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s Projected XRP Price if It Matches Tether (USDT) Peak Volume,https://timestabloid.com/heres-projected-xrp-price-if-it-matches-tether-usdt-peak-volume/,"The potential valuation of XRP continues to spark debate across the cryptocurrency space. Despite experiencing significant price swings and a decline from its all-time high of $3.84 in 2018, many investors and analysts still believe XRP remains undervalued, particularly in light of its intended use as a bridge currency for cross-border payments. While some observers remain skeptical about its long-term prospects, others maintain that XRP could see considerable growth if it begins to facilitate large-scale financial activity, particularly within institutional frameworks. One way to assess this possibility is by using a valuation model based on real-world utility rather than speculation. Measuring XRP’s Value Through Utility A widely referenced methodology for valuing digital assets comes from a research model developed by Robert Mitchnick and Susan Athey. Unlike approaches driven by market sentiment, this model estimates fair value based on a token’s role in actual economic activity. It evaluates the relationship between transaction volume, token supply, and how frequently each token is used. Using a publicly available calculator built on this framework, we assessed XRP’s value under a hypothetical but relevant scenario: what if XRP handled the same level of daily transaction volume as Tether (USDT) did at its highest point this year? The Benchmark: USDT’s Peak Volume Tether (USDT), the most actively traded stablecoin, recorded its peak daily volume on February 3, 2025, reaching $292 billion. This volume is driven by its widespread use across crypto exchanges and trading platforms as a base pair against top assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. By contrast, XRP’s highest daily transaction volume in recent years was $51.7 billion, which it achieved in December 2023. The comparison sets a high benchmark, but it provides a meaningful reference point for exploring XRP’s potential growth under optimal adoption conditions. Parameters Used in the Valuation To simulate XRP handling a $292 billion daily volume, several parameters were applied. First, we assumed that the average holding time for each XRP token is 10 days, reflecting active use in institutional settlements. We also estimated the value of XRP held as a store of value at $180 billion. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Next, the projection was made over three years, allowing sufficient time for growth in adoption, regulatory clarity, and Ripple’s ongoing efforts to expand utility. To factor in supply changes, we projected a circulating supply of 66.2 billion tokens by that time, accounting for the gradual release of XRP from escrow, approximately 200 million per month. Lastly, to bring the projected price back to present-day terms, a 2% annual discount rate was applied, representing a modest expected rate of return over the next three years. Projected Price Outcome With all these parameters in place, the model generated a present-value estimate of $44.13 per XRP. This would represent a substantial increase from its current market value of approximately $2.28 , a potential gain of nearly 1,836%. It’s worth noting that this outcome aligns with past forecasts from analysts like Mickle and EGRAG Crypto , both of whom have separately projected a $44 price point under favorable market conditions. However, this analysis does not serve as a price prediction. Instead, it illustrates what XRP could be worth if it supports transaction volumes comparable to leading stablecoins like USDT, assuming the appropriate infrastructure and institutional participation are in place.

You’ll hear claims that XRP is already reshaping global finance and leaving old systems in the dust. According to influencer Coach JV, Ripple is building a whole new rails for money. He says XRP isn’t here to compete with banks. It’s here to replace them. Related Reading: Ethereum Network Awakens—Massive On-Chain Moves Signal What’s Coming He points out that transactions on the XRP Ledger settle in 3–5 seconds and cost fractions of a penny. That beats SWIFT transfers, which can take days and cost up to $50 per payment. XRP still trades around $2,25 but that figure, he argues, won’t stay low for long if the token keeps winning regulatory approvals and new partners. XRP is the most disruptive financial technology of our lifetime. Ripple isn’t just competing with the banking system, it’s replacing it. The old system is dead. The new financial rails are being laid right before your eyes. Stay asleep and you’ll miss the greatest wealth transfer… — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) July 2, 2025 Ripple’s Technology Versus Legacy Rails Based on reports, RippleNet now counts more than 300 financial institutions in its network. Yet daily on‑chain volumes for XRP hover around $1 billion—small next to global cross‑border flows of roughly $150 billion per day. Banks are testing the tech, but most haven’t shifted large sums yet. That gap between tests and real‑world use is one reason XRP’s price has stayed below its all‑time high for seven years. Push For Regulatory Clarity XRP backers are watching the US carefully. They see growing buzz around spot XRP ETFs. Analysts like Eric Balchunas have given those filings up to 95% odds of approval by year‑end. If an ETF hits a US exchange, they say, more money will pour in. Ripple has also been chasing money‑transmitter licenses in Europe and Asia. Every new license, they believe, brings Ripple a step closer to mainstream use. Community Calls For Patience Coach JV keeps telling followers not to panic over a stagnant price. He uses phrases like “greatest wealth transfer in history” to drive home his point. In an earlier tweet, he promised “unimaginable wealth” for anyone who holds on. Other voices, such as commentator Edoardo Farina, point out that only about 1 to 2 million people hold XRP today. That number, they say, leaves room for 100 million or more newcomers—and more buyers often means higher prices. Related Reading: The Silent Bitcoin Accumulation: Public Companies’ Surprising H1 2025 Lead Analysts Caution Over Hype Even so, some experts urge caution. They note that bold forecasts don’t guarantee buy‑in from big banks or regulators. An ETF approval won’t force funds to rush in overnight. And test programs don’t always turn into full rollouts. For now, XRP remains a high‑risk play. Investors should track on‑chain metrics and regulatory milestones before getting swept up in the hype.

While MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to hold the attention of early-stage meme-powered altcoin fans, Chainlink’s sentiment appears to be softening as technical signals point to a period of cautious consolidation. MAGACOIN FINANCE Stays Early-Stage, Community-Driven MAGACOIN FINANCE is a meme-driven altcoin and is also a decentralised political memecoin. It is gaining steady traction, while Bitcoin remains the anchor of the crypto market. It is currently trading at the minimum, and the strength of the project refers to how well it is developed and its community. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a unique, zero-tax, community-governed meme altcoin with political and cultural implications. Hashex has duly audited the coin’s token, and the project does not have VC control, unlike most other speculative meme coins, which lack absolute transparency. People who supported the coin in its earlier days do so because of its ideology, thousands of active holders, an ever-increasing Telegram presence, and decentralisation. Traders have kept MAGACOIN FINANCE on their watchlists due to rumours about upcoming exchange listings. At the same time, the narrative of early-stage momentum helps traders find culturally relevant tokens that transcend hype-driven pumps. Its hybrid identity, which combines the viral meme-coin energy with governance focus more commonly associated with larger altcoins, enables it to carve a distinct niche for itself. Bitcoin’s Bullish Momentum Gathers Pace Bitcoin’s market action this month has reinforced its reputation as the bellwether asset in the crypto market. Trading activity has surged to new yearly highs, with large derivatives traders and prediction markets reflecting growing confidence that BTC could push toward a fresh all-time high in the coming months. Current estimates place an 85% chance of Bitcoin hitting new record levels before October 2025, driven by improving liquidity, risk-on investor sentiment, and easing geopolitical tensions. Despite the optimism, short-term traders have recently locked in profits, with some data indicating that short-term holders have sold significant portions of their BTC holdings since May. This has resulted in a notable imbalance in the derivatives market, where bearish perpetual futures positions outnumber bullish longs by approximately two to one. Even so, the underlying trend remains upward as strong buy-side support keeps BTC trading well above $108,000, with analysts eyeing key resistance at $110,000 to $112,000. A breakout above these levels could open the door to further gains into the $125,000–$140,000 range. Chainlink Sees Cautious Sentiment By comparison, Chainlink (LINK) has shown signs of short-term weakness in recent sessions. As of July 2025, LINK is holding near the $13.30–$13.40 range, maintaining key support levels around $13.00. However, recent declines and an inability to reclaim the resistance levels around $13.86 to $14.36 have made some traders more cautious. On the fundamentals side, Chainlink remains a cornerstone of the blockchain data ecosystem. Its decentralised oracle services and the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) continue to attract real-world enterprise pilots and tokenisation partnerships. Yet, near-term momentum appears muted as broader market sentiment recalibrates. Analysts see potential for a bounce back into the $14.50–$15.00 range if sentiment improves. Still, any further weakness could push LINK into a deeper consolidation phase, with downside targets around $12.80 or lower. A Market Balancing Accumulation and Early-Stage Opportunity In a market where cultural tokens, foundational blockchains, and data providers all coexist, investors are watching for assets that offer a clear edge, whether that’s Bitcoin’s liquidity leadership, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s decentralised political narrative, or Chainlink’s oracle dominance. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a unique opportunity for investors to get in early on an ecosystem with massive upsides.

This shift opens up new opportunities for savvy investors. Discover which DeFi projects are poised for significant growth and could potentially offer impressive returns. Jupiter (JUP) Price Insights: Past Declines and Key Support Zones JUP behavior shows a one-month drop of 18.01% and a six-month decline of 53.73%. A one-week gain of 12.07% hints at short-term movement amid longer-term pressure. Price action over the recent month was marked by a steady descent, with the half-year view underlining a significant weakening in value. The past figures indicate that the coin experienced a brief rally before facing sustained losses, highlighting a period of volatility and bearish influence. Current price stands between $0.34 and $0.57, with the first resistance at $0.69 and a higher barrier at $0.92. Support emerges at $0.21, with a secondary level at $0.00. Technical readings, including an RSI near 50, reveal a market lacking a clear trend. Bears hold sway for now, as reflected in the negative summary and moving average recommendations. Traders might target support at $0.21 for a bounce before considering a push higher, while breaks above $0.69 could trigger bullish activity. A cautious approach is advised, monitoring these key levels for decisive movements. Chainlink Price Shifts: Recent Rally Amid Long-Term Bearish Trends Chainlink experienced a modest rebound last week with a 3.75% increase. However, the asset declined about 5% over the month and saw a significant drop of over 43% in the past six months. This recent activity points to short-term gains, contrasting sharply with long-term bearish trends as selling pressure has dominated for several months. Price movements remain volatile, with brief moments of buyer activity, yet the overall trend suggests a lack of sustained upward momentum. Chainlink is currently trading within a range of approximately $11 to $15.70. Key resistance is noted around $18.03, with initial support at $8.63. Additional resistance appears near $22.73, and a secondary support level is at $3.94. Technical indicators provide a mixed picture, indicating balance between buyers and sellers, with the Relative Strength Index near 50. Recent trading reflects a minor weekly gain, but ongoing monthly and six-month declines show persistent selling pressure. Bulls need to overcome the $18.03 barrier, while bears may push prices toward support. Traders should watch for movements around $8.63 or potential pullbacks. Caution is necessary due to the mixed market signals. Aave: Price Fluctuations Signal Cautious Optimism for Recovery Over the last month, Aave witnessed modest gains as its price increased by 1.68%, following a strong one-week surge of 8.27%. The coin experienced mixed performance with a striking six-month decline of 22.90%, reflecting investor hesitance after prior volatility. Price actions during this period showcased erratic behavior, with brief bullish bursts amid broader downward trends, highlighting the challenges of market recovery. Investors exhibited cautious optimism, balancing short-term rallies with long-term decline, resulting in market sentiment oscillating between hope and uncertainty. Current prices trade between $216 and $328.64, with bulls eyeing a primary resistance level at $382.89 and a secondary target at $494.61, while bears support a near-term floor of $159.44 and a deeper level at $47.72. Indicators including an Awesome Oscillator reading of 8.83 and a Momentum Indicator of 7.18 point to moderate upward pressure, with an RSI at 53.32 suggesting near-neutral conditions. The market lacks a definitive trend, requiring careful positioning within these key levels. Traders may consider short-term entries to profit from rebounds toward resistance while using stop-loss orders beneath support levels to limit risk. Uniswap Price Rebound: Short-Term Gains Amid Long-Term Struggles Recent UNI price action shows a gain of nearly 11% over the past month following a marked recovery. Over the past six months, the coin fell by about 52%, indicating a significant long-term decline. The data outlines a striking short-term rebound contrasting with an extended downtrend, highlighting market hesitancy. The noticeable monthly improvement suggests renewed investor interest despite ongoing challenges. The contrasting figures indicate a volatile market where short-term gains exist alongside broader weakness in the coin's performance. Current activity places Uniswap between a support at $4.33 and a resistance level at $10.08, with the trading range being $5.73 to $8.61. The coin is testing these key levels as traders seek opportunities for breakouts or reversals. Indicators, such as a mildly bullish RSI at 54.19, hint at buying pressure, yet the overall trend remains unclear. There is potential for trades; bullish participants may push toward $10.08, while bearish traders could aim for a dip to support. Monitoring price reactions near these levels, along with volume, is essential for position management. Conclusion As capital shifts from Bitcoin to altcoins, key projects to monitor include JUP , LINK , AAVE , and UNI . Each of these offers unique features and potential growth. JUP focuses on creating a secure ecosystem. LINK enhances interoperability between smart contracts. AAVE allows users to lend and borrow assets. UNI is the governance token for a leading decentralized exchange. Observing these projects could provide insights into emerging trends and opportunities within the market.

MAGACOIN FINANCE Gets Early Traction at $0.00010425 While Ethereum’s developer community gears up for the next phase, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing how the meme-powered altcoin niche is evolving. Trading near $0.00010425, the decentralised political memecoin has been quietly building momentum, thanks to its clear anti-centralisation message and community-first model. Unlike typical meme tokens that rely on a few viral tweets to pump prices, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out a more structured identity. It’s both a meme-powered altcoin and a decentralised political memecoin, tapping into an ideological base that wants more than fleeting hype. Its zero-tax design, a fully audited smart contract, and a no-VC-control approach have resonated with early backers who value transparency. Telegram and X (Twitter) channels are filled with word-of-mouth updates about possible listings, and community-driven marketing. For meme traders watching Dogecoin’s recent volume dip, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s consistent engagement and ideological branding are a refreshing change of pace. Ethereum’s 2025 Upgrades: A Smart Contract Game-Changer Ethereum has long held its crown as the go-to platform for smart contracts, but network congestion and high fees have tested even its most loyal users. This year, the world’s largest smart contract blockchain is advancing with back-to-back upgrades aimed at addressing these pain points. The Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, 2025, combines the Prague execution layer fork and the Electra consensus layer upgrade, marking a major milestone since the Merge in 2022. With 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) rolled into one, Pectra introduces smart accounts, also known as “account abstraction,” making wallets significantly more flexible and secure. Now, users can even pay gas fees with tokens other than ETH, a minor detail that could have a significant impact on how dApps are used daily. Put simply, Ethereum’s 2025 roadmap appears to be a solid step forward, combining usability, scalability, and increased network participation. NEAR Protocol Slides but Holds Long-Term Promise Meanwhile, NEAR Protocol is navigating a patch of turbulence. The scalable Layer-1 blockchain is currently trading between $2.14 and $2.21, down slightly over the past few weeks. Technically, NEAR is hovering below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, often a sign that buyers are hesitant to jump in until stronger support appears. Still, NEAR’s fundamentals remain intact. The protocol continues to grow its ecosystem and developer base, and forecasts for 2025 remain moderately optimistic, with projections pointing to a potential range of $2.50 to $2.70 by year’s end if market sentiment stabilises. For now, though, NEAR is caught between broader market caution and its technical headwinds. Traders watching for value opportunities may see this consolidation phase as an entry point. Still, it’s clear that, compared to Ethereum’s upgrade buzz and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s meme-layer narrative, NEAR has work to do to regain momentum. The Takeaway: Three Projects, One Market Narrative Ethereum’s smart contract push underscores its commitment to being the backbone for DeFi, NFTs, and real-world tokenisation. MAGACOIN FINANCE shows that the meme-powered altcoin space can evolve with structure, governance, and cultural relevance.

The action is part of President Lee Jae Myung’s scramble to breathe life into a slowing economy and shield vital industries as trade tensions with the United States threaten to upend commercial ties. The supplementary budget , which was passed after bitter debates and a boycott by the opposition, is greater than the government’s proposal of 30.5 trillion won. Legislators tacked additional funding for direct cash handouts and emergency aid to distressed industries. The Finance Ministry said the new number shows the importance of falling back on more efficient support measures in light of the double risk of a slowdown in the country and international shocks. The new relief bill is arriving at a critical time. Seoul and Washington have a deadline of July 9 to resolve closing differences on the revised US-Korea Free Trade Agreement . US President Donald Trump has warned he may impose duties on imports from major trading partners, including South Korea, should the talks fail to bear fruit. Any move toward a reciprocal tariff increase from 10% to 25% would also seriously blow up Korean exports, such as automobiles, batteries, and semiconductors, propelling the economy. President Lee moves to close revenue gap with stimulus budget That bill contains a 10.3 trillion won fund to compensate for shortfalls in tax revenue. The government has been hit with lackluster corporate tax collections amid poor earnings in key sectors such as manufacturing and retail. Consumer demand is also down, putting yet more pressure on public finances. The government will fund that mostly through borrowing. The figure will mostly be for new sovereign bond issuance, spending cuts, and reallocating existing budget lines. Low-income families and struggling businesses will receive cash coupons and targeted relief. Additional money has also been allocated for industrial innovation, export assistance, and the creation of jobs. Despite a boycott of the legislation by opposition lawmakers who said the package lacked long-term vision and was not transparent, the ruling party forced the bill to pass parliament. However, the passage was a major early victory for President Lee, who was sworn in only last month after a snap election win. South Korea races to avoid US tariffs An impending trade cliff is spurring the urgency. A temporary deal that has largely kept Korean exports outside the reach of plumped‐up American tariffs expires soon. Without a new agreement, the tariffs would automatically rise to 25% on the targeted goods. President Trump has indicated that he may start sending unilateral tariff notices to US trading partners as soon as this weekend. That could give Seoul little time to respond or negotiate concessions. South Korea’s trade minister, Yeo Han-koo, is flying to Washington in a last-ditch diplomatic effort to ward off a worst-case scenario. “It’s still not clear to each side what the other side wants,” President Lee said, calling the trade talks frustrating and opaque. Failing to do so could come at a heavy cost for Korean exporters regarding near-term losses, diminished competitive standing globally, and possible layoffs. With more than 40% of GDP based on exports, Korea is extremely exposed to external shocks. If duties increase overnight, many industries, ranging from the automotive and electronics sectors to steel and shipbuilding, may lose their margins. Market analysts caution that any short-lived disruption could put a chill on GDP growth for the year and rattle investor confidence. And the political stakes are high, too. Running for president, Lee made economic reform and inclusive growth his platform. An inability to contain the fallout from tariffs imposed by the United States could undermine his administration’s credibility early in his tenure.

The move marks a major escalation in his push for what he calls “reciprocal” trade and comes just five days ahead of a self-imposed July 9 deadline for countries to strike deals with the US. Trump told reporters that “10 or 12” letters will be sent Friday, with additional notices expected in the following days. “By the ninth, they’ll be fully covered,” he said, referring to the expiration of the 90-day window he provided when initially announcing the tariff plan on April 2. The new tariffs could range from 10% to 70%, surpassing his earlier maximum of 50%. Trump pushes simple tariff deals as deadline pressures mount Trump reaffirmed his preference for direct tariff implementation over drawn-out negotiations, saying, “It’s much easier. I’d rather just do a simple deal where you can maintain it and control it.” He confirmed that payments from the tariffs would start flowing into the US beginning August 1. While importers or intermediaries pay tariffs, the ultimate cost is often passed to consumers or absorbed in profit margins. As the deadline nears, talks with key economies — including South Korea, Indonesia, the EU, and Switzerland — are in a critical phase. Bloomberg Economics estimates the average tariff on US imports could rise to 20% from just 3% before Trump took office. So far, only the UK and Vietnam have finalized agreements . A deal with China has resulted in a truce, easing tit-for-tat measures and loosening export restrictions. This week, Trump unveiled the Vietnam deal, which imposes a 20% tariff on Vietnamese exports and a 40% tariff on transshipped goods. Though lower than the initial 46%, the rates exceed the interim 10%. Vietnam, however, says negotiations are still ongoing. Global trade partners scramble for last-minute deals as tariff deadline looms Indonesia expressed optimism about finalizing a bold trade pact covering minerals, energy, and defense cooperation. Cambodia announced it had agreed on a reciprocal trade framework, with details to be made public soon. Trump had threatened Cambodia with a 49% tariff, one of the steepest. Japan, South Korea, and EU members are still finalizing accords. Some European automakers are pushing for tariff relief in exchange for increased US investment . South Korea’s top trade envoy is expected to visit Washington this weekend with fresh proposals in a last-minute attempt to avoid new tariffs. Trump has remained optimistic about reaching a deal with India but has sharply criticized Japan, describing it as a tough negotiator. This week, he said Japan might face tariffs as high as 35%. Despite growing concerns, Trump insisted there would be no delay to the deadline. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed Thursday that the president would decide whether countries negotiated in good faith and whether any extensions were warranted. “We’re going to do what the president wants,” Bessent said on CNBC. Markets slide, and fed holds firm as Trump’s tariff threats rattle the global economy Global markets reacted swiftly. Stocks in Asia and Europe dropped, and the US dollar weakened. American equity and bond markets were closed for the Fourth of July holiday. Federal Reserve officials remain cautious, with some warning that increased tariffs could stoke inflation — a concern that’s kept interest rate cuts off the table despite pressure from the White House. As Trump moves to reshape global trade through unilateral action, trading partners face a stark choice: strike a deal now or pay the price come August.

Chainlink is currently showing strong technical behavior, holding support around $12, with analysts watching for a potential climb toward $25. Meanwhile, Kaspa is working on sustainable growth into 2026, prioritizing performance upgrades instead of hype-fueled activity. However, BlockDAG is gaining attention for a different reason. With $329.5 million raised in presale, an ROI of 2,660% delivered to early holders, and a new partnership with the Seattle Seawolves, it is combining digital accessibility with real-world adoption. These three platforms continue to stand out for those following long-term crypto engagement strategies. BlockDAG Joins Forces With Seattle Seawolves to Boost Global Adoption BlockDAG has teamed up with the Seattle Seawolves to boost global adoption of its blockchain infrastructure. This collaboration introduces digital access to exclusive NFTs, fan perks, and behind-the-scenes content, all made possible through BlockDAG’s scalable Layer 1 technology. Together, the Seawolves and BlockDAG will share fresh content on social platforms, including match previews, player highlights, and interactive features that enhance fan involvement. These initiatives aim to build secure, meaningful digital touchpoints between the team and its fan base. With elements like special-access content and tradeable collectibles, the goal is to make the experience more engaging and rewarding. For BlockDAG, this partnership is another step toward connecting Web3 capabilities with everyday communities. The platform’s presale continues to gain traction, having raised $329.5 million, sold 23.6 billion coins, and reached batch 29 with a current price of $0.0276. Still, buyers can access a limited offer at $0.0016, but only until August 11. Early holders of the altcoin have already seen an ROI of 2,660%. This partnership shows why BlockDAG is being seen as one of the top crypto opportunities right now. It combines usefulness, accessibility, and popular appeal in a way that makes blockchain a direct part of the fan experience. Kaspa Price Prediction Shows Potential for Gradual Gains Into 2026 The Kaspa price prediction through 2026 points to a steady growth path fueled by strong technical capabilities. Analysts expect it to increase in value as it continues refining block timing and confirmation speeds. With a focus on performance and scalability, it appeals to those looking for stable networks that deliver consistent results. Rather than aiming for sudden price jumps, Kaspa appears ready for steady, calculated growth. This makes it appealing to users who prefer sustainable infrastructure over volatile spikes. Current forecasts suggest a more balanced price range by 2026, backed by continued technical upgrades and growing use. For those seeking dependable, low-risk returns, Kaspa could be a solid choice. Chainlink Price Prediction: July 2025 Outlook Suggests Bullish Trend The Chainlink price prediction for July 2025 suggests that upward momentum may continue if current levels hold. Technical charts show higher lows forming, with $12 acting as a strong support zone. If this level remains unbroken, LINK could push toward $18, with a breakout potentially aiming for $25. If buying activity increases, prices could extend even further, potentially landing between $31 and $41. Additionally, a rounded-bottom formation is appearing on the charts, a shape often seen before a trend reversal. However, a dip below $12 could point to weakness, putting targets between $10 and $11 in focus. This makes close tracking of support and resistance levels important in the short term. Final Thoughts Crypto platforms that offer clear value and maintain stability often gain attention beyond hype cycles. Chainlink continues to show resilience through technical strength. Kaspa is taking a methodical approach, offering consistent gains with solid infrastructure. BlockDAG, by contrast, is making headlines by applying blockchain tools in real-world areas like professional sports. With 23.6 billion coins sold and a limited-time price of $0.0016 available until August 11, BlockDAG presents a strong entry point with high growth potential. Together, these three projects are not only making moves in the market, but they are also reinforcing their relevance through technology, real-world utility, and strategic engagement. This is why they remain top coins to watch in 2025 .

Despite this short-term dip, LINK has held onto weekly gains of around 2.4%, suggesting broader market participants may still be weighing its long-term potential. While price remains rangebound, recent on-chain data indicates that LINK’s price action could be the result of diverging behavior between retail and institutional investors. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) On Standby: Bitcoin’s Next Move Holds The Key Chainlink Institutional Accumulation and Supply Pressure CryptoQuant contributor “Banker” highlighted a growing structural dynamic in the LINK ecosystem in a recent QuickTake analysis titled “LINK’s Accumulation Standoff: Whales Build, Retail Waits.” The report outlines how LINK is currently in a consolidation phase between $12 and $15, where institutional actors have been steadily accumulating tokens, while retail users remain largely passive. This discrepancy may be playing a key role in capping upward momentum despite persistent LINK outflows from centralized exchanges. According to Banker, exchange netflows for LINK have remained negative at roughly -100,000 LINK per week, signaling that more tokens are being withdrawn from trading platforms than deposited. This behavior is typically associated with accumulation activity, particularly from larger holders or “whales” who may be positioning for longer-term appreciation. Historical spikes in retail deposits, such as the +5 million LINK deposited in March 2025, have proven to be exceptions rather than the norm, as retail activity has since remained subdued. Supporting this view, active LINK addresses have hovered consistently between 28,000 and 32,000 per day, while transaction counts average around 9,000 daily. These figures have not rebounded from previous activity peaks seen in late 2024, even as Chainlink’s oracle usage has expanded. Meanwhile, elevated levels of exchange withdrawals, peaking at over 3,000 per day in Q4 2024, remain a dominant force. With leverage metrics staying neutral, whales have been able to withdraw LINK without introducing significant price volatility, resulting in a 40% year-to-date drop in exchange reserves. Market Outlook Hinges on Retail Reentry or Whale Fatigue As LINK’s consolidation persists, the path forward may depend on a shift in market dynamics. Banker points out that a meaningful breakout will likely require renewed participation from retail traders, as evidenced by a spike in active wallet addresses and transaction volume. Related Reading: Chainlink Holders Set Record As 1-Yr MVRV Signals ‘Opportunity’ If these metrics rise and price breaks above the $15 price mark, momentum could build for a stronger upward trend. On the other hand, a decline in whale-driven withdrawals or an increase in exchange inflows could weaken accumulation, potentially pushing LINK back down toward the $10 level. Banker added: Until catalysts emerge, whales silently build positions, echoing Bitcoin’s 2023 consolidation before its 2024 surge.

Dogecoin is forming a bullish pattern, and Hedera is trying to bounce back. But much of the real interest is shifting elsewhere. Web3 ai , a presale project with AI-powered features, has now sold over 23.95 billion tokens and collected more than $8.7 million. As each presale stage wraps up, people are starting to focus on platforms with real tools, not just attention-grabbing stories. This change in direction is becoming clearer. Older coins that once moved fast are now hitting resistance levels. Meanwhile, smaller AI-backed platforms are offering better early entry chances. At $0.000443 in Stage 09, Web3 ai is catching attention not as just another project, but as the best crypto investment this year with a forecasted 1,747% ROI and tools built for real users. Bullish Signs in Dogecoin but Momentum Still Lacking Dogecoin is showing a pattern that some see as bullish, including signs of a falling wedge breakout. If Dogecoin moves past $0.13 and holds it, some believe a run to $0.16 could follow. These patterns have worked for Dogecoin before, especially during strong hype periods backed by social media. But volume levels are not supporting the move right now. There’s little whale buying and the network is quiet. Even if the pattern looks good, the follow-through is still uncertain. With meme coins slowing down, this rally may not hold unless something major shifts in Q3 2025. Dogecoin is still being watched because of its long history and surprise price moves. Yet for those looking for the best crypto investment in 2025, Dogecoin’s dependence on hype makes it a hard choice compared to projects offering more stable returns and clear use cases. Hedera Faces Challenges Despite Project Growth Hedera’s price outlook has become weaker after dropping nearly 11% in recent weeks. Some experts believe HBAR could move back into the $0.12 to $0.15 range before Q3 ends, but current signals show neutral or weak trends. Its RSI is just above oversold, and the $0.10 support is under pressure. One issue is the gap between Hedera’s use cases and its price trend. It has big partnerships and is working on tokenization and digital ledger tools. But the price has not reacted to any of this. Right now, just having good tech is not enough. Markets are looking for returns, and Hedera has not offered strong gains. Unless new market forces or changes in how the token works take place, Hedera may keep moving sideways. People who want to set up their positions for 2025 might decide to look at other options, especially ones like Web3 ai that offer both high ROI and near-term reasons to grow. Web3 ai Builds Real Tools with 1,747% ROI Potential Web3 ai is drawing attention not only for its presale progress or token price but also for the tools it plans to launch soon. At $0.000443 in Stage 09, the $WAI token powers every part of this growing platform. One major highlight is the Crypto Trading Assistant, designed to offer trading help using real-time data. This tool replaces slow signals and scattered technical analysis with AI-based trade ideas, chart views, and alerts across both centralized and decentralized exchanges. It works with large sets of past data and adjusts for new changes in market mood, price swings, and token links. This helps both new and experienced traders make decisions with more confidence. Web3 ai has already sold more than 23.95 billion tokens and raised $8.7 million, showing that many are interested. The expected 1,747% ROI from the current price to launch makes the upside worth noting, especially when matched with working products. It’s not just about using AI as a buzzword, but building real tools with token-based access that sets $WAI apart from coins based only on hype. As the crypto space shifts toward platforms that offer real use, Web3 ai is getting noticed. People holding the token are not only hoping for gains, but also getting tools that help them trade smarter with AI on their side. What the Market Says Right Now Dogecoin is forming a bullish setup, but weak volume and slow trader interest are stopping big gains. Hedera has solid use cases, but its price is still close to major support levels and hasn’t picked up yet. Web3 ai, on the other hand, is seeing steady interest as its presale grows and more people explore its roadmap. With real tools for trading, a focus on AI, and a possible 1,747% return, Web3 ai is becoming the best crypto investment for 2025 . As the market shifts away from quick pumps toward smart choices, tokens like $WAI are showing why they matter. For those watching for strong projects under a cent, this might be the one where the features match the early interest.

Shiba Inu is drawing attention through accumulation trends, while Hyperliquid holds firm despite market volatility. However, both rely heavily on speculative movement and market timing. Unstaked offers something different. Its AI agent demo shows how simple it is to build and deploy intelligent tools that manage tasks like community engagement without any coding. This shift toward hands-on utility gives Unstaked broader relevance. For those evaluating the best crypto to buy, usability and live functionality make Unstaked a strong candidate in a crowded field. Shiba Inu Price Potential Builds as Accumulation Strengthens Shiba Inu is showing signs of renewed strength as significant buy orders flow in, thereby hinting at a potential shift in market sentiment. Following a stretch of subdued price action, these large-scale transactions point to calculated accumulation rather than short-term speculation. Meanwhile, the current consolidation near support levels has attracted attention, with technical indicators suggesting that buyers are stepping in at perceived value zones. As a result, this activity highlights growing optimism about Shiba Inu price potential, especially if the asset can break through nearby resistance levels. In addition, market watchers are also noting increased wallet activity and trading volume, both of which reinforce the narrative of strategic positioning. At this point, the focus now is on whether this buying momentum can sustain and translate into a broader move upward. Hyperliquid Market Crash Resilience Sparks Bullish Momentum Despite broader downturns, Hyperliquid has shown remarkable resilience, defying fears tied to the recent Hyperliquid market crash narrative. While volatility has tested many digital assets, Hyperliquid’s infrastructure adjustments and community-driven focus have helped steady investor sentiment. Specifically, strategic tweaks, including improved leverage settings and tighter risk parameters, have contributed to a stronger, more sustainable trading environment. Importantly, these changes, rather than stalling momentum, appear to have increased user confidence. Consequently, trading activity has steadily grown, and recent price movements show signs of consolidation, not collapse. Furthermore, technical indicators support the view that HYPE’s support levels are holding firm, hinting at the possibility of a breakout if momentum continues. More importantly, the ability to weather a dip without eroding user trust adds to the platform’s credibility. Looking ahead, as more users re-engage, the recovery from the so-called Hyperliquid market crash could transition from a rebound into a longer-term uptrend, driven by stability, utility, and timely adaptation.

Trump signed the one big, beautiful bill into law at a military family picnic at the White House for the Fourth of July. The president and his aides had long pegged Independence Day as a deadline for when they hoped to see the legislation on his desk, a timeline that appeared in peril just days ago. The move marks the president’s most significant legislative achievement of his second term. Until now, Trump’s presidency has largely relied on executive orders rather than congressional action. First lady Melania Trump attended Friday’s ceremony, and several Cabinet officials and numerous Republican lawmakers, including Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.), House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), and Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.). The event featured dramatic touches, including a flyover by two B-2 bombers — the same model used in last month’s strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. “This is really promises made, promises kept,” Trump said before signing the bill. Calling it “the biggest victory yet,” he touted the measure as proof of American strength and a cornerstone of his economic agenda. GOP rallies behind Trump to push budget through Congress amid tight deadline The bill’s passage reinforces Trump’s dominance within the Republican Party. GOP leaders on Capitol Hill pushed the measure through both chambers this week despite razor-thin margins, vocal opposition from Democrats, and skepticism from fiscal hawks and moderates. Trump personally lobbied key lawmakers, even inviting some to the White House to seal their support ahead of the July 4 deadline. But the political victory is not without cost. The sweeping legislation includes major spending cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs, prompting criticism from advocacy groups, fiscal watchdogs, and Democrats who warn of long-term consequences. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, approximately 11.8 million Americans could lose Medicaid coverage due to new work requirements, co-payments, and reimbursement caps. Hospitals, particularly rural ones, could face closures due to reduced federal support. Polls show the bill is broadly unpopular with the public. Democrats have vowed to use the bill as a political weapon in the upcoming midterms, while some Senate Republicans fear electoral backlash from voters reliant on safety-net programs. Trump hails ‘rocketship economy’ as $4.5 trillion in tax breaks take center stage Still, the administration insists the package will supercharge the economy. Trump dismissed concerns over rising debt: “Our country is going to be a rocketship economically.” Despite opposition forecasts, he argued that tax reform, deregulation, tariffs, and energy production will drive growth. The bill features $4.5 trillion in tax cuts , including an extension of the 2017 Trump-era tax reductions. It also offers new tax relief for tipped workers, overtime pay, certain auto loans, seniors, and parents. A key win for Republicans in high-tax states — like New York, New Jersey, and California — is expanding the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap from $10,000 to $40,000 over five years. The bill slashes incentives for renewable energy and electric vehicles to offset part of the cost, which could slow green infrastructure investments. Medicaid alone faces nearly $1 trillion in reductions, while food-aid programs will enforce expanded work requirements and penalties for states with error-prone benefit systems. In contrast, the bill delivers hundreds of billions in new military spending and greenlights additional funds for immigration enforcement, aligning with Trump’s national security agenda. As the country celebrates Independence Day, Trump is betting that this bold, controversial budget will reshape America’s economy — and his political legacy.

Stage 3 positions are filling in quickly at $0.00012255. Traders are viewing this as an early opportunity to get into a project with solid community ownership. With XRP holding on to large ETF news and Mantle making new product plays, MAGACOIN FINANCE is in the spotlight. This altcoin is drawing in retail buyers and early whales. Every round has sold out quicker than expected to date. Fixed supply and audited trust give the buyers more confidence. Most consider it a meme coin with real structure and a solid plan for growth. What Makes MAGACOIN FINANCE Different MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out by merging political storytelling with disciplined tokenomics. Each move showcases growing momentum. Investors want tokens that are not just hype. Zero-tax mechanism and community governance enable trust-building. Others liken it to Dogecoin in its infancy. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is intent on long-term assets for its owners. Its roadmap is suggesting real decentralized finance capabilities. XRP Investors Wait and Watch XRP has been a crypto behemoth for years. Frenzy over a spot ETF keeps traders active. Experts estimate the chances of approval at about 45% currently. Large ones such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have submitted. But SEC delays make Q4 the probable timeframe. Some analysts anticipate XRP price crossing previous highs if approvals come through. While waiting, diversification is going on with some XRP investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE is among the options for investors who want a new twist with a robust community backing. Mantle Becomes Useful but Uncertain Mantle’s release of the new UR Neobank was featured in the news. It had a modest price increase, even during the overall market slump. Mantle is known for its Layer 2 technology that speeds up Ethereum transactions and lowers fees. Most investors still consider Mantle to be a promising one. Its price range up to Q4 may be between $0.44 and $0.71. Others look for a surge through $1.50 if new buyers come in. But superior early-stage deals are in their opinion. That is the reason that money is flowing into names like MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE Keeps Building One of the reasons MAGACOIN FINANCE is so popular is due to its fixed supply model. It gets rid of stealth emissions and gives assurance to its holders. A third-party audit does support its security assertions. Each stage sells out quicker. This is a clear sign that indicates that demand is increasing. Crypto veterans compare it to those initial meme coins but point to its open staking model and political slant. This is to draw in purchasers who want something more than temporary hype. And it doesn’t hurt that a lot of people are moving money from XRP and Mantle to be an early adopter. Wrapping Up MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing it belongs in the 2025 altcoin discussion. Traders demand projects with thoroughly established plans, audited with integrity, and viral hype. As XRP traders await ETF listing and Mantle continues to develop its DeFi toolbox, MAGACOIN FINANCE is experiencing genuine demand for Stage 3. Look for more eyes to turn up here as the capped supply contracts and buyers continue to fill out each phase. This political-themed meme-powered altcoin demonstrates that narrative does count.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi crypto is quietly gaining momentum. The project has sold more than 60% of presale stage 5 at $0.03. MUTM has mobilized in excess of $11.7 million and has attracted over 12,700 investors. As ETH regains strength amid shifting sentiment in the broader crypto market, the spotlight is increasingly shifting to Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance could hit $3 soon after launch. Ethereum Eyes $3,000 Amid Renewed Market Optimism Ethereum (ETH) is priced at around $2,740 and it has experienced stable upward movement since improvements in the general market sentiment and the rising network activity. As analysts see it, ETH might be tested around the $3,000 mark again in the near future should the upside demand persist and risk-on macro conditions in the crypto sphere remain. The price growth of Ethereum is chiefly due to growing institutional use and improving fundamentals. Nevertheless, with the slow development on ETH, certain investors are starting to diversify into other recent assets such as Mutuum Finance, which has been drawing interests based on their growth prospects of providing speedier returns. Mutuum Finance Presale Stage 5 Gains Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up some serious traction as it reaches Stage 5 of its presale. With more than 12,700 early adopters and well over $11.7 million in funds raised, the project is taking giant strides as a major player in the DeFi. USD Stablecoin Launch & $50K Security Bounty Mutuum Finance, in its plans to build more on its DeFi, is launching a fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. In contrast to highly risk-exposed algorithmic stablecoins, this token has been designed in such a manner that it will guarantee its value even during market volatility. The project itself is about integrity and security. Mutuum Finance platform is already audited by CertiK as well, which once again shows team dedication to transparency, reliability, and sustainability. Mutuum Finance also introduced a Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, where a reward of 50,000 USDT is offered. The bounty comes in four categories, namely the critical, major, minor, and low. This will level out all the tiers of vulnerability and reward it alike. Investor Incentives In appreciation of the presale mania and as a token of appreciation to early adopters, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will distribute a total of $100,000 . Ten such winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens for being part of the early backers of the project. With the community growing exponentially, the early backers are being rewarded, not only with possible future gain, but with real, present-time rewards. As Ethereum steadily approaches the $3,000 milestone, investor attention is simultaneously shifting toward high-upside opportunities like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi project that’s already making waves. With over $11.7 million raised, 12,700+ investors onboard, and Stage 5 of the presale more than 60% sold out at just $0.03, Mutuum is capturing serious market interest. Backed by a CertiK audit, a $50,000 security bounty, and an upcoming USD-backed stablecoin, the project is setting the stage for a potential rally toward $3 post-launch. Early participants are also eligible to win a share of $100,000 in MUTM tokens. Seize this early advantage, visit the official website now and join the presale before it closes.

After dipping toward the $0.13–$0.15 demand zone, the meme‑coin shot higher, and a surge in derivatives data suggests many expect more gains. Related Reading: Ethereum Network Awakens—Massive On-Chain Moves Signal What’s Coming Trader Interest Climbs Around $0.19 Resistance According to market data, Open Interest jumped by 16% to reach over $2 billion. Options volume exploded by 400%. That kind of rise often points to big bets on upward swings. Right now, many eyes are on the $0.20 resistance level. If DOGE can close a daily candle above that line, it may clear the way toward $0.27. Dogecoin’s technical setup is drawing fresh looks from chart watchers. The Stochastic RSI crossed above 80, which can mark an overbought zone. Yet coins have stayed above overbought readings before when buyers kept pushing. Traders will want to see real volume behind any move above that descending trendline near $0.19. Without it, the rally may stall or give back gains. Whales Return With Spot Inflows Based on reports, Dogecoin saw a net inflow of $8.20 million into spot wallets. That marks a big shift after weeks of outflows. Large holders have been moving coins onto exchanges in the past, but now they’re pulling more in. In other cycles, fresh whale buys have lined up with mid‑term rallies. On‑chain metrics add another layer. Dogecoin’s MVRV Z‑score climbed back to 0.355 after hitting near‑historical lows late in June. That figure measures how much profit holders stand to make on average. A rising score hints that fewer holders are underwater, and that might draw in new buyers. Still, MVRV is backward‑looking. It can’t predict if price will break through key resistance. Network Activity Shows Mixed Signals Network stats tell a mixed story. Daily active addresses slid to 34 K, and transaction counts dropped to 15K as of July 3. That’s a sharp fall from the more than 500K addresses and transactions seen in the last week of June. Lower usage could sap the rally’s legs if retail traders don’t reengage soon. Related Reading: The Silent Bitcoin Accumulation: Public Companies’ Surprising H1 2025 Lead Even with these mixed signals, the mood toward Dogecoin is brighter than it was a week ago. Traders piling into options and hikes in Open Interest show speculative appetite is up. Large spot inflows show that whales have stepped back in. But network usage is lagging. If daily addresses and transactions don’t bounce back, bulls may find it harder to sustain the push.

Speaking at an Independence Day event in Ottawa, Hoekstra noted that both leaders have dedicated negotiators working on the deal. He envisioned a scenario where each leader could proudly tell their citizens, “I secured a fantastic deal for my Canada.” Hoekstra further speculated that at that moment, they would have a president who could say, ‘I got a great deal for the USA.’ Based on his argument, this was possibly a ” win-win situation.” Hoekstra expresses optimism for an end to the US-Canada trade negotiation The US, Canada, and Mexico already have a trade agreement that Trump signed in his first term. The president, however, has avoided it, setting tariffs of up to 50% on imported steel and aluminum and duties on cars and trucks. Interestingly, Canada plays an important role in exporting all of those goods. On the other hand, the Canadian government imposed counter-tariffs on tens of billions of dollars worth of American-made goods. This included automobiles and other consumer goods. Notably, Carney, Canada’s prime minister since March, chose not to respond when Trump raised the tariffs on steel and aluminum weeks ago. Meanwhile, trade talks restarted between the United States and Canada immediately after Ottawa removed a digital services tax, which the US objected to, according to White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett. Hassett stated that when he was asked about the talks starting up again. This came after Mark Carney telephoned US President Donald Trump to inform him that the tax was being canceled, the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, describing it as a big win for US tech firms. Leavitt described this as straightforward, referring to Prime Minister Carney giving in to President Trump and the US. She praised Trump’s tough negotiating approach for the change. The secretary further stated that President Trump understands that every country needs to have strong trade ties with the US. Based on Leavitt’s argument, Canada made a mistake by promising to put in place a tax that would have harmed their tech companies. The two leaders agreed on a July 21 deadline for reaching an agreement. Hoekstra, who used to be a member of the US House of Representatives from Michigan, which relies heavily on trade with Canada, asserted that they will get through this. He then concluded that when this is all over, they will be stronger and better than they were at the start. Canada drops its digital services tax on the US, resulting in a trade deal with the nation Canada backed off a plan to start imposing a new digital services tax aimed at US technology giants just hours before it came into effect in hopes of helping move forward the halted trade talks with the US. This was after Trump asked Canada to drop the tax at a G7 meeting in Canada earlier in June. According to Hassett, this is something that they had studied, and now they had agreed to it. Therefore, Hassett anticipated that they could get back to the negotiations. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick commented on the situation in a post on X. Lutnick expressed gratitude to Canada for removing its Digital Services Tax. According to him, it was intended to stifle American innovation and would have been a deal breaker for any trade deal with America. As a result of this change, stocks reached new highs on Wall Street as market sentiment lifted on hopes that the US would make progress on its trade negotiations with major trading partners, including Canada.

With its price at $0.00013428 and climbing, this new political meme token is drawing serious attention, even as Ethereum consolidates and Aptos advances with mixed market traction. Analysts and early investors see MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most compelling opportunities of 2025. Its meme appeal, political branding, and real fundamentals is driving significant forecasts from top analysts, attracting capital away from more established altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Meme-Political Star MAGACOIN FINANCE tops the watchlist of leading altcoins with a HashEx smart contract audit, a strict 170 billion token cap, and a clear roadmap focused on community-driven governance. Its narrative taps into the “Make America Great Again” movement, giving it a political edge in a crowded meme sector. Every presale phase is selling out rapidly, often driving prices higher within hours. The project already boasts 20,000+ active supporters and million dollars raised from early investors, making it one of the largest community-driven crypto launches of 2025. Backed by staking rewards with high APYs for early participants, it’s no surprise MAGACOIN FINANCE is topping analyst watchlists. Some even compare it to the earliest days of Aptos and Ethereum— but with stronger fundamentals and an actual decentralized governance framework. MAGACOIN FINANCE Vs Ethereum: Big Institutional Bets but Price Stalls Ethereum is seeing significant strategic moves from major players. BitMine Immersion Technologies, originally a Bitcoin miner, just raised $250 million to start an ETH treasury, which could make it one of the largest publicly traded ETH holders. This private placement drew top investors like Founders Fund, Pantera, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, and Thomas Lee, who will chair BitMine. Lee highlighted Ethereum’s dominance in stablecoin settlement and expects ETH to keep benefiting as stablecoin adoption grows. While this underlines Ethereum’s long-term strength to achieve $5000 in the long-term, ETH is currently consolidating as markets digest the news — pushing some investors to look for more immediate high-growth plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Aptos’ Volatility Pushes MAGACOIN FINANCE Aptos (APT) has posted some impressive milestones. CEO Avery Ching was appointed to the CFTC’s GMAC Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee, a regulatory move boosting institutional credibility. The network also saw over 1,200 smart contracts deployed in a single day, and its stablecoin supply recently hit $1 billion. Technologically, Aptos is rolling out Zaptos, a pipelined blockchain design supporting up to 20,000 transactions per second. Meanwhile, Bitwise updated filings for an Aptos ETF, and Wyoming’s stablecoin initiative is spotlighting APT. Yet despite these advances, APT flashes mixed market signals and is lagging the kind of explosive multiples speculative traders crave. Final Take: Where the Money’s Moving Ethereum continues to secure its spot as the backbone of DeFi and institutional treasuries. Aptos is innovating and securing more regulatory wins, but with limited immediate upside. In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting traders eager to ride the next bullish wave. With its low entry price at $0.00013428, audited supply cap and surging community, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming one of the top altcoins to watch for portfolio diversification with solid gains.

With constant shifts in investor behavior, technology upgrades, and unexpected market surges, knowing where to place your bets has never been more critical. As crypto adoption climbs again, everyone’s wondering which projects will actually deliver. For those looking to score big in 2025, the real search is for the top-performing cryptos today that combine fresh innovation with real user traction. Right now, four names are catching serious attention: Polkadot, VeChain, Sui, and Web3 ai. Each brings its own strengths, but Web3 ai stands out with unmatched presale ROI and AI-powered tools already attracting early whales. If you’re serious about catching the next wave of wealth in crypto, start with these top-performing cryptos today before prices run. 1. Web3 ai: Where AI Utility Meets Real ROI Potential Web3 ai is making serious noise among crypto watchers, aiming for utility-driven growth. With Stage 9 underway, the token sits at just $0.000443 and has already raised over $8.8 million. The final presale stage is set at $0.003267, with a projected listing price of $0.005242, delivering early participants up to 1747% gains. But this isn’t just about numbers. Web3 ai is backed by several smart AI tools built for real-world investing, ranging from portfolio tracking and yield management to scam alerts and market insights. Unlike speculative meme coins, $WAI serves as a gateway to staking, governance, and AI-driven trading tools. These features make it valuable even after the presale ends. Many now speculate that $WAI could climb to $5 over the long term. With both infrastructure and community growing fast, Web3 ai is one of the top-performing cryptos today, giving early backers a solid shot at outsized gains. 2. Polkadot: Tech-Driven Growth With Whale Confidence Polkadot (DOT) continues gaining traction due to its unique multichain structure and cross-chain messaging upgrades. Priced near $7.20, DOT is drawing increased whale attention after key developments in the XCM protocol and new parachain slot expansions. As more DeFi apps tap into Polkadot’s system, on-chain volume and total value locked are seeing a steady rise. With over half of DOT’s supply staked, the network shows strong internal confidence and user loyalty. Analysts expect DOT to push back into double digits as parachain growth expands. Whales have been quietly building positions throughout June, signaling long-term belief. For those looking beyond short-term pumps, Polkadot remains one of the top-performing cryptos today, driven by its solid tech and interoperability edge. 3. VeChain: Where Enterprise Adoption Meets Real Utility VeChain (VET), currently near $0.031, is backed by serious enterprise integrations. With use cases spanning logistics, healthcare, and sustainability, VET has become a go-to for corporations like Walmart China and DNV. The recent rollout of VeBetterDAO and incentive-driven marketplaces has sparked higher network activity and brought new developers into the fold. One major strength is its dual-token model: VET handles value transfers, while VTHO covers fees, keeping enterprise adoption cost-effective. Whale wallets have picked up massive amounts of VET since June, reflecting trust in VeChain’s growth story. As global attention turns toward sustainability, VeChain’s real-world blockchain usage cements its place among the top-performing cryptos today. 4. Sui: High-Speed Blockchain With a Growing Ecosystem Sui (SUI) is making headlines thanks to its high throughput and unique programming framework. Currently around $0.84, Sui leverages the Move language and handles up to 297,000 transactions per second in test settings. That kind of performance is attracting DeFi builders, NFT creators, and GameFi developers to its network. Sui also benefits from low gas fees and strong support from its foundation through grants and dev events. Whale tracking shows a growing number of large wallets accumulating SUI since new bridges and listings were announced. As user-friendly features roll out, and with more developers choosing Sui for its speed and scalability, it’s clear this coin is among the top-performing cryptos today with real breakout potential. Final Words! There’s no shortage of coins making noise, but only a few show the kind of traction, tech, and tokenomics that lead to real returns. Web3 ai, Polkadot, VeChain, and Sui are top-performing cryptos today with clear use cases and growing demand. Web3 ai leads with its presale momentum and access to real AI-powered investing tools, while Polkadot delivers cross-chain utility that developers love. Meanwhile, VeChain shows blockchain is already reshaping enterprise systems, and Sui proves next-gen blockchains can be both fast and scalable. For those aiming to make smart moves before the next crypto bull run hits full swing, these four projects deserve a close look. Stick with the top-performing cryptos today , and you might just be early to the next big breakout.

While tokens, DAOs, and smart contracts have achieved some of this, the actual process of managing decentralized communities still depends heavily on human effort. Moderating Telegram groups, welcoming new users, and keeping engagement high are tasks that remain manual, repetitive, and difficult to scale. That could soon shift. In 2025, a new concept is beginning to gain momentum at the intersection of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology: autonomous AI agents that operate independently on-chain. These are not abstract concepts, they are already being tested. Unstaked is one of the few platforms actively working to make this technology accessible for every Web3 project, regardless of scale or technical expertise. Understanding AI Agents & Their Relevance AI agents are software programs that function autonomously, respond to user input, and evolve their behavior through interaction. Unlike basic bots or scripts, these agents can learn from their environment, enhance their performance, and carry out complex workflows without direct supervision. While Web2 examples include AI-powered customer service systems and recommendation engines, Web3 presents unique demands. In this space, there are no centralized servers or private backends. AI agents must operate independently, transparently, and in a decentralized manner. This is the gap that Unstaked aims to close. Unstaked’s Infrastructure for Autonomous Web3 Agents Unstaked is building a platform that lets users design, customize, and launch decentralized AI agents using the $UNSD token. These agents are tailored to real-world applications in crypto, such as moderating community forums, handling live chats, onboarding users, responding to queries, and managing campaign execution. Unlike proprietary AI tools, Unstaked’s agents operate entirely on-chain. Every task performed by an agent is recorded and visible, allowing for transparency and accountability. This proof-of-intelligence system builds the trust needed for agents to act on behalf of decentralized communities. Unstaked has also released a product demo , offering a glimpse into its dashboard and capabilities. The interface enables users to build agents without writing code, define behavior rules, and assign tasks, all within a streamlined, no-code environment. Though the demo represents an early version, it shows Unstaked’s platform is ready for practical use, offering a much-needed solution for launching AI agents across blockchain-native ecosystems. The Role of the $UNSD Token in the Agent Economy $UNSD is central to the entire Unstaked platform. It enables users to: Deploy and run AI agents Access advanced automation templates Unlock higher-level agent behavior models Engage with agent marketplaces Pay for usage costs through crypto-native microtransactions Unstaked replaces traditional SaaS subscription models with a blockchain-based pricing structure. Agents start at just $10 to $20 per month, paid in $UNSD. This approach gives communities access to scalable automation tools at a fraction of the cost of employing human support teams. As more agents are deployed, demand for UNSD naturally rises. This builds a utility-focused feedback loop, differentiating it from many tokens that rely primarily on price speculation. Strong Presale Performance & Market Interest Unstaked is currently in Stage 22 of its presale, offering UNSD tokens at $0.01209. The projected launch price is approximately $0.1819, suggesting a potential return of 2700%, depending on platform growth and adoption. To date, Unstaked has raised more than $10.8 million and sold 1.2 billion tokens, putting it among the most active infrastructure-based crypto projects in 2025. This momentum shows that the idea of decentralized AI tools is gaining real interest beyond theory. Looking ahead, crypto communities may rely less on human moderators and support teams. Instead, autonomous agents could oversee education, onboarding, campaign management, and even trigger smart contract actions based on behavioral data. This transition is not far off. Unstaked is one of the few projects building the backend required for it. By allowing users to control agent functions and infrastructure, Unstaked combines usability, transparency, and scalability in one platform. Closing Thoughts The arrival of AI agents in Web3 is not just about convenience, it addresses a growing need. As decentralized systems expand globally, there is a rising demand for intelligent, self-managing tools. Unstaked meets this challenge with a toolkit built for real-world use. With a live demo, active presale, and product roadmap tied to actual deployment, Unstaked is shaping up to be a key player in the evolution of crypto infrastructure. As AI becomes more than just a market theme and starts powering core Web3 functions, platforms like Unstaked may become essential to how decentralized communities grow, adapt, and function.

While headlines are busy celebrating Solana’s first U.S.-based ETF and Hedera’s steady push into enterprise solutions, there’s a newcomer drawing surprising attention— MAGACOIN FINANCE . This bold, politically flavored memecoin isn’t just holding its price; it’s gaining momentum. The question buzzing through Telegram groups and crypto Twitter: could MAGACOIN FINANCE start attracting the kind of serious backing usually reserved for blue-chip tokens? What Is MAGACOIN FINANCE All About? At its core, MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t your average altcoin. It blends meme appeal with real features—like a zero-tax system, capped supply, and full smart contract audits. But the real kicker? It leans into a highly recognizable political brand, one that sparks conversation (and some controversy) everywhere it goes. The coin is built for community first. Unlike many meme coins that rely on hype alone, MAGACOIN FINANCE emphasizes grassroots momentum and long-term involvement. Its “Make America Great Again” branding is part of its identity, turning what some might see as a joke into a powerful narrative that resonates with a specific crowd. What Sets MAGACOIN FINANCE Apart in a Crowded Market Solana’s hitting its stride. It’s got a new ETF, sky-high trading volumes, and an upcoming upgrade that could make it one of the fastest blockchains around. Hedera, meanwhile, is playing the long game, building partnerships and integrating tools for regulated industries. MAGACOIN FINANCE doesn’t try to compete in the same way. It’s not built on speed or corporate partnerships—it’s built on culture. It’s early-stage, driven by people who want to see a specific message succeed. Where Solana and Hedera feel polished, MAGACOIN FINANCE is raw, loud, and unapologetically community-driven. The Buzz Is Real Check the numbers—over 20,000 members in its Telegram, with more joining daily. The website traffic is spiking, and whispers of an exchange listing are picking up steam. Investors are showing up fast, with each presale round selling out in just hours. Between the decentralized structure , strong online presence, and politically charged branding, this isn’t just another meme coin—it’s starting to feel like a movement. The Takeaway: MAGACOIN FINANCE Is One to Watch Closely While Hedera cools off and Solana dominates headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building something different. It’s not trying to replace the big names—it’s carving out its own space in the market.

Tron’s steady rise in USDT volume and SUI’s reaction to its big token unlock show how fast the market can change and why picking the right project could make all the difference. While both tokens continue to make an impact, BlockDAG (BDAG) is drawing attention through major figures and its upcoming BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release. With over $330 million raised, 23.6 billion coins sold, and the presale now in batch 29 at $0.0276, BlockDAG is offering a unique chance to buy in at just $0.0016 until August 11. This price, supported by full audits and growing mining support, places BlockDAG among the top choices in the best crypto coins for 2025 category. Tron Growth Sparks Discussion on Long-Term Strength The Tron (TRX) market outlook is gaining momentum, supported by its role in decentralised media and strong alliances. Its recent spike in USDT transactions has stood out during a market dip, showing stable usage. Tron continues to attract developers who value fast, low-cost transfers. Its system backs stablecoin activity and DeFi projects, which gives it practical use. Still, some concerns remain about how decentralised Tron really is and how it will handle bigger demand in the future. Questions about governance and scaling continue, yet Tron keeps showing signs that it may have more growth ahead. SUI Faces Pressure Post-Unlock but Shows Developer Appeal The SUI price movement has shifted after its recent $164 million token unlock, which brought negative pressure. Even so, SUI’s Layer 1 setup focused on speed and cost is keeping developer interest strong. It handles smart contracts and on-chain assets easily, which could help build out its platform. However, rising competition and market changes present challenges. SUI’s next steps depend on how well it manages its token system and earns continued support from its community and builders. BlockDAG Sets Stage With $0.0016 Entry and Growing User Base The BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release is putting the project in a different category from other rising coins. It’s now giving early access to one of the lowest prices offered since the first batch. With more than $330 million raised, 23.6 billion coins sold, and current pricing at batch 29’s $0.0276, the project is moving fast. Right now, a limited-time offer allows users to grab BDAG at just $0.0016 until August 11. This pricing is one of the lowest seen since batch 1 and is aimed at bringing in more users before the official launch begins. More than just a low entry point, BlockDAG is building trust through audits from Halborn and CertiK. These checks confirm the system is prepared for future expansion and focused on long-term strength. The project is not only looking at short-term growth but also shaping a stable foundation. Along with solid pricing and security, BlockDAG shows signs of real activity. Over 18,300 miners have been sold, and the X1 Mining App is helping grow its user network. These tools are already working in the market. For those following the Tron (TRX) market outlook or watching the SUI price movement, BlockDAG’s security features, strong presale numbers, and the upcoming BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release make it one to keep an eye on. It’s now gaining attention as one of the best crypto coins for 2025. Quick Take: Tron, SUI, and BlockDAG on the Radar The Tron (TRX) market outlook shows steady signs, backed by strong USDT activity. Still, some questions remain about its ability to scale and its governance structure, which may shape where Tron heads next. The SUI price movement shifted after a large token unlock changed short-term expectations. But its flexible Layer 1 design keeps builders interested, and it still holds value in the current space. BlockDAG, meanwhile, is drawing attention through its BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release, offering a rare $0.0016 entry until August 11. This price sits far below batch 29’s $0.0276. With a $330 million presale, audits from top firms, and a rising number of miners, BlockDAG is positioning itself among the best crypto coins for 2025 . For those acting early, this could be the moment that makes the difference.

Although the digital asset remains down 19% on a year-over-year (YoY) basis, some analysts are optimistic that it’s ready for a liftoff. Ethereum Enters Wyckoff ‘Liftoff’ Phase In an X post published today, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader noted that Ethereum appears to be following the Wyckoff Accumulation pattern and has successfully cleared both the ‘creek’ and ‘spring’ phases, potentially entering the ‘liftoff’ phase characterized by parabolic price action. Related Reading: Ethereum Breakout Imminent? Broadening Wedge Hints At $4,200 Surge In the Wyckoff accumulation pattern, the ‘creek’ represents overhead resistance where price struggles to break higher, while the ‘spring’ is a false breakdown below support, meant to trap bears and confirm strong hands. The ‘liftoff’ phase follows the spring, marked by a sharp recovery and breakout above resistance, signaling the start of a new bullish trend. The analyst shared the following Ethereum daily chart, which shows the cryptocurrency on the verge of a potential breakout, with its next major resistance at the $3,700 level. A successful breakout and retest of this level could set the stage for a new all-time high (ATH). Fellow crypto analyst Crypto GEMs also pointed toward Ethereum getting ready for a significant move to the upside. The analyst shared the following chart which compares ETH’s price action in 2025 to that in 2024. If Ethereum mirrors its 2024 performance, it could break above the $3,000 mark in the near term. However, not all analysts share this bullish outlook. For instance, noted crypto analyst Carl Moon shared a four-hour Ethereum chart showing the asset trading within a rising wedge pattern. He cautioned that unless ETH breaks out of this formation, it may face a drop to $2,200. To explain, a rising wedge pattern is a bearish chart formation where price moves upward within converging trendlines, indicating weakening bullish momentum. It often signals an upcoming breakdown, as buyers lose control and sellers push the price lower after the wedge is breached. ETH Network Sees Renewed Activity In a separate X post, crypto analyst CryptoGoos remarked that daily transactions on Ethereum are nearing ATH level for the first time since 2021. Typically, heightened network activity tends to precede major price movements. Analyst Crypto Rover echoed this view, noting that active addresses across the Ethereum network have hit a new all-time high. They added that ETH below $3,000 is “an absolute steal.” Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross On Daily Chart – Is A New ATH Within Reach? Meanwhile, Ethereum liquid staking is also inching toward historic levels, with 35.5 million ETH now locked. At press time, ETH trades at $2,522, down 3.8% in the past 24 hours.

This decentralized political memecoin is gaining traction fast, leveraging cultural relevance and community-first principles to draw attention during a phase of Bitcoin consolidation. With BTC trading just under major resistance levels and short-term optimism showing signs of fatigue, traders are increasingly looking for early-stage altcoins that combine narrative strength with transparent tokenomics. MAGACOIN FINANCE is meeting that demand by offering not only meme-driven virality but also a strong ideological identity. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Grabbing Trader Interest Bitcoin remains the market anchor, but its current rangebound behavior—hovering between $106,500 and $109,000—has led many to look elsewhere for growth catalysts. As 97% of BTC supply sits in profit, profit-taking and increased volatility are likely. This has opened a window for tokens that aren’t dependent on macro catalysts. MAGACOIN FINANCE is thriving in that gap, driven by: A grassroots political theme that resonates with today’s crypto-savvy, ideologically driven investor A fixed supply and zero-tax structure that encourages clean trading and long-term holding Increasing market visibility via Telegram growth, Twitter engagement, and early analyst coverage A community-based roadmap that emphasizes decentralized control over VC-backed influence Rather than react to market cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building a brand—one that blends humor, resistance, and decentralized ideals into one package. Not Just a Meme Coin—A Cultural Statement MAGACOIN FINANCE separates itself from other memecoins through purpose. It’s not just a token chasing virality—it’s a political and cultural statement against centralization and gatekeeping in both traditional finance and blockchain governance. That positioning places it alongside community-aligned projects like Cardano and Ethereum in philosophy, while operating in the meme-layer ecosystem popularized by Dogecoin and SHIBA INU. It bridges these two worlds: the entertainment value of memes and the conviction of decentralized movements. This hybrid identity is fueling a sense of belonging among holders who view crypto not just as a market—but as a movement. Why Market Analysts Are Watching Closely With Bitcoin dominance still high and many top altcoins consolidating, attention is turning to tokens that show organic growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE has already crossed key traction milestones, including: Over 20,000 active community members across platforms Inclusion in early “watchlist” articles by altcoin analysts Strong participation from politically engaged investor segments Rumors of exchange readiness and upcoming feature rollouts As Bitcoin prepares for potentially volatile July sessions and macro conditions fluctuate around U.S. Federal Reserve decisions, many believe the cultural layer of crypto could lead the next wave of rotation. MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned as a leading candidate. The Bottom Line: MAGACOIN FINANCE Taps Into 2025’s Meme-Political Wave Bitcoin may be holding its ground just below a psychological milestone, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is moving differently. It’s not waiting for ETF headlines or macro decisions—it’s building a decentralized brand powered by meme culture and political relevance. For investors seeking the next wave of crypto identity projects—where culture, narrative, and ownership align—MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a frontrunner.

Shiba Inu Has 62% Of Its Supply Controlled By Top 10 Whales In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has shared how some top coins currently compare against each other in terms of the percentage of supply held by the ten largest wallets on the respective networks. Below is a chart showing the trend in this metric for eight cryptocurrencies: Shiba Inu, Ethereum, Pepe, USDT, USDC, DAI, Chainlink (LINK), and Uniswap (UNI). As is visible in the graph, the stablecoin USDC has the lowest amount of supply concentrated on the top 10 addresses among these assets at around 27%. Chainlink and DAI come close with the metric sitting at 32% and 33%, respectively. Others like Uniswap and Ethereum, however, have a more significant part of their supply under the control of these humongous entities: 51% and 49%, respectively. One asset that particularly stands out is Shiba Inu, with a massive 62% of its supply belonging to the ten largest whales on the network. For comparison, the other memecoin on the list, Pepe, has the same metric at 39%. Generally, the centralization of supply on just a few hands isn’t a constructive sign for any cryptocurrency’s stability, as tokens signify power on the network. It’s especially relevant in the case of a proof-of-stake (PoS) asset like Ethereum. As Santiment explains, As a retail trader, it’s generally safer to hold coins with less supply held by the most elite whales. There is less risk of sudden dumps or price manipulation should an asset’s largest whales decide to exit their positions. Given this, the assets like Ethereum, Uniswap, and Shiba Inu that currently have a majority of their supply or close to it in the hands of the top 10 whales may not be in the best position right now. In some other news, the cryptocurrency market sentiment is on the verge of extreme greed, according to the Fear & Greed Index. The Fear & Greed Index is an indicator created by Alternative that inputs a few different factors to determine the investor mentality as a score lying between zero and hundred. As displayed above, the cryptocurrency Fear & Greed has a value of 73 at the moment. This corresponds to the presence of a strong sentiment of greed present among the traders. Historically, markets have often moved in the direction that goes contrary to the expectations of the crowd. The probability of a contrary move is especially strong in the extreme ends of the index. For now, the market is still outside of the extreme greed zone, but only by a couple of units. SHIB Price At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading around $0.0000115, up over 3% in the last seven days.

Turkey’s Capital Markets Board (CMB) has reportedly blocked access to 46 crypto websites, including the second-largest global decentralized exchange, PancakeSwap. The Capital Markets Board (CMB), Turkey’s main financial watchdog, said in an official announcement that the platforms were offering “unlicensed crypto asset services” to Turkish residents—an action deemed a violation of the country’s Capital Markets Law. The list of banned entities includes a mix of crypto exchanges, trading apps, and even information-based platforms like Cryptoradar, a popular cryptocurrency price comparison site. PancakeSwap alone saw over $325.2 billion in trading volume in June, making it a major player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem alongside Uniswap and Curve. Turkish regulators now consider the platform’s operations illegal despite its global status. The CMB did not reveal the individuals who violated the regulations. It’s also not said whether the targeted platforms had received prior warning or an opportunity to comply with local laws before the shutdown. PancakeSwap had not made a public statement at the time of this writing. This marks a radical change in Turkey’s approach to crypto services and suggests a move toward centralized control in an industry meant to be borderless and decentralized. Turkey tightens crypto oversight The move against crypto sites is part of a broader push by Turkish regulators to establish order and legal clarity in a market that has expanded rapidly but in a largely unregulated fashion. Turkey introduced new regulations aimed at curbing crimes like money laundering and terrorism financing. Under these rules, crypto platforms are required to identify and verify their users, particularly when transactions involve funds from newly unregistered wallet addresses. On the other hand, users are expected to give a transaction description of at least 20 characters for each transfer. Apart from transaction descriptions, platforms are now expected to impose holding periods on crypto withdrawals when the Travel Rule is not applicable. This includes a 48-hour delay for most withdrawals and a 72-hour delay for the first withdrawal from any newly created account. If a transaction appears suspicious or lacks proper documentation, service providers can flag it as high-risk. They may then refuse or halt the transfer or impose restrictions such as bans, limits, or account freezes on the user involved. Transactions below 15,000 lira do not have to undergo identity checks. Still, regulators have warned that those trying to split larger transfers into smaller transactions to fly under the radar may also be flagged. Turkey aligns with global crypto crackdown efforts Turkey is now the latest country to join a growing list of countries closing in on the crypto industry. Russia, Kazakhstan, Venezuela, and the Philippines have all moved to restrict access to platforms that do not have local authorization and are not meeting regulatory standards. Critics say Turkey’s move should also be interpreted as part of its broader attempts to stabilize the ailing national economy and shield ordinary citizens from scams, fraud, and highly volatile financial products. Cryptocurrency adoption in Turkey has surged recently, driven by the country’s high inflation and weakening lira. To others, crypto has become an alternative store of value and carries huge risks. In 2021, it prohibited using digital assets for payments, arguing that they created a risk to financial stability. The decision mobilized public anger and prompted legal challenges, but the ban took effect. A domestic law firm started preparing to challenge the ban in court earlier this year, indicating that the legal infrastructure for crypto in Turkey remains a work in progress. This week’s enforcement action seemed to attempt to establish a position of regulatory primacy before that legal uncertainty expands. It is unclear whether the blocked platforms can reapply or appeal their banning via a local license. In the meantime, blocked platforms remain out of reach of Turkish users unless they are accessed through VPNs or other methods, putting them at legal risk.

While XRP enjoys a wave of optimism thanks to regulatory breakthroughs, traders are increasingly diversifying into newer, story-driven assets. In particular, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a notable destination for capital rotating out of large caps, drawing interest even as other networks like Sui and Pi struggle to sustain comparable momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE Taps Into Meme Energy and Political Themes While XRP consolidates around its evolving narrative, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction for very different reasons. Branded as both a meme-powered altcoin and a decentralized political memecoin , the project is cutting through the crowded crypto landscape by blending ideological messaging with internet culture. This fusion is appealing to traders who want more than technical milestones — they’re buying into a community ethos centered on decentralization and cultural identity. Unlike many projects that focus heavily on tech updates or institutional roadmaps, MAGACOIN FINANCE has leaned into its grassroots appeal. Its zero-tax approach and emphasis on community-driven governance resonate with market participants increasingly wary of centralization. As a result, it’s building a strong base on platforms like Telegram and X (Twitter), with discussions often revolving around its potential to become a flagship for political narratives within the meme coin sector. XRP Clears Major Regulatory Hurdles, Spurs Rotations XRP has been at the heart of recent market conversations, primarily due to the long-awaited resolution of Ripple’s legal standoff with the SEC. With both parties moving to withdraw appeals after a multi-year battle and a closed-door SEC session expected to formalize the end of the case, the regulatory fog that once clouded XRP’s outlook is finally lifting. This newfound clarity is fueling speculation that an XRP ETF could be right around the corner. Big institutional names have already been linked to preliminary discussions, and with court restrictions on Ripple’s institutional sales now removed, the door is open for expanded enterprise adoption. On-chain data also suggests that whales and retail holders alike are taking positions, as wallet activity and broader engagement continue to trend upward. Sui and Pi Struggle to Match Enthusiasm Despite Headlines Meanwhile, Sui and Pi are each trying to navigate their own pivotal moments — but neither has captured the same groundswell of trader enthusiasm. Sui, for example, is managing a hefty token unlock that added millions of new coins to circulation. While some investors see long-term promise in Sui’s growing ecosystem, Nasdaq’s spot ETF filing, and recent high-profile investments, short-term caution is dominating sentiment as the market processes this fresh supply. Technical patterns still point to a challenging near-term landscape, with analysts watching to see if demand can balance the latest unlock. Pi Network is also at a crossroads. Major unlock events in July are swelling the available supply, sparking concerns of potential selling pressure. At the same time, Pi’s ecosystem updates — from an AI-driven app builder to improved staking and KYC systems — show real developmental progress. However, without a major exchange listing on the horizon, many traders are choosing to remain on the sidelines. A Market Driven by Storylines as Much as Stats The contrasting trajectories of these projects highlight how sentiment and narrative continue to steer crypto flows.

However, Ethereum (ETH) has lately been sending mixed signals, which has led to a lot of doubt amongst investors. These mixed signals have pushed ETH holders into MUTM tokens as they seek out new growth. So far, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $11.7 million, a testament to the hunger for growth in the crypto sector. A major advantage that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers is that it is an early-stage project, which means all its upside has not been explored. Investors are pouring into the project in expectation of explosive growth followed by steady gains. Let us take a deep dive into this exciting project. The protocol design Mutuum Finance operates as a decentralized non-custodial lending protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. Lenders deposit assets into the protocol’s liquidity pools to earn interest, while borrowers deposit collateral into the pools to access the liquidity. To ensure the stability of the protocol, Mutuum Finance requires that all loans be overcollateralized. That means the borrowers must deposit collateral that is worth more than the value of the loan they take. This ensures that in case of rapid price shifts, there is enough of a buffer in which liquidators can act. Liquidators step in when a loan position dips below the safe level of collateralization. When that happens, they purchase the debt at a discount, helping to keep bad debt from accumulating in the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): an emerging top contender Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in the presale phase, where tokens are going for $0.03. So far, around 12,700 unique buyers have taken part in the presale, buying over $11.7 million worth of tokens. The current price of the tokens in phase 5 is a 200% increase from the initial listing price of $0.01. In phase 6, the token price will increase by 16.67% to $0.035. One of the impacts of this increase is that it will reduce the existing 50% discount on the token price based on the launch price of $0.06. That is a massive opportunity that you should not let slip away. Analysts forecast massive growth for MUTM tokens, and they expect the token price to rapidly climb 37x when the tokens go live. This massive surge will be followed by a period of growth, according to the forecasts. The projected gains mean that if you invest $1400 in the presale today, your investment could grow to over $51,000. This massive return is just a few clicks away. Best of all, since there is no upper limit on how much you can invest in the presale, it could be your biggest gainer of 2025. One of the reasons why analysts are confident about sustained gains for MUTM tokens is the planned buyback program. In this program, Mutuum Finance will purchase MUTM tokens off the open market and redistribute them to stakers. These purchases will be carefully timed to ensure that they have the optimal impact on price increases. As such, holders of the tokens can experience sustained growth of their investment the longer that they hold. Analysts also point to explosive growth when the tokens launch. A major reason for this explosive growth is the planned launch of a beta version of the platform on the token listing day. This beta version is expected to generate massive amounts of organic traffic from the project. The crypto market will test out the beta platform’s features and share the good news on social media. As word spreads on its utility, it will trigger a new stream of capital into the project, which will lead to massive long-term gains. To take full advantage of this expected surge, buying tokens now while there is still a massive discount available is your best move. Mutuum Finance partners with CertiK Mutuum Finance revealed that they have partnered with CertiK on a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program. The goal of this program is to encourage the global security community to keep a close eye on the project. Additionally, a partnership with CertiK will ensure the team has access to the best advice on how to implement industry best practices when it comes to securing the project. The bounty program is split into four tiers, which are critical, major, minor, and low. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already secured a CertiK audit, where it received a Token Scan Score of 95. The results of the audit continue to inspire confidence in investors, and this high level of trust is expected to continue long after the tokens’ launch. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is signaling massive fast gains for its early adopters. With tokens currently available at a 50% discount on the listing price, the current price of $0.03 is a perfect entry point. Do not miss out on this opportunity.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $36.8. By 2031, ICP’s price might reach a maximum of $113.32. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. The network leverages advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025?

Volatility remains low, indicating consolidation. The coin continues to remain range-bound between $4.653 and $5.139. ICP 1-day price analysis: Internet Computer sees bearish consolidation near support levels As seen on the 1-day price chart for July 5, ICP is still in a consolidation phase, maintaining a range-bound structure between key support and resistance levels. The price is currently near the lower end of this range, with immediate support at $4.443. The immediate resistance is at $4.883, with an upper resistance zone near $5.139. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The broader price movement shows a descending channel, with the price recently moving through this channel after peaking above $5.100. The MACD histogram is showing negative momentum, with the line in bearish territory, supporting the ongoing downward pressure despite the minor price fluctuations. Any break below the current range could open the door to further declines towards $4.5. ICP price analysis for 4-hour: Volume is low, as ICP retests support On the 4-hour chart, ICP sits just slightly above the lower Bollinger band at $4.661, acting as critical support. The recent price action suggests a tight range and a lack of strong directional movement. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The On-Balance Volume (OBV) is showing a downward trend, which confirms that selling pressure is dominant, despite the price attempting to hold above the support levels. A positive shift in volume accumulation would confirm more buying interest and could lead ICP to retest the $4.898 resistance. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $4.89 SELL SMA 5 $5.03 SELL SMA 10 $5.00 SELL SMA 21 $5.11 SELL SMA 50 $5.28 SELL SMA 100 $5.25 SELL SMA 200 $6.30 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $5.07 SELL EMA 5 $5.11 SELL EMA 10 $5.13 SELL EMA 21 $5.24 SELL EMA 50 $5.79 SELL EMA 100 $6.78 SELL EMA 200 $7.85 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis ICP is currently range-bound between $4.443 support and $5.139 resistance. The negative momentum on the MACD and OBV indicates downside risk. A break below $4.600 could lead to further declines, while a sustained move above $5.139 may signal a bullish shift. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed.

These laws allow enforcement agencies to confiscate assets even if it cannot be proved that someone has broken the law. This means if officials believe that anyone has earned cryptocurrency illegally or that person cannot explain where the money came from, the police and other arms of the government will be able to acquire it by law. Swedish lawmakers advocate for a national Bitcoin reserve The new laws are one of the strictest in Europe, Strömmer noted. Following reliable sources, the rule prompted the seizure of 80 million Swedish kronor, equivalent to $8.4 million in assets. According to the website of the Swedish parliament, this law also applies to children and young people, as well as those who suffered from a severe mental disorder at the time of the crime. Based on the Minister of Justice they aim to ensure that the authorities work together more closely and pay special attention to assets that bring big profits. “Now it’s a matter of turning up the pressure further,” Strömmer said. Strömmer’s requests for more active seizures come as some Riksdag lawmakers advocate creating a national Bitcoin reserve . This approach resembles the trend in the US, Czechia, and Italy. In the meantime, a leading advocate of a Bitcoin reserve, Dennis Dioukarev, a Member of the Riksdag, commented on the topic of discussion. Dioukarev told reporters he agrees with Strömmer’s calls to increase seizure enforcement. He welcomed every effort to seize illegally obtained assets. Dioukarev argued that this would help to fight crime and make life hard for criminals. As for what will or should be done with seized crypto, Dioukarev reiterates his calls for the accumulation of a strategic reserve. Based on his explanation, cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin in particular that are confiscated should be transferred to Sweden’s central bank, the Riksbank, to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve. The Swedish authorities reveal increasing cryptocurrency adoption among criminals When reporters last asked Minister Strömmer’s press office about the fate of seized cryptocurrencies, one of his press officers responded that they could not answer those questions then. This inability to comment also extended to questions about what steps Strömmer and the Swedish government intend to take to enhance crypto-related asset seizures. In 2024, 62,000 individuals were part of or linked to criminal networks in Sweden, according to the Bloomsbury Intelligence & Security Institute. Drug dealers and money launderers were among those using cryptocurrency a lot, though it is hard to measure exactly how much. Additionally, in September, the Police Authority and the Financial Intelligence Unit in Sweden reported that some cryptocurrency exchanges were skilled money launderers. The report recommended that law enforcement gradually increase its monitoring and infiltration of crypto exchange platforms to help detect and disrupt illegal operations.

An analyst suggests that the flagship crypto’s daily close could set the stage for a bullish end of the week despite potential volatility. Related Reading: SUI Prepares For Bullish Flag Breakout Amid $3 Reclaim – Analyst Doubles The Target Bitcoin Breakout To Come ‘Sooner Or Later’ At the start of the new quarter, Bitcoin has retested crucial levels, touching the $105,000 support and $110,000 resistance over the past four days. Amid its Tuesday pullback, the flagship crypto fell to a two-week low but managed to bounce from a crucial range. Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems previously noted that BTC needed a strong rebound from the “most important” support and resistance area, between the $104,000 and $106,000 price levels, explaining that failing to hold this range would open the door for a drop to the range lows around $101,000. On Friday, the analyst highlighted Bitcoin’s price action after holding the key levels, which “provided the perfect entry for a bounce, just as expected.” Following this performance, he asserted that Bitcoin is expanding on its two-month Power of Three (Po3) setup, signaling that potential further expansion is ahead. Nonetheless, he pointed out that the flagship crypto is still trading in a two-month range, suggesting a volatile price action until the price successfully breaks out, which it has attempted to do earlier this week. “Since we are in a range, we are forced to respect the key levels of the range: high, mid, and low,” Sjuul detailed, adding that all eyes are currently on the mid-range, where bulls must step in to confirm the bullish move to the range high. Based on this, the analyst forecasted another move above the $110,00 mark, where “we have left a lot of unfinished business” and “plenty of liquidity lies.” He pointed to a huge cluster near the $111,000 area in BTC’s Liquidity Heatmap, affirming that “price is attracted by liquidity, so I am expecting that level to be visited sooner or later.” BTC Eyes Pivotal Closes After being rejected from the $108,000 at the start of the week, analyst Rekt Capital noted that Bitcoin broke out of two 2-week downtrends in the past 40 days but was rejected from the crucial 6-week diagonal downtrend, around the $108,000 mark, during the same timeframe. This week, BTC closed above this resistance twice, and daily closed above the $109,000 mark on Thursday. However, Friday’s pullback saw Bitcoin drop below the crucial level, falling to the $107,245 area. The analyst considers that a key retest of the pattern is in progress. He previously explained that any dipping into the top of Bitcoin’s pattern could “technically be considered additional retesting to further solidify the recently broken black diagonal resistance into new support.” Nonetheless, BTC must close today above the diagonal resistance for a successful retest. “Bitcoin is losing the diagonal for the moment. But if price Daily Closes above the diagonal, then this will have ended as a downside wick as part of a volatile retest. Upcoming Daily Close will be pivotal,” he stated.

In 2017, Ethereum earned that spot. In 2021, it was Solana. Now, in 2025, BlockDAG appears to be stepping into that same role. What started as a quietly promising Layer 1 is now being called the most viral presale of the year. Conversations about BlockDAG (BDAG) have flooded every corner of the crypto internet, from Twitter to Telegram, Reddit threads to YouTube breakdowns. And the numbers reflect the excitement: over $329.5 million in funding, 200,000 holders, 2 million+ downloads of the X1 mining app, and 18,250 ASIC units sold. But what’s truly driving this momentum? It’s the nonstop surge in social attention, arriving just as altcoin season kicks off in Q3. X1 Miner App Explodes Past 2 Million Downloads At the core of BlockDAG’s viral rise is the X1 Miner App , a mobile mining tool that has become one of 2025’s most talked-about Web3 platforms. With over 2 million users onboard, it’s clear the growth wasn’t fueled by traditional ads or influencer campaigns. Instead, users themselves drove the buzz. Built on a Proof-of-Engagement model, the app rewards users for daily check-ins, inviting friends, and quick in-app tasks. That creates an ongoing loop where people earn BDAG, post their results, bring in new users, and repeat. Screenshots of mining rewards, invite bonuses, and leaderboard rankings now fill crypto spaces like Reddit, Twitter, and Discord. This flywheel effect has turned the X1 app into a grassroots phenomenon, where the community becomes both the miner and the marketer. As a result, the app has evolved from a utility to a social engine, pushing downloads even higher each day. BlockDAG Goes Global with Major Sports Deals BlockDAG’s presence isn’t limited to screens and feeds. It’s entering the real world through major sports collaborations. Recent sponsorships with the Seattle Seawolves (rugby) and Seattle Orcas (cricket) have made waves both inside and outside the crypto industry. Just days after the announcements, branded gear, athlete shoutouts, and behind-the-scenes content started trending. Fans, athletes, and crypto personalities began sharing BlockDAG photos online, with one message getting louder across platforms: Web3 is entering the spotlight, and BlockDAG is leading the charge. There’s more. Sources close to the project have confirmed a third U.S.-based sponsorship deal will be signed soon. It’s awaiting final regulatory clearance and could rank among the largest sports partnerships in crypto history once revealed. These aren’t just brand plays, they’re strategic bridges between Web3 and massive real-world audiences. And for BlockDAG, that bridge is proving very effective. Social Surge: BlockDAG Dominates TikTok, X, and More Building a single strong crypto community is hard. Building one across every major platform at the same time is nearly unheard of. But BlockDAG has done just that. Here’s how its online presence stacks up: Twitter (X): Over 120,000 mentions in July alone Telegram: A thriving network of 100,000+ members across buying hubs, support groups, and regional chats YouTube: Dozens of user-made videos ranging from mining tutorials to BDAG price speculation TikTok and Discord: Fast-growing followings where the conversation never slows What makes this unique is the cross-platform synergy. BlockDAG isn’t relying on one channel; it’s dominating all of them at once. That level of exposure directly supports its massive presale performance, turning online buzz into measurable ecosystem growth. BDAG at $0.0016 Until August 11: Here’s What That Means Despite all the attention, BlockDAG’s presale still offers BDAG at $0.0016, locked in until August 11. After that, the coin will move toward its confirmed launch price of $0.05. This means buyers are looking at a potential 3,025% gain from current levels. But this limited-time pricing isn’t the only thing drawing interest. Several powerful signals are converging right now: A functioning ecosystem, not just a roadmap Unmatched social buzz across every major platform Confirmed real-world sponsorships connecting Web3 to mainstream sports A launch plan is already in motion as the BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release approaches in August This isn’t hype for the sake of it. The project is laying down infrastructure and onboarding users daily, all while the broader market catches up. Final Thoughts Crypto is no stranger to buzz, but what BlockDAG is doing goes well beyond the usual trend cycle. With a mining app that’s changing how mobile users participate, real sports sponsorships bringing new eyes to Web3, and nonstop activity across Twitter and Telegram, BDAG isn’t following the market; it’s shaping it. The BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release is set for August 11, and miner hardware is ready to roll out. The app is growing. The community is expanding. And the crypto presale is entering its final stages. BlockDAG is no longer the best-kept secret in crypto. It’s the most talked-about project of the moment, and if the current pace continues, it could soon define the next chapter in Layer 1 evolution.

This rally happened as Bitcoin crossed $110,000 and Ethereum climbed beyond $2,600, fueling optimism across the crypto market. Yet beneath the surface, whale behavior hinted at a different trend one pointing toward a new contender: Pepeto. While PEPE was rallying, on-chain metrics revealed early signs of change. Whale wallets holding PEPE tokens increased their positions by 5% over the last month, while the total exchange balances dropped to their lowest level in nearly two years. Such patterns often precede either large breakouts or sudden sell-offs. Reports now suggest many whales are rotating funds into Pepeto instead. PEPE: Bullish But Facing Questions PEPE’s move higher was largely driven by positive sentiment around Ethereum and renewed confidence in the broader crypto space. As an ERC-20 token, PEPE tends to follow Ethereum’s momentum during big moves. Nansen shows whales now control around 7.95 trillion PEPE tokens, up from earlier levels, and the top 100 wallets alone hold roughly 302 trillion. Meanwhile, Pepeto still trades at just $0.000000138. However, as PEPE’s supply on exchanges keeps falling, more holders are moving assets into cold storage. Some analysts view this as preparation for volatility or an exit plan. Despite its popularity, PEPE’s lack of utility has led some investors to look for alternatives with more substance. Pepeto: Where Meme Coins Meet Real Utility As whales explore new options, Pepeto is emerging as a strong challenger. Rather than relying only on viral buzz, Pepeto focuses on practical features and sustainable value. The project includes a dedicated meme coin exchange, staking incentives, and cross-chain bridging technology. So far, Pepeto’s presale has raised over $5.5 million. With a capped supply of 420 trillion tokens, 30% is reserved for presale participants and another 30% for staking. This design supports liquidity and rewards committed investors. Holders can earn staking returns of up to 271% APY, distributed on a per-block basis over two years. Pepeto’s clear roadmap is split into four phases, each focused on building long-term trust and rolling out tools. This strategic plan helps it stand apart in a market often dominated by hype-driven tokens. A New Year’s Message from the God of Frogs As the New Year begins, the God of Frogs, Pepeto Himself, shares a message of triumph and faith for the loyal Pepeto Army: The Plan Unfolds: The roadmap progresses flawlessly, as foretold. Every milestone has been achieved, and the… pic.twitter.com/zCmy1bTRQY — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) January 1, 2025 What Sets Pepeto Apart Pepeto brings together several innovations that matter to serious investors: Smooth token bridging across major blockchains A zero-fee DEX for meme coin trading Staking with transparent, high-yield rewards As the crypto space matures, investors increasingly demand real utility and robust frameworks. Pepeto’s focus on both makes it an appealing option. Timing is everything. Whales moving from PEPE to Pepeto could be an early sign of a larger trend. For traders and holders searching for high-upside projects, Pepeto checks many of the right boxes.

Two wallets that had remained dormant for over 14 years each transferred 10,000 BTC to new addresses around early Friday, as CoinDesk reported . The two addresses had initially received their coins on April 3, 2011, when bitcoin traded at just 78 cents. That BTC is now worth over $1.1 billion per wallet at current prices, marking an appreciation of more than 13.9 million percent. The original source of the coins was wallet “1HqXB…gDwcK,” which sent 23,377.83 BTC to three separate wallets in 2011. Two of those — “12tLs…xj2me” and “1KbrS…AWJYm” — held the bulk until this week. The third wallet, which received 3,377 BTC, had already spent its funds in 2011. Late Friday, on-chain analysis firm Arkham flagged that six other wallets moved over 10,000 bitcoin (BTC) in quick succession, worth over $8.6 billion at current prices. The same entity apparently owns all of these wallets, Akrham said. However, no individual or company has publicly claimed ownership of these wallets as of Asian morning hours on Saturday. The transferred BTC was sent to fresh wallets using a modern, lower-fee address format. Neither of the new wallets has since moved the funds further, and the identity of the wallet owner remains unknown. All of these moved coins are among the rarest class of BTC: mined or transacted during the “Satoshi era,” a loosely defined period from bitcoin’s launch in 2009 through 2011, when its pseudonymous creator was still active online. Wallets from this time are considered part of crypto’s holy grail — rarely moved and often watched closely by traders for market signals, as any large sales could be perceived as an early believer or miner changing their stance on the market.",Markets|Bitcoin|News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|ARKM|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-05 05:12:31

With July already witnessing substantial movement on-chain, the search for the best crypto coins to invest in now is heating up. Several projects are drawing renewed attention from seasoned community members who’ve seen what it means to miss early gains. Whether it’s protocol-level innovation or strong post-launch market behavior, smart capital is shifting its focus toward platforms that combine real use with sustainable upside. Amid rising trade volumes and enhanced infrastructure support, a few names are surfacing consistently across reports and trend trackers. One such standout is Qubetics ($TICS), which has climbed the rankings quickly with notable user adoption, application utility, and powerful price action. Alongside Qubetics, this article will break down three more projects that have recently attracted attention for their tech fundamentals and July ecosystem developments. Each section includes contextual insight and unique investment scenarios to give clarity on why these coins are turning heads right now. Arweave, Injective, and Near Protocol each show distinct potential in data handling, DeFi scaling, and cross-chain development respectively. 1. Qubetics Redefines Crypto Wallet Access Across Chains with Seamless Interoperability Qubetics Wallet is more than just a secure storage option, it’s becoming a practical entry point to multi-chain interoperability. Designed as a non-custodial, multi-platform solution, the Qubetics Wallet allows users to manage their digital assets on iOS, Android, and desktop environments. Built with flexibility at its core, it supports not only $TICS tokens but also various other digital assets through its unified Layer 1 architecture. This means participants no longer need to shift between multiple blockchain platforms to execute basic transactions. For example, sending Bitcoin and interacting with Ethereum dApps can now be managed within the Qubetics ecosystem without switching wallets, dealing with bridges, or paying extra fees. Such frictionless cross-chain interaction has historically required centralized exchanges or complex bridging platforms, but Qubetics removes these hurdles altogether. This kind of practical deployment has put Qubetics among the best crypto coins to invest in now , especially for community members focused on utility beyond speculation. A similar shift toward end-user simplicity was seen when MetaMask began supporting multiple chains in its interface, but Qubetics is offering it natively at the protocol level. Qubetics’ Record-Breaking Launch and DPoS Rewards Model Position It for Long-Term Momentum In its first hour on MEXC and LBank, Qubetics reached an all-time high of $4.20, marking a massive 950% jump from its launch price of $0.40. With a presale starting at just $0.01, early participants saw potential 420x returns. For example, someone who placed $5,000 during the earliest presale round would have received 500,000 tokens. At the $4.20 high, that same amount was worth $2.1 million. This staggering growth has prompted analysts to forecast a $10–15 price range post-mainnet, especially as activity builds around its validator program. The project runs on a Delegated Proof of Stake ( DPoS ) model, which allows token holders to participate in governance and earn passive income. Holding just 5,000 $TICS enables delegation, while those holding 25,000 $TICS can become validators and receive 30% APY. Community members select delegates who process transactions and maintain the network, ensuring fair representation and steady reward distribution. What sets Qubetics apart is the high utility of its token. Besides delegation rewards, $TICS fuels transactions across chains, eliminating the need for bridges, complex swaps, or KYC barriers. Currently trending among the top 10 on CoinMarketCap, the $2 support level continues to attract consistent buy pressure, indicating strong market confidence. Moreover, Qubetics processed over $700K in trade volume within the first 24 hours of its exchange debut, validating its liquidity strength. Why This Coin Made it to This List: Qubetics offers real-world crypto infrastructure, passive earning potential via Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), and a historic early ROI, which together solidify its spot as one of the best crypto coins to invest in now. 2. Arweave’s Data Permanence Infrastructure Gains Enterprise and Public Support Arweave’s recent integrations are shaping up to push the project further into mainstream blockchain infrastructure. Known for its permanent data storage network, Arweave is now seeing traction in both Web3 and institutional archiving applications. Its permaweb model, which stores files forever on-chain, recently gained relevance as decentralized platforms sought alternatives to mutable and censorable storage services. July saw an increase in protocol use cases, particularly in NFT projects and decentralized identity frameworks. These applications need guaranteed content persistence, and Arweave’s low-cost storage model fits that demand. Developers no longer need to rely on third-party servers or risk broken URLs, Arweave’s network ensures content remains untouched and continuously accessible. Community discussions in tech circles also hint at possible collaborations with major content platforms and civic data storage providers, expanding Arweave’s potential market reach. Although specific partnerships remain undisclosed, its protocol’s open adoption metrics continue to trend upward this month. Why This Coin Made it to This List: Arweave’s relevance in the Web3 storage sector is growing consistently, making it one of the best crypto coins to invest in now for those eyeing blockchain infrastructure beyond transactions. 3. Injective’s Growth in On-Chain Derivatives and AI Integration Draws Market Interest Injective Protocol is carving its identity as a serious contender in the decentralized finance space. The chain focuses on fast, low-cost on-chain derivatives and is expanding its support for new DeFi primitives, including synthetic assets. What sets it apart this July is the increasing number of integrations with AI-driven financial tools, designed to optimize trade execution and liquidity routing in real time. This month, Injective unveiled updates that simplify asset listings and automate risk management on its decentralized exchange framework. These changes allow builders to deploy scalable trading products without needing to code from scratch or depend on Ethereum’s congestion-prone network. The protocol is also integrating into liquidity mining programs, drawing attention from developers who want scalable, AI-enhanced market infrastructure. Its use of the Cosmos SDK gives it fast block times, and this technical edge continues to generate traction in developer forums and launchpad platforms. Why This Coin Made it to This List: Injective offers real DeFi utility and strong technical fundamentals, making it one of the best crypto coins to invest in now for participants focused on AI, derivatives, and protocol-level innovation. 4. Near Protocol Scales With Zero-Knowledge and Modular Chain Development in July Near Protocol is ramping up its ecosystem expansion in July with a shift toward zero-knowledge proof integrations and modular app development. Known for its sharded, high-throughput structure, Near is pushing deeper into privacy layers and developer-friendly customization. These advancements have brought new dev teams into the fold and bolstered activity on Near-native apps. July also saw the roll-out of simplified account abstraction, which reduces friction for users unfamiliar with wallet seed phrases and gas fees. This push to bring Web2-like UX into crypto environments is turning heads in enterprise circles that are prioritizing onboarding simplicity for their users. Several modular components introduced by Near allow teams to plug in specialized functions like zk-verification, private swaps, or custom consensus rules, all without rebuilding full chain infrastructure. This design is helping it appeal to both early-stage startups and mature blockchain platforms. Why This Coin Made it to This List: Near Protocol’s July rollouts improve developer and user accessibility, securing its rank among the best crypto coins to invest in now for multi-chain dApp innovation. Conclusion: Why These Projects Top the List of Best Crypto Coins to Invest in Now The common thread across Qubetics , Arweave, Injective, and Near Protocol is simple: real development, strong user-facing solutions, and a growing base of supporters who see long-term viability. From Qubetics’ 30% APY validator system and native wallet to Arweave’s unmatched permanence, these aren’t just coins, they’re entire infrastructures. Injective’s AI-enabled trading and Near’s modular flexibility offer additional dimensions to what participants can build or benefit from. For those evaluating the best crypto coins to invest in now, these four projects offer a mix of usability, scalability, and credible returns. With the continued momentum seen throughout July, particularly in staking-based systems like Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), the outlook on these projects remains firm. Smart capital is watching, and many are already positioning early.

Despite the dip, price action remains constructive with higher lows forming above $2.20 — a level that has emerged as key short-term support. While macro headwinds continue to pressure digital assets broadly, XRP’s bullish structure and rising institutional narrative, including Ripple’s U.S. bank license application and ETF speculation, are keeping long-term sentiment intact. News Background The cryptocurrency market remains on edge as geopolitical and trade tensions between major economies continue to cloud investor confidence. However, XRP’s long-term outlook is bolstered by Ripple’s ongoing push for regulatory clarity and deeper financial integration. The firm’s recent application for a U.S. national banking license with the OCC, alongside a separate bid for a Federal Reserve master account, could unlock direct access to the Fed’s payment systems — a groundbreaking development for a crypto-native firm. Analysts also point to structural bullish signals, with XRP forming higher highs and higher lows across multiple timeframes.

This landmark legislative act, as reported by CBS News, is poised to reshape the nation’s financial landscape through a comprehensive package of tax breaks and significant spending cuts. For anyone following the intricacies of global markets, understanding the implications of such a monumental Trump Bill is paramount, as shifts in US Fiscal Policy often ripple through various sectors, including the burgeoning digital asset space. What Exactly is the ‘One, Big, Beautiful’ Trump Bill ? Dubbed the ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill’ by President Trump himself, this legislation represents a critical pivot in the administration’s economic strategy. Far from a simple amendment, it’s a sweeping reform designed to stimulate growth, reduce government expenditure, and, in the eyes of its proponents, usher in an era of unprecedented prosperity. At its core, the bill encompasses two primary pillars: Extensive Tax Breaks: These are designed to put more money back into the pockets of American families and businesses, encouraging investment and consumption. Strategic Spending Cuts: Aimed at trimming down federal expenditures across various departments, with the goal of reducing the national debt and fostering fiscal responsibility. The signing ceremony itself, held amidst the patriotic fervor of Independence Day, underscored the administration’s belief in the bill’s transformative power, presenting it as a gift to the American people on their nation’s birthday. But what are the specifics, and how might these changes affect the average American and the broader economy? Unpacking the Tax Reform Components: Who Benefits and How? The tax reform aspect of the ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill’ is perhaps its most immediately impactful feature. It introduces a series of adjustments aimed at both individual taxpayers and corporate entities, with the overarching goal of fostering economic dynamism. While specific details of the tax breaks are still being widely discussed, the general thrust is clear: For Individuals: Many Americans are expected to see a reduction in their tax burden, potentially leading to increased disposable income. This could stimulate consumer spending, a key driver of economic growth. The legislation aims to simplify the tax code for many, reducing the complexity of annual filings. For Corporations: A significant reduction in corporate tax rates is a cornerstone of this bill. The theory is that lower corporate taxes will incentivize businesses to invest more domestically, create jobs, and repatriate profits currently held overseas. This could lead to a surge in business expansion and innovation. Proponents argue that these tax breaks will act as a powerful stimulant, injecting capital directly into the economy. Critics, however, voice concerns about the potential for increased national debt if the cuts are not offset by sufficient revenue generation or spending reductions, and whether the benefits will be equitably distributed across all income brackets. The Promise of Government Spending Reductions: A Path to Fiscal Health? Complementing the tax breaks are the substantial government spending cuts outlined in the bill. This aspect reflects a commitment to fiscal austerity, seeking to rein in federal expenditures that have grown significantly over the decades. The targeted cuts are broad, touching various government agencies and programs. The rationale behind these reductions is multi-faceted: Debt Reduction: By spending less, the government aims to slow the growth of, and eventually reduce, the national debt, which has been a long-standing concern for economists and policymakers. Efficiency and Accountability: The cuts are often framed as a means to streamline government operations, eliminate wasteful spending, and enhance accountability across federal departments. Fiscal Discipline: This move signals a shift towards a more conservative fiscal approach, emphasizing responsible budgeting and prioritizing essential services while scaling back on others. While the long-term benefits of reduced government spending are often debated, the immediate impact can be felt in various sectors. Some programs may face reduced funding, leading to adjustments in their operations. The challenge lies in implementing these cuts without negatively impacting critical services or stifling necessary investments in infrastructure and social programs. The delicate balance between fiscal responsibility and societal well-being is at the heart of this legislative effort. What is the Anticipated Economic Impact on the Nation? The signing of the ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill’ on July 4th is undoubtedly a moment that will be analyzed for its profound Economic Impact . The combination of tax cuts and spending reductions creates a unique economic experiment, with various potential outcomes. Here’s a look at what economists and market watchers are considering: Potential for Growth: The theory behind the tax cuts is that they will spur business investment and consumer spending, leading to higher GDP growth and job creation. Lower corporate taxes could also make the U.S. a more attractive place for businesses to operate, potentially drawing in foreign investment. Inflationary Pressures: If the tax cuts significantly boost demand without a corresponding increase in supply, there could be inflationary pressures. This is a key concern for central banks and could influence future monetary policy decisions. National Debt Trajectory: While spending cuts aim to reduce the national debt, the immediate impact of significant tax revenue reductions could lead to an initial increase in the deficit. The long-term trajectory will depend on the extent of economic growth generated and the discipline of future spending. Market Reactions: Financial markets, including traditional stocks and bonds, will closely watch the implementation and early results of this bill. Positive sentiment around potential growth could boost equities, while concerns about deficits or inflation could lead to volatility. For the cryptocurrency market, while not directly impacted, the broader economic health and investor sentiment influenced by such policies can indirectly affect digital asset valuations as capital flows shift. The real-world effects will unfold over months and years, providing a crucial test for the bill’s underlying economic philosophy. Businesses will adjust investment plans, consumers will adapt spending habits, and the government will navigate a new fiscal reality. Navigating the Future of US Fiscal Policy : What’s Next? With the ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill’ now law, the landscape of US Fiscal Policy has been irrevocably altered. This legislation sets a new precedent and direction for how the government manages its finances and interacts with the economy. For citizens, businesses, and investors alike, understanding the implications and preparing for the future is key. For Citizens: Monitor your personal tax situation. The tax breaks may mean more disposable income, but it’s wise to consult with financial advisors to understand how the changes specifically affect your household and long-term financial planning. For Businesses: Evaluate the new corporate tax rates and spending environments. This could be an opportune time for expansion, investment in new technologies, or strategic restructuring to leverage the new fiscal landscape. For Investors: Keep a close eye on economic indicators. GDP growth, inflation rates, and employment figures will be critical in assessing the bill’s effectiveness. Diversifying portfolios and staying informed on how these policies influence different market sectors, including the evolving digital asset space, remains a prudent strategy. The bill represents a significant commitment to a particular economic vision. Its success will be measured not just in immediate financial metrics but also in its long-term impact on job creation, innovation, and the overall prosperity of the nation. As the country moves forward, the ongoing debate and adjustments to this new fiscal framework will undoubtedly shape the economic narrative for years to come. A New Chapter in American Economics The signing of the ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill’ on July 4th marks a pivotal moment in American economic history. By introducing a sweeping package of tax breaks and spending cuts, the Trump administration has laid out a clear vision for the nation’s financial future. While the full effects will only become clear over time, this legislation promises to ignite debates, stimulate economic activity, and challenge conventional wisdom about government’s role in the economy. It is a bold move, undertaken on a day that celebrates freedom and new beginnings, and its legacy will undoubtedly be discussed and analyzed for generations.

In a significant development, Sweden is taking a decisive stand. The nation’s Justice Minister, Gunnar Strömmer, has issued an urgent call for authorities to intensify their efforts in seizing illegally acquired assets, with a particular focus on digital currencies. This bold move signals a new era for Swedish crypto seizures , aiming to cut off funding for criminal enterprises and uphold the rule of law. Why is Sweden Intensifying Swedish Crypto Seizures ? Sweden, known for its progressive stance and robust legal framework, is now at the forefront of combating financial crime in the digital age. Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer’s recent directive underscores a growing concern among global governments regarding the use of cryptocurrencies in illicit activities such as money laundering, drug trafficking, and cybercrime. The anonymity and borderless nature of digital assets can make them attractive to criminals, posing a significant challenge to traditional law enforcement methods. The call to action by Minister Strömmer is not merely a suggestion but a reinforcement of a powerful new legal tool. A forfeiture law, which came into effect last November, empowers Swedish authorities to confiscate illicit gains, including cryptocurrencies, without necessarily needing to prove a specific underlying crime. This is a game-changer, shifting the burden and making it significantly easier for the state to reclaim assets derived from criminal activities. The emphasis is on proactive enforcement, targeting high-profit assets to maximize the impact on criminal networks. Combating Organized Crime: A primary driver is to dismantle organized crime groups by hitting them where it hurts most – their finances. Adapting to Digital Crime: Recognizing that criminals are increasingly using digital assets, the legal framework must evolve to keep pace. Recovering Illicit Gains: Ensuring that crime does not pay, and ill-gotten wealth is returned to society or used to fund public services. Understanding the New Illegal Asset Forfeiture Law The forfeiture law introduced in November is a pivotal piece of legislation in Sweden’s fight against financial crime. Traditionally, authorities would need to secure a conviction for a specific crime to seize assets. However, this new law introduces a non-conviction-based forfeiture mechanism, often referred to as “unexplained wealth orders” or “civil forfeiture” in other jurisdictions. This means if assets are deemed to be illicitly acquired, they can be confiscated even if a criminal conviction isn’t obtained, or if the perpetrator cannot be identified or prosecuted. This paradigm shift is crucial for addressing the complexities of crypto-related crimes. Tracing digital assets through multiple wallets and exchanges can be arduous, and linking them directly to a specific individual or crime can be even harder. The new law provides a broader legal basis for action. It mandates closer collaboration between various enforcement bodies, including the tax agency, police, and customs, to leverage their combined expertise and resources in identifying and seizing these assets. Key aspects of the new illegal asset forfeiture law: Feature Traditional Forfeiture New Swedish Forfeiture Law (November) Proof Required Proof of specific criminal conviction. Proof that assets are illicitly acquired (no conviction needed). Scope Tied to proven criminal acts. Broader, targets assets deemed illicit regardless of specific conviction. Asset Types Tangible assets, bank accounts. Includes all assets, specifically targeting cryptocurrencies. Enforcement Primarily police/prosecutors. Collaborative approach: police, tax agency, customs, etc. The Role of Gunnar Strömmer in This Crackdown Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer has emerged as a key figure in Sweden’s aggressive stance against illicit finance. His outspoken advocacy for more stringent enforcement of the new forfeiture law highlights the government’s commitment to tackling organized crime head-on. Strömmer’s call for agencies to “more actively apply” the law and “target high-profit assets” indicates a strategic shift towards proactive and impactful seizures rather than reactive responses. Strömmer’s vision extends beyond mere confiscation; it encompasses a holistic approach to disrupting criminal networks. By emphasizing inter-agency collaboration, he aims to create a seamless enforcement ecosystem where information and expertise are shared efficiently. This collaborative model is vital for navigating the complex and often technical nature of crypto confiscation . It acknowledges that no single agency possesses all the necessary tools or knowledge to effectively track, seize, and manage digital assets. His statements underscore the urgency and importance of this initiative for national security and public trust. The message is clear: Sweden is determined to ensure that criminals cannot hide their ill-gotten gains in the digital realm. What Does This Mean for Crypto Confiscation Globally? Sweden’s proactive approach to crypto confiscation is not an isolated incident but part of a growing global trend. As cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, governments worldwide are grappling with how to regulate them and prevent their misuse by criminals. The Swedish model, particularly its non-conviction-based forfeiture, could serve as a blueprint for other nations seeking to strengthen their legal frameworks against digital asset crime. Several countries have already begun to implement similar measures or are exploring them: United States: Has a robust civil forfeiture system that allows for the seizure of assets suspected of being involved in criminal activity, even without a conviction. United Kingdom: Introduced Unexplained Wealth Orders (UWOs) which compel individuals to explain the legitimate source of their wealth, failing which assets can be seized. Canada: Provincial civil forfeiture laws allow for the seizure of property used in or derived from unlawful activity, independent of criminal charges. The challenges in crypto confiscation remain significant. They include the technical complexities of accessing private keys, the jurisdictional hurdles of cross-border transactions, and the need for specialized training for law enforcement. However, Sweden’s push signals a commitment to overcome these challenges through legal innovation and inter-agency cooperation. This global trend suggests that the era of relatively unchecked illicit crypto activity is drawing to a close, as governments arm themselves with more potent legal tools. Navigating the Future of Digital Asset Recovery The intensification of digital asset recovery efforts by Sweden and other nations marks a critical juncture for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. For legitimate users and businesses, this means increased scrutiny and potentially more stringent compliance requirements. For those involved in illicit activities, the message is unequivocal: the digital realm is no longer a safe haven for criminal proceeds. Actionable insights for various stakeholders: For Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Service Providers: Strengthen KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) protocols. Enhance collaboration with law enforcement agencies, providing timely and accurate information when requested. Invest in advanced blockchain analytics tools to identify suspicious transactions. For Law Enforcement Agencies: Prioritize training in blockchain forensics and cryptocurrency investigations. Foster inter-agency and international cooperation to overcome jurisdictional barriers. Develop specialized units dedicated to digital asset recovery. For Individuals: Ensure all cryptocurrency holdings are acquired through legitimate means. Maintain meticulous records of transactions and sources of funds. Be aware of evolving regulations regarding digital assets in your jurisdiction. The path forward for digital asset recovery will involve continuous adaptation. As technology evolves, so too will the methods used by criminals and, consequently, the strategies employed by law enforcement. Sweden’s bold step serves as a powerful reminder that the fight against financial crime is extending deeper into the digital frontier, making the cryptocurrency space safer and more transparent for legitimate participants. Conclusion: A Safer Digital Frontier Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer’s urgent call for tougher seizures of illegal assets, including cryptocurrencies, marks a significant moment in Sweden’s commitment to combating financial crime. The new forfeiture law, coupled with a push for enhanced inter-agency collaboration, positions Sweden at the forefront of digital asset recovery. This proactive stance not only aims to disrupt criminal networks by targeting their financial lifelines but also sets a precedent for other nations grappling with similar challenges. As the world increasingly embraces digital currencies, the imperative to ensure they are not exploited for illicit purposes becomes paramount. Sweden’s actions send a clear message: the digital frontier is not beyond the reach of justice, and the era of unchecked illicit crypto gains is rapidly drawing to a close. This move ultimately strengthens the integrity of the crypto ecosystem, fostering a more secure environment for all legitimate participants.

Not long after, a whale that had remained dormant for over 14 years woke up, transferred 10,000 BTC, and reportedly sold. Many more ‘Billionaire’ whales have also emerged. Despite this, the BTC price continues to remain calm with fewer signs of a massive pullback. This raises concerns over the upcoming rally as the price remains unaffected by the whale movements. 80,000 BTC Moved—Will They Be SOLD? During the earlier days of BTC, addresses held more than 10,000 BTC. There are 20 such dormant addresses, which collectively hold 1% of all BTC mined in 2010-2011. Interestingly, 8 out of 20 addresses have just woken up and have transferred more than 80,000 BTC collectively. Source: X The question is not whether the whales are preparing for a sell-off, but why they have moved now. Previously, when Bitcoin surged above the $100K milestone and went on to mark a new ATH above $111K, these whales remained passive. Now that the price has hit $110K yet again, these whales have become active. This suggests either the whales may not be confident of the upcoming price action, or they may be feeling that the markets may face a liquidity crunch as BTC marks a new ATH. Hence, they may be preparing to accumulate as much liquidity as they can. However, many believe this whale is an old miner from 2011, having originally controlled around 200,000 BTC. Meanwhile, the rumors are also that these are Satoshi-linked funds, but there is no evidence to support this. Historically, Q1 2025 has seen more BTC token transfers than Q1 2024, marking a 121% year-on-year increase, which signals a broader trend of awakening old coins. What Does it Mean Going Forward? The Bitcoin price may face high short-term volatility, such as large transactions that usually spook the markets.

Crypto trading became legal in 2018 when New Zealand recognized it as property for tax purposes. The nation opts for clever crypto approaches, as the interest in digital asset investments is growing rapidly. As of 2025, New Zealand is tightening its hold on security to enhance transparency and combat tax evasion in the region. While the country has not regulated specific crypto laws this year, it has indirectly impacted crypto with fintech laws. Table of contents Crypto regulations in New Zealand 2025 What is the New Zealand Government Saying About Crypto? Crypto License in New Zealand 2025 Crypto Tax in New Zealand 2025 Crypto Adoption in New Zealand 2025 Conclusion FAQs Crypto regulations in New Zealand 2025 April 1, 2026– Introduction of OECD in Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) CARF, through the Taxation Act 2025, will come into effect in 2025. It aims at enhancing transparency and combating tax evasion in the crypto space while establishing rules for crypto asset services providers (CASPs). Crypto transaction reporting obligations for CASPs will be mandatory under this law . March 31, 2025- Conduct of Financial Institutions (CoFI) Under this legislation, fair conduct principles for financial institutions, including crypto, are compulsory. While this legislation does not directly regulate crypto as a financial product, it does impact how financial institutions dealing with crypto assets conduct themselves. March 2025- Financial Markets Authority (FMA) Regulatory Sandbox FMA announced a regulatory sandbox for 2025, where fintech companies, including developing blockchain corporations, can test innovative products under supervision. It also fosters collaboration between the government and the crypto industry, promoting consumer protection and market integrity. March 29, 2025- Consumer and Product Data Act This law introduces a legislated consumer data right (CDR) in the financial sector. While this law does not directly regulate crypto, it can indirectly impact data rights and data sharing in the digital industry and blockchain developments. What is the New Zealand Government Saying About Crypto? The Financial Market Authority (FMA) is the key regulator of cryptocurrency and digital assets in New Zealand. Currently, the agency is focusing on licensing and tax regimes while releasing warnings against crypto scams in the region. The agency released a set of crypto scams in New Zealand while suggesting some tips for investments to avoid such situations. One of the biggest crypto risks in New Zealand, according to the FMA, is the inability to find out the entity offering services. FMA said that due to big overseas crypto exchanges, it is hard to find out who is offering, buying, selling, or exchanging crypto, putting the assets at risk of theft. It stated– “Because it is decentralised by nature, there’s no control by a single entity such as a government, bank, or financial institution – there are no restrictions on who can issue them.” Crypto License in New Zealand 2025 Licensing: While there are no specific crypto licenses in New Zealand , crypto asset service providers (CASPs) and wallet service providers must register with the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) as financial service providers (FSPs) to obtain a crypto license to continue operations. Compliance: CASPs, wallet service providers, and businesses involved with crypto must comply with anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorism financing (CFT), and the know-your-customer (KYC) obligations. Reporting: Entities providing digital asset services may be required to report their transaction and other information to FMC, especially if any suspicious activity is discovered. Crypto Tax in New Zealand 2025 Capital Gains Tax (CGT): CGT does not apply to crypto in New Zealand, as it considers crypto as property. Income Tax: Earning and disposing of crypto is subject to general income tax in New Zealand. The key advisor on government tax policies in New Zealand, the Inland Revenue Department (IRD), said in a statement – “If you acquire crypto assets to dispose of them, you need to pay income tax on any profit you make. For example, if you buy or mine crypto assets to sell or exchange them. If you make a loss when you sell your crypto asset, you may be able to claim this loss.” Income tax bracket Annual Income Rate (2024-2025) Tax Rate Annual Income Rate (2025-2026) Up to $14,000 10.5% Up to $15,600 Up to $14,001 – $15,600 12.82% – $15,601–$48,000 17.5% $15,601 – $53,500 $48,001 – $53,500 21.64% – $53,501–$70,000 30% $53,501 – $78,100 $70,001 – $78,100 30.99% – $78,101–$180,000 33% $78,101 – $180,000 Over $180,000 39% $180,001+ Crypto Adoption in New Zealand 2025 User Penetration Rate: Currently, the user penetration rate is projected to be 33.59% and is forecasted to increase to 34.78% by 2026. The number of crypto users is expected to reach 1.84 million by 2026. Crypto Revenue: In 2025, the crypto revenue is projected to reach US$174.1 million, which is anticipated to show an annual growth of 15.37%, resulting in a projected total amount of US$200.8 million by 2026. Crypto Holdings: No public information on the government’s crypto holdings in New Zealand is available; no indication or evidence that the government is investing or holding any digital assets. Conclusion Despite legal uncertainties, the crypto market in New Zealand is growing as the popularity of digital assets has spread worldwide. The government of New Zealand is currently taking a “wait and see” approach to cryptocurrency, not providing much clarity in the regulations. If the country provides legal transparency on digital assets, it may boost the adoption rate and expand the national economy.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a crucial barometer for investor sentiment, recently registered 67 on July 5th, a slight dip from the previous day but still firmly entrenched in the ‘Greed’ zone. For seasoned investors and curious newcomers alike, understanding this index is like having a compass in the often-turbulent seas of crypto. But what does this ‘Greed’ signal truly mean for your digital assets, and how can you leverage this insight to make smarter decisions? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Deep Dive into Market Sentiment At its core, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by Alternative, is designed to distill the complex emotions driving the cryptocurrency market into a single, digestible number. Ranging from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed), it offers a snapshot of whether market participants are feeling overly anxious or excessively exuberant. This index isn’t just a random number; it’s a sophisticated aggregation of various data points, aiming to capture the collective psychological state of crypto investors. Why is this important? Because emotions, particularly fear and greed, are powerful forces in financial markets. When fear dominates, investors tend to panic sell, often at a loss. Conversely, when greed takes over, it can lead to irrational exuberance, inflated prices, and eventually, market corrections. The index serves as a potential contrarian indicator: extreme fear might signal a buying opportunity, while extreme greed could suggest it’s time to exercise caution. The Six Pillars of the Index: What Drives the Numbers? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t a simple survey; it’s a weighted average of six distinct factors, each contributing to the overall score. Let’s break down these components to truly understand what influences the Crypto Market Sentiment : Volatility (25%): This factor measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility, especially sudden downward movements, often indicates fear in the market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This component analyzes the current trading volume and market momentum, comparing it with average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a rising market suggests strong positive momentum and potentially greed. Social Media (15%): The index scans various social media platforms, particularly Twitter, for crypto-related hashtags and analyzes the sentiment of posts. A high volume of positive, excited mentions can point towards increasing greed. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, this factor historically involved weekly polls asking investors about their market outlook. These surveys provided direct insights into investor confidence. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin Dominance refers to Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. An increasing Bitcoin dominance often indicates that investors are moving from altcoins to Bitcoin, which is seen as a safer haven during uncertain times (fear), or that Bitcoin is leading a bull run (greed, but more focused). Google Trends (10%): This factor analyzes search queries related to cryptocurrencies on Google Trends. A surge in searches for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘crypto crash’ might indicate fear, while terms like ‘how to buy crypto’ or ‘Bitcoin halving’ during a bull run could signal growing public interest and greed. The weighting of these factors highlights their perceived importance in gauging overall market sentiment. It’s a holistic approach, moving beyond just price action to include the underlying psychological currents. Navigating the ‘Greed Zone’: What Does a 67 Mean for Your Investments? With the index at 67, we are firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone. But what does this imply for you as an investor? Being in the Greed Zone suggests that investors are becoming overly optimistic, potentially leading to inflated prices due to Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO). Here’s what it typically signifies: Increased FOMO: Many investors might be rushing to buy, fearing they’ll miss out on further price increases. This can drive prices up unsustainably. Higher Risk: As prices climb on the back of speculative buying, the market becomes more vulnerable to sudden corrections. The risk of buying at a local top increases. Potential for Profit-Taking: Experienced traders often view the ‘Greed’ zone as a signal to consider taking some profits off the table, especially if they entered positions during periods of fear. It’s crucial to remember that the index is a sentiment tool, not a crystal ball. A high ‘Greed’ reading doesn’t guarantee an immediate crash, just as ‘Fear’ doesn’t guarantee an immediate rally. However, it serves as a powerful reminder to approach the market with a degree of caution and to re-evaluate your investment strategy. Challenges and Limitations: Why Market Volatility Isn’t the Only Factor While incredibly useful, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t without its limitations. Relying solely on this index for investment decisions can be perilous. For instance, while Market Volatility is a significant component, it’s just one piece of a much larger puzzle. Other factors to consider include: Aspect Description Relevance to Index Economic Indicators Inflation rates, interest rates, global economic stability. Indirectly impacts overall investor confidence, which can influence crypto sentiment. Regulatory News New laws, bans, or approvals for cryptocurrencies. Directly impacts market sentiment, sometimes overriding index signals. Technological Developments Upgrades to blockchain networks, new dApps, scaling solutions. Can drive long-term value and sentiment, not fully captured by short-term sentiment metrics. Whale Movements Large transactions by institutional investors or major holders. Can significantly influence price and sentiment, often before the index fully reflects it. The index is most effective when used as a complementary tool alongside technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and a thorough understanding of macroeconomic trends. It’s a sentiment gauge, not a definitive buy or sell signal. Unlocking Insights: How to Leverage the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for Better Decisions So, how can you effectively integrate the Crypto Fear & Greed Index into your investment strategy? Here are some actionable insights: Contrarian Thinking: The classic advice is to be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful. When the index is extremely low (0-20), it might be a good time to accumulate assets, assuming your fundamental analysis supports the investment. When it’s extremely high (80-100), consider reducing exposure or taking profits. Risk Management: A high ‘Greed’ score should prompt you to review your portfolio’s risk exposure. Are you over-allocated to volatile assets? This might be a good time to rebalance. Patience and Discipline: Don’t let the index dictate impulsive decisions. Use it as a prompt for deeper analysis. If the index is high, ask yourself: Is this asset truly undervalued, or am I just feeling FOMO? Trend Confirmation: Observe the trend of the index. Is it steadily rising into greed, or has it just spiked? A rapid change can be more indicative of a short-term emotional swing than a sustained trend. Remember, successful investing in crypto, or any market, is about making informed, rational decisions, not emotional ones. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index helps you identify when emotions are running high, giving you an edge to act more rationally than the crowd. Conclusion: Your Compass in the Crypto Storm The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , currently hovering at 67 in the ‘Greed’ zone, offers invaluable insight into the prevailing sentiment of the cryptocurrency market. By deconstructing its components—from market momentum and social media buzz to Bitcoin Dominance and Google Trends—we gain a deeper appreciation for the complex interplay of factors that shape investor psychology. While it’s a powerful tool for gauging market sentiment and acting as a potential contrarian indicator, it’s not a standalone solution. Instead, it serves as an essential compass, guiding you to exercise caution when exuberance peaks and to consider opportunities when fear reigns supreme. By understanding and strategically utilizing this index alongside other analytical tools, you can navigate the dynamic crypto landscape with greater confidence and make more informed investment choices.

In pursuit of an ‘open participation’ model, the company is working to make its token tradable on decentralized exchanges and P2P platforms. WLFI says tokenholders can vote on token rewards if the proposal is approved In a Friday X post, WLFI stated it was making history by initiating a proposal to enable $WLFI token trading on Independence Day . The firm frames the launch as a nod to the holiday’s spirit of liberty and innovation. It even commented, “Crypto is coming home — and there’s no better day to let freedom ring.” The platform is optimistic that if the proposal is approved, it will help expand token utility, strengthen community ownership and participation, and better align long-term incentives with the protocol’s growth and adoption. Moreover, once the proposal is greenlit, tokenholders will be able to vote on matters such as token emissions, ecosystem rewards, and treasury management. WLFI also confirmed that once the ability to trade starts, it will trigger the partial unlock of tokens held by early supporters. The rest of the token supply will remain locked pending a second vote by the community to establish the release framework. Tokens belonging to founders, team members, and advisors will not unlock at this stage and will follow a more extended vesting schedule to show their commitment to the protocol’s long-term vision. Lawmakers are still concerned about Trump’s conflicts of interest, with his WLFI ties Democratic lawmakers remain wary of WLFI due to concerns over Donald Trump’s potential conflicts of interest . Although Trump claims to have cut ties with the company, his family still holds a significant stake, and he recently disclosed earning approximately $57.4 million from his involvement with the platform. In June, Trump’s family reduced their stake in the company by 20% and has been cutting off its stake since December. However, lawmakers still feel uneasy about their remaining ties. Aside from WLFI, Trump has been involved in several other crypto projects, such as the launch of his memecoin and NFT sales, from which he’s amassed over $620 million. Bloomberg even reported that crypto makes up 9% of his net worth. Last month, Representative Adam Schiff introduced the Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure(COIN) Act. This bill would bar the president, immediate family members, and executive branch officials from being involved in issuing or promoting specific digital assets if passed. WLFI collaborated with Re7 Capital for its USD1 stablecoin vault WLFI recently partnered with London’s Re7 labs to launch its USD1 stablecoin vault on Euler and Lista. No financial terms of their agreement have yet to be revealed. Evgeny Gokhberg, founder of Re7 Capital, gave a statement on their partnership, “Working alongside World Liberty, Euler, and BNB Chain, we’re advancing a model for stablecoin adoption that meets the expectations of both crypto-native and institutional users.” He added that their collaboration shows their commitment to developing DeFi infrastructure and their priority to maintaining stability, transparency, and crypto efficiency in the industry. Additionally, the United Arab Emirates-based Aqua 1 Foundation acquired $100 million worth of World Liberty tokens, becoming the second Middle Eastern entity to invest in the platform. In May, MGX, a technology investment firm, also used World Liberty’s USD1 stablecoin to facilitate its $2 billion investment in Binance.

The latest update from CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index reveals a score of 24 as of July 5th, a clear signal that the market is currently experiencing Bitcoin Season . For many investors, this number is a crucial indicator of where capital is flowing and how different digital assets are performing. But what exactly does an index score of 24 signify for your portfolio and the broader crypto market trends ? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index : What Does 24 Mean? The Altcoin Season Index , meticulously tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), provides a snapshot of the market’s current state by evaluating the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. A score of 24, as recently reported, is a definitive indicator: we are not in Altcoin Season. For the market to be declared an ‘Altcoin Season,’ a staggering 75% or more of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin within that 90-day window. Conversely, a score like 24 places us firmly in ‘Bitcoin Season,’ where 25% or fewer of these altcoins have managed to surpass Bitcoin’s performance. This index, ranging from 1 to 100, serves as a vital barometer for understanding the prevailing capital flows and investor sentiment across the digital asset landscape. Navigating Bitcoin Season : Why Dominance Matters When the Altcoin Season Index points to Bitcoin Season , it signifies a period where Bitcoin (BTC) is not just holding its own, but actively outperforming the vast majority of alternative cryptocurrencies. This dominance is not merely a statistical quirk; it reflects deeper underlying dynamics within the crypto market trends . Often, Bitcoin Season emerges during times of market uncertainty, where investors tend to flock to what they perceive as the safer, more established asset in the volatile crypto space. Bitcoin’s larger market capitalization, greater liquidity, and increasing institutional adoption contribute to its role as a ‘digital gold,’ making it a preferred haven. This period also often sees a consolidation of capital, with funds rotating out of smaller, riskier altcoins and into Bitcoin, further solidifying its lead. Analyzing Current Crypto Market Trends : Beyond the Index Score While the Altcoin Season Index provides a clear numerical value, understanding the current crypto market trends requires looking beyond just the score. Bitcoin Season is a recurring phenomenon in the cyclical nature of the cryptocurrency market. It often precedes or follows periods of intense altcoin speculation. During such times, the market’s attention and liquidity are heavily concentrated on Bitcoin, which can lead to a ‘cooling off’ period for many altcoins. This doesn’t necessarily mean altcoins are ‘dead,’ but rather that their individual altcoin performance may be subdued relative to Bitcoin. Key factors influencing these trends include global macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and significant industry news. Investors often use Bitcoin’s performance as a bellwether for the overall health and direction of the crypto ecosystem. Impact on Your Altcoin Performance : Strategies for Investors For investors holding a diversified portfolio of digital assets, the current Bitcoin Season directly impacts your altcoin performance . Many altcoins may experience stagnation or even declines in their Bitcoin-denominated value, even if their USD value remains stable or slightly increases. This period can be challenging for those solely focused on rapid altcoin gains. However, it also presents unique opportunities for strategic cryptocurrency investing . Here are some considerations: Re-evaluate your portfolio: Is your risk exposure appropriate for a Bitcoin-dominant market? Consider rebalancing some positions towards Bitcoin if you believe its dominance will continue. Focus on fundamentals: This is an excellent time to research projects with strong technology, active development, clear use cases, and solid communities. Projects with genuine utility tend to fare better in bear or consolidation phases. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider regularly investing a fixed amount into promising altcoins. This strategy can help mitigate risk during volatile periods. Patience is key: Market cycles are a natural part of crypto. While Bitcoin may be leading now, history suggests that altcoin seasons eventually return. Strategic Cryptocurrency Investing in a Shifting Landscape Successfully navigating the current market demands a strategic approach to cryptocurrency investing . Understanding that the market operates in cycles—alternating between Bitcoin dominance and altcoin surges—is paramount. During Bitcoin Season, a conservative stance might be warranted for some, focusing on capital preservation. For others, it might be an opportune moment to accumulate undervalued altcoins at lower prices, anticipating their eventual resurgence when market sentiment shifts. Diversification remains a core principle, but the allocation within that diversification might need adjustment based on the prevailing market conditions indicated by metrics like the Altcoin Season Index . Always conduct thorough due diligence and never invest more than you can afford to lose. The Altcoin Season Index at 24 clearly signals that the cryptocurrency market is currently in a phase of Bitcoin dominance. While this may mean subdued altcoin performance in the short term, it offers valuable insights into prevailing crypto market trends . For those engaged in cryptocurrency investing , understanding these cycles and adapting strategies accordingly is crucial. Whether you’re rebalancing your portfolio, researching new projects, or simply holding through the current climate, staying informed about key metrics like the Altcoin Season Index empowers you to make more informed decisions in this dynamic digital landscape.

The post, which includes a three-day candlestick chart of XRP, points to a potential breakout from a falling wedge pattern that has been forming since late 2024. Jaydee’s chart is centered around this large wedge, bounded by two descending trendlines that have kept XRP in a consolidating range for months. The token now sits at the top of the wedge, trading at $2.23, and pressing against resistance after gradually moving sideways through May and June. Well-respected analysts have shared bullish expectations for July , and the recent price action, supported by a rising Relative Strength Index (RSI), has raised questions about whether XRP could soon break free of this extended downtrend. $XRP – Remember when I called the 12x all the way to my $3.37 TP level w/exact PRECISION?

(Patreon/Discord – Green Box)… pic.twitter.com/l28K1ZfhWD — JD (@jaydee_757) July 3, 2025 Confirmation Still Pending Jaydee is optimistic about XRP’s trajectory. The analyst stated, “If we can have a full 3-day candle close above for better confirmation… then I expect my next TP levels to hit,” he said. The breakout line on his chart aligns closely with the $2.23–$2.24 range, where the current three-day candle has wicked above the upper resistance line. However, the body of the candle has not yet clearly closed above it. The RSI, currently at 50.66, is also testing a descending trendline that has capped momentum for months. Jaydee also expects a breakout here, indicating that both price and momentum could be aligning for a significant shift. This combination of technical signals adds weight to the possibility of a trend reversal. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Outlook Hinges on Candle Close Jaydee previously called a 12x move in XRP, predicting a price target of $3.37, which, according to him, hit “with exact PRECISION.” His current post implies that another set of take-profit (TP) levels is in place, although they are not specified in the chart. If XRP can secure a candle close above this wedge, those targets are back in play. While Jaydee emphasizes that his TP levels are set and stresses a trading approach without emotional reaction, the chart also acknowledges that confirmation is key. Without a clear close above resistance, this could remain a false breakout or trap, especially in the context of broader market conditions. Patience is crucial in this situation, as the three-day candle must confirm the breakout with a solid close above the wedge. The price and RSI action suggest that XRP may be nearing a pivotal moment, and it’s only a matter of time. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This massive transfer, reported by Cointelegraph, underscored a fascinating truth about Bitcoin’s ecosystem: a significant portion of its circulating supply remains untouched for extended periods. In fact, over 30.4% of all Bitcoin has not moved in more than five years, highlighting a unique aspect of its ownership and market behavior. This remarkable statistic points to a powerful underlying trend: the prevalence of Bitcoin dormant supply . What Does “Bitcoin Dormant Supply” Truly Mean? Understanding Bitcoin dormant supply is crucial for anyone trying to grasp the deeper trends within the digital asset space. Simply put, ‘dormant supply’ refers to Bitcoin that has remained in the same wallet address for a specified period without any outgoing transactions. While the recent $8 billion transfer involved Bitcoin that had been untouched for 14 years, the broader statistic of over 30% pertains to coins that haven’t moved in at least five years. This period is significant because it often indicates a strong conviction from the holder, suggesting they are not interested in short-term trading or profit-taking. On-chain analytics firms meticulously track these movements, segmenting dormant supply into various age bands, such as 1-3 years, 3-5 years, and 5+ years. The longer the dormancy period, the stronger the signal of long-term holding. This phenomenon is particularly noteworthy for Bitcoin due to its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins. When a significant portion of this limited supply is locked away in dormant wallets, it effectively reduces the amount of Bitcoin available for active trading, contributing to its scarcity and potentially influencing its value proposition as a store of value. The Unwavering Conviction of Long-Term Bitcoin Holders The significant portion of Bitcoin that remains unmoved is largely attributed to long-term Bitcoin holders . These individuals and entities embody the ‘HODL’ ethos, a term born from a misspelling of ‘hold’ during a volatile market period, which has since become a mantra for holding onto cryptocurrency regardless of price fluctuations. These holders are not swayed by daily market swings or speculative fervor; their belief is rooted in Bitcoin’s fundamental value as a decentralized, censorship-resistant, and finite digital asset. Who are these steadfast holders? They include early adopters who mined or acquired Bitcoin when it was worth mere pennies, institutional investors who have recently added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, and individual investors who view Bitcoin as a long-term hedge against inflation or a generational wealth transfer mechanism. Their collective decision to hold, often through multiple bear markets and significant price corrections, showcases a profound confidence in Bitcoin’s future potential. This commitment from long-term Bitcoin holders forms a bedrock of stability for the entire crypto ecosystem, contrasting sharply with the often-volatile short-term trading landscape. How Does Dormant Supply Influence Bitcoin Market Dynamics? The existence of such a large Bitcoin dormant supply profoundly impacts Bitcoin market dynamics . When over 30% of the circulating supply is not actively traded, it creates a unique supply-side pressure. In essence, it means that the effective liquid supply available for buying and selling is considerably smaller than the total circulating supply. This reduced liquidity can amplify price movements, as fewer coins are available to absorb large buy orders, potentially leading to more significant upward price action during periods of high demand. Conversely, a sudden decision by a large number of these dormant holders to sell could introduce a substantial amount of supply into the market, potentially leading to downward price pressure. However, the historical trend suggests that these holders are remarkably resilient, often choosing to hold even during significant downturns. Their inactivity acts as a constant removal of supply from the active market, underpinning Bitcoin’s scarcity narrative. This phenomenon is a key factor differentiating Bitcoin’s market behavior from traditional assets, where a much larger percentage of assets are actively traded, making the influence of Bitcoin market dynamics from dormant supply a critical analytical point. Mastering the Crypto HODL Strategy: Benefits and Challenges For many, the observation of this dormant supply validates the crypto HODL strategy . This approach, which involves holding onto cryptocurrency for extended periods regardless of price fluctuations, has proven to be incredibly lucrative for early adopters and those with a long-term vision. But what are the tangible benefits and inherent challenges? Benefits of a HODL Strategy: Compounding Gains: By holding through market cycles, investors can benefit from the long-term appreciation of Bitcoin, allowing their initial investment to grow exponentially. Reduced Stress and Emotional Trading: HODLing removes the temptation to make impulsive trading decisions based on short-term volatility, which often leads to losses. Tax Efficiency: In many jurisdictions, holding assets for longer periods can qualify for more favorable long-term capital gains tax rates. Alignment with Bitcoin’s Vision: It aligns investors with Bitcoin’s core narrative as a long-term store of value, rather than a speculative asset. Challenges of a HODL Strategy: Market Volatility: Enduring significant price drops (e.g., 80% corrections) requires immense psychological fortitude. Opportunity Cost: Funds are tied up, meaning they cannot be used for other investments or short-term gains. Psychological Temptation: The urge to sell during euphoric bull runs or panic during severe bear markets can be overwhelming. Security Risks: Long-term holding necessitates impeccable digital asset security to prevent loss or theft. Examples abound, from individuals who bought Bitcoin for a few dollars and are now millionaires, to companies like MicroStrategy that have adopted Bitcoin as their primary treasury reserve asset, demonstrating a corporate-level crypto HODL strategy . Ensuring Digital Asset Security for Long-Term Holdings The sheer volume of Bitcoin dormant supply also raises critical questions about digital asset security . How have these vast sums of Bitcoin remained safe and untouched for so long? The answer lies in robust security practices, primarily the use of cold storage solutions. Unlike hot wallets, which are connected to the internet, cold storage devices keep private keys offline, making them virtually impervious to online hacks. Key Security Measures for Long-Term Bitcoin Holders: Hardware Wallets: Devices like Ledger or Trezor store private keys offline, requiring physical confirmation for transactions. Multi-Signature Wallets: These require multiple private keys (held by different individuals or in different locations) to authorize a transaction, adding layers of security. Air-Gapped Computers: Using a computer never connected to the internet for generating and storing private keys. Seed Phrase Management: Securely backing up and protecting the recovery seed phrase, often on physically robust materials and in multiple secure locations. Inheritance Planning: Crucial for ensuring that assets can be accessed by beneficiaries in the event of the holder’s incapacitation or death. The recent movement of 14-year-old Bitcoin highlights that even after more than a decade, the security measures employed by these holders proved effective. However, the challenge of maintaining such high levels of digital asset security over extended periods is immense, requiring constant vigilance against evolving threats like sophisticated phishing attempts or even physical theft of storage devices. Beyond the Five-Year Mark: The Future Implications What does this vast Bitcoin dormant supply mean for Bitcoin’s future? If these coins remain dormant, they effectively reduce Bitcoin’s true circulating supply, enhancing its scarcity and reinforcing its narrative as ‘digital gold.’ This continued dormancy could contribute to higher price floors and less volatility in the long run, as fewer coins are available for speculative trading. However, the potential for these coins to eventually move remains a significant factor. While a sudden, massive sell-off could create market shock, it’s more likely that any movement would be gradual or for specific purposes, such as rebalancing portfolios, transferring to institutional custody, or even for philanthropic endeavors. The fact that the recent $8 billion transfer was picked up by exchanges suggests some intent to liquidate, but it represents a tiny fraction of the overall dormant supply. The long-term behavior of these holders will continue to be a fascinating aspect of Bitcoin’s journey, shaping its trajectory and cementing its status as a revolutionary digital asset. The phenomenon of Bitcoin dormant supply is more than just a statistic; it’s a testament to the unwavering belief of long-term Bitcoin holders in its future. It profoundly shapes Bitcoin market dynamics , underscores the power of the crypto HODL strategy , and highlights the critical importance of robust digital asset security . As Bitcoin continues its journey, the silent strength of its long-term holders will remain a foundational pillar, influencing its trajectory and cementing its status as a unique and revolutionary digital asset in the global financial landscape.

At the current levels, Ethereum continues to look incredibly bearish, with sell-offs dominating the market at this level. While piling shorts are pointing to a possible relief rally, there is also the possibility that the price will crash back down from here. Crypto analyst Weslad maps out the ETH price trajectory using the ABCDE wave structure, showing a possible crash below $2,000. The Bullish Ethereum Scenario Weslad points to the 2021 Ethereum peak when the price reached $4,851 as the point when a large-scale symmetrical pennant had formed for the digital asset. Interestingly, this has continued for multiple years already, and continues to play out even in 2025, four years later. So far, the analyst believes that the altcoin has been in a long-term accumulation phase in a defined corrective range. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Not Remotely Close, Bitcoin Dominance Still Too High: Market Expert Says Another important development is the formation of an ABCDE wave pattern. This pattern often predicts peaks and troughs, and depending on where the asset is in the pattern, it could point to a recovery or a crash. Presently, the crypto analyst puts the Ethereum price as being somewhere in a D wave, which is still bullish for the price. “Currently, price action is developing near point D, approaching the upper boundary of the pennant, a crucial area that could define the next directional move,” the analyst said. If this D wave plays out as expected, then the Ethereum price is expected to actually surge from here. The top of this pattern would put it above $3,500 before the move is completed. On the upper end of this is the formation of an Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern. This pattern has seen the $2,855 acting as key resistance, beating the Ethereum price down multiple times this year. However, if a sustained break is achieved above this level, in conjunction with a breakout from Wave D, then it is possible that the price does rally to new all-time highs above $6,000. The Bearish Scenario While the formation of the ABCDE wave count points to some bullishness for the Ethereum price, there is still the possibility that the price could go in the opposite direction. For example, after the D wave is completed, comes the next wave in the sequence, which is the E wave, and this is a bearish wave. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Not Remotely Close, Bitcoin Dominance Still Too High: Market Expert Says As the crypto analyst explains, a temporary rejection at the neckline or pennant resistance would trigger an E wave retracement. In this case, the Ethereum price could see an over 30% crash, putting it back toward the $1,400-$1,800 level, where there is the most support. “Recent price behavior shows compressed volatility and increased buying interest on dips, reinforcing the possibility of an imminent directional breakout,” Weslad warned. “A decisive move outside this macro structure may mark the beginning of a new phase of long-term price expansion.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",Ethereum|ETH|ETH news|eth price|ethereum|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,TRADING|ETH|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-07-05 06:30:30

In the dynamic world of digital assets, few topics spark as much debate and fascination as a company’s decision to integrate Bitcoin (BTC) into its treasury. Once heralded as a visionary move, a recent commentary from Glassnode lead analyst James Check has cast a shadow of doubt over the long-term viability of the Bitcoin treasury strategy . Are we witnessing a pivotal moment where the shine of corporate BTC holdings is beginning to fade for new entrants? This article delves deep into these concerns, exploring the nuances of corporate Bitcoin adoption, the inherent crypto risk, and what it truly takes for a digital asset strategy to be sustainable. The Genesis of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: Why Companies Embraced BTC Holdings For several years, the narrative around companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets was overwhelmingly positive. Pioneers like MicroStrategy led the charge, viewing Bitcoin as a superior alternative to traditional fiat currencies, a hedge against inflation, and a strategic asset signaling innovation and forward-thinking leadership. The allure was multifaceted: Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin’s fixed supply offered a compelling alternative to depreciating fiat currencies. Innovation and Brand Image: Embracing Bitcoin allowed companies to position themselves at the forefront of technological advancement, appealing to a tech-savvy investor base and attracting talent interested in the future of finance. Balance Sheet Optimization: For some, it was a way to potentially generate significant returns on idle cash, outperforming traditional low-yield investments. Market Signal: A strong commitment to Bitcoin could be seen as a vote of confidence in the broader crypto ecosystem, potentially influencing stock prices and market perception. These motivations drove a wave of corporate Bitcoin purchases, transforming the balance sheets of publicly traded companies and setting a new precedent for treasury management in the digital age. However, as with any emerging trend, the initial enthusiasm often gives way to a more critical examination of long-term implications. Questioning Long-Term Viability: Is Your Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Still Relevant? James Check’s recent remarks on X (formerly Twitter) highlight a critical shift in perspective. He suggests that the traditional model of accumulating Bitcoin for corporate treasuries may already be losing its relevance, especially for newer participants looking to replicate past successes. His core argument is profound: ‘long-term accumulation depends more on the strength of a company’s core business and strategy than on symbolic BTC holdings.’ This statement challenges the very foundation of the ‘Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset’ philosophy. Here’s why the viability is being questioned: Diminishing Novelty for New Entrants: The initial shockwave of a company announcing BTC holdings has subsided. Newer firms attempting to mimic this strategy might not achieve the same ‘first-mover’ advantage or market excitement that early adopters did. Volatility as a Double-Edged Sword: While Bitcoin’s price appreciation can be spectacular, its volatility can equally decimate balance sheets. Quarterly earnings reports can be significantly impacted by BTC price swings, introducing an unpredictable element that traditional investors might shy away from. Opportunity Cost: Capital tied up in Bitcoin is capital not invested in core business expansion, research and development, or traditional, less volatile assets. For companies whose primary business isn’t crypto, this can be a significant drain on resources that could otherwise fuel organic growth. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving. Changes in taxation, accounting standards, or outright prohibitions could significantly impact the value and utility of corporate BTC holdings. Focus Shift from Core Business: When a company’s financial performance becomes heavily linked to its Bitcoin holdings, there’s a risk that management’s focus might inadvertently shift from operational excellence to crypto market speculation. This can dilute investor confidence in the company’s primary value proposition. The essence of Check’s argument is that Bitcoin should complement, not define, a company’s financial health. A strong core business provides the stability and revenue streams necessary to weather market fluctuations, making any digital asset holding a strategic enhancement rather than a speculative gamble. Navigating the Peril: Sound Crypto Risk Management for Your BTC Holdings Adding to the concerns, Fakhul Miah, GoMining Institutional Managing Director, previously warned about the dangers of newer firms attempting to replicate the BTC banking model without proper risk controls. His apprehension is well-founded: a collapse due to unchecked crypto exposure could severely damage Bitcoin’s broader reputation, potentially setting back institutional adoption. What exactly constitutes ‘proper risk controls’ in the context of corporate Bitcoin adoption ? It goes far beyond simply buying and holding. It involves a sophisticated understanding of the unique risks associated with digital assets: Market Risk: The Volatility Challenge Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate wildly. A robust risk management strategy must include: Clear Allocation Limits: Defining a maximum percentage of the treasury that can be allocated to Bitcoin to prevent overexposure. Stress Testing: Regularly simulating worst-case scenarios (e.g., a 50% or 80% drop in BTC price) to understand the potential impact on the company’s balance sheet and liquidity. Rebalancing Strategies: Establishing rules for when and how to adjust BTC holdings if they grow too large or fall too low as a percentage of the overall treasury. Operational Risk: Securing Digital Assets Unlike traditional assets, Bitcoin requires specialized custody and security measures: Secure Custody Solutions: Utilizing reputable institutional-grade custodians with robust security protocols (e.g., cold storage, multi-signature wallets, air-gapped systems). Internal Controls: Implementing strict internal policies for access, transaction approvals, and audit trails to prevent fraud or error. Cybersecurity Measures: Protecting digital infrastructure from hacking attempts, phishing, and other cyber threats. Regulatory Risk: The Evolving Landscape The lack of clear, consistent global regulation poses significant challenges: Legal and Compliance Expertise: Engaging legal and compliance professionals specialized in digital assets to navigate evolving laws, tax implications, and reporting requirements. Jurisdictional Awareness: Understanding how regulations in different countries might impact the company’s ability to hold, use, or sell Bitcoin. Reputational Risk: Public Perception A company’s foray into Bitcoin can be viewed positively or negatively. Poor management of BTC holdings, especially during market downturns, can damage investor confidence and brand image. Transparent communication and consistent strategy are key. Without these foundational controls, a company’s attempt to replicate a successful Bitcoin treasury strategy can quickly devolve into a high-stakes gamble, potentially leading to financial distress and undermining the broader acceptance of digital assets in traditional finance. Beyond Symbolic: Crafting a Robust Corporate Bitcoin Strategy for Long-Term Success Given the growing concerns, how can companies approach corporate Bitcoin holdings in a way that is truly sustainable and beneficial? The answer lies in moving beyond symbolic accumulation towards a deeply integrated, risk-aware strategy. 1. Strategic Alignment with Core Business Before acquiring any Bitcoin, a company must clearly articulate how this investment aligns with its core mission, business objectives, and risk appetite. Is it truly a long-term strategic asset, or is it merely speculative? For example, a payment processing company might see Bitcoin as a natural extension of its services, while a manufacturing firm might view it purely as a treasury diversification tool. 2. Comprehensive Due Diligence Treat Bitcoin acquisition with the same rigor as any major capital expenditure or M&A activity. This includes thorough research into market dynamics, regulatory implications, security requirements, and accounting treatments. 3. Robust Treasury Management Framework Develop clear, written policies for Bitcoin holdings, including: Investment Thesis: Why are we holding Bitcoin? Allocation Limits: Maximum percentage of total treasury assets. Custody Solutions: Detailed plan for secure storage. Valuation and Accounting: Clear methodologies for reporting. Exit Strategy: Conditions under which Bitcoin holdings would be reduced or sold. 4. Active Risk Mitigation Implement the crypto risk management controls discussed earlier. This is not a one-time setup but an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring and adaptation to market and regulatory changes. 5. Transparency and Communication Communicate your Bitcoin strategy clearly to investors, employees, and the public. Transparency builds trust and helps manage expectations, especially during periods of market volatility. Explain the rationale, the risks involved, and the long-term vision. 6. Explore Beyond Pure HODL While holding Bitcoin is a common strategy, companies might explore other avenues for digital asset integration, albeit with careful consideration of additional risks: Bitcoin for Payments: Accepting BTC for goods or services can expand customer reach and reduce transaction fees. Yield Strategies (with caution): Some companies explore lending out BTC or participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) for yield, but these come with significantly higher risks (smart contract risk, counterparty risk, impermanent loss). Indirect Exposure: Investing in Bitcoin ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) or companies with significant BTC holdings rather than direct ownership, which can simplify custody and regulatory compliance, though it still carries market risk. The key takeaway here is that a successful Bitcoin treasury strategy is not about blindly following trends but about making informed, strategic decisions that align with a company’s fundamental strengths and long-term vision. The Future Landscape: What’s Next for Corporate Bitcoin and Digital Asset Integration? The conversation around corporate Bitcoin holdings is evolving. We are likely to see a more nuanced approach from companies going forward. Instead of simply accumulating Bitcoin as a ‘symbolic’ gesture, future strategies may focus on: Utility-Driven Adoption: Companies will increasingly integrate Bitcoin and other digital assets where they offer clear operational or financial advantages, such as cross-border payments, supply chain transparency, or tokenized loyalty programs. Diversified Digital Asset Portfolios: Beyond Bitcoin, companies might explore stablecoins for operational liquidity, or other cryptocurrencies that align with specific business use cases (e.g., Ethereum for smart contract-based services). Sophisticated Treasury Management Tools: The development of more advanced software and services for managing digital assets will make it easier for corporate treasuries to handle crypto with the same rigor as traditional assets. Regulatory Clarity: As regulations mature, it will provide a clearer framework for companies to operate within, reducing uncertainty and potentially encouraging broader adoption. The journey of Bitcoin adoption by corporations is still in its early stages. The initial speculative phase is giving way to a more mature, strategic evaluation. This shift is healthy and necessary for the long-term integration of digital assets into the global economy. Conclusion: Navigating the New Frontier of Corporate Finance with Prudence James Check’s insights serve as a crucial reminder that the enthusiasm for digital assets must be tempered with pragmatic financial principles. While Bitcoin offers undeniable potential, its integration into corporate treasuries is not a panacea for all financial challenges. The long-term viability of a Bitcoin treasury strategy hinges not just on the price of BTC, but fundamentally on the robustness of a company’s core business, its strategic foresight, and its commitment to rigorous crypto risk management. For companies contemplating or currently holding Bitcoin, the message is clear: move beyond symbolic gestures. Embrace a comprehensive, disciplined approach that prioritizes financial stability, operational integrity, and a clear understanding of both the opportunities and the inherent risks. Only then can Bitcoin truly become a sustainable and valuable component of a forward-looking corporate treasury.

CertiK reported that this reflects a 52.1% decrease in value lost from the previous quarter. The quarter also saw 59 fewer incidents during this period. Ethereum Hit Hardest Again Phishing was the most damaging attack vector, as it saw $395 million being stolen across 52 incidents. Code vulnerabilities followed suit and recorded $235.8 million in losses across 47 incidents. In its latest report, CertiK said that Ethereum saw the highest number of incidents. The network recorded 70 hacks, scams, and exploits, resulting in $65.4 million in losses for the quarter. Additionally, funds worth $181 million were recovered, which brought the adjusted losses for the second quarter to $620.4 million. The average loss per incident was $4.3 million, while the median was around $104,000. Zooming out, the blockchain security firm also reported total losses of $2.47 billion across 344 incidents for the first half of 2025. Wallet compromises were the costliest during this period, as these breaches accounted for $1.71 billion in losses across 34 incidents. Next up was phishing, with $410.7 million stolen across 132 incidents, which made it the most frequent attack type so far this year. So far this year, Ethereum recorded 175 incidents in H1, resulting in $1.63 billion in losses. A total of $187.3 million was recovered in the first half of the year, pushing the adjusted total losses to $2.29 billion. Meanwhile, the average loss per incident for H1 was $7.13 million, with a median loss of $89,026. Two Major Hacks Skew Trend CertiK noted that while headline figures suggest worsening crypto security, two incidents alone accounted for around $1.78 billion of 2025’s losses – the Bybit hack and the Cetus Protocol breach. Hackers exploited Bybit’s cold wallet infrastructure in February 2025 by altering transaction logic and masking interfaces, which enabled them to steal over $1.5 billion in Ether. North Korea’s notorious state-sponsored hacking entity, the Lazarus Group, was responsible for it. Besides, Sui-based Cetus, on the other hand, suffered an exploit in an overflow check within the project’s liquidity calculation function, which resulted in $225 million in losses in May. Without these two incidents, total losses would be $690 million, which essentially indicates that the broader security trend may not be as severe as the raw figures imply.

Currently trading at $0.4710, the coin has recorded a 2.7% drop overnight and a 14.7% decline in the past 7 days. Its market cap stands at $3.59 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $82.73 million, up 2.87%, suggesting heightened market activity amid sell-offs. The sharp price correction is largely attributed to recent token unlock events, with 270 million Pi tokens released, causing a supply shock. Additionally, over 6 million Pi worth $2.8 million was moved to exchanges within 24 hours, increasing sell-side risk. Both RSI and MACD indicators suggest bearish momentum may persist in the short term. Interestingly, amid this volatility, the Pi mining rate has seen a modest 0.93% increase, rising from 0.0029887 to 0.0030165 Pi per hour, indicating a network still growing in user engagement. But does that signal a path to $1 in 2025? Let us understand the dynamics in this Pi price analysis. Pi Network Price Analysis On the daily chart, Pi Network continues to trade below the middle Bollinger Band and the 20-day SMA. The upper band at $0.6099 and the lower band at $0.4514 form a tight squeeze, typically signaling an incoming volatility spike. However, the price remains pinned near the lower band at $0.4708, suggesting bearish dominance. The RSI stands at 34.94, below the neutral 50 level, indicating the asset is approaching oversold territory but lacks bullish divergence. Despite the increasing 24-hour volume, the price has failed to bounce meaningfully, which is a classic sign of distribution rather than accumulation. In summary, unless a major fundamental catalyst like the Open Mainnet launch or a utility-driven adoption spike emerges, Pi’s outlook remains neutral-to-bearish. A sustained reclaim of $0.53 which is at mid-Bollinger would be the first bullish trigger, followed by a breakout toward $0.61 and then $0.70 before even entertaining the possibility of a $1 breakout.

Turkey Bans PancakeSwap The Turkish financial regulator, CMB, announced that it had taken legal action against PancakeSwap , a high-profile DEX that handled over $325 billion in trading volume in June. The CMB did not specify how it determined PancakeSwap was in breach of Turkish law. PancakeSwap has now become the first decentralized exchange banned in Turkey. The exchange failed to meet the licensing requirement set by CMB. Apart from PancakeSwap, CMB also banned Cryptoradar and Exchange Investr, along with more than 40 other websites. Why did Turkey Ban PancakeSwap? CMB has not yet released a criterion behind the enforcement, and PancakeSwap has not commented on the action. However, this step could be seen as a part of a broader strategy in Turkey, as the regulators are aiming to advance their goal of improving market stability and investor protection. Turkey is enhancing its regulatory framework to protect users from potential financial risks and illicit transactions. Under new regulations, it is tightening its security measures by increasing crypto market transparency through licensing and anti-money laundering (AML) rules. So the decision of the PancakeSwap ban follows the regulatory authority granted to the CMB last year, allowing it to block unlicensed foreign cryptocurrency service platforms targeting Turkish users. [post_titles_links postid=”478736″] Turkey Tightens Crypto Rules in 2025 On 28th June, Turkey published new, stricter rules for crypto in the Official Gazette, to maintain security and transparency in the transactions. Under Law No. 5549, the regulators introduced new transfer limits, mandatory waiting periods, and anti-money laundering (AML) policies in a bold move to tighten CMB oversight over crypto. Besides this, the country implemented a series of new regulations to mitigate risks in the crypto space. Final Thought It is crucial for all crypto service-providing platforms to seek proper approval from official regulators to continue operations in Turkey. This enforcement of banning websites is a precedent for other exchanges and platforms to comply with the Turkish regulatory regime. CMB and PancakeSwap have yet to deliver a comment regarding the enforcement.

The Turkish Capital Markets Board (CMB) banned PancakeSwap for “providing unauthorized crypto services” and failing to meet the licensing requirements it set for virtual asset service providers. The specific details of the breach weren’t elaborated, but it falls under the CMB’s authority to block unlicensed foreign platforms targeting Turkish users. How will the ban affect Turkish users of PancakeSwap and other blocked platforms? The ban restricts direct access for Turkish users to PancakeSwap and the other 45 blocked platforms, pushing them towards licensed, centralized exchanges or potentially into less secure methods like VPNs to bypass restrictions. This could reduce DeFi participation and stifle innovation within Turkey’s crypto community. Can PancakeSwap or other blocked platforms appeal the ban or obtain a license to operate in Turkey? The article doesn’t specify if PancakeSwap can appeal the ban directly. However, for any crypto service provider to operate legally in Turkey, they would need to comply with the CMB’s licensing requirements and new regulations, including AML/CFT and KYC rules.

In a post on the social media platform X, the billionaire says that Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” will increase the US national debt from about $230,000 per American household to $425,000 per American household over the next decade. The ballooning national debt will have severe ramifications, according to Dalio. “Now that the budget bill has passed Congress, we can see what the projections look like for deficits, government debt, and debt service expenses. In brief, the bill is expected to lead to spending of about $7 trillion a year with inflows of about $5 trillion a year, so the debt, which is now about 6x of the money taken in, 100% of GDP, and about $230,000 per American family, will rise over ten years to about 7.5x the money taken in, 130% of GDP and $425,000 per family. That will increase interest and principal payments on the debt from about $10 trillion ($1 trillion in interest, $9 trillion in principal) to about $18 trillion (of which $2 trillion is interest payments), which will lead to either a big squeezing out (and cutting off) of spending and/or unimaginable tax increases, or a lot of printing and devaluing of money and pushing interest rates to unattractively low levels.” Dalio believes the remedy to the looming fiscal crises is to cut spending and raise taxes to lower the annual deficit to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio. “This printing and devaluing is not good for those holding bonds as a storehold of wealth, and what’s bad for bonds and US credit markets is bad for everyone because the US Treasury market is the backbone of all capital markets, which are the backbones of our economic and social conditions. Unless this path is soon rectified to bring the budget deficit from roughly 7% of GDP to about 3% by making adjustments to spending, taxes, and interest rates, big, painful disruptions will likely occur.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

He expressed confidence in Ripple’s unique role as a company actively deploying blockchain to address real-world problems. Ripple’s Long-Term Commitment to Utility Garlinghouse emphasized the importance of long-term commitment in developing blockchain-based financial solutions. Acknowledging that “introducing XRP into those flows will take time,” he described Ripple’s progress as part of a broader effort that is ongoing but already advancing. His tone suggested the company is fully aware of the challenges ahead, yet resolute in its trajectory. He framed Ripple’s position as distinctive, stating, “When I zoom out and look at where Ripple sits in the blockchain and crypto ecosystem, we are incredibly fortunate to be the only company with real customers solving real problems.” WOW! RIPPLE CEO BRAD GARLINGHOUSE: „WHEN I ZOOM OUT AND LOOK OUT WHERE RIPPLE SITS IN THE BLOCKCHAIN & CRYPTO ECOSYSTEM WE ARE INCREDIBLY FORTUNATE TO BE THE ONLY COMPANY WITH REAL CUSTOMERS SOLVING REAL PROBLEMS!“ #XRP WILL SOLVE A MULTI-TRILLION-DOLLAR PROBLEM! pic.twitter.com/cbbuTcPP1T — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) July 3, 2025 This assertion reflects the years Ripple has spent developing partnerships , regulatory engagement strategies, and infrastructure to support the utility of XRP across cross-border payment systems. Execution Over Hype While Ripple’s competitors often focus on speculative use cases or theoretical applications of blockchain, Garlinghouse has made it clear that Ripple has prioritized implementation over experimentation. The company’s customer base, which includes financial institutions and payment providers, gives weight to his argument that Ripple’s products are already being used globally in practical scenarios. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He continued by underlining that the journey is still in its early phases. “We are at the early stages of that marathon,” he said, referencing the broader adoption curve that blockchain technology and digital assets must navigate to reach full-scale integration within the global financial system. Ripple has always prioritized utility and adoption over speculation and short-term price movements, and Garlinghouse added, “There’s no doubt that… we’re the only ones that have crossed that starting line.” Others in the space may be preparing, but Ripple has already begun. Looking Toward the Future Garlinghouse’s comments centered on Ripple’s positioning and the early but tangible results of years of development. The system Ripple works with allows XRP to solve the global payments problem , and his remarks offered a contrast to the more promotional rhetoric common in the industry, grounding Ripple’s vision in advancement and real-world utility rather than hype. For observers of the crypto space, his statement reinforced the idea that utility, backed by partnerships, regulatory engagement, and real-world application, will determine long-term winners in the blockchain sector. As Ripple continues to build, the emphasis remains on execution with XRP and delivering technology that works today.

While Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to hover on meme-fueled legacy alone, a powerful new player under $1 is stealing the spotlight: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is the 5th stage of presale already sold out more than 60%. The present amount of money raised by Mutuum Finance is already more than $11.7 million with more than 12700 holders. Dogecoin may still enjoy its status among the top cryptocurrencies by market cap, but when it comes to innovation and actual utility, Mutuum Finance is leaving DOGE in the dust. Dogecoin Holds Steady as Investors Wait for Next Big Move Currently trading at just under the $0.161 mark, Dogecoin (DOGE) is still trading at a steady range as it continues to soar to new heights based on its status as a meme coin. Albeit the absence of significant changes and news, DOGE has demonstrated its strength by recovering after touching recent bottoms at around $0.14 and gaining small bullish impetus. Dogecoin remains under the watchful eyes of analysts who are predicting that a push towards $0.20 might be on the cards should the general market be bullish this summer. Nevertheless, given that its worth largely depends on social media buzz and community hype, one cannot say how the Dogecoin project will evolve, unlike the projects with greater real-world utility attached. Mutuum Finance is one of these projects that are gaining popularity as far as early investors are concerned. Mutuum Finance Presale Achieves Milestone More than $11.7 million and more than 12,700 investors have been drawn to the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale. This kind of winds is the sign of increasing confidence of investors in short-term success of the project and its long-term vision. MUTM is priced at $0.03, which is the lowest-possible price before a 16% hike in the next presale stage. $50K Bug Bounty as Mutuum Finance Continues Development Momentum Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty with CertiK. It is inclusive in the sense that, it is distributed according to the four variable degrees of severity that are, critical, major, minor and low. It is also the form of communicating the fact that the project is interested in security and transparency. Proven Dual-Lending Formula Transformation of DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed as a hybrid lending platform that will serve the active as well as passive DeFi users. Users can earn passive income by lending their USDT via smart contracts pools which provide stable passive income in the project’s Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending mechanism. In addition, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model permits lenders and borrowers to be as engaged as they could ever be in reciprocating terms of a transaction and do not require a third party to act on their behalf. The paradigm is more prevalent for the clients of less secure assets. Leaderboard and $100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance values its first-time investors and has launched a $100,000 giveaway that will see 10 winners receive $10,000 MUTM. This is to celebrate the investors’ first trust in the project. As Dogecoin (DOGE) holds steady near $0.16 with little more than meme momentum backing its price, serious investors are eyeing more utility-driven opportunities under $1, like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Now in its 5th presale stage and over 60% sold out, Mutuum has already raised over $11.7 million from 12,700+ investors, signaling strong confidence in its innovative DeFi lending model. Backed by a $50K CertiK bug bounty, dual lending protocols, and a growing community, MUTM is quickly becoming the top pick for forward-thinking crypto buyers. Join the Mutuum Finance presale now and secure your position in what could be the best crypto under $1 going into 2025.

Analyst Predicts 80% Drop Soon,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-crash-coming-analyst-predicts-80-drop-soon/,"The post Bitcoin Price Crash Coming? Analyst Predicts 80% Drop Soon appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin may seem bullish right now , but a leading crypto analyst has issued a shocking warning: a crash of over 80% could be just around the corner. While Bitcoin has climbed 3.3% in the last 30 days and currently trades at $108,161, concerns are building beneath the surface. Crypto analyst EDO FARINA XRP , who commands a following of more than 167,000 on X, believes Bitcoin’s rally is dangerously overheated. In a recent post, he predicted that a sudden, sharp correction is not just possible—it’s imminent. And when it hits, he warns, it will be fast and severe. Bitcoin Market Is Overheating According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s recent surge isn’t backed by fundamentals. Since the U.S. political shift in November 2024 , Bitcoin has surged by nearly 60%. In Q2 2025 alone, it delivered a quarterly return of 29.9%, and so far in July, it has grown by nearly 1%. But the economic backdrop tells a different story. Inflation in the U.S. has eased to 2.4%, close to the Federal Reserve’s target. Still, GDP growth is slowing—projected to drop to 1.8% in 2025. The labor market is cooling too, with unemployment rising to 4.1% in June, while consumer spending is expected to weaken. The analyst suggests this kind of economic environment doesn’t support such an aggressive BTC rally. Missed the Bitcoin Boom? EDO FARINA argues that the best time to buy Bitcoin was years ago. In 2020, BTC returned a staggering 304.1%, followed by a solid 59.6% in 2021. Although 2022 saw a major correction with a 64.3% drop, the market bounced back strongly—posting gains of 115.4% in 2023 and 121.1% in 2024. According to the analyst, today’s price level is no longer ideal for those seeking “safe” long-term gains. Bitcoin Whales Are Allegedly Selling Another red flag is the behavior of Bitcoin whales. The analyst claims that large holders, especially those owning Satoshi-era coins, are moving their BTC to exchanges. Each time the price approaches the critical $110,000 level, it faces strong resistance. For instance, on May 22, BTC touched $111,662. But by the next day, the market dropped nearly 4%. On June 10, Bitcoin climbed to $110,266, only to fall by more than 8% over the next 12 days. A similar trend occurred on July 3, when BTC touched $110,681 and dropped by 1.44% the very next day. These repeated sell-offs around the $110K mark suggest that whales are actively cashing out, keeping Bitcoin from breaking out to a new high. [post_titles_links postid=”478664″] The Real Concern: Low Trading Volume According to Farina, what’s even more dangerous than whale selling is the low trading volume in the current market. Compared to previous bull runs, fewer retail investors are buying. The analyst argues that today’s price action is driven by a few large players, not widespread demand. This poses a serious risk. If whales decide to dump their holdings all at once, there may not be enough buying support to hold the price up. This lack of liquidity could trigger a cascade of sell-offs and lead to a massive crash. Could Bitcoin Crash Soon? Farina believes the crash will be triggered by a major, unexpected event—what’s often called a “black swan” in financial markets. Once it happens, the crash will be swift and brutal, catching most investors off-guard. He concludes that Bitcoin’s current high is artificially inflated and not supported by real market activity. Without strong and broad demand, the price could collapse quickly when the pressure hits. While Bitcoin’s price action appears bullish , the warning signs are hard to ignore. Whale movements, resistance at $110K, weak economic fundamentals, and low volume suggest that the rally might not be as healthy as it looks. Whether this ends in a soft pullback or a dramatic crash, investors may want to stay alert.

As of July 5, 2025, Bitcoin is trading around $107,493, down about 2.14% today according to CoinDesk data from July 4, 2025. It snapped a two-day winning streak but is up 0.57% this week and 15.07% year-to-date. How high can Bitcoin’s price go in July 2025? Some predictions for July 2025 suggest Bitcoin could reach a maximum price of $125,000, with an average around $115,000. Historically, July has been a positive month for Bitcoin, showing an average gain of over 9.1% over the past five years. Will Bitcoin hit a new All-Time High (ATH) in the near future? Bitcoin’s all-time high was $111,970 on May 22, 2025. Some analysts believe a decisive break above the $110,000-$112,000 resistance could propel BTC towards a new high of $120,000 or beyond, especially if supported by strong institutional buying. How high can Bitcoin’s price go in 2025? Some analysts project Bitcoin could average around $125,027 in 2025, potentially reaching highs of $168,000 to $175,000.

The price action reflects strong buying interest but also hesitation as bulls struggle to reclaim higher levels. Despite holding above key support, Solana must break decisively above resistance to confirm a bullish breakout and continue its upward trend. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms Rising Wedge Pattern – $2,200 Support Back In Focus? Market momentum has favored bulls in recent weeks, but Solana’s inability to breach the $160 zone raises questions about the strength of this trend. Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared insights highlighting that Solana is currently ranging within a rising channel pattern—a structure that, while seemingly bullish, can often precede a breakdown to lower demand zones if support fails. This makes the coming days especially important for SOL’s trajectory. As macro conditions improve and Bitcoin flirts with new all-time highs, Solana is expected to respond in kind. However, technical signals suggest caution. A break below the rising channel could target the $128.50 support area, while a successful breakout above $160 could open the door to retesting local highs. Traders and investors alike are closely watching Solana’s next move in this high-stakes consolidation phase. Solana Holds Key Support Amid Rising Channel Formation Solana is currently trading below the $150 level, reflecting a notable 20% decline from its local high set in May. Despite this setback, the asset continues to hold a strong support base, signaling that bullish sentiment has not entirely faded. The broader market remains in a consolidation phase, with Solana showing signs of indecision as it moves sideways within a tightening price range. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic, pointing out that a breakout above the key $150–$160 supply zone could spark renewed upside momentum. However, the current price structure suggests that Solana may not be ready yet to retest previous highs. According to Carl Runefelt, Solana is ranging within a rising channel—a pattern that can lead to sharp movements if broken. While rising channels can sustain bullish continuation, a breakdown below the lower trendline often results in accelerated downside moves. Runefelt warns that if Solana breaks below the channel, the next key support area lies around $128.50. This level has historically acted as a strong demand zone and could serve as the next target in the event of a bearish move. In the meantime, Solana’s consolidation reflects broader market uncertainty, with traders waiting for a decisive breakout or breakdown to guide positioning. A successful reclaim of the $150 level would improve sentiment significantly and could set the stage for a push toward the $170–$180 range. On the other hand, failure to hold above current levels may shift the narrative toward further downside risk. Related Reading: Chainlink Consolidates Above Key Support – Bulls Eye $20 Range SOL Holds Range Amid Resistance Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $147.62, moving sideways within a tightening range and forming a potential rising channel pattern. The daily chart reveals that SOL has been unable to break decisively above the $155–$160 resistance zone, while strong support remains near the $140 level. Price action shows repeated rejections near the 100-day moving average (blue line), which now acts as dynamic resistance around $155.60. The 200-day moving average (red) sits further above $165.54, marking a long-term resistance area. Volume remains relatively low compared to early June spikes, suggesting market participants are waiting for a clear breakout direction. A push above $160 would likely trigger bullish momentum, potentially opening the door toward the $170 level. However, the rising channel identified by analysts suggests a possible downside risk if the lower trendline fails. Related Reading: Litecoin Surges Past Descending Resistance – Bulls Target $97.10 Level If Solana breaks below the $145 support and falls out of the channel, the next target would be the $128.50 area, which previously acted as a demand zone in mid-May. Until then, bulls must defend current levels and aim to reclaim the 100-day SMA to maintain the broader recovery structure. The coming sessions may offer clarity as consolidation nears its resolution.

(05th July, 2025)",https://coinpedia.org/news/why-crypto-market-is-down-today-05th-july-2025/,"The post Why Crypto Market is Down Today? (05th July, 2025) appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market today has experienced a broad-based downturn today, with the total industry market capitalization slipping to $3.33 trillion. Trading volume also shrank considerably by 16.50%, now standing at $93 billion, signaling cautious attitude from investors. Bitcoin remains the dominant force with a 64.6% market share, followed distantly by Ethereum at 9.1%. A combination of macro events and sudden whale activity has injected fresh volatility into the digital asset space. The Fear & Greed Index rests at a neutral 51, reflecting indecision among market participants. A significant development casting a shadow over today’s action is the $3.6 billion crypto options expiry. Of that total, Bitcoin accounts for $2.98 billion and Ethereum $610 million. The unwinding of these contracts has led to volatility and uncertain short-term moves, as traders reassess risk amid high open interest. Whale Activity and Option Expiry Unnerve Investors? Bitcoin’s price has slipped by 0.68% over the last 24 hours, currently hovering around $108,294.97. While the dip may seem modest, the root cause is raising alarm bells. As a dormant wallet containing 80,009 BTC, which was inactive for over 14 years, has suddenly moved approximately $8.7 billion worth of tokens. Such activity typically highlights security concerns and fears of large-scale dumping, which often prompts a wave of defensive selling. This movement coincided with today’s massive options expiry event, further intensifying downward pressure. Also read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Ethereum is not immune either. The second-largest crypto has declined 1.2%, now trading at $2,527.90. This pullback is largely linked to short-term profit-taking following a strong 4.09% weekly performance. Moreover, ETH faced stiff resistance near $2,600, which drove liquidations of over-leveraged long positions. Liquidation Shakeout Hits Market Liquidation events have further strained investor sentiment. Bitcoin’s leveraged long positions took a hit amid the dormant wallet scare, triggering cascading liquidations. The overall 24-hour trading volume for BTC has fallen by 14.9%, now at $42.47 billion. Ethereum’s fall is a case of technical rejection. The failed attempt to break above $2,600 led to profit booking and liquidation of weak hands. The combined pressure from options expiry and short-term resistance zones added fuel to the correction. XRP, meanwhile, is down 0.25% to $2.22 after failing to maintain its breakout above the $2.27–$2.30 range. The market also seemed underwhelmed by Ripple’s recent announcement about securing a banking license, which failed to generate strong bullish momentum.

A recent whale moved $57 million worth of XRP, sparking talk of a potential sell-off, though markets quickly shrugged off those worries. Forecasts for XRP price vary, with projections as high as $2.65 by year-end, driven by renewed optimism around Ripple’s banking licenses and growth in on-chain settlements . A popular analyst on X (formerly Twitter), called Clyde has opined that he expects XRP to make a new all-time-high in July or august. By his projection, the first major target is $4.50, with the next target being $6.30 as XRP could lead altseason.

The request, submitted Wednesday in Delaware, is aimed at avoiding potential legal penalties from violating cross-border digital asset laws. “Distributions made by or on behalf of the FTX Recovery Trust into jurisdictions in violation of these legal restrictions may trigger fines and penalties, including personal liability for directors and officers, and/or criminal penalties up to and including imprisonment,” the estate warned. China and Russia Among Targeted Jurisdictions FTX’s creditor base spans the globe, but the estate has cited nations with prohibitive or undefined crypto laws as high risk. These include China, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Ukraine, among others. The estate said, for example, that institutions in Macau are barred by mainland authorities from engaging in virtual currency services. The estate emphasized that all 49 identified jurisdictions are affected by similarly stringent regulations. Distributions on Hold, Not Cancelled While not rejecting payouts altogether, the estate clarified that it is placing distributions on hold pending legal clarity. This delay includes the majority of claims originating from China, which represent 82% of the affected value. Though China has banned crypto transactions, it hasn’t fully prohibited the possession of digital assets, creating ambiguity. Meanwhile, nearby Hong Kong has taken a supportive stance toward crypto, recently endorsing investment products like ETFs and derivatives. FTX’s legal team is pushing for a clear framework: “The FTX Recovery Trust has developed the restricted jurisdiction procedures to provide notice and a process for resolving the question of whether distributions will be made pursuant to the plan.” The motion seeks court approval to proceed cautiously, allowing some distributions to resume once jurisdictional clarity is achieved. Legal experts have voiced understanding of the strategy. “It doesn’t surprise me that the FTX estate might not make distributions in countries where such distributions might be illegal,” said Aaron Brogan, managing attorney at Brogan Law.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ASIA,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-07-05 08:38:39

The post highlights that Ripple is now operating with many of the features of a bank—specifically a neo-bank—without holding a traditional banking license. The statement underscores Ripple’s global reach, now extending to over 55 countries, with real-time payment infrastructure and stablecoin functionality already active. According to X Finance Bull, the agility demonstrated by Ripple stands in contrast to the slower adaptability of traditional financial institutions. The tweet ends with a pointed rhetorical question directed at XRP holders: “Is your $XRP bag ready for what’s coming?” An attached infographic further supports this claim, showing Ripple listed on The Financial Brand’s Neobank Tracker as a recognized digital neo-bank. The listing is based on the financial services Ripple provides, such as digital payments, liquidity provision, and stablecoin infrastructure, rather than any banking charter. As explained in the graphic, this designation is tied to service capabilities rather than formal licensing. Ripple is moving like a bank without a banking license. Neo-bank status. 55+ countries. Real-time rails and stablecoin flow ready. The old guard can’t move this fast. Is your $XRP bag ready for what’s coming? pic.twitter.com/S9aDPZmvJA — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) July 3, 2025 Ripple’s Financial Services Model The digital banking services offered by Ripple are centered around its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product and the RippleNet network, which facilitate efficient cross-border transactions. Ripple’s infrastructure also supports RLUSD, its recently launched U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin designed for on-chain settlement. These tools enable financial institutions to manage global payments with improved speed and reduced friction. The scope of Ripple’s presence—spanning over 55 countries—emphasizes its ambition to serve as a borderless settlement layer. In a follow-up exchange, an X user named SJ commented on the same post, stating , “The fact Ripple is already a NEO Bank. Just laugh now XRP family. Good times are here already. Ripple was already way ahead of everyone else.” In response, X Finance Bull reiterated the sentiment by affirming , “Facts. Ripple didn’t wait for permission, it just built what the system couldn’t. $XRP fam always saw it coming.” The dialogue reflects a growing confidence among Ripple’s ecosystem supporters regarding its operational capabilities and strategic direction. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory Positioning and International Reach The attached material also details Ripple’s regulatory standing, noting that it holds money transmitter licenses in several U.S. states. Additionally, it is actively building regulatory credentials across Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. There is speculation that Ripple may eventually seek full national bank status, though no formal announcement to that effect has been made. These developments align with the company’s broader ambition to provide compliant, scalable solutions that mirror or exceed traditional banking functions without assuming the legal responsibilities of a chartered bank. Innovation, Inclusion, and Scalability The infographic outlines several key areas in which Ripple is impacting the financial landscape. Ripple is described as using blockchain technology to deliver secure, real-time services that differ from legacy systems. It is also credited with expanding financial inclusion by making cross-border payments more accessible to underserved markets. The platform’s scalability is highlighted as another advantage, with its infrastructure supporting extensive operations while maintaining efficiency. X Finance Bull’s post and the accompanying graphic portray Ripple as an entity that has grown beyond its role as a blockchain payments company into a full-featured digital financial services provider. The combination of regulatory credentials, global reach, and service offerings that include real-time settlements and stablecoin flows positions Ripple in a category with established neo-banks. By offering services traditionally associated with banks, without seeking a charter, Ripple’s model may represent a blueprint for future blockchain-based financial platforms. As conversations around XRP’s utility and Ripple’s evolution continue, the focus is likely to remain on how effectively the firm can bridge legacy systems with blockchain infrastructure.

The index value is only 24 out of 100. This value shows that Bitcoin’s performance in the last 90 days has been better than most altcoins. The annual peak was recorded as “Altcoin Season” on December 4, 2024, at 87; however, on April 26, 2025, this value fell to the annual low of 12. Despite this, some altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin in the last 3 months.

Crypto has never been more in the cultural zeitgeist than it is in 2025. Ever since Donald Trump took the Whitehouse, Wall Street has been just as concerned with the price of Bitcoin ( BTC ) as it has been with Tesla, Nvidia, or the S&P 500. You might also like: Stablecoins: The gateway to mainstream crypto in 2025 | Opinion The free world has never been able to separate fringe technology from the mainstream—it eventually becomes the same, and we are now seeing this happen with crypto, and spearheading the transition is the humble stablecoin, a part of crypto that was once a shadowy effigy; is now out in the open for all to see. Stablecoins, thanks to being pegged against fiat currencies, can take on all the roles of traditional currency. From commercial bank integration to remittance payments, stablecoins have never been ‘cool’ in the memecoin or BTC sense; instead, it’s the one part of crypto that actively puts its head above the decentralised water and runs in tandem with pre-existing financial systems. In 2024, global stablecoin transactions passed $27.6tn and the stablecoin market capitalisation in 2025 sits at $238bn currently—and its adoption during this time has largely gone unnoticed. The demand for stablecoins has gone supersonic, thanks firstly to the world’s largest private banks. In 2019, JP Morgan developed the internally used JPM Coin to facilitate cross-institutional transactions. With the rapid growth of interbank transactions, which make up $1bn in stablecoin transactions daily, governments have had no choice but to regulate. Europe The European Union was the first governing body to blink first across the Atlantic. The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) came into full force at the end of 2024 and offers a streamlined approach to regulation, prioritising consumer protection and anti-money laundering. The pro-consumer stablecoin landscape in the EU has allowed crypto to infiltrate everyday citizens’ lives like a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Trust and the implementation of robust, clear user guidance have been critical in the implementation of MiCA by the European Banking Authority . As a result, the stability created in the market led to an increase in EURC stablecoin transactions, from $7m to $21m between December and January 2025. There is a clear need, facilitated through banking institutions, for everyday consumers for stablecoins, especially in Europe, as cross-border transactions and remittance continue to become disproportionately more important in a world getting more comfortable with mass migration and open borders. The United States In the U.S., stablecoins have had a more nuanced path to infiltrating everyday use cases. JP Morgan may have been one of the first movers when it came to cross-institutional payments, but the U.S. opened the floodgates early, and under Gary Gensler, crypto was a hostage to archaic hang-ups and tin foil hat-inspired rhetoric, with Gensler claiming crypto was “unlikely [to] be a currency”, thanks to the fact that “the leading lights of this field are either in jail or awaiting extradition”. Crypto was never going to show its best side pre-regulation, and since Donald Trump took the White House in 2025, crypto regulation in the US is evolving at a rate not seen before; cue the GENIUS act. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, for the first time, gives both issuers and users of stablecoins clarity on their lawfulness within society and how they can be used. With this, the CFTC has also been announced as the primary regulator of digital commodities and payment stablecoins, further legitimising its position as part of the traditional finance furniture in the U.S. While the industry is still in its infancy compared to the EU, the impact that robust regulation will have for the rest of the world will be disproportionately more important. If the world salutes the Euro, then it bows to the dollar, and stablecoins will add yet another arrow to the dollar’s ever-growing quiver. Now that the stage is set and the world’s largest players have clarity, stablecoin adoption at both the institutional and consumer level is set to go supernova. Leading UK bank Standard Chartered has estimated the GENIUS act will “cause total stablecoin supply to rise from $230bn to $2tn by end-2028”. One of the largest infiltrations into traditional finance to date is the transfer of U.S. treasuries to stablecoin issuers, with $1.2tn in U.S. debt set to be bought by Tether, Circle, and other dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies by 2030. Once reserved for institutional stalwarts like Berkshire Hathaway, crypto is pulling up a seat at the TradFi table and is set to have a larger piece of the treasury pie than China, Japan & the UK in just five years. With the GENIUS Act and MiCA in full swing, and institutional driving stablecoin transactions, it will not be long before a lot of the FIAT capital flow globally will be represented by stablecoins. The Vice President of blockchain and digital assets at Mastercard, Raj Dhamodharan, recently highlighted that “most people won’t even know they’re using stablecoins” as the digital infrastructure required for crypto adoption is already in place. The physical money that backs up the number on our banking app will soon be pegged to a digital dollar or euro without most of the world ever knowing. It may sound strange, but if anything, banking is simply catching up with consumer demands—and although this revolution will be silent, its impact over the coming years will speak volumes.

Now, experts are wondering: Was this a planned move, or could it be the biggest crypto hack ever? Let’s break it down! Old Satoshi-Era Coins Come Alive On July 4, 2025, blockchain watchers were shocked to see 80,000 BTC transferred from eight wallets that had been inactive since 2011. Two of them, each containing 20,000 BTC, were originally funded when Bitcoin was worth just $0.78 per coin. Meanwhile, today, each wallet now holds over $1.1 billion worth of BTC. Interestingly, the coins haven’t been moved since reaching these new wallets, and no individual or company has claimed ownership. However, the sudden movement has raised immediate questions. Who’s Behind the Transfer? The on-chain analysis firm Arkham said all eight wallets seem to belong to one single entity. The BTC was sent to fresh wallets using newer, cheaper address formats. Most of the coins didn’t go to exchanges, they just moved to new addresses. And this has raised concerns. Now, the big question has arisen: Was this transfer legitimate, or was it a hack? Coinbase Head Hints at Possible Hack That’s what Conor Grogan, head of product at Coinbase, is wondering. In an X post, Grogan floated the idea that this could be the largest crypto heist in history if those wallets were compromised. He pointed to one suspicious clue: a small Bitcoin Cash (BCH) transaction made from one of the whale wallets about 14 hours before the main BTC transfer. According to Grogan, this may have been a way to secretly test whether the wallet’s private keys still worked. While, Grogan made it clear that this is just speculation, not proof. But he added, “If this really was a hack,” Grogan said, “it could be the biggest theft in history.",News,EN,0,0,BCH|EXCHANGE|ARKM|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-05 08:44:11

According to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the two men will serve a combined 12 years in prison for their part in the criminal scheme. According to the report , the perpetrators, 35-year-old Ramondip Bedi and 40-year-old Patrick Mavanga cold-called their victims between February 2017 and June 2019, luring them to fake websites under their control. These websites promised their victims promises on lucrative returns on their crypto investments. The police reported that the pair were able to scam about 65 investors out of £1,541,799 (approximately $2,104,555). The criminals were said to operate their investment platforms through several companies, including CCX Capital and Astaria Group LLP. United Kingdom court sentenced the men for 12 years According to the FCA, both men had pleaded guilty to fraud charges in 2023, but the final criminal proceedings just wrapped up with their sentencing. According to reports, Judge Griffiths, presiding over the case at the Southwark Crown Court, sentenced Bedi to 5 years and 4 months in prison, while Mavanga was sentenced to 6 years and 6 months of prison time. The authorities are still carrying out confiscation proceedings to recover more funds from their criminal gains. According to reports from the FCA, Bedi was charged with conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to breach the general prohibition, and the possession and conversion of criminal property. On the other hand, Mavanga was charged with conspiracy to commit fraud, breach of general prohibition, possession of false identification documents with an improper intent, and perverting the course of justice. Their prison terms are expected to run consecutively. In his sentencing, Judge Griffiths said, “Bedi and Mavanga were both leading players in a conspiracy whereby the victims of the fraud were persuaded to invest in cryptocurrency consultancy and conspired to drive a coach and horses through the regulatory system.” Reports also claimed that while both men had already pleaded guilty in 2023, Mavanga was slammed with an additional offense last year. United Kingdom authorities claimed that he specifically deleted phone call recordings with Bedi where the pair discussed the crypto scams. The joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight, Steve Smart also waded in, noting that Bedi and Mavanga ruthlessly carried out their fraudulent activities, defrauding dozens of innocent victims whose motive was to look for an investment platform to help them increase their returns. He added that it is right that they received these prison sentences, as it will serve as a deterrent to other criminals still committing these crimes. He also added that they will not stop going after elements like these in the United Kingdom, vowing to make them pay for their crimes. FCA has reiterated its resolve to continue to go after criminals in the United Kingdom. These include crimes like phishing , social engineering attacks like rug pulls and sextortion, pig butchering scams, and other versions of Ponzi schemes that have grown rampant in the United Kingdom. In the last month, the agency has wrapped up cases against 11 other scammers, with several of the affected parties entering guilty pleas. The authority has also been trying to spearhead crypto policy reforms in the United Kingdom, but its track record of overzealous persecution has remained the only aspect negatively impacting its reputation in the industry.

This assertion was made during Schwartz’s deposition filed in 2023, as part of the ongoing legal proceedings brought by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission against Ripple Labs. The deposition transcript, shared online by the X account XrpHodL, includes Schwartz’s comments on how Ripple’s management of XRP compares to the distribution of Bitcoin. He pointed to Ripple’s operational control of XRP as a competitive advantage in building a payments ecosystem. On the topic of Bitcoin’s distribution, he acknowledged it is much harder to track due to its decentralized nature. Nonetheless, he stated: “Satoshi, the original Bitcoin creator, probably held an enormous amount of XRP at the time.” When asked what time, he said “2017”. Schwartz noted that Ripple deliberately focused on building infrastructure and utility around XRP as part of its payment solutions, while no comparable development efforts were undertaken for Bitcoin. According to him, the company’s ability to influence XRP’s ecosystem distinguished it from Bitcoin, whose distribution and control remain opaque. His deposition emphasized that Ripple’s direct role in XRP’s adoption set it apart from Bitcoin’s purely decentralized approach.

Although Schwartz has never claimed to be Nakamoto, various coincidences in the history of cryptocurrency development have fueled rumors. Observers have previously noted that the timeline of XRP Ledger’s development and Satoshi Nakamoto’s withdrawal from Bitcoin appear to align. Nakamoto announced his intent to “move on to other things” in 2011, which is also the year Schwartz began to publicly express interest in working on new projects. Further adding to this speculation is the fact that Schwartz, alongside Arthur Britto and Jed McCaleb, initiated development of the XRP Ledger shortly thereafter, which culminated in its 2012 launch. Ripple adopted the XRP Ledger as the foundation of its blockchain-based payment platform. No Evidence Confirms Schwartz as Satoshi Nakamoto Despite these observations and Schwartz’s comment on Satoshi’s supposed XRP holdings, there is no evidence confirming that Schwartz is the individual behind the Nakamoto pseudonym. His statement during the deposition has nonetheless added to the ongoing curiosity about the identity of Bitcoin’s creator and their potential involvement in other blockchain projects. While Schwartz’s remarks offer insight into how Ripple viewed its role in XRP’s development relative to Bitcoin’s trajectory, they remain speculative regarding Nakamoto’s holdings or identity.

47523237,https://thecoinrise.com/brazil-central-bank-connector-hacked-140-million-stolen/,1751705792,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/47523237.jpeg,"Brazil Central Bank Connector Hacked, $140 Million Stolen",https://thecoinrise.com/brazil-central-bank-connector-hacked-140-million-stolen/,"C&M Software, the service provider linking Brazil Central Bank to local banks and financial institutions, suffered a significant security breach on Wednesday. The hack led to the theft of 800 million Brazilian reais (around $140 million) from six financial institutions connected to the central bank, in what is emerging as one of the country’s largest recent financial cyber incidents. According to Brazilian outlet São Paulo, the breach reportedly occurred after a C&M employee sold their login credentials for around $2,700, providing the attackers with access to critical software systems. The stolen funds were taken from reserve accounts within the system and swiftly moved out, causing alarm among stakeholders and regulators monitoring financial infrastructure in Brazil. Crypto Laundering Through LATAM Exchanges Onchain investigator ZachXBT reported that between $30 million and $40 million of the stolen funds were converted into Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Tether (USDT). The attackers laundered these assets through various Latin American crypto exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) desks, making fund recovery and tracing efforts significantly harder for authorities. This incident underlines the vulnerabilities that centralized software systems face, particularly those managing financial flows at a national level. Centralized systems carry single points of failure that can result in significant data theft or financial loss if exploited, and the problem is only growing as hackers refine their techniques with the help of artificial intelligence tools and dark web marketplaces. Calls for Privacy Tools and Decentralization Grow Cybersecurity experts note a sharp rise in attacks on centralized crypto exchanges in late 2024, according to Chainalysis, as hackers increasingly target platforms with large asset pools and consolidated control points. Eran Barak, CEO of Shielded Technologies, emphasized the need for privacy-preserving tools to guard against advanced AI-assisted hacking attempts. Barak argued that decentralized systems, particularly those leveraging zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), can reduce hackers’ incentives by requiring them to attack individual wallets rather than centralized vaults holding millions of credentials or billions in capital. “Their return on investment would be one record instead of millions, making these attacks far less attractive,” Barak explained. As the investigation unfolds in Brazil, this incident reinforces the urgent need for stronger cybersecurity and privacy infrastructure in the global financial sector, particularly as attackers expand their focus on centralized systems that remain high-value targets for financial crime .

The project offers scalable DApps at low fees and high speeds. Additionally, it offers full Ethereum (ETH) compatibility. Despite recent upgrades, POL has struggled to find growth in July 2025. One of the reasons for this is that the entire crypto market is going through a period of consolidation. Additionally, Polygon (POL) continues to face stiff competition from the rest of the market. Amid this challenging environment, analysts have pointed out that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new entrant in the DeFi sector, could overtake POL when it comes to actual gains. Following this advice, investors have been pouring capital into the project and are looking forward to making massive returns. Let us examine why the MUTM tokens could be your best crypto buy of 2025. Roaring presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of the presale, where tokens are going for $0.03, which is a 200% increase from the $0.01 listing price. So far, the presale has raised over $11.7 million from around 12,700 unique buyers. The optimism around the MUTM tokens has seen 60% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 sell out barely a month after they launched. One of the main drivers of this fast pace in phase 5 is the 50% discount available to buyers. In phase 6, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035, which will wipe out this massive discount. If you act fast enough, there is still a chance to benefit from it. According to the latest projections, the price of MUTM tokens could go up by 4300% when they go live. For ordinary buyers, that means a $1600 purchase in the presale today could grow to over $68,000. Since there is no limit on how much you can invest, this massive return could be even bigger depending on how much you place in the current presale. The main catalysts One of the reasons why analysts are so optimistic about the future of MUTM tokens is the upcoming crypto rally. As with all past rallies, prices in the cryptocurrency market tend to rise in waves. For instance, recent forecasts project that Bitcoin (BTC) could climb to $200k in the upcoming rally. While that might be impressive for an institutional investor who invests $1 million, for a retail buyer who places $1,000 into BTC, that would only translate into around $2,000. The best way to capitalize on the upcoming rally is to invest in a promising presale project like MUTM, where returns could be 43x or higher. Another reason for the optimism around MUTM tokens is the buyback and distribution program. The Mutuum Finance team plans to purchase MUTM tokens off the open market and distribute them to stakers in the safety module. These purchases will help to sustain growth for MUTM tokens, which will attract new buyers. It will also attract new users to the protocol, which will increase the protocol revenue available for buybacks. Consequently, it will create a self-sustaining loop of upward movement. Mutuum Finance is also CertiK-audited, which has helped to boost trust in the ongoing presale. The project has received a Token Scan Score of 95 from CertiK, which signals that this is a trustworthy investment. In the crypto market, trust is at a premium, and Mutuum Finance has the certification to back it. CertiK partnership Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has partnered with CertiK on a $50,000 giveaway, where they will offer rewards to security experts for helping to secure the ecosystem. In this program, security experts will be given rewards via a four-tier system when they present accurate bug reports to them. The tiers are critical, major, minor, and low. Security experts will be rewarded based on the level of the vulnerability they help to identify. That will motivate them to hunt for the most pressing bugs that could affect the long-term functionality of the ecosystem. Over 60% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 have been sold out, and at the current pace, they will all be sold out by the end of July. The price of MUTM tokens will increase significantly in phase 6, which means this is the time to get your tokens before the price goes up by double digits.

This week’s most notable news is that Costa Rica moves forward with its plans to regulate crypto activities in the country as the sector rapidly expands. Panama, on the other hand, is introducing blockchain technology into rice production, becoming a regional leader in agricultural innovation. Costa Rica advances toward cryptocurrency regulation Costa Rica’s Legislative Assembly has submitted a ground-breaking law to regulate Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), which includes cryptocurrency exchanges. This legislation seeks to strengthen the General Superintendency of Financial Institutions (Sugef) capabilities by establishing a more robust framework for overseeing and controlling cryptocurrency transactions. If passed, the bill would require exchanges to develop client identification systems and rigorous Know Your Customer (KYC) processes. One of the bill’s core sections requires exchanges to gather and store detailed client and transaction data, particularly for politically exposed individuals and users in high-risk countries. The project aims to combat money laundering and terrorism financing by ensuring compliance with international financial security requirements. Sugef would also maintain a public list of authorised exchanges, guaranteeing that only compliant actors can operate legally. Blockchain boosts rice farming in Panama Panama has become a regional leader in agricultural innovation after incorporating blockchain technology into rice cultivation. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and Panama’s Ministry of Agricultural Development (MIDA) are leading the project, which includes 106 local rice farmers who utilise blockchain to track crops, access real-time data, and make educated decisions that increase profitability. Farmers’ incomes have increased by an average of 98% thanks to satellite tools and over 60,000 technical reports, while environmental impact has been reduced through climate-smart practices such as the NAMA mitigation framework. This approach demonstrates how blockchain might promote sustainable agriculture and revolutionise business paradigms in Latin America. Young Argentines drive crypto adoption in Buenos Aires A recent Emergente Analytics analysis found that 7 out of 10 Bitcoin users under 30 in Buenos Aires are students , demonstrating early acceptance among young individuals in training. The poll, which was performed in September 2024 with 120 participants from Buenos Aires and its surrounding metropolitan region, also revealed that 80% of existing users identify as male, indicating a major gender disparity in the ecosystem’s early growth. Interestingly, nearly 70% of women surveyed who are not yet crypto users showed a desire to begin using cryptocurrencies soon, indicating a potential shift in gender composition. Social media emerged as the primary source of information, with perceived security, platform repute, and usability outweighing profitability and customer service when selecting a platform.

The total cryptocurrency market capitalisation, which had fallen to a weekly low of $3.36 trillion, rebounded to $3.48 trillion later in the week, driven by bullish developments out of the US. This late-week optimism pushed market sentiment higher, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index rising to 73, firmly within the Greed zone. Altcoins followed a similar upswing late in the week, but much of those gains were wiped out by Friday as Bitcoin once again failed to hold above $110,000, marking its third rejection at that level this month. Weekly momentum was largely driven by meme coins, which dominated the top 100 rankings during late Asian trading hours on July 4, capturing the spotlight with outsized gains amid broader market volatility. Why did Bitcoin go up? After some early‑week volatility, Bitcoin surged to a weekly high of $110,386 on Thursday, ignited primarily by the announcement of a landmark US–Vietnam trade agreement. Under the deal, Vietnam agreed to slash tariffs on US goods, with US tariffs dropping from previous levels of 46% to just 20%, with zero duties on imports entering Vietnam, significantly easing trade tensions and bolstering risk appetite across global markets. This diplomatic win, combined with a cooling of US export restrictions on semiconductors to China, propelled a meaningful risk-on shift, lifting equities and derivatives markets and cascading positive sentiment into crypto. Further, June’s non-farm payrolls data exceeded expectations with 147,000 jobs added, well above the projected 110,000, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. Bitcoin extended its rally as traders priced in stronger consumer demand and near-term resilience, with flows into spot ETFs accelerating alongside a broader surge in risk markets. However, the fervor was short‑lived. As markets reassessed the data through the lens of Federal Reserve policy, traders scaled back expectations for a July rate cut, FedFunds futures showed a sharp rise in odds for no easing until at least September. That recalibration triggered a swift pullback, with Bitcoin dipping just under $109,000 as liquidity quickly shifted from crypto back to safer havens. What’s next for Bitcoin? Bitcoin bulls were thwarted in an attempt to regain support at $110,000 on Thursday as US employment data exceeded expectations, dealing a blow to hopes of interest-rate cuts before September. This is the third failed attempt since the May all-time high, casting doubt on Bitcoin’s ability to breach $110,000 and enter price discovery again. Historically, multiple rejections near all-time highs have preceded sharp drops in BTC price. For example, Bitcoin price was rejected multiple times from the $107,000 level in January, just 2% below the previous all-time high of $109,000 reached on Jan 20. This preceded a 14% price drop over the two weeks that followed. If history repeats, some analysts are worried the BTC/USD pair might drop 14%-18% from current price levels. Additionally, high-taker sell volume around $110,000 and neutral funding rates in futures markets point to profit-taking and hesitation among traders, increasing the likelihood of a pullback. Such trends are common when prices hover near all-time highs, often prompting long-term holders to realise profits and exit positions. Looking at the 24-hour liquidation heatmap for the Bitcoin BTC/USDT trading pair, it’s clear that there’s strong resistance around the $110,000 to $112,000 mark. These areas have consistently rejected upward momentum, confirming that sellers are dominating at higher levels and limiting Bitcoin’s ability to enter price discovery. Binance BTC/USDT Liquidation Heatmap. Source: Coinglass. On the downside, support appears to be forming near the $106,000 and $104,000 levels, with visible absorption and liquidations indicating renewed buyer interest. If current selling pressure intensifies, a breakdown below these thresholds could open the door for a deeper correction toward $103,000, where the next liquidation cluster lies. For now, Bitcoin could be moving rangebound between $103,000 and $110,000, unless market sentiment tilts decisively in either direction. One potential trigger for short-term volatility could be selling pressure from “Satoshi era” Bitcoin holders. Over the past week, a number of dormant whales re-emerged, most notably a coordinated move from eight wallets that had been inactive for over 14 years, collectively transferring out 80,009 BTC, worth an estimated $8.69 billion at the time of movement. Crypto Rover @rovercrc · Follow UPDATE:ALL 8 WALLETS WOKE UP AFTER 14 YEARS OF DORMANCY AND TRANSFERRED OUT 80,009 $BTC WORTH $8.69B. 8:52 PM · Jul 4, 2025 986 Reply Copy link Read 197 replies While the destination wallets remain unknown, such large-scale movements from early holders often signal internal rebalancing, custodial shifts, or potential liquidation, factors that tend to unsettle near-term market confidence when Bitcoin is already struggling to sustain new highs. Nevertheless, some analysts believe bullish developments in the US could reinforce momentum for Bitcoin and see it hitting new highs in the coming days. Much of that optimism centres on the potential impact of President Donald Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” a massive spending package expected to inject trillions into the US economy. The bill, which is reportedly being finalised around Independence Day, has already sparked renewed interest in risk assets, including Bitcoin. Historical precedents suggest this optimism may not be misplaced. When Trump signed a major COVID-19 relief bill in late 2020, Bitcoin jumped by 38% over the following weeks. If a similar reaction plays out again, a comparable rally would push BTC/USD well past $150,000. Crypto Rover @rovercrc · Follow THE LAST TIME TRUMP INTRODUCED A MASSIVE SPENDING BILL.BITCOIN PUMPED 38% IN JUST ONE WEEK.HE IS EXPECTED TO SIGN THE BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL INTO LAW TOMORROW.👀 1:32 PM · Jul 4, 2025 830 Reply Copy link Read 129 replies Markets are also factoring in the implications of mounting U.S. debt. Forecasts suggest the national debt could hit $40 trillion in 2025, nearly double the $23.2 trillion recorded at the start of 2020. From a macroeconomic standpoint, such aggressive borrowing has traditionally acted as a tailwind for Bitcoin, which thrives in environments of fiat dilution and fiscal expansion. If the “Big Beautiful Bill” becomes law, the flood of liquidity it unleashes may offset near-term resistance and profit-taking, setting the stage for Bitcoin to break out of its current range and resume its long-term uptrend. When writing, Bitcoin was hovering over $107,500, up just 0.3% over the past 7 days. Top Altcoin this week The total market cap of all altcoins rose 8% to a weekly high of $1.35 trillion before settling at around $1.29 trillion as of press time. Ethereum, the altcoin with the biggest market cap, was up 3.2% over the past 7 days, trading around $2,500 key support level. XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), Tron (TRX), and Dogecoin (DOGE) held gains ranging between 2 and 7%. The highest gains this week were pulled by Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), which rose 62.7% over the period. Bonk (BONK) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) followed with gains of 26.4% and 19.4% respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap PENGU rallied for seven straight days following a surge in interest after the Cboe BZX Exchange proposed the listing of the Canary PENGU ETF with the US securities regulator. Additionally, its listing on crypto exchange Biconomy.com and a surge in NFT sales over the past week also contributed to its price appreciation. Bonk’s rally this week followed after the project’s team disclosed plans to burn 1 trillion BONK tokens from circulation once the number of holders hits 1 million, a milestone that is aimed at creating long-term scarcity. According to data from CoinGecko Terminal, the current holder count stands at approximately 943,890. At this rate, the 1 million threshold is expected to be reached in the coming months. While no particular development could be identified for FARTCOIN’s gains when writing, it was likely driven by a broader rally across the memecoin market sparked by Bitcoin’s recovery this week.

The asset dipped to as low as $2,499 last month amid broader market weakness before rebounding above key resistance. Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum has rejected its $2,550 resistance zone, hinting at potential deeper losses toward $2,220 if bulls fail to regain control. Meanwhile, a new token is defying the odds and is set to challenge more established tokens within the next few months. Ethereum Price prediction: Road to $3,000 or Slip to $2,200? Currently, ETH trades around $2,554.13 after a sharp rally of 3% over the past week, breaking past the two-week high of $2,535. This move flipped the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement level of the prior drop from $2,523 to $2,372, signaling a potential shift in momentum. However, the asset faces strong resistance near $2,665 and $2,720, where past highs have capped further advances. A sustained break above $2,735 could pave the way to $3,000, a target many bulls eye based on past breakout patterns . Conversely, failure to hold above $2,550 risks a new leg down toward $2,310 and even $2,220, where key support levels lie. Experts like Wizz Trades on X (formerly Twitter) have said that “ even the worst case scenario is bullish ” for ETH.

Is XRP Gearing up for a Bullish Break? According to market analyst Lingrid, “XRP is breaking out from a multi-month descending triangle after reclaiming the upper boundary with a clear bullish break. Price action shows a sequence of compression patterns, with each breakout gaining strength from underlying support levels.” Since a descending triangle typically forms during a downtrend and consists of lower highs and a relatively flat support level, price breaking above the descending resistance line signals that selling pressure is weakening and buyers are taking control. Therefore, XRP is experiencing a shift in market sentiment. Lingrid added, “A clean move above the triangle now points to a potential climb toward the $2.60–$2.70 target zone. As long as the price stays above $2.15, this rally may gain traction with increasing momentum.” At the time of this writing, XRP was hovering around the $2.22 zone , representing a 6.6% increase in the past week. As bullish momentum builds for the 4th-largest cryptocurreny, it remains to be seen whether XRP will soar to the psychological price of $5 . XRP Trading Volume Explodes Coinglass reports a surge in trading volume across major exchanges, led by Binance at $2.77B, followed by Bitget ($2.11B), Bybit ($1.20B), and MEXC ($674.81M). When XRP's trading volume explodes across major exchanges, it signals a significant shift in market activity and investor interest. Therefore, when aligned with upward price movement and positive news, it reflects increased interest, potential institutional activity, and a possible trend acceleration. Interestingly, breakouts from descending triangles are often accompanied by a spike in trading volume, which confirms the strength of the breakout and suggests that more participants are entering the market, supporting the move higher. Therefore, XRP might be eyeing a notable bullish run with its dominance skyrocketing . XRP Holders’ Conviction Plays Out According to crypto pundit Edo Farina, “ XRP holders have been proven right time and time again. We had the courage to speak the truth, even when the facts pointed the other way. The SEC lawsuit and XRP stuck at $0.50 felt like an eternity. But we were on the right side of history. We deserve prosperity.” As XRP holders continue to show their strong conviction, why are they positioned for considerable long-term prosperity? 1. On‑Chain Growth & Holder Base Expansion XRP started 2025 strong, adding 58,000 new wallet addresses, marking the fastest relative growth among top cryptocurrencies at a 1% rise in holders. More impressively, recent data shows XRP surpassed 7.1 million holders, a milestone driven by robust retail adoption. This surge signals a broadening user base and deeper network effect. 2. Institutional & Regulatory Clarity Institutional interest in XRP is accelerating. In Q1 2025, average daily trading volume surged to $1.73 billion, up from $1.42 billion in Q1 2024. Notably, 19% of this volume moved via OTC—a hallmark of institutional trading. Whale accumulation continues too: over 610 million XRP valued at $1.33 billion was scooped up by large holders. Legal clarity is advancing. Ripple and the SEC edged closer to resolution: Ripple has dropped its cross‑appeal while the SEC is expected to follow, simplifying the regulatory landscape. Although one judge recently rejected a proposed settlement fine reduction, the core ambiguity has been largely lifted. 3. Technological Advances & Real‑World Use Ripple is actively building infrastructure to boost XRP’s utility: Introduction of an EVM-compatible XRPL sidechain, enabling Ethereum-style smart contracts on XRP Ledger. Escrow strategy enactment—locked 400 million XRP in early July—which ensures predictable and transparent token release. Ripple’s pursuit of a national trust bank charter and integration with Federal Reserve systems will deepen its institutional backbone 4. Price Catalysts & Outlook With whales accumulating and institutional inflows rising, short‑term price momentum shaped around the $2.23‑2.40 resistance zone is promising. Historical patterns indicate July returns averaging 6.9%, hinting at seasonal upside. Optimistic forecasts peg XRP at $3–$5 by late 2025, with some long‑term models stretching toward the $8 level as adoption compounds. Conclusion XRP holders stand at the crossroads of technology, finance, and regulation. With a burgeoning user base, institutional adoption, and a clear roadmap, XRP is no longer just a speculative asset, it’s becoming a financial infrastructure staple. Having broken out of a multi-month descending triangle, it remains to be seen if this will be the catalyst to new heights.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|REGULATION|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-05 09:15:06

Blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain says the two Bitcoin addresses that each had 10,000 BTC were each emptied within minutes of each other on the 4th of July. The two wallets had received their respective Bitcoin on April 3rd of 2011 when BTC was trading at $0.78 a piece. The value of the Bitcoin in the slightly older wallet had risen from $7,805 to $1,092,370,050.73 at the time of the transfer, a gain of 13,995,672%. In the newer wallet, the value of the Bitcoin had jumped from $7,805 to $1,090,670,006.39, a 13,973,891% gain. The total value transferred from the ancient addresses adds up to $2,183,040,056. Bitcoin is trading at $109,061 at time of writing. While the wallets were dormant since April of 2011, they also received trace amounts of Bitcoin during the intervening period, possibly due to dusting attacks conducted to try to sniff out the entities behind the addresses. Dusting attacks are typically conducted by researchers, law enforcement officials or criminals. The phenomenon of long-dormant addresses suddenly getting active spurs media interest due to their potential link to the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, who remains a mystery more than one and a half decades since the crypto king was introduced to the world. The last known publicly verifiable online activity linked to Satoshi Nakamoto leads back to December of 2010 when the pseudonymous creator took to the BitcoinTalk forum to discuss a software update for Bitcoin meant to forestall denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

The company, based in Redmond, confirmed to media outlets that it is planning on changing its operational model in the South Asian country. According to reports, Microsoft will begin to serve its users in Pakistan through resellers and other closely located Microsoft offices. In a detailed statement by a spokesperson of the company, its customer arrangements and services will not be affected. The spokesperson also added that the company has always adopted this model in other countries and it has been successful. “Our customers remain our top priority and can expect the same high level of service going forward,” the spokesperson added. Microsoft set to wind down its Pakistan operations According to reports, the decision is expected to affect five Microsoft employees in Pakistan, with the report noting that the company did not set up any engineering base or resources in the country, unlike its bases in India and other growing countries. Instead, its employees in Pakistan were only tasked with selling Azure and Office products. The development comes amid a broader restructuring move from the company. According to Pakistan’s Information and Broadcasting Ministry, Microsoft’s exit is part of a wider workforce optimization program. “This would reflect a long-signaled strategy, consolidating direct headcount and moving toward a partner-led, cloud-based delivery model, rather than a retreat from the Pakistani market,” the body said. It also noted that it recognizes the value of having leading global technology providers active in the country. “We will continue to engage Microsoft’s regional and global leadership to ensure that any structural changes strengthen, rather than diminish, Microsoft’s long term commitment to Pakistani customers, developers, and channel partners,” the agency said. Western firms struggle as Asian tech firms dominate Earlier this week, Microsoft announced a reduction in its workforce, cutting it by 4% globally. Also, in preparation for its transition in Pakistan, the company had moved licensing and commercial contract management for Pakistan to its European hub in Ireland in the last few years, while certified local entities have been in charge of the handling of its day-to-day service delivery. Former Microsoft executive and its first lead in Pakistan Jawad Rehman discussed the company’s exit in a recent post. “This is more than a corporate exit. It’s a sobering signal of the environment our country has created … one where even global giants like Microsoft find it unsustainable to stay. It also reflects on what was done (or not done) with the strong foundation we left behind by the subsequent team and regional management of Microsoft,” Rehman said. The exit comes days after the federal government of Pakistan announced its plan to provide IT certifications from several tech companies, including Google and Microsoft to 500,000 youths. The announcement was in contrast to that of Google, with the company announcing a $10.5 million investment in the country’s public education last year and is also looking at Pakistan as a location to produce half a million Chromebooks by 2026. The recent development reveals the broader challenges to the tech sector in Pakistan. Unlike India and other markets in the region, Pakistan has struggled to establish itself as a major engineering outsourcing destination for Western tech companies. Instead, the country has been dominated by two main firms, local companies that have developed their engineering capabilities and Chinese firms like Huawei , which has gained a considerable amount of market share by providing enterprise-grade infrastructure to communications firms and banks.

You may have heard the success stories of people who bought Bitcoin (BTC) for $100, XRP for $0.005, or Solana (SOL) for $0.20 and turned little amounts of money into massive amounts. But for those who lost out on those moonshots, the real issue is: What’s next? While the big names still receive a lot of press, savvy investors are now turning to new, undervalued tokens that have significant potential for growth. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the most important part of this movement. It’s a meme coin that’s gradually becoming the most inexpensive crypto buy of 2025. At just $0.0013 in its current presale stage, LILPEPE is offering early backers the kind of upside that Bitcoin and Solana once did — but with far more community hype and infrastructure from the get-go. Missed BTC, XRP, and SOL? You’re Not Alone Most retail investors didn’t buy Bitcoin in 2010 or 2015. They didn’t buy XRP before the 2017 Ripple hype. Many only heard of Solana after it soared past $100 in the last cycle. By then, the lion’s share of gains had already been made. The beauty of crypto, though, is that it constantly offers new opportunities. While large-cap assets like BTC and ETH may double or triple in the next bull run, micro-cap tokens like LILPEPE can 50x or more from their starting point, especially when built on strong foundations, viral branding, and early utility. Why LILPEPE is the Best Low-Cost Crypto Buy Right Now What separates Little Pepe (LILPEPE) from thousands of other meme coins isn’t just its low entry price. It’s that the project is bringing real utility and innovation to a meme category that’s often dominated by pump-and-dump tokens. Built on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, LILPEPE is launching its own Layer 2 blockchain exclusively for meme coins. The chain is designed to be bot-resistant, lightning-fast, and virtually free of gas fees, solving major issues that plague new meme coin launches. More impressively, LILPEPE is launching a Meme Launchpad, a platform where new creators can build, mint, and launch their meme tokens directly on the LILPEPE chain. This ecosystem approach transforms LILPEPE from a meme into a decentralized factory of meme innovation. This is not just another frog-themed token. It’s the only meme coin positioning itself to become the infrastructure layer for an entire meme economy. Blazing Through Presale Stages and Raising Millions LILPEPE is currently in Stage 4 of its presale, priced at just $0.0013. With over $3 million raised so far and 2.6 billion tokens sold, the demand is clear. Early stages sold out in record time, and the momentum doesn’t appear to be slowing. But it’s not just the presale traction that has traders buzzing. The team recently launched the Little Pepe $777K Giveaway, where 10 winners will receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens. The campaign has exploded across crypto Twitter and Telegram, drawing attention from whales, influencers, and retail alike. Add to this the confirmed listings on two top centralized exchanges (CEXs) at launch, plus plans to debut on the biggest crypto exchange in the world, and it’s easy to see why many believe LILPEPE is next in line for a viral breakout. A Second Chance at Crypto Wealth Everyone dreams of buying the next Bitcoin at $1. Everyone regrets not investing $500 in SHIB before it skyrocketed to millions. But regret doesn’t pay the bills — action does. LILPEPE is offering a rare chance to get in on the ground floor of a coin that isn’t just a meme — it’s a meme movement. With strong tokenomics, real product development, major exchange support, and a presale price under a penny, the upside potential is enormous. While Bitcoin and Ethereum may still grow steadily over the coming years, only micro-cap gems like LILPEPE can deliver the kind of exponential returns that change lives. So, if you missed the last rallies, don’t let the next one pass you by. LILPEPE might just be the best cheap crypto to buy now if you’re looking to rewrite your crypto story in 2025 — and beyond.

One explosive under-the-radar gem is stealing the spotlight, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Currently priced at $0.03 MUTM is moving fast through its presale phase. Mutuum Finance is in presale stage 5 of which 60% is already sold out because of huge demand. The project is priced at $0.03, the lowest it’ll ever be before a 16.67% jump in the next stage. Over $11.7 million has been raised to date and over 12,700 investors have joined. While well-known tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB) continue to ride waves of meme-driven speculation, Mutuum Finance brings actual utility to the table, a DeFi protocol built for high-speed lending, real-world integration, and sustainable yield. Shiba Inu Holds Ground as Investors Look for the Next Big Gainer Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen its price fall 2.4% in the last 24 hours to trade around $0.0000114. While SHIB has yet to experience the blow-ups of its 2021 surge, it remains favored pick among retail investors looking forward to community and ecosystem expansions. Recent weeks have not shown any significant drivers of the price, so SHIB is trading within a rather narrow range, and experts believe that in order to resume its movement toward the $0.00002 level, the token might require the renewal of mania over meme coins or the start of the larger Altcoin rally. Among investors seeking greater growth opportunities, there are some who are starting to look at newer players such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Presale Hits $11.7 Million Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is well on its path to being one of the hottest projects in DeFi.

Some even foresee a post-launch price bounce of more than $2.50 before the bull run of 2025 is finished. Mutuum Finance Giveaway Is Live To commemorate its early traction and to give back to the community Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also organizing a huge $100,000 giveaway . 10 winners from the early investors will be chosen to win $10,000 in Mutuum Finance tokens each.

Most recently, the altcoin demonstrated a strong resurgence by moving from around $13 to just beneath $16 in the first half of June. However, the Chainlink price soon suffered a severe downturn, reaching as low as $11.2 by June 22. While the price of the LINK token has recovered above the $13 level, below are two of the critical levels investors should watch out for over the coming weeks. If Resistance Is At $15, Where Is LINK’s Next Support? In a recent post on the social media platform X, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared an interesting on-chain insight into the current setup of the Chainlink price. According to the market pundit, the altcoin could be approaching a critical resistance level around the $15 region. Related Reading: Whales Are Loading Up on Chainlink (LINK), But Retail Investors Are Still Missing the Signal This on-chain revelation is based on the average cost basis of several LINK investors. For context, cost-basis analysis examines a level’s capacity to function as support or resistance based on the volume of tokens last acquired by investors in the price region. As depicted in the chart above, the size of the dot represents the amount of LINK tokens purchased within each price region and its corresponding strength. The bigger the dot, the larger the volume of purchased tokens, and the stronger the support or resistance. It is worth noting that the green dots are the support levels, as they are below the current price, while the red dots refer to resistance, as they are above the current price. According to data highlighted by Martinez, the Chainlink price faces a major supply barrier around the $14.88 – $15.32 region, where 10,440 addresses bought 89.63 million LINK tokens (equivalent $1.36 billion at an average price of $15.12). This region could prove to be a resistance to price, as investors with their cost basis around the level would likely sell as soon as they break even, thereby putting downward pressure on the LINK price. Furthermore, IntoTheBlock data shows that the Chainlink price could find significant support around the $12.87 – $13.26 bracket, where 20,260 investors acquired 53.91 million LINK tokens at an average price of $13.05. The rationale behind this is that, when LINK’s price returns to around $12.8, investors with their cost basis in and around this level are likely to defend their position by purchasing more coins, ensuring the altcoin stays above the support area. Chainlink Price At A Glance As of this writing, the LINK token is valued at around $13.16, reflecting an almost 4% price decline in the past 24 hours.

Key Takeaways: Sweden’s new law lets authorities seize assets, including crypto, from anyone unable to prove the legitimacy of their wealth. Over $8.3 million has already been confiscated since November 2024. Concerns are rising among legal experts over potential civil liberties violations. Speaking to Dagens industri on Thursday , Strömmer urged police, tax authorities, and the Swedish Enforcement Authority to prioritize cases likely to result in significant confiscations. The justice minister revealed that more than $8.3 million in assets have been seized since the law took effect in November 2024. “Now it’s time to turn up the pressure even more,” Strömmer said. Sweden’s New Law Lets Authorities Seize Assets Without Proof of Crime The controversial legislation empowers authorities to seize cash, bank assets, and luxury items from individuals unable to prove that their wealth matches their income or offer a legitimate explanation for its origin. Sweden’s government announced when passing the measure that it aimed to crack down on violent crime by disrupting criminal finances. “This means that a person who, for example, has large amounts of cash, sizeable bank assets, or luxury articles may forfeit them if he or she does not have an income that is proportional to the property and cannot otherwise explain where it comes from,” the government stated at the time. Though it’s unclear how much of the $8.3 million seized so far is linked to cryptocurrency, the law has already sparked concerns among legal experts and civil liberties advocates. The Economist reported in December that a woman traveling through Gothenburg-Landvetter Airport had $137,000 and a Rolex watch confiscated, while roughly $1 million in assets were seized during the first week of enforcement. California passed bill to seize your crypto. pic.twitter.com/QxbWzKEsSZ — mrredpillz jokaqarmy (@JOKAQARMY1) June 28, 2025 In April, Swedish MP Rickard Nordin called on the finance minister to consider adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset, proposing that authorities retain seized BTC rather than liquidate it, similar to a “budget-neutral” approach used by the U.S. The push for a digital asset reserve comes after former U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March creating a national crypto reserve, potentially influencing lawmakers abroad to explore similar strategies. Swedish MPs Push to Add Bitcoin to National Reserves In April, two Swedish lawmakers urged Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson to consider adding Bitcoin to Sweden’s foreign exchange reserves , highlighting its similarities to gold and potential as a hedge against economic instability. Their proposal includes directly accumulating Bitcoin or adopting a budget-neutral strategy by keeping BTC seized in criminal cases instead of auctioning it. At the core of the Swedish lawmakers’ proposal is the belief that Bitcoin could serve as a digital gold, an asset capable of retaining value in times of economic upheaval. Notably, this method has allowed the US government to quietly build up large amounts of BTC, a move formalized in March when Donald Trump signed an executive order making Bitcoin part of the national reserve framework.

But while the event focused on military strength and national pride, the bill’s deeper economic changes could have unexpected effects on the crypto world. One key result is growing concern about inflation , as the bill includes large tax cuts and expanded spending. Economists warn this could increase the federal deficit by over $3 trillion, potentially weakening the U.S. dollar. Historically, such conditions often lead investors to seek out alternative assets like Bitcoin , which is seen as a hedge against inflation. At the same time, the bill excludes proposed crypto tax reforms . Lawmakers had pushed for provisions like tax breaks for small Bitcoin transactions and mining operations, but those were left out of the final version. This means that while crypto may gain more attention due to the economic fallout, the regulatory landscape remains the same for now. Despite no direct impact on digital assets, experts believe the broader financial consequences of this bill could drive more people to consider Bitcoin as a safe store of value. As inflation fears rise, crypto might gain new momentum, even without fresh legal support.",,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-07-05 09:31:10

According to the document, the bureau conducted an investigation in 2018 that ended with the arrest of syndicate leader Joaquin ”El Chapo” Guzman. A person associated with the cartel told the FBI that the criminal organization had hired a hacker. The cybercriminal hacked into electronic devices, cell phones, and monitored people visiting the U.S. Embassy in the Mexican capital. A key figure in the surveillance was an FBI assistant legal attaché working overseas. The hacker was able to use the FBI employee's phone number to obtain call and geolocation data. In addition, the attacker tapped into the city's surveillance camera system in Mexico City to track the attaché's movements and identify the people he met with. According to the operative, the cartel used the information to intimidate and kill potential witnesses and informants. Spanish group stole more than €460 million Members of the Spanish Guardia Civil, together with Europol, uncovered a major fraud network that stole more than €460 million from over 5,000 victims around the world through bogus cryptocurrency investment schemes. On June 25, law enforcement detained three suspects in the Canary Islands and two in Madrid. Europol had coordinated the investigation since 2023 and involved a cryptocurrency expert during the Spanish operation. According to the investigation, the organizers created a global scheme to collect funds through bank transfers, cryptocurrency transactions, and cash. They allegedly used payment gateways, cryptocurrency exchange accounts, and a corporate structure linked to Hong Kong. The network operated with agents around the world who lured victims to fake investment platforms. Hackers infiltrated gamers' PCs through Call of Duty: WWII The release of Call of Duty: WWII triggered massive hacks. On July 3, two days after the release, complaints from players began about attacks from an unknown hacker using remote code execution (RCE) exploits. An attacker exploiting multiplayer vulnerabilities executed arbitrary commands on users' computers while they were playing and streaming. There are known cases of hackers forcibly opening the Notepad application, displaying unwanted content on the screen, and rebooting the system. According to a gamer under the nickname MikeRxqe, the outdated P2P network model used in the game makes it much easier to get the IP addresses of players. In this case, users connect directly to each other, and the IP address of each becomes known to everyone else. The attacker can then send specially crafted network packets directly to the victim. These packets masquerade as legitimate game data (movement and shot information) but contain malicious payloads. On July 2, Activision conducted short-term technical maintenance on the servers, but there were no official statements regarding any connection to the RCE vulnerability. Migrants hacked the program that determines the location of state control agents The ICEBlock iPhone app, which allows anonymous reporting of sightings of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, went viral following a mention by Attorney General Pam Bondi. The bulk of ICEBlock users—about 20,000 people—are in Los Angeles, where ICE raids have become commonplace in recent weeks. After Bondi's evening statements, the following day on July 2, it made the list of the most downloaded free software in the United States. With ICEBlock, users can share the location of ICE agents within an ~8 km radius. The app sends a notification when enforcement officers are spotted in the vicinity. Police arrest two hackers targeting high-ranking officials and journalists On July 1, Spanish police arrested two men in Las Palmas province on suspicion of cybercrimes, including stealing data from the country's government agencies. Both suspects have been characterized as a ”serious threat to national security.” The investigation began after law enforcement officials detected a leak of personal data. The leaked data directly concerned politicians, representatives of the central and regional governments, as well as media workers. It is believed that the first suspect specialized in siphoning data, while the second managed the financial part: selling access to databases and accounts, as well as controlling the cryptocurrency wallet that received the funds. Both were detained. During the searches, police seized a large number of electronic devices that could lead to new evidence, buyers, or accomplices. Malware targeting cryptocurrency theft has learned to self-heal North Korean hackers are using a new macOS malware family, NimDoor, targeting cryptocurrency and Web3 organizations. The attack chain includes contacting victims via Telegram and trying to convince them to install a fake update for Zoom. The malware is being distributed via the Calendly meeting scheduling service and email. In a report published on July 2, SentinelOne experts said the attackers used binaries compiled in C++ and Nim to attack macOS, which is a fairly rare choice. The most sophisticated element of the attack is the event-driven CoreKitAgent application. A notable feature is the use of persistence mechanisms that make it difficult to terminate or delete. Bluetooth vulnerability allows hackers to eavesdrop on gadget owners At the TROOPERS security conference, researchers from ERNW disclosed three vulnerabilities in Airoha chips (SoCs). They are widely used in speakers, headphones, headsets, and wireless microphones across 29 types of devices. Hackers can exploit the Bluetooth chipset to eavesdrop and steal sensitive information. At risk are gadgets from Beyerdynamic, Bose, Sony, Marshall, Jabra, JBL, Jlab, EarisMax, MoerLabs, and Teufel. Security issues allow attackers to gain control of your device. On some smartphones, an attacker within Bluetooth range can extract call history and contact lists. Airoha has released an updated SDK with the necessary protection measures, and device manufacturers have already started developing and distributing patches. The number of attacks via contactless payments has increased 35 times globally since the beginning of the year According to data from ESET experts, the number of thefts via contactless payment systems continues to grow. In the first half of the year alone, the number of NFC attacks worldwide increased by a factor of 35 compared to 2024. This scheme combines standard attack methods (social engineering, phishing, Android malware) with a tool called NFCGate to create an entirely new scenario. The NGate malware allows relaying NFC data between two devices remotely, including bank cards, and bypasses security by acting on behalf of the victim. More than 40 malicious extensions that steal private keys have been discovered in Firefox The extensions are visually indistinguishable from legitimate ones and have a huge number of fake reviews and ratings to gain trust. More than 40 fake extensions for the Firefox browser are designed to steal cryptocurrency wallet data. They masquerade as solutions from popular platforms: Coinbase, MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, Exodus, OKX, Keplr, MyMonero, Bitget, Leap, Ethereum Wallet, and Filfox. Once installed, the software stealthily steals data, putting users' assets at risk. During initialization, the attackers also send the victim's external IP address, presumably for tracking or pinpoint targeting. The campaign has been active since at least April 2025. New malicious extensions were uploaded to the Firefox catalog as recently as the last days of June.",News|Security,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY|ASIA,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-05 09:36:58

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $108,595, it will fuel a bullish rally to $110,203. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $107,130, beginning a bearish trend to $104,960. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bearish pressure as buyers failed to defend support channels. This pushed the BTC price toward $108K. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Bitcoin ETF volume is on a rising trend, recording $102.14 million in daily total net inflows on June 30, marking day 15 of a gigantic inflow streak that now totals $4.73 billion. It also marks the third consecutive month of total net inflows totaling $12.8 billion since April. Bitcoin price prediction July 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $109,000, making Q2 its best quarter since 2020. In the second quarter of 2025 alone, it went up by 31%, showing strong market activity and growing investor trust. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $101,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 $101,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 $68,000 $120,000 $160,000 Bitcoin Price Predictions 2026-2031 Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2026 $115,000 $130,000 $185,000 2027 $140,491 $170,100 $216,738 2028 $164,063 $185,068 $244,142 2029 $195,629 $200,312 $255,321 2030 $225,903 $248,568 $270,593 2031 $285,058 $303,555 $350,548 Bitcoin price prediction 2026 Bitcoin might witness slow growth after 2025’s halving surge, resulting in a surge in selling pressure. However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

Cathie Wood of Ark Invest forecasts Bitcoin may hit $600,000 by 2030, with a potential rise to $1.5 million in her bull case scenario after Bitcoin ETF approval (Bitcoin exchange traded funds). Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-05 09:40:00

Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. The Plomin Hard Fork, which activated in Q1 2025, has significantly enhanced Cardano’s appeal to investors by establishing full decentralized governance. This is seen as a key milestone that aligns with the blockchain’s long-term vision of community-driven decision-making. Despite these advancements, bullish attraction post-Plomin Hard Fork was tempered by market dynamics and challenges, on its price chart. However, in Q2 2025, things seem to have changed , as a variety of optimistic factors surround the altcoin sector, which is benefiting the ADA price. As a result, Cardano price prediction is heating up again in the community. With bullish technical signals, major upgrades, and ETF hopes rising , many are intrigued to know, “Is ADA Price ready for a massive breakout?” Here’s a detailed ADA price prediction for 2025 and beyond, including expert targets up to 2050. Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Assuming that Cardano continues to focus on the network’s upcoming updates, we can expect a wider adoption rate. Even the ETF odds has higher approval rate that could bring large crowd wil multi-billion dollars into the asset, once approved. Therefore, we expect the ADA price to reach $2.05 in 2025.

As a result, ADA price has been showing signs of short-term recovery from the $0.55 support level. With the recent bullish momentum in the crypto sector during the first week of July, ADA price has been uplifted to $0.61 with growing hopes of an ADA ETF. ADA is now inching towards the range’s upper border, and a sustained bullish momentum could lead to higher levels. The key level to watch in July is $0.72. If ADA holds and reclaims this level, a breakout above that range may lead to a rally toward $0.86, and if this resistance is cleared, ADA could aim for $1.10 by July end. However, failure to stay above $0.60 could send ADA back to $0.55, with a deeper decline possible toward $0.40. Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) July 2025 $0.40 $0.74 $1.10 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Source: coincarp Cardano has always prioritized decentralization, and the recent Plomin hard fork has taken it a step further. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. To break above the $1.10–$1.20 range, strong retail participation will be key. A major catalyst could be the approval of an ADA ETF, expected by year-end, which could attract billions in inflows. If ADA holds above its Q1 2025 high, it has a strong chance of retesting the $2.05 mark before the year ends.

From billion-dollar government bills to sudden Bitcoin movements, this week’s crypto news packed surprises at every turn. Big names like Robinhood, Ripple, Solana, and FTX grabbed headlines. One thing is definitely for sure – the market is heading for another big shift. If you’ve been struggling to keep up, don’t worry – you’re in the right place. Let’s dive into the first crypto roundup of July 2025! #1 All Eyes on U.S. House’s Historic ‘Crypto Week’ Mark your calendars: a major week for crypto is coming! The U.S. House of Representatives will hold “Crypto Week” starting July 14 to discuss key laws on digital assets. Three major bills – the CLARITY bill, the GENIUS bill, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act – are set for debate. These could change rules for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins, possibly causing market swings. Lawmakers say this move aims to keep the U.S. a global tech leader. Crypto fans should watch closely as big changes and price moves may follow soon. #2 Bitcoin Could Gain from Trump’s $5 Trillion ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ It happened. The US has passed President Donald Trump’s massive $5 trillion spending and tax bill, nicknamed the “Big Beautiful Bill.” The bill doesn’t directly mention crypto, but analysts believe Bitcoin may benefit. Why? The bill sharply raises the US national debt limit, a move that could push investors towards Bitcoin as a safe haven. Though crypto-related amendments were dropped, experts still expect a positive impact on Bitcoin prices. Politics aside, this bill could shake up global markets and Bitcoin may lead the way. Elon isn’t going to like this one. #3 Ripple Joins Race for U.S. Banking License Ripple is taking a bold step to get closer to traditional banking. CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that Ripple has applied for a U.S. national bank license from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). He called it a “new (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market.” This comes right after Circle, the company behind USDC, also applied for a license. Ripple is also seeking a Master Account with the Federal Reserve, aiming to hold stablecoin reserves directly. Big moment for crypto’s push into the banking world. True to our long-standing compliance roots, @Ripple is applying for a national bank charter from the OCC. If approved, we would have both state (via NYDFS) and federal oversight, a new (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market. Earlier in the week via… https://t.co/IdiR7x3eWZ — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) July 2, 2025 #4 FTX Faces New Payout Freeze Across 49 Countries FTX creditors in 49 countries, including China, Russia, Pakistan, and others, may soon face blocked payouts. A new proposal by FTX Recovery Trust aims to freeze claims from these regions, citing legal checks. China tops the list, with 82% of affected claims. Creditors will have 45 days to raise objections or lose their claims for good. The final call will come on July 22 in court, adding more drama to FTX’s long-running collapse saga. #5 CertiK Flags $2.5B Crypto Losses in H1 2025 Crypto losses just crossed a massive $2.5 billion in the first half of 2025 but here’s the surprising part: the number of hacks is actually falling. Blockchain security firm CertiK says losses dropped by 52% in Q2 compared to Q1, even as scams and attacks continue. Two major hacks – Bybit and Cetus Protocol – together caused $1.78 billion in damages. Phishing remains the top scam type, with 132 incidents so far. CertiK warns users to stay alert as phishing attacks get “increasingly deceptive” and harder to spot. #6 80,000 Bitcoin Moves After 14 Years! Something strange just happened. On July 4, over 80,000 Bitcoin dormant since 2011suddenly moved across eight wallets, shocking the crypto community. The wallets, holding over $5.2 billion, quietly shifted funds using modern address formats, raising questions about whether this was a smart whale shuffle or a historic hack. Coinbase’s Conor Grogan even flagged a tiny Bitcoin Cash (BCH) test transaction just hours before the move hinting at a possible key-check before a bigger play. For now, no one has claimed the coins, leaving everyone guessing. #7 Crypto Investors May Get Tax Breaks Under New US Bill US Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced a new bill to simplify crypto taxes. The proposal aims to end double taxation on crypto activities like staking, mining, and lending. It also suggests no tax on small transactions under $300, with an annual cap of $5,000. Lummis wants tax relief for crypto donations too, and plans to delay taxes on mining and staking rewards until they’re sold. She calls it “groundbreaking legislation” that “cuts through the bureaucratic red tape” to help Americans join the digital economy without worrying about tax troubles. #8 First-Ever Solana Staking ETF Goes Live In a major first, Solana now has its own ETF in the U.S. and it comes with staking rewards! Rex Shares and Osprey Funds launched the Solana + Staking ETF (SSK), giving investors a way to earn rewards from Solana staking directly through a simple ETF. The SEC didn’t officially approve it but allowed it by saying it had “no further comments.” This ETF invests in staked Solana, related crypto products, and JitoSOL, a special token linked to staking rewards. Rex’s CEO calls it a “bridge between traditional and crypto investing.” #9 Iran’s Nobitex Resumes Withdrawals After $100M Hack Iran’s biggest crypto exchange, Nobitex, is slowly returning to normal after a shocking $100 million hack. The attack, linked to Israeli hacker group Gonjeshke Darande, caused major disruption and grabbed global headlines. Nobitex is now allowing only verified users to access their wallets, with withdrawals restarting on June 30. Other services like trading and deposits will reopen later. The exchange also warned users not to use old wallet addresses anymore – those are now useless due to a system upgrade. It’s a cautious but steady comeback. #10 Robinhood Brings Micro Crypto Futures for Bitcoin, Solana & XRP Robinhood is stepping deeper into crypto by launching micro futures for Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP. These smaller contracts let traders invest with less money, making it easier to bet on crypto price moves or hedge risks. This comes as crypto trading grows sharply on Robinhood, boosted by its recent deals with Bitstamp and WonderFi. Backed by CME Group, Robinhood is aiming to attract more everyday traders into crypto futures. In the Spotlight Here’s a few quick hits you shouldn’t miss! Figma Reveals $70M Bitcoin Bet in IPO Filing: The design giant also plans to move $30M in USDC into Bitcoin, signaling crypto is now part of its cash strategy alongside treasuries and bonds. Russia Unveils Ruble-Backed Stablecoin, RUBx: Rostec’s RUBx will launch as a fully ruble-backed stablecoin, aiming for legal, fast transactions under Russia’s strict financial laws, with full control by the state-owned tech giant. Tether Teams Up With Agribusiness Giant for Brazil Bitcoin Mining Pilot: The renewable-powered project could turn surplus energy into Bitcoin, with Adecoagro aiming to diversify its revenue while using Tether’s mining software. Bitcoin Millionaires Soar by 26K After Halving Rally: Bitcoin’s Q2 rebound minted over 26,000 new millionaires, as prices shot past $111K in May, driven by April’s halving and a rush of institutional buying. Ripple Ends July With Split 500M XRP Unlock: Ripple’s unusual two-part XRP release caught market watchers off guard. It’s part of a growing shift toward demand-driven token moves, with less predictability and sharper strategy. What’s Next for Crypto? Major shifts to expect ahead The U.S. “Crypto Week” could trigger major legal shifts, making mid-July a critical moment for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins. Expect volatility ahead. Bitcoin may see fresh safe-haven demand as Trump’s $5 trillion bill raises global debt fears. Ripple’s bold banking push hints at deeper ties between crypto firms and traditional finance in the coming months. Rising phishing scams and $2.5B in H1 crypto losses suggest user security will remain the industry’s weak spot. U.S. tax reforms may soon make staking, mining, and small crypto payments more attractive for everyday investors. That’s it for this week.

One such project is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently in Phase 5 of its presale at $0.03 per token. With over $11.7 million already raised, more than 12,700 holders, and 60% of the current phase sold, Mutuum is showing clear signs of building momentum. A SHIB-heavy whale wallet recently invested $10,000 into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 5 of the presale at $0.03 per token, securing 333,333 MUTM tokens. At the confirmed listing price of $0.06, those tokens will be worth $20,000, doubling the initial investment. If the price rises to $0.18, the value would reach $60,000 (6x return), or $40,000 at $0.12 (4x return), and even $100,000 if it hits $0.30 (10x return). These projections are grounded in the strong potential of the project’s innovative lending and borrowing options, unique P2P features, and planned future functionalities that could drive significant growth. P2C Lending and Smart Passive Income Options Unlike most DeFi protocols that limit participation to advanced users, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a system that is simple to use but deeply effective in generating yield. The P2C (peer-to-contract) lending model is at the core of this structure. It will allow users to supply assets like USDT, ETH, or LINK into smart contracts and receive mtTokens—interest-bearing tokens issued at a 1:1 ratio to their deposit. These mtTokens steadily grow in value as lending activity increases, with no need for manual reinvestment or compounding. For example, when a user deposits $10,000 in LINK, they receive mtLINK, which reflects both the deposit and accumulated interest. Assuming an average annual percentage yield (APY) of 10%, the user will earn $1,000 in passive income over a year—without having to actively trade or manage the funds. It’s a passive income strategy that works while the user does nothing but hold. What sets Mutuum apart even further is how mtTokens tie into its staking rewards. Users who will stake these mtTokens in designated smart contracts will receive dividends in MUTM funded by the protocol’s revenue. Part of that revenue will be used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market and redistribute them to mtToken stakers, creating a closed-loop reward system that benefits users. This staking mechanism is designed to scale as protocol activity increases, offering growing rewards as liquidity deepens. P2P Lending, Audited Security, and Stablecoin Expansion For users interested in more flexible lending strategies, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also provides a P2P (peer-to-peer) lending mode. This model will allow direct negotiation between lenders and borrowers for everything from loan terms and interest rates to duration and supported tokens. Unlike the pooled model, this approach allows custom arrangements—ideal for users holding niche or volatile assets such as DOGE or SHIB. The system’s architecture has already attracted security validation. The protocol’s smart contract has undergone a CertiK audit using both manual review and static analysis, with high scores that reinforce Mutuum’s credibility. This is further strengthened by the launch of a $50,000 bug bounty program, encouraging independent researchers to test the protocol for vulnerabilities—an extra layer of transparency that many projects in this phase don’t provide. On the innovation front, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a fully decentralized stablecoin, built to maintain a $1 peg using overcollateralized crypto reserves. Only verified issuers will be able to mint this stablecoin, ensuring strict control over supply. Borrowers will be able to mint the stablecoin by locking assets like ETH, and it will be automatically burned when loans are repaid or liquidated. The borrowing interest rate for this stablecoin will be adjusted to maintain price stability, supported by arbitrage opportunities that further lock in the peg. This structure will not only give users an additional borrowing option on the protocol—it will also support the long-term stability of the ecosystem. By maintaining overcollateralization and automatic liquidation rules, the stablecoin will act as both a liquidity enabler and a risk management tool, integrating deeply with Mutuum’s overall lending infrastructure. With the presale moving into its latter half and early whales repositioning their portfolios, the window to enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.03 is narrowing quickly. Its mix of P2C reliability, P2P flexibility, mtToken staking rewards, and reserve-backed stablecoin development makes it one of the most utility-rich assets under $0.05 right now. This month, the market is once again learning that early-stage utility wins over hype. At 60% sold, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t going to sit at $0.03 much longer. Those looking for the next big opportunity aren’t chasing trends—they’re entering before the breakout.

Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 is turning increasingly bullish. This surge in optimism is driven by record-breaking inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs , rising institutional interest , and strong political support, including Trump’s plan to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . With companies like GameStop and Trump Media adding BTC to their balance sheets, and the Fed signaling potential rate cuts, investors are asking one critical question: Will Bitcoin go back up and lead the next financial revolution?

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 Bitcoin’s performance in Q1 2025 was notably lackluster due to tariff-related concerns alongside the rise in tension between Russia and Ukraine. Yet, it made a remarkable comeback in Q2, particularly during April and May. Driven by easing tensions, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000 by the third week of May. But, In early June, BTC attempted to hold support near the previous swing low from May after pulling back from its $112K peak. On June 6th, a positive U.S. jobs report and renewed U.S.-China trade talks sparked a brief bounce from the dynamic support of the 50-day EMA. Yet, by June 10th, the momentum began to wane, with increased selling pressure linked to rising geopolitical tensions, particularly between Israel and Iran. The situation escalated on June 17th when President Donald Trump issued a warning to Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Following a defiant response from Iran, the U.S. launched attacks on Iranian nuclear sites over the third weekend of June, further worsening the geopolitical landscape. Consequently, Bitcoin briefly dipped to around $98,000 but rebounded after a ceasefire announcement on June 23rd. As of the fourth week of June, Bitcoin’s price has advanced significantly, yet it struggles near a multi-month supply block. The price action throughout June had resembled a continuation pattern known as “flag pattern”, with the upper border aligning with this supply block. In the first week of July, daily active addresses, whale transactions count (>1m USD), and addresses holding coins (10,000 – 100,000) have seen increases, as a result, the border of the flag is breached on the upside. Now, if Bitcoin can break through June’s swing high of $110K then this time the chances of surpassing $112,000 become more likely. A successful breakout could propel BTC towards a new high of $120,000 by the end of July. Conversely, if bearish pressure mounts and the price reverses, then the consolidation under the flag would continue and could return to the critical May swing low support zone. Should this level also fail, then Bitcoin could fall to the flag’s lower border, dragging the price down to the $100,000 to $95,000 range in the near term.

After a price dip, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000. Now, the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict has prompted U.S. intervention, resulting in another surge in social volume. Bitcoin’s price dipped to $98,000, but analysts expect a strong rally in H2 2025. Despite geopolitical challenges in Q1 and Q2, the overall outlook for Bitcoin remains bullish.

Remittix’s RTX Wallet Undergoes Full Flight Testing,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-vs-solana-which-altcoin-wins-the-2025-layer-1-war-remittixs-rtx-wallet-undergoes-full-flight-testing/,"The battle between Solana and Cardano is heating up as investors debate whose altcoin is likely to dominate the market for layer-1 blockchains by 2025. While both tokens have loyal bases, current performance and ecosystem growth tell two entirely different stories. Meanwhile, Remittix continues to gain momentum, with its RTX Wallet moving on to flight testing ahead of a highly anticipated Q3 launch. Solana Shows Resilience, Cardano Lags Behind Solana has recovered robustly, advancing at $148.34 from a 10.87% price jump. Despite a 25.19% drop in volume to $3.43 billion, Solana’s sharp rebound suggests new investor interest in its fast-speed DeFi and NFT capabilities. Cardano , however, has done poorly. ADA is sitting at $0.5761, down 4.12%. Its volume fell over 50%, now settling at a paltry $583.18 million. This reflects losing momentum, as users turn their attention to faster-growing systems instead. The Remittix ecosystem, meanwhile, is expanding with a real-world use case especially with confidence wavering in slower-growing projects. Remittix Prepares To Disrupt Global Payments While Remittix Wallet progresses from flight tests, investors are taking note. With this significant update, users will be in a position to send cryptocurrencies like ETH, BTC and XRP directly into normal bank accounts all in just minutes. With its token price standing at $0.0811, Remittix has raised over $15.9 million and sold 548 million tokens. The project aims at an $18M soft cap, with an early investor 50% bonus in place. While Cardano or Solana are forecasting on Layer-1, Remittix is focused on real-world adoption. With a crypto-fiat bridge, it’s not just building blockchain infrastructure it’s building world financial access. Layer-1 Speculation vs Real-World Utility Cardano and Solana both possess powerful smart contract capabilities. But the question is: which will be most valuable in the next cycle? Solana has velocity. Cardano has academic credentials. But Remittix has something different. With institutional demand increasing for scalable payment technologies, Remittix is proving to be a break-out opportunity. The Remittix roadmap is also aggressively timed. With Q3 scheduled for wallet integration and token strength remaining strong, it’s widely predicted that RTX will crack the top 10 crypto ranks in time before 2026. Can RTX Be 2025’s Top Performer? While Solana and Cardano are locked in a tech battle, investors are looking for alternatives that do well now, not eventually. Remittix (RTX) solves a sure problem: fast, simple cross-border crypto settlements and it’s already making waves around the world. With Remittix Wallet soon to be fully released, and the market currently placing emphasis on outcomes rather than hype, RTX could end up not only being an addition to layer-1s but a serious challenger to their dominance.

In Q2, after testing the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 in mid-May, it fell to hold above a key swing low support at $2.10. The upside potential has been limited due to worsening geopolitical conditions. Many anticipated a catalyst on June 16th with a favorable lawsuit update, but it resulted in a 60-day pause in appeals. On June 17th, the SEC delayed Franklin Templeton’s XRP spot ETF amid geopolitical tensions. The U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites during the third weekend of June shook market sentiment completely XRP dipping to $1.94, but a ceasefire in the fourth week helped the market rebound. On June 23rd onwards, XRP climbed from $1.94, rising over 15% after the ceasefire announcement, turning it into a short-term battle. The fourth week was full of bullish developments, as Ripple’s CEO announced on June 28th that they would drop the cross-appeal against the SEC . Experts now expect, if the SEC also drops its appeal, it would formally conclude a four-year conflict. Investor sentiment has improved, showing less panic in short-term among traders. A strong “buy-the-dip” mentality has emerged amid the chaos. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, called Ripple’s recent decision a turning point, increasing the odds for XRP ETF approval, with BlackRock potentially entering soon . The sentiment has changed, and with market-wide optimism in early July, as the short-term EMA is breached and the XRP price is inching closer to retest the falling channel’s upper border aligned with a supply block near the key $2.40 resistance. This time, a break of the upper border could trigger a rally toward $2.80 in the short term, with a chance to retest the all-time high of $3.40 later in July. The first week of July’s momentum is backed by growing whale transaction count (>100K USD), rising exchange outflow, and spiked spot volume. It indicates a sustained short-term rally. In case, if no strong catalyst emerges to push beyond the pattern’s upper border and the $2.40 supply block, a flash crash could occur, pushing XRP’s price down. If selling pressure were to resume the $2.10 support, which aligns with the 200-day EMA is crucial, as losing grip at this mark could decline to $1.88 or even $1.63. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $1.7 $2.45 $3.40 XRP Price Prediction 2025 If XRP successfully breaks its all-time high of $3.40 in May 2025—a major supply zone on the chart—it could realistically target $5 by year-end, fueled by growing optimism from banks , institutions, and potential ETF support. Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD , is now integrated into its cross-border payments system, Ripple Payments, further strengthening its position in global finance. Moreover, XRP has partnered with Wormhole to utilize its phenomenal cross-chain interoperability. Through this road in development, they seek a real-world adoption to boost. Therefore, consistent developments and crucial partnerships, If XRP manages to break above its all-time high of $3.40 in July 2025, after clearing the high-volume resistance zone at $2.40. Then odds are high that it could realistically target $5 by year-end.

President Donald Trump has issued a stern warning: if U.S. trading partners don’t finalize new trade agreements by July 9, they could face tariffs of up to 70% on imports starting August 1 . This bold move under Trump’s “America First” policy has already started rattling global markets—and could soon ripple into the crypto space. July 9 Deadline: No Extensions, Says Trump Trump made it clear—no country will get an extra day beyond the July 9 deadline to strike new trade deals. Currently, a temporary 10% tariff is in place for most partners, but failure to strike a deal could raise that figure to as high as 70%. Who Has Secured a Deal So Far? Some countries have already managed to avoid the tariff hike: UK : Reached a deal in May to maintain a 10% tariff with special terms for autos and aircraft engines. Vietnam : Agreed to a 20% export tariff to the U.S., with U.S. goods entering Vietnam duty-free. But others are still negotiating, or worse—on the verge of missing the deadline. Countries at Risk: Japan, South Korea, EU, India Japan and South Korea saw talks break down after initial progress. The EU is internally divided, delaying its potential deal. India is resisting U.S. demands, especially regarding genetically modified crops and agri-market access. With less than a week left, the clock is ticking fast. U.S. Sending Warning Letters to Non-Compliant Countries The U.S. government is reportedly sending official letters to at least 12 nations, detailing the exact tariff rates they will face if no agreement is reached. Countries like South Korea, Indonesia, and the EU are racing to finalize deals before July 9. [post_titles_links postid=”478938″] Stock Markets React to Trade Uncertainty Markets are already showing signs of pressure: European Market: -1.02% yesterday Japanese Market: -1.91% this week Indian Market: -0.59% this week Analysts warn that fears of a global trade war are pushing investors toward safer assets. What It Means for Crypto: Volatility First, Bullish Later? If new tariffs spark global economic uncertainty, risk assets like crypto may initially dip. But in the medium to long term, crypto could benefit: Bitcoin and stablecoins may become hedges against inflation. Investors might shift to crypto as fiat currencies come under pressure. Market instability often leads to increased crypto adoption . While Trump’s tariff threat may jolt markets in the short term, it could fuel crypto’s growth as a decentralized alternative to traditional finance. [article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″] FAQs What is the likelihood of a global trade war, and how would it impact the global economy? The likelihood of a global trade war is heightened by Trump’s ultimatum. If tariffs escalate, it could lead to reduced global trade volumes, increased costs for consumers and businesses, and slower economic growth worldwide. Such a scenario disrupts supply chains, can fuel inflation, and might shift global alliances, potentially reducing global GDP. How will the tariffs impact cryptocurrency prices in the short and long term? In the short term, tariffs are likely to cause market volatility and uncertainty, leading investors to pull back from perceived high-risk assets like cryptocurrencies, potentially causing price dips. However, in the medium to long term, if trade wars lead to inflation or currency devaluation, crypto (especially Bitcoin) could be seen as a hedge, attracting investors and potentially driving adoption and price appreciation. What role does Trump’s pro-crypto stance play in mitigating tariff-related crypto market volatility? Despite Trump’s pro-crypto stance, which includes appointing crypto-friendly regulators and establishing a U.S. Bitcoin reserve, tariffs can still cause crypto market volatility. While his policies aim to legitimize and boost crypto, the immediate economic uncertainty from trade disputes often outweighs this, leading to short-term price drops as investors become risk-averse.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,MARKET|ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-05 10:55:01

Ethereum lending protocols have just shattered previous records, reaching an astonishing $22.6 billion in total active loans. This unprecedented surge, highlighted by crypto data platform Token Terminal, isn’t just a number; it’s a clear indicator of the burgeoning trust and utility within the Ethereum ecosystem and the broader crypto finance landscape. What Are Ethereum Lending Protocols and Why Do They Matter? At its core, an Ethereum lending protocol is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that facilitates borrowing and lending of cryptocurrencies without the need for traditional financial intermediaries like banks. Think of it as a peer-to-peer marketplace where users can lend out their digital assets to earn interest or borrow assets by providing collateral. These protocols are a cornerstone of the DeFi movement, offering a more open, transparent, and accessible financial system. They operate on smart contracts, self-executing agreements with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. This automation reduces human error, increases efficiency, and removes the need for intermediaries, making transactions faster and often cheaper. Their importance stems from several key aspects: Accessibility: Anyone with an internet connection and an Ethereum wallet can participate, regardless of geographical location or credit history. Transparency: All transactions are recorded on the public blockchain, providing an immutable and verifiable audit trail. Efficiency: Automated smart contracts enable near-instantaneous loan origination and repayment, eliminating bureaucratic delays. Yield Generation: Lenders can earn passive income on their idle crypto assets, while borrowers gain access to liquidity without selling their holdings. The Staggering Surge in Active Loans: A Deep Dive into $22.6 Billion The recent announcement from Token Terminal, shared widely on X, confirms that total active loans on Ethereum-based platforms have indeed reached a historic peak of $22.6 billion. This figure represents a significant milestone, showcasing robust demand for decentralized credit and the increasing maturity of the DeFi sector. This remarkable growth isn’t attributed to a single entity but rather a collective effort from several leading protocols that have consistently innovated and expanded their offerings. Here’s a look at some of the key players driving this unprecedented volume: Protocol Name Key Features / Role in Growth Aave A decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol for earning interest on deposits and borrowing assets. A pioneer in flash loans. Spark Protocol A lending protocol from MakerDAO, designed to enhance liquidity and efficiency within the ecosystem, often integrating with DAI. Morpho An optimization layer for existing lending protocols like Aave and Compound, improving rates by matching lenders and borrowers directly. Maple Finance Specializes in institutional-grade uncollateralized lending, bridging traditional finance with DeFi for creditworthy entities. Fluid Protocol Focuses on providing liquidity solutions and lending services, often catering to specific market needs. Compound One of the original and most influential algorithmic money markets on Ethereum, enabling users to earn interest or borrow assets. Euler Finance A permissionless lending protocol allowing users to lend and borrow almost any ERC-20 token, with advanced features like isolated markets. Goldfinch A decentralized credit protocol that allows for uncollateralized crypto loans, bringing real-world credit to the blockchain. Curve Finance Primarily known for stablecoin swaps, but also offers lending pools that contribute to the overall liquidity landscape. Gearbox Protocol A composable leverage protocol that allows users to take on leverage for various DeFi activities like yield farming and trading. Silo Finance A lending protocol that creates isolated lending markets for specific assets, mitigating risks associated with broader market volatility. The diversity of these platforms, from fully collateralized to undercollateralized and institutional-focused models, highlights the evolving sophistication of the active loans market on Ethereum. Unlocking Potential: Understanding DeFi’s Broader Impact The growth of DeFi , driven significantly by lending protocols, represents a paradigm shift in how financial services are delivered. It’s not just about loans; it’s about reimagining the entire financial system to be more inclusive, efficient, and transparent. The underlying principles of DeFi—decentralization, transparency, and permissionless access—are challenging the status quo of traditional finance. Beyond lending, DeFi encompasses a wide array of services, including: Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): For trading cryptocurrencies directly peer-to-peer. Stablecoins: Cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, crucial for reducing volatility in DeFi transactions. Yield Farming and Staking: Strategies to earn rewards by providing liquidity or securing networks. Decentralized Insurance: Protecting users against smart contract bugs or other risks. Prediction Markets: Platforms for betting on future events. The substantial volume of active loans underscores the increasing utility and demand for these decentralized financial instruments. It signals a growing confidence among users and institutions in the security and viability of blockchain-based financial products, paving the way for wider adoption. Navigating the Landscape of Crypto Finance: Benefits and Considerations The burgeoning sector of crypto finance offers compelling advantages that are attracting both retail and institutional participants. However, like any emerging financial frontier, it comes with its own set of considerations and risks that users must be aware of. Key Benefits: Global Access: Anyone, anywhere, can access financial services without geographical barriers or extensive paperwork. Lower Fees: Often, transaction fees can be lower compared to traditional banking, especially for international transfers. Faster Transactions: Blockchain technology enables near-instantaneous settlement of transactions, unlike traditional banking which can take days. Innovation: The permissionless nature fosters rapid innovation, leading to new financial products and services. User Control: Users retain full control over their assets, reducing reliance on third-party custodians. Important Considerations and Challenges: Volatility: Cryptocurrency prices can be highly volatile, impacting the value of collateral and borrowed assets. Smart Contract Risk: While robust, smart contracts are not immune to bugs or exploits, which could lead to loss of funds. Liquidation Risk: In collateralized lending, if the value of your collateral falls below a certain threshold, it can be automatically liquidated. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for crypto finance is still evolving, posing potential risks. User Error: Lack of proper understanding or mishandling of private keys can lead to irreversible losses. Engaging with crypto finance requires due diligence, a thorough understanding of the protocols involved, and robust risk management strategies. The Future Horizon: What’s Next for Ethereum and Its Lending Ecosystem? The record-breaking performance of Ethereum lending protocols is not just a snapshot of current success but also a strong indicator of future potential. The ongoing evolution of the Ethereum network, particularly with the transition to Ethereum 2.0 (now known as the Merge and subsequent upgrades like Shanghai and Cancun), is set to further enhance its capabilities and support even greater scale in DeFi. Key developments shaping the future include: Scalability Improvements: Layer 2 solutions and sharding (future implementation) will significantly increase transaction throughput and reduce gas fees, making lending and borrowing more accessible and cost-effective for a broader user base. Enhanced Security: Continued audits and community vigilance will strengthen the security posture of protocols, building greater trust. Institutional Adoption: As regulatory clarity improves and specialized products emerge, more traditional financial institutions are likely to enter the Ethereum DeFi space, bringing substantial capital and further legitimizing the ecosystem. Real-World Assets (RWAs): The tokenization of real-world assets (like real estate, invoices, or commodities) on Ethereum could open up entirely new avenues for lending and borrowing, bridging the gap between traditional finance and DeFi. Cross-Chain Interoperability: As bridges and interoperability solutions mature, seamless movement of assets across different blockchains could expand the reach and liquidity of Ethereum-based lending. The path ahead for Ethereum and its vibrant lending ecosystem appears promising, poised for continued innovation and growth as it reshapes the global financial landscape. Actionable Insights for Navigating the DeFi Lending Space: Educate Yourself: Understand the basics of blockchain, smart contracts, and specific lending protocols before committing funds. Start Small: Begin with smaller amounts to get comfortable with the process and risks. Diversify: Don’t put all your assets into a single protocol. Monitor Your Positions: Especially for collateralized loans, keep a close eye on market volatility and your liquidation thresholds. Utilize Security Best Practices: Use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and consider hardware wallets for storing significant assets. Stay Informed: Follow reliable crypto news sources and protocol updates to be aware of any changes or potential vulnerabilities. The remarkable achievement of Ethereum lending protocols hitting $22.6 billion in active loans is a powerful testament to the maturity and immense potential of decentralized finance. It underscores a growing global appetite for accessible, transparent, and efficient financial services. As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve and innovate, its lending landscape is set to play an even more pivotal role in shaping the future of finance, offering unparalleled opportunities for both lenders and borrowers worldwide. This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it’s a foundational shift towards a more open and inclusive financial paradigm.

After reaching a high of $110,500 yesterday, BTC has retraced over 2%, but price action remains bullish. Traders are closely watching this consolidation, which may act as a springboard for a decisive move upward. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms Rising Wedge Pattern – $2,200 Support Back In Focus? According to top analyst Ted Pillows, multiple technical indicators support a bullish outlook. Notably, Bitcoin has just confirmed a bullish MACD crossover on the daily timeframe, which is often a precursor to upside continuation. Adding to the bullish case is Bitcoin’s highest monthly close in history, a key psychological milestone that could bring new inflows and spark renewed interest from sidelined investors. The current setup points to a market that’s primed for upside, provided buyers can reclaim the $112K level. As macroeconomic uncertainty fades and bullish momentum builds across the crypto space, Bitcoin could soon enter uncharted territory. All eyes are on the next few sessions as BTC tests critical levels with strong technical backing. Bitcoin Nears Crucial Breakout Phase Amid Bullish Momentum Bitcoin has gained over 10% since June 22, climbing from local lows near $98,000 to current levels around $108,000. This steady advance reflects renewed optimism across the crypto market, but the asset now enters a critical phase. Price action has stalled just below the $112,000 all-time high—a resistance level that has capped Bitcoin’s upside since late May. The coming days will be decisive, as a breakout above this level could trigger price discovery, while a rejection may open the door for a broader pullback. Despite the short-term uncertainty, the long-term outlook remains firmly bullish. Many analysts argue that an eventual move beyond $112K is inevitable, driven by favorable macro trends, strong institutional interest, and growing demand for spot ETFs. Still, caution is warranted. A failure to hold current support levels—especially the $105,000–$106,000 zone—could lead to a drop below $100,000 and shake out overleveraged positions. Ted Pillows remains confident, stating, “You can’t be bearish on Bitcoin now.” His view is based on a confluence of technical factors: a confirmed bullish MACD crossover, a clean support retest, and Bitcoin’s highest monthly close on record. These signals, combined with steady momentum, suggest that a new all-time high could be just days away. Related Reading: Chainlink Consolidates Above Key Support – Bulls Eye $20 Range BTC Faces Rejection At $109K, Eyes Key Support At $106K Bitcoin’s price is consolidating after failing to hold above the $109,300 resistance level, as seen on the 4-hour chart. After briefly tapping above $110,000, BTC retraced and is now hovering around $107,961. This rejection suggests that the all-time high zone remains a major obstacle for bulls despite the ongoing uptrend. Price is now testing the 50 SMA (blue line), currently acting as dynamic support, while the 100 and 200 SMAs (green and red) below provide a broader safety net in the $106,000–$106,500 region. The key level to watch remains $109,300. A decisive break and close above this level on strong volume would likely signal the start of price discovery. However, if bears manage to push BTC below $106,000, we could see a retest of the $103,600 support—an area that has held multiple times since late May. Related Reading: Ethereum Looks Strong Despite Volatility – $10,000 Price Target Gains Momentum Volume is relatively low compared to previous impulse moves, indicating that the current pullback may be a healthy pause rather than a trend reversal. For now, Bitcoin’s structure remains bullish, with higher highs and higher lows intact. If bulls can defend this support zone and regain momentum, a new attempt at breaking $112,000 may come sooner rather than later. The next 48–72 hours will be critical.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) is pushing closer to its record high, boosted by strong DEX volume. In contrast, Pi Coin keeps hovering below the $0.55 mark despite many efforts to break past it. BlockDAG, however, is taking bold steps beyond just price charts. It has rolled out its next growth phase at a low price of $0.0016 as part of its GLOBAL LAUNCH. Alongside this, it has secured major partnerships with two well-known U.S. sports teams: the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas. With more than $331 million raised so far and a tech framework built for growth, BlockDAG (BDAG) is looking more than just another trending name. Its combination of real-world ties and an attractive entry point shows why many see BDAG as the best crypto to buy right now. Hyperliquid Price Moves Near Resistance The recent Hyperliquid (HYPE) price jump has put fresh focus on its decentralized trading platform. After falling to $32.62 last month, HYPE has bounced back above $40 and is now around $40.56. This means a 15% rise in the last week, sitting just 11% shy of its all-time high of $45.57. June’s total DEX volume hit $11.44 billion, its best since December 2024, which suggests more traders are using the platform. Looking at the charts, signs are mostly positive. RSI is at 60 and still climbing, while momentum stays strong with all major exponential moving averages in buy range. However, the tight Bollinger Bands could point to a sharp swing. If the price clears $41.50, there’s a chance HYPE could challenge its record again. If it stalls, a dip back to $38–$39, or even $35, is possible. Despite possible dips, Hyperliquid’s on-chain activity remains one of the strongest right now, making the case for a steady Hyperliquid (HYPE) price climb in the coming weeks. Pi Coin Price Holds Steady in a Tight Range In sharp contrast, the Pi coin price shows little sign of breaking out. Current numbers place Pi at $0.532, down 0.17% for the day, moving within a narrow band of $0.527 to $0.548. Repeated pushes above $0.55 have not held, and momentum feels slow. Technicals don’t help the outlook either. Pi remains stuck under all major EMAs on the 4-hour chart, with the 200 EMA forming tough resistance at $0.607. The 20 EMA sits near $0.548, a level Pi struggles to cross. The lower Bollinger Band is acting as short-term support around $0.512. A few traders hope for a bounce, but there’s no real spark yet. Unless Pi climbs back above at least $0.567, it will likely stay in its current pattern. So far, the Pi coin price is still moving sideways, and many market watchers are growing impatient with its lack of strong upward signs. BlockDAG: Seattle Ties and $0.0016 Entry Offer Real Growth Potential While HYPE tests new highs and Pi stays range-bound, BlockDAG is making moves that reach far beyond crypto chatter. The project has launched its GLOBAL LAUNCH release, pushing the BDAG coin to just $0.0016 for now, a huge drop from its Batch 29 rate of $0.0276. This limited price window runs until August 11 and is among the lowest entries for a top Layer 1 contender. With more than $331 million secured, a locked launch price of $0.05, and 23.5 billion coins already sold, BlockDAG’s offer is catching serious attention. BlockDAG is not just sitting in the digital world; it’s blending blockchain with real sports culture. The partnership with the Seattle Seawolves, two-time Major League Rugby champs, aims to deliver co-branded media, digital fan experiences, and exclusive NFT access. Fans get behind-the-scenes content and interactive ways to connect with the team. Its deal with the Seattle Orcas, a rising name in Major League Cricket, shows the same real-world push. Cricket fans can expect digital content driven by players and fresh ways to engage with the sport through blockchain tools. These partnerships prove BlockDAG’s plan for real-world reach and strong community building. Its EVM support, hybrid DAG-chain system, and easy smart contract tools back this up. Together, these moves make BlockDAG stand out as the best crypto to buy right now for users wanting growth plus real value. Key Insights Right now, the market shows three paths. Hyperliquid (HYPE) keeps its upward momentum but must break resistance. Pi coin stays stuck, with no big upside on the horizon yet. Meanwhile, BlockDAG pushes ahead with big partnerships, a live ecosystem launch at a heavily discounted $0.0016, and over $331 million already raised. Its rare mix of a strong tech base and real-world connections is not something you see every day. With a final launch price locked at $0.05 and potential for over 3,000% gains from its current entry, BlockDAG looks like the best crypto to buy right now: built on action, not just talk.

The race between legacy and innovation is heating up fast. Chart Analysts Spot Potential Rally Forming in XRP XRP price is starting to warm up again, nudging 3% higher in the last 7 days to trade at $2.21. That tiny move may seem underwhelming at first glance, but the story behind the price says otherwise. With trading volume jumping 8.46% to $3.55 billion, traders are clearly positioning themselves for something bigger. XRP’s market cap now sits at $132.64 billion and its volume-to-market cap ratio of 2.68% suggests growing short-term liquidity. From a technical angle , XRP price is coiling tightly near the upper edge of a symmetrical triangle, a pattern it’s been respecting since February. That upper resistance between $2.20 and $2.25 is being tested again, with analysts pointing to a potential breakout that could unlock targets as high as $2.97 or even $3.30. The key? Volume confirmation. If that comes through, XRP could snap out of its consolidation range between $1.59 and $2.28 and start building momentum toward a long-term rally. While some experts are already predicting XRP could touch $15 before 2027, its journey won’t be without competition. A newer rival with a sharp focus on real-world utility is catching attention fast and its explosive growth potential could outpace XRP in the short term. More on that below. Remittix Offers Flat Fees With No Hidden Surprises While XRP gears up for a long-term climb toward $15.9, Remittix is already moving at full throttle with real-world impact. This rising project is quietly stealing attention for one simple reason it works. Remittix lets users convert crypto to fiat and send it directly to bank accounts across 30+ countries, no middlemen, no delays. It supports over 40 digital assets, with a flat-fee model that beats traditional payment rails and avoids nasty surprises. What sets it apart is its business utility. Companies can plug into Remittix’s API to accept crypto and settle in fiat instantly, no juggling exchanges or banks. With only 1.5 billion RTX tokens ever minted and bulletproof audits already completed, investors are seeing real upside. Now priced at $0.0811, RTX is gaining momentum fast. If XRP is a long play, Remittix might just be the breakout of the year.

Bitcoin Solaris Mobile Mining Revolutionizes Wealth Creation Without Expensive Hardware,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/is-bitcoin-mining-profitable-bitcoin-solaris-mobile-mining-revolutionizes-wealth/,"The post Is Bitcoin Mining Profitable? Bitcoin Solaris Mobile Mining Revolutionizes Wealth Creation Without Expensive Hardware appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Not long ago, the dream of earning Bitcoin through mining meant setting up a noisy, heat-blasting rig that drained your wallet and your electricity bill. It was a game for early adopters with deep pockets and tech skills. Today, Bitcoin Solaris is proving that you don’t need a warehouse full of GPUs to tap into serious crypto gains. All you need is your phone, some curiosity, and a little timing, because this presale window won’t stay open forever. Why Traditional Bitcoin Mining Left Most People Behind Bitcoin changed the financial world, but let’s be honest, mining it became a high-stakes, resource-heavy battle. Between rising hardware costs and soaring energy consumption, mining profits vanished for everyday users. Sure, it built empires, but it also built walls. Those walls are now coming down. Enter Bitcoin Solaris . Unlike the original Bitcoin, BTC-S was built from the ground up with accessibility, efficiency, and scalability in mind. And its mobile-first approach isn’t just different, it’s a game-changer. The Heart of BTC-S: Mobile Mining for All Bitcoin Solaris is built on a Universal Mining model that lets anyone participate, from hardcore miners to people with mid-range Android phones. Whether you’re working from a laptop in a coffee shop or relaxing with your phone, you can mine BTC-S without breaking a sweat or a fuse box. What makes it even more impressive is the upcoming Solaris Nova App. This isn’t a lightweight gimmick. It’s a powerful tool with serious features: One-click mining with adaptive algorithms for each device Built-in wallet for seamless rewards tracking Energy-saving modes for mobile devices In-app tutorials that make it beginner-friendly Compatible across Android, iOS, PC, Mac, and browser Whether you’re on your laptop or phone, Solaris Nova is setting the standard for what mining should feel like: simple, secure, and smooth. Even the mining community is buzzing. A detailed review by Token Galaxy breaks down exactly why the platform is catching fire. And it’s not just the mining that’s turning heads. Crypto Was Meant for Everyone BTC-S Finally Delivers That Promise Beyond Just Mining: A Scalable, Efficient Blockchain Core The mobile mining narrative is strong, but the tech under the hood makes BTC-S far more than a mining story. Its architecture delivers blazing performance with real-world utility. Dual-layer design with a hybrid PoW + DPoS consensus model 10,000+ transactions per second and 2-second finality 99.95% lower energy consumption compared to traditional Bitcoin mining Validator rotation for secure, decentralized governance This tech isn’t theoretical. It’s already been validated through successful audits by both Cyberscope and Freshcoins , ensuring that the platform is both trustworthy and scalable. And if you want to see how much you could potentially mine, check out the official calculator . It’s a glimpse at what crypto earnings can look like without the tech headache. Why the Presale Is Booming with 150% Launch Potential There’s a reason over 13,650 unique users have already joined. The presale isn’t just hot, it’s historic. With less than 4 weeks left, this is one of the shortest and most explosive fundraising rounds in recent memory. Current presale price: $10 Next phase price: $11 Launch price: $20 Bonus: 6% Estimated gain: 150% at launch Solaris has already raised over $6 million, and momentum isn’t slowing. And wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for seamless token delivery after launch. That’s right, you don’t need them to buy in, just to receive your tokens when the fireworks start. This is more than hype. It’s an opportunity with real infrastructure behind it. Even on social platforms like Telegram and X , communities are growing fast and spreading the word. Tokenomics: Built to Last At the core of long-term value is the BTC-S token structure, and it’s clear this project was built with sustainability in mind. According to the official tokenomics , here’s how BTC-S is distributed: 66.66% allocated to mining over 90 years 20% reserved for the presale 5% for liquidity pools 2% each for ecosystem, community rewards, marketing, and staking 0.33% for the team and advisors With only 21 million BTC-S tokens ever to exist, scarcity is built in. And by heavily prioritizing mining and public access, the project ensures decentralized, organic growth for years to come. The Verdict: Mining, Simplified. Crypto, Reimagined. Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just asking if mining is still profitable; it’s proving that it can be more inclusive, more powerful, and more rewarding than ever before. With a mobile-first model, clean energy performance, and a global community behind it, BTC-S delivers on the vision that made Bitcoin a revolution in the first place. But this time, you don’t need a warehouse full of servers to join the wealth wave. You just need to be early.

After two successful tokenised green bond issuances, the city-state is preparing to roll out its third tokenised government bond — now with a stamp duty exemption for tokenised ETFs. This strategic move aims to solidify Hong Kong’s position as a global digital asset hub. At the same time, the city is actively exploring tokenisation of real-world assets like precious metals, non-ferrous metals, and solar panels. Hong Kong’s Tokenised Bond Journey: From Pilot to Global Model The journey began in 2021 with “Project Genesis,” a proof-of-concept initiative with the Bank of International Settlements to explore tokenised green bonds. February 2023: First tokenised green bond worth HK$800 million February 2024: Second issuance — a multi-currency digital bond totaling HK$6 billion in HKD, RMB, USD, and EUR These initiatives laid the foundation for Hong Kong’s third issuance, which now takes the vision further with tax exemptions and real asset expansion. What’s New in the Third Tokenised Bond? Stamp Duty Exemption: Tokenised ETFs will now be exempt from stamp duty, creating cost advantages for investors Asset Expansion: Tokenisation to include precious metals, non-ferrous metals, and solar panels This will enable fractional ownership and 24/7 access to traditionally illiquid asset classes, opening new doors for global investors.

A tokenized government bond is a digital representation of a traditional sovereign bond issued on a blockchain. Each token represents fractional ownership of the bond. Smart contracts automate processes like issuance, interest payments, and redemption, enhancing liquidity, transparency, and efficiency by reducing intermediaries and enabling 24/7 trading. What challenges must Hong Kong overcome for its Web3 strategy to succeed?

A good example of this phenomenon is Solana (SOL), which just a few years ago was at $2. Today, the price of SOL is around $150, and analysts forecast it could climb higher. One token that has shown the ability to replicate these gains is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is still on the ground floor in its pricing. Tokens are currently in the presale phase, and analysts project massive gains when they go live. Let us take a closer look at what the future holds for MUTM tokens. MUTM presale is a massive success Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in the presale phase, where tokens are going for $0.03. So far, the project has raised over $11.7 million in the ongoing presale, which is barely halfway to completion. Tokens will list for $0.06, with the current price being a 200% increase from the initial launch price of $0.01. The current price of $0.03 is a 50% discount on the final price, which presents an opportunity for massive gains. At this price, you are guaranteed a 100% ROI. This is your chance to act before the price goes up by 16.67% in phase 6 to $0.035. In the next phase, the discount you will receive will be massively reduced. The protocol design Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed as a decentralized non-custodial protocol where users can join as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. Lenders deposit their assets into the protocol’s pool to receive interest, while borrowers deposit collateral to access the liquidity in the pools. To protect liquidity in the pools, all loans must be overcollateralized. That means borrowers deposit collateral that is worth more than the value of their deposit. If the collateral’s value dips below the safety parameters, borrowers have the option to top it up. Otherwise, the loan position is liquidated. During a liquidation, liquidators step in and purchase the debt at a discount. The discount that liquidators receive can be adjusted upwards to get them to act faster, depending on the specific market conditions. Analysts forecast massive gains for MUTM tokens The price of MUTM tokens is currently below $1, at $0.03. However, analysts are optimistic about its future, predicting that it could rise to $3. That would represent a massive 9900% increase, which makes MUTM the perfect token to rise in the next altcoin rally to the top. Based on the expected return, analysts are confident it could make it to the top 100. The Mutuum Finance team has already secured a listing on CoinMarketCap, which will provide everyone with a front row seat to witness the rise of a giant in the DeFi sector. With over 350 monthly visitors, CoinMarketCap is also expected to be an important source of new growth for MUTM tokens. As the token begins to experience initial gains due to the planned buyback program, it will improve its visibility, attracting many new buyers. In the buyback program, the Mutuum Finance team plans to use protocol profits to purchase MUTM tokens on secondary marketplaces and distribute them to stakers in the protocol. These purchases will increase buying pressure for MUTM tokens, helping to boost returns for their holders. To make the most returns, it is important to participate in the presale in the current early phases when the token price is at a 50% discount. Analysts also point to the CertiK audit as another driver of growth for MUTM tokens. The team got a CertiK audit early in the life of the project, and it currently has a Token Scan Score of 95. This score has provided a major confidence boost to presale investors, as it proves this is a genuine project. Mutuum Finance partners with CertiK To ensure the long-term security of the project, Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK on a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program. In this program, Mutuum Finance will reward security experts who identify vulnerabilities and create accurate bug reports. The program is split into four tiers of critical, major, minor, and low. This tiered approach ensures that those who identify the most pressing issues receive the biggest rewards. The program will also allow the team to develop deep roots with the global security community. Additionally, partnering with CertiK will ensure that Mutuum Finance implements industry best practices to protect its users. MUTM is poised for a breakout So far, over 60% of the tokens set aside for the current presale phase have been sold out. In the upcoming phase six, the token price will rise by double digits, wiping out the 50% discount available in the current phase. By acting now, you are getting a massive discount at an extremely low price. This could be your last chance at breakout returns before the next altcoin rally.

This publicly listed digital asset trading platform has announced a significant fundraising effort, securing approximately $535,000, specifically earmarked for a strategic Bitcoin purchase . This isn’t just another transaction; it signals a growing confidence in digital assets among established financial entities. What’s Behind the Norwegian Block Exchange’s Latest Bitcoin Purchase? The Norwegian Block Exchange , a prominent player in the digital asset space, successfully raised NOK 5.4 million, which translates to roughly $535,369. The primary objective of this fundraising was clear: to bolster its balance sheet with Bitcoin (BTC). The company wasted no time, having already acquired six BTC, an investment currently valued at approximately $633,700. This immediate acquisition highlights NBX’s conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value. As a publicly listed entity, NBX’s decision to directly invest in Bitcoin carries significant weight. It demonstrates a proactive approach to treasury management and a belief in the potential of cryptocurrencies to serve as a valuable asset class. Furthermore, the company has expressed intentions to explore using BTC as collateral, a forward-thinking strategy that could unlock new financial opportunities within the digital asset ecosystem. How Does This Crypto Investment Reshape the Landscape for Digital Assets? NBX’s recent crypto investment is more than just a company expanding its holdings; it’s a testament to the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets . For years, Bitcoin was viewed with skepticism by traditional finance, often dismissed as too volatile or speculative. However, the tide has turned. Publicly traded companies are now actively integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategies, validating its role as a store of value and a potential hedge against inflation. This move by NBX contributes to a broader narrative of institutional adoption. When a regulated, publicly listed platform like NBX makes such a commitment, it sends a powerful signal to other financial institutions and investors. It suggests that the perceived risks are diminishing, while the potential benefits are becoming too significant to ignore. This could pave the way for: Increased Institutional Interest: More traditional financial players may feel confident exploring crypto investments. Enhanced Liquidity: Greater corporate participation can lead to deeper markets and improved liquidity for digital assets. Regulatory Clarity: As more regulated entities engage with crypto, it often spurs regulators to provide clearer guidelines. Innovation in Financial Products: The exploration of BTC as collateral by NBX could inspire new lending and borrowing products in the crypto space. The Growing Trend: Why More Companies are Making a Corporate Bitcoin Commitment The corporate Bitcoin trend is not new, but it continues to gain momentum. Pioneers like MicroStrategy have famously amassed vast Bitcoin treasuries, citing its potential as a superior store of value compared to fiat currencies, which are susceptible to inflation. Companies are increasingly looking at Bitcoin as a strategic asset for several reasons: Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an attractive alternative to traditional assets. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can offer diversification away from traditional financial instruments, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant long-term growth potential, offering companies a chance to enhance their balance sheets. Forward-Thinking Image: Embracing Bitcoin can also project a modern, innovative image for a company, appealing to a tech-savvy investor base. While the benefits are compelling, companies also face challenges, including market volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and the need for secure custody solutions. However, NBX’s strategic approach, including the exploration of Bitcoin as collateral, suggests a thoughtful navigation of these complexities. What’s Next for Norwegian Block Exchange and the Future of Digital Assets? The strategic Bitcoin purchase by the Norwegian Block Exchange is a clear indicator of its long-term vision within the rapidly evolving financial landscape. By actively integrating Bitcoin into its operations and exploring innovative uses like collateralization, NBX is positioning itself at the forefront of digital finance. This move could set a precedent for other European and global financial platforms, encouraging them to reassess their stance on cryptocurrency. The continuous growth of the digital assets market relies on such bold steps from regulated entities, fostering trust and stability. Looking ahead, we can anticipate NBX to continue leveraging its Bitcoin holdings, potentially integrating them into new financial products or services for its customers. This pioneering spirit from a publicly listed company underscores the irreversible shift towards a more decentralized and digitally-native financial system. The future of finance is increasingly intertwined with the adoption of cryptocurrencies, and NBX is certainly playing a pivotal role in this transformation. The Norwegian Block Exchange’s decision to raise capital for a significant Bitcoin purchase is a powerful statement about the evolving role of cryptocurrencies in corporate finance. It highlights a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a strategic asset, capable of serving both as a store of value and a versatile tool for future financial innovation. As more institutions follow suit, the lines between traditional finance and the digital asset world will continue to blur, paving the way for a more integrated and dynamic global economy.

If proven true, Grogan noted, it could mark the largest heist in history . “If true (again, I’m speculating on straws here), this would be by far the largest heist in human history,” Grogan stated in a post on X on Friday, reflecting on the unusual transfer of BTC from eight separate wallets that had not been touched since 2011. Suspicious BCH Transaction Raises Questions Grogan pointed out a suspicious Bitcoin Cash (BCH) transaction that occurred just before the massive BTC movement, describing it as an unusual test transfer from one of the whale wallets involved. “There is a small possibility that the $8B in BTC that recently woke up were hacked or compromised private keys,” he explained. According to Grogan, the BCH test transaction took place 14 hours before the Bitcoin began moving in large chunks of 10,000 BTC at a time, raising concerns that the wallet owner may have been quietly testing private key access. While using Bitcoin Cash to test a key without drawing attention is plausible, Grogan noted it was odd that other BCH wallets linked to the entity were left untouched. “What makes me say this is the other BCH wallets have not been touched at all; why wouldn’t they also sweep these?” he questioned. Bitcoin Now Parked in New Wallets On the same day, blockchain intelligence firm Arkham confirmed that a single entity moved the $8.6 billion worth of BTC from eight different wallets into eight new wallets, where the funds remain unmoved. Arkham noted that the Bitcoin had originally been transferred into the initial wallets on either April 2 or May 4, 2011, and had stayed dormant for more than 14 years before this sudden activity. Despite the massive movement of funds, Bitcoin’s price remained relatively stable , slipping 0.5% in the past 24 hours and trading above $108,000 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data . While the exact reason for the transfer remains unclear, the crypto community is closely monitoring these wallets, as questions linger over whether the world has just witnessed the quiet execution of the largest crypto theft in history — or a whale simply moving their fortune after more than a decade of silence.

That’s exactly what’s happening in China, where a video titled ‘What is a stablecoin ‘ has exploded on Douyin, the local version of TikTok, garnering over 12 million views. This isn’t just a fleeting moment; it signals a profound curiosity among the general public about the evolving world of digital assets. But why are millions suddenly captivated by the concept of a stablecoin , especially in a region known for its strict stance on cryptocurrencies? What Exactly is a Stablecoin and Why the Buzz on Douyin? At its core, a stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, usually pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar, or sometimes to commodities like gold. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can see dramatic price swings, stablecoins aim to offer price stability. This makes them attractive for various purposes, from facilitating transactions to acting as a safe haven during market downturns. The sudden surge in interest on Douyin can be attributed to several factors: Accessibility: Short-form video platforms like Douyin excel at breaking down complex topics into digestible, engaging content. A ‘What is a stablecoin’ video can explain the basics in under a minute, making it accessible to a mass audience who might otherwise find crypto daunting. Curiosity: Despite official restrictions, there’s an inherent curiosity about new financial technologies. People are always looking for ways to understand emerging trends that could impact their lives or the economy. Economic Context: In uncertain economic times, the concept of a ‘stable’ digital asset might naturally pique interest, even if the direct application for the average user isn’t immediately clear. Decoding China’s Crypto Curiosity Amidst Regulations The fact that ‘What is a stablecoin ‘ is trending in China is particularly fascinating given the country’s stringent regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. China has famously cracked down on crypto trading and mining, even launching its own central bank digital currency, the Digital Yuan (e-CNY), as a state-controlled alternative. So, what does this public interest in a private digital asset signify for China crypto ? It’s important to distinguish between outright speculation and genuine educational interest. While direct engagement with private cryptocurrencies for investment might be restricted, the underlying technology and concepts behind them continue to fascinate. The trending video likely serves an educational purpose, demystifying a term that many have heard but few truly understand. This curiosity doesn’t necessarily translate into a desire to defy regulations but rather reflects a global trend of digital literacy. The government’s push for the Digital Yuan also implicitly raises public awareness about digital currency in general. As people become more familiar with the concept of a digital form of money, their natural curiosity extends to other forms of digital assets, including stablecoins. Global Cryptocurrency Trends: Is China Leading the Way in Public Education? The Douyin phenomenon isn’t an isolated incident; it’s a reflection of broader cryptocurrency trends worldwide. Across the globe, we’re seeing an increasing demand for clear, simple explanations of crypto concepts. Social media platforms, from TikTok to YouTube, have become unlikely educators, filling a gap that traditional financial institutions often struggle to address. This massive viewership in China suggests a significant underlying demand for crypto knowledge, even in markets with tight controls. It highlights that: Information travels: Despite firewalls, interest in global financial innovations persists. Education is key: The public is eager to learn, and simplified content resonates widely. Social media’s power: These platforms are incredibly effective at disseminating information, regardless of the topic’s complexity or sensitivity. Understanding these cryptocurrency trends is vital for anyone operating in the digital asset space, as it points to where future growth and adoption might stem from: informed users. The Future of Digital Currency: Beyond the Headlines The trending stablecoin video on Douyin serves as a powerful indicator of the public’s growing engagement with the concept of digital currency . While China’s specific regulatory environment adds a unique layer to this story, the underlying message is universal: the world is increasingly curious about how digital assets will shape our financial future. Looking ahead, we can anticipate continued discussions and developments around stablecoins and other forms of digital money. The benefits, such as efficient cross-border payments and a hedge against volatility, are compelling. However, challenges like regulatory oversight, potential for centralization, and consumer protection remain critical areas of focus. For the average person, understanding these basic building blocks of the digital economy will become increasingly important, regardless of where they live. The viral success of ‘What is a stablecoin’ on Douyin is more than just a trending video; it’s a fascinating glimpse into the collective consciousness of a nation grappling with the complexities and possibilities of the digital age. It underscores a universal truth: knowledge empowers, and people are hungry for it, especially when it comes to understanding the innovations that are reshaping our world.

A major shift in old BTC wallets has the crypto world talking, and once again, Davinci Jeremie has a message! The well-known early adopter, who famously bought Bitcoin at $1, has shared a reminder: “Stacking sats in times of disbelief makes you legend later.” The post came just a day after 80,000 Bitcoin, worth over $8 billion , was moved from wallets that hadn’t been touched since 2011. 80,000 BTC on the Move Yes, you read that right. The transactions were spotted on Friday and quickly sparked debate. Each wallet had been inactive for over a decade before suddenly transferring large sums of Bitcoin. Coinbase’s Conor Grogan suggested these wallets may have been part of a compromised OG stash. Others speculated they could be linked to early figures like Ripple co-founder Arthur Britto or longtime Bitcoin supporter Roger Ver. I think the timing is very interesting. With Ripple applying for bank license, Fedwire, SEC case closing in, etc. There must be something happening. Even folks are thinking could be Britto. I would say watch these sub wallets where the BTC went to and see where they go. — XRP_Liquidity (Larsen/Britto/Escrow/ODL/RLUSD) (@XRPwallets) July 5, 2025 What’s clear is this: the BTC was originally bought for just $80,000. Today, it’s worth over $8 billion. That alone shows how much early conviction in Bitcoin has paid off. Davinci’s Message: Why It Matters Now Jeremie’s tweet is a reminder of what has worked in crypto – buying when others hesitate. His message points to a pattern seen throughout Bitcoin’s 16-year history: those who bought during uncertain times often ended up ahead. “Those who stacked when nobody believed… will live like legends when everybody else regrets,” he wrote. [post_titles_links postid=”478938″] Bitcoin vs Altcoins: Stability Still Wins Earlier this week, Davinci also spoke about Bitcoin’s stability compared to altcoins. He noted that while altcoin traders face high risk and sleepless nights, Bitcoin remains the one asset that offers long-term peace of mind . Bitcoin is a long-term hedge, especially in a world dealing with inflation and uncertainty. Final Take Whether or not the wallet movements were planned or just a coincidence, the timing of Davinci’s message was sharp. Stack sats when it’s quiet, and you may not need to worry when it’s loud.

The project is priced at $0.03 at its fifth stage of presale, over 60% now sold out. Phase 5 buyers are set for a guaranteed 100% ROI gain at listing. The project has already raised over $11.7 million and brought over 12,700 investors so far. While Pepe Coin fueled headlines in the past, its lack of utility and declining investor confidence have pushed it down the rankings of top cryptocurrencies. Mutuum Finance, on the other hand, is drawing serious attention from those asking what crypto to invest in before the next rally. $11.7M and Rising: Mutuum Finance’s Record-Breaking Streak With its revolutionary two-way lending framework, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already attracted over 12,700 investors and collected $11.7 million. MUTM price will go up to $0.035 in Phase 6, 16.67% higher, so those jumping in here are in for huge profits. Smarter Lending Starts Here, The Mutuum Finance Model Mutuum Finance combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, delivering customers safe returns on USDT pools via the P2C platform and complete ownership of direct crypto transfer via the P2P platform.

CertiK-Audited and Certified Mutuum Finance is turning momentum into measurable credibility.

To further complement its ecosystem, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently working on creating an Ethereum-based, fully collateralized stablecoin pegged to the USD. As opposed to the algorithmic models, which can depeg, the currently developed stablecoin will be designed to bring long-term liquidity, stability, and reliability to retail and institutional users. Mutuum Finance’s $100K Giveaway and $50K Bug Bounty Program The project is already audited by CertiK and paving the way for massive adoption, and the investors who buy in today will reap big at launch.

As the hype around meme coins like PEPE fades, savvy investors are shifting focus to high-utility projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), now widely considered one of the best new cryptos to invest in. Priced at just $0.03 during Phase 5 of its presale, already over 60% sold out, Mutuum offers buyers a guaranteed 100% ROI at listing.

Priced currently at less than $0.002, many analysts and crypto insiders believe LILPEPE could rocket to $2 by 2026, delivering over 1500x returns. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Crypto Challenging Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Little Pepe isn’t just another meme coin. It’s the native utility token of a robust, multi-layered ecosystem built on a next-generation Layer 2 blockchain. While other meme coins ride the hype and fizzle out, LILPEPE brings something rare to the table: utility with personality. Its network isn’t just fast—it boasts warp-speed security, ultra-low gas fees, and lightning-fast transaction finality that outpaces even some of the top blockchains in the market. In the words of its community, “LILPEPE settles transactions faster than Elon Musk tweets.” Presale Momentum: Demand Surging, Supply Shrinking One of the clearest indicators of LILPEPE’s breakout potential is the staggering demand for its presale. With a total supply of 100 billion tokens, 26.5% has been allocated specifically for presale buyers—a strategic move that’s already generating immense traction. As of now, Stage 3 has sold out, raising a solid $2,525,000, and Stage 4 has commenced, pricing each token at $0.0013. With limited supply and a rapidly growing community, analysts believe the presale tokens could be significantly undervalued compared to their projected post-listing price. Adding fuel to the fire, LILPEPE is confirmed to be listed on two top centralized exchanges (CEXs) shortly after the presale ends—an event that typically catalyzes massive price action and liquidity spikes. The $2 Prediction: Hype or High Probability? Skeptics might scoff at a token climbing from $0.0013 to $2 in just a few years, but this isn’t the first time the crypto market has seen such meteoric rises. Shiba Inu and Dogecoin were both born from internet jokes and memes, only to reach multi-billion-dollar market caps within short periods. LILPEPE, however, is being taken even more seriously in the early stages. Top market traders and blockchain insiders are already placing their bets, with some analysts predicting a 1500x surge by 2026. That’s not just based on hype, but also the technology, tokenomics, and community momentum that LILPEPE is steadily building. Let’s not forget: the crypto market has a history of rewarding early believers, especially when utility meets virality. The Secret Sauce: Backed by Meme Market Masters Behind the scenes, anonymous but well-connected crypto professionals are helping Little Pepe rise. Many of these experts helped popularize top meme coins. These are experienced individuals who know how to inspire excitement and create ecosystems that can withstand market changes. Their involvement adds credibility and tactical strength to LILPEPE’s rollout, giving it a strategic edge over other upstarts in the meme coin race. Designed for instant settlements, LILPEPE enables high-speed trading and microtransactions, making them viable even for gaming and DeFi applications. The team has worked hard to expand the project from the ground up, getting both holders and developers to help build its ecosystem. The branding is perfect. The Road Ahead: 2026 and Beyond LILPEPE is poised to become the meme currency of the next bull run, as many investors are interested in the current presale, impending CEX listings, and a tech backbone that surpasses Ethereum’s. The leap to $2 by 2026 may seem like a significant goal, but it’s not the first time it’s been achieved. The crypto market has consistently demonstrated that unconventional ideas, particularly those with strong communities and intelligent tokenomics, can defy logic and expectations. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) isn’t just a gamble if you’re seeking the next big breakout coin. It may be a once-in-a-lifetime chance. Conclusion The crypto landscape is primed for its next viral sensation. With its strong utility, blazing-fast blockchain, and cultural relevance, Little Pepe could be the next $2 coin born from the meme world—but backed by real tech and a more innovative strategy. As the presale continues and investor buzz intensifies, now might be the last chance to get in while LILPEPE is still priced under $0.002. The countdown has begun—and if predictions hold, this tiny frog could leap to legendary status by 2026.

According to his post, the pattern suggests the potential 15 percent price breakout, targeting the $2.65 level if confirmed. The chart attached to his commentary illustrates key levels of resistance and Fibonacci retracement levels, outlining the technical basis for his outlook. Analysis of Current Price Action Ali’s chart is based on the XRP/USDT perpetual contract on Binance, shown on the 4-hour timeframe. At the time of the analysis, XRP was trading near $2.29, with a slight intraday gain of about 0.41 percent. The chart indicates that the left shoulder, head, and right shoulder of the pattern have been formed, with the neckline resistance positioned at approximately $2.33. This neckline is a critical level to watch, as a clear breakout above it would complete the inverse head and shoulders formation. The price action leading up to this point includes a decline to the $1.90 zone, which formed the head of the pattern. Since then, XRP has rebounded and established higher lows, with the right shoulder appearing to take shape over the past few sessions. The pattern suggests that a decisive move above $2.33 could trigger a measured move upwards. $XRP appears to be forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern, potentially setting the stage for a 15% breakout to $2.65! pic.twitter.com/5XLBc5AIkm — Ali (@ali_charts) July 3, 2025 Fibonacci Levels and Price Targets The chart also overlays Fibonacci retracement and extension levels, providing additional context to the analysis. Key Fibonacci resistance levels above the neckline include $2.47 (1.272 extension), $2.54 (1.414 extension), $2.64 (1.618 extension), and $2.74 (1.786 extension). We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ali identifies the $2.65 level as the primary upside target, which corresponds closely with the 1.618 extension level on the chart. This level would represent a 15 percent increase from the breakout point at $2.33. The use of Fibonacci levels in this analysis supports the target projection by aligning potential resistance points along the anticipated upward move. The current structure, as outlined by Ali, implies that failure to break and hold above the neckline could invalidate the pattern and limit upside potential. Broader Implications for XRP Ali’s commentary reflects a positive short-term technical outlook for XRP , contingent on confirmation of the breakout. The inverse head and shoulders pattern is widely regarded as a bullish reversal indicator, suggesting that XRP could continue higher if buying momentum persists. Traders watching this setup are likely to focus on the $2.33 neckline and monitor volume and momentum indicators for signs of confirmation. This analysis comes as XRP continues to trade within a broader recovery trend after recent corrections. While technical patterns do not guarantee outcomes, they remain an important tool for market participants seeking to identify probabilities in price movements.

Also, Schwartz’s claim that Satoshi “probably” held XRP lacks evidence and appears to be a speculation. David Schwartz has often speculated to be behind the mysterious identity of Bitcoin’s creator. However, he has clarified that he only got involved in Bitcoin around 2011. The Bitcoin whitepaper came out in 2008, and the network officially launched in 2009, but no one knows who truly created it. XRP: Satoshi’s Real Vision? Previously, a widely circulated post by John Squire claimed that XRP is the product which comes closes to Satoshi Nakamoto’s main idea. XRP fans argue that it solves many of Bitcoin’s current issues, like high fees, slow speeds, and centralization. [post_titles_links postid=”478887″] Alex Cobb , a well-known community voice also added by suggesting that Satoshi Nakamoto may have had a hand in creating XRP. He quoted Satoshi’s famous last message from April 23, 2011 “I’ve moved on to other things” hinting that XRP, which launched just a year later, could have been part of those “other things.” Could Satoshi Have Helped Create XRP? While there’s no proof, Ripple CTO David Schwartz and others involved in XRP were also early Bitcoin contributors which has sparked more curiosity around the theory. Also, 2009 emails show that Satoshi had praised the original Ripple project, calling it “unique” for spreading trust rather than centralizing it. However, his remarks referred to RipplePay, created in 2004 and not XRP. But many have mistakenly linked his praise to XRP. Some analysts have also pointed to the timing of Satoshi’s exit in 2011 and the start of XRP’s development soon after. With Arthur Britto reappearing online and old BTC wallets moving, speculation is rising, could Bitcoin’s creators have helped shape XRP too?

SEC filings reveal Pershing Square Capital has allocated 41% of its capital into the small handful of bets, with the largest allocation in Uber. The firm now has about $2.8 billion invested, or 18.5% of its portfolio, in the rideshare giant, holding 30.3 million shares. Uber’s strength lies in its dominant driving platform, fueled by network effects that attract more drivers and riders, alongside its growing profitability and robust cash flow generation. In addition, Pershing now holds an estimated 18,984,772 shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill, representing 9.07% of its portfolio, valued at just over $1 billion. Chipotle’s scalable, health-focused fast-casual model leverages strong brand loyalty and operational efficiency to drive consistent growth, although the company has faced challenges like tariff-related cost pressures and weaker 2025 foot traffic. Lastly, Pershing Square Capital has committed 14% of its portfolio, approximately $1.6 billion, to Google’s parent company Alphabet. The firm holds an estimated 9,048,131 shares at $180.55 each. The big bet is focused on the tech giant’s continued dominance, fueled by cloud computing, artificial intelligence, ad services and YouTube, bolstered by high switching costs and data-driven network effects, although the firm continues to fight ongoing antitrust challenges.

The ETF is only behind the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF and the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF. The IBIT Bitcoin ETF holds $76 billion in assets under management (AUM) and generates an estimated $191 million in annual revenue. IBIT Becomes BlackRock’s Third Most Profitable Fund BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF has quickly established itself as the firm’s third-highest revenue-generating fund. The ETF has $76 billion in assets under management (AUM), and a 0.25% expense ratio, generating $191 million in annual revenue. The ETF’s stunning growth puts it behind only BlackRock’s iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF and the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF. IBIT launched in January, easily crossing early projections thanks to strong demand from institutional and retail investors. The ETF has experienced consistent inflows since then, which have significantly contributed to its annual revenue. Most analysts believe IBIT will surpass its competition in revenue generation. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas stated, “IBIT is now the 3rd highest revenue-generating ETF for BlackRock out of 1,197 funds, and is only $9b away from being #1. Just another insane stat for a 1.5-year-old (literally an infant) ETF.” Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor responded to the milestone, stating that IBIT will soon become BlackRock’s number one revenue-generating ETF. Market watchers also noted that the spot Bitcoin ETF is only $9 billion in assets away from surpassing IWF as BlackRock’s top revenue-generating ETF. A Record-Breaking ETF BlackRock manages over 1,100 ETFs. However, IBIT’s stunning growth has been unlike any other. The ETF’s current revenue is only $20 million lower than IWF and $16 million lower than EFA. Current market conditions and investor sentiment could help IBIT climb higher. BlackRock’s IBIT became the fastest ETF to reach $2 billion in inflows, reaching the milestone just days after its launch. The fund crossed $50 billion within six months, placing it among the fastest-growing ETFs of all time. IBIT has consistently registered inflows from corporate treasuries, hedge funds, and advisors, benefiting from the rising demand for Bitcoin and other digital asset investment products. According to BlackRock, IBIT’s growth signals rising institutional adoption of Bitcoin. IBIT’s trajectory mirrors the early success of gold ETFs and suggests a push towards crypto integration in traditional portfolios. IBIT’s success is largely due to the fact that it gives investors exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of wallets and direct ownership of the asset. It also underscores the growing demand for Bitcoin as a mainstream investment asset. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Markets were also spooked by a mysterious transfer of 80,000 BTC by a long-dormant Bitcoin wallet, with some speculating it could be a hack. The flagship cryptocurrency is down 0.70% over the past 24 hours, trading around $108,101 after dropping from an intraday high of $109,123. BlackRock’s IBIT Becomes Third-Highest Revenue Generator BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF has quickly established itself as the firm’s third-highest revenue-generating fund.

Just another insane stat for a 1.5-year-old (literally an infant) ETF.” Mysterious Bitcoin Whale Transfer Stuns Market An old Bitcoin whale has started moving a staggering 80,000 BTC , worth $8.6 billion after fourteen years. According to data from Arkham Intelligence, the funds began moving in batches of 10,000 BTC early on Friday. By 11 AM Eastern Time, all the BTC had been moved to new addresses. Blockchain observers quickly pointed out that the entity behind the transfers received the Bitcoin in 2011 as “coinbase” transactions, the first transaction in a block created by miners. “THE FINAL BTC BILLIONAIRE ADDRESS JUST MOVED $1.1 BILLION worth of BTC . A single entity that controls $8.6 BILLION of BTC has moved their final 10K wallet.” CryptoQuant head of research, Julio Moreno, stated that this was the largest movement of BTC aged ten years or more. The previous record was a transaction of 3,700 BTC . “It is the largest daily movement of coins aged 10 years or more in history.” Another analyst noted that the entity that made the transactions on Friday held over 200,000 BTC at one point. Conor Grogan, the director of Coinbase, stated that the entity had a fortune of $21.5 billion, ranking it among the top five largest Bitcoin holders in history. According to Grogan, the Bitcoin wallet likely belonged to an “OG miner.” OG miners are miners who began Bitcoin mining very early on, likely when the network was in its infancy. Was The $8.6B Bitcoin Transfer A Hack? Conor Grogan, Head of Product at Coinbase, believes there is a small chance the staggering transfer of $8.6 billion worth of Bitcoin could be a hack. If true, it could be the largest heist in history. Grogan stated in a post on X, “If true (again, I’m speculating on straws here), this would be by far the largest heist in human history. There is a small possibility that the $8B in BTC that recently woke up were hacked or compromised private keys.” Grogan flagged a suspicious Bitcoin Cash (BCH) transaction made before the Bitcoin transfer, stating the wallet owner might have been quietly testing the wallet key, as Bitcoin Cash transactions attracted little attention. “I found a single BCH test transaction from one of the BTC whale clusters 14 hours ago, followed by the full amount. An hour later, the BTC wallets began to move. What makes me say this is that the other BCH wallets have not been touched at all; why wouldn’t they also sweep these?” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered a sharp decline on Friday, losing momentum after failing to close above $110,000. The flagship cryptocurrency posted an impressive rally on Wednesday, rising nearly 3% to reclaim $108,000 and settle at $108,845. It continued pushing higher on Thursday, reaching an intraday high of $110,583 before marginally declining to settle at $109,650. Sellers overwhelmed buyers on Friday, and the price dropped to $108,097. Despite geopolitical tensions, market uncertainty, a massive spending bill, and a mysterious whale transfer, Bitcoin charts remain bullish. According to analysts, short-term traders are locking in their profits after BTC’s latest rally, creating a “sell the news” dynamic. The price faces resistance around $110,650, a level it failed to clear this week. A break above this level could take BTC beyond $112,000 to a new all-time high. Prices have also been impacted by the recent US nonfarm payrolls jobs data. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US economy added 147,000 jobs in June, while the unemployment rate dropped to 4.2%. The data was substantially better than the expected addition of 100,000 jobs in June, and contrasted with the ADP report, which indicated a loss of over 33,000 private sector jobs. The unemployment rate was also lower than the predictions that projected an increase to 4.3%. BTC ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping below $100,000 to a low of $98,385 on Sunday (June 22). The price rebounded to reclaim $100,000 and end the weekend at $100,985. BTC rallied on Monday, rising over 4% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,443. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as the price rose 0.66% to cross the 20 and 50-day SMAs and $106,000, settling at 106,137. BTC reclaimed $107,000 on Wednesday, rising 1.19% and settling at $107,397. Despite the positive sentiment, the price fell 0.39% on Thursday, slipping below $107,000 and settling at $106,980. It recovered over the weekend, registering marginal increases on Friday and Saturday to reclaim $107,000 and settle at $107,339. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC rose almost 1% to reclaim $108,000 and settle at $108,350. However, it lost momentum on Monday, dropping 1.09% and settling at $107,167. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell 1.33%, slipping below $106,000 and settling at $105,742. BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 3% to reclaim $108,000 and settle at $108,845. The price continued rising Thursday, reaching an intraday high of $110,583 before settling at $109,650. Sellers overwhelmed buyers on Friday as the flagship cryptocurrency fell 1.42% to $108,097. The current session sees BTC marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control.

After a sharp decline and waning investor confidence, whales are now accumulating billions in SHIB, reigniting short-term price and market optimism. Despite Shiba Inu’s prolonged consolidation, a sudden spike in on-chain activity has caught the market by surprise. For instance, Shiba Inu’s transaction volume soared to 24 trillion SHIB in early June, with whale activity surging 600%. This striking on-chain spike may be the reason why bullish momentum is starting to build, given that SHIB has already enjoyed a 4.3% increase over the past 24 hours, trading at $0.00001182. SHIB’s Golden Cross Pops Up According to market analyst Kryll, Shiba Inu is witnessing a golden cross amid intensified whale accumulation. Why is this bullish? Well, a golden cross happens when the 50-day moving average (MA) crosses above the 200-day one, signalling a potential trend reversal from bearish to bullish. Therefore, Shiba Inu’s short-term price momentum is gaining strength, which has the potential to boost sentiment through positive market psychology. Technical analyst Tom Tucker added , “SHIB is trading just above its YTD low, with a double-bottom pattern forming. Exchange supply is dropping, futures open interest is rising, and a BTC rally could add fuel.” Source: Tom Tucker Meanwhile, the Shibarium team recently unveiled a major upgrade aimed at boosting decentralization, privacy, and censorship resistance.

This comes in the final chapter of a S$3 billion money laundering scandal that rocked the city-state in 2023. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) confirmed the penalties on Thursday, naming global banks like Credit Suisse, UBS, Citibank, UOB, Julius Baer, LGT Bank, and asset manager Blue Ocean among those penalized. Yes, this is serious. Read on for the details! The Assets That Sparked the Crackdown This massive case first surfaced in August 2023, when police raided multiple properties and arrested ten Chinese nationals, later linked to organized criminal groups. Authorities uncovered billions in illegal funds tied to luxury real estate, cash, and cryptocurrencies. The individuals were later sentenced to prison terms between 13 and 17 months, deported after serving time, and permanently banned from returning to Singapore. Credit Suisse Fined the Most Among the banks involved, Credit Suisse’s Singapore branch received the largest fine of S$5.8 million. MAS cited “poor or inconsistent implementation of AML controls” as the reason. Others, like UBS, Citi, and UOB, were also fined for similar lapses. UOB, Singapore’s third-largest bank, said it has already taken corrective steps to strengthen compliance. MAS has also issued prohibition orders lasting up to six years against four individuals linked to the case. This is Singapore’s most serious regulatory action since 2016, when the MAS shut down BSI Bank over its role in the 1MDB scandal. Crypto Is Being Closely Watched While the focus is on traditional banks, crypto had a role to play. Some of the seized assets were in cryptocurrencies, pulling the digital asset sector into the spotlight once again. And it’s happening at a time when Singapore is tightening crypto regulations. Under new rules that kicked in this June: Crypto firms offering overseas services must be licensed under the FSMA by June 30, 2025 Retail investors are banned from using credit or receiving incentives Transactions over SGD 1,500 require full ID checks under the Travel Rule DeFi frontends and wallets that serve retail users or earn from token-based services may now fall under MAS oversight Crypto innovation is welcome, but not without strong compliance. A Warning Shot to Banks and Crypto Firms Singapore is raising the bar on financial integrity. And as crypto becomes more embedded in the global financial system, these rules aren’t just for banks anymore. The MAS is trying to build a system where trust is the most important. It will be interesting to see the results of this crackdown.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|FIAT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-05 11:58:41

The capital fuels a strategic shift towards a large Ethereum treasury and business expansion into higher-margin Bitcoin Treasury Advisory and Mining-as-a-Service offerings. BMNR trades at a 52.82x price-to-hold ratio (current BTC only) and a pro forma 3.29x (including planned ETH treasury), representing a notable premium compared to peers like MSTR, MARA, and RIOT. While the capital infusion is a significant positive, a hold rating is initiated due to the current rich valuation. Bitmine Immersion Technologies ( BMNR ) is the latest company to adopt the crypto corporate treasury strategy. As publicly traded companies increasingly adopt the crypto-backed balance sheet approach, it is becoming increasingly important for investors to develop a framework for evaluating companies pursuing such strategies. In the last month, I've covered a series of companies that recently adopted a crypto-backed corporate balance sheet. And part of the approach I've taken to analyze these companies includes an assessment of the underlying business (if any), the strategic intent for adopting a crypto treasury strategy, and the potential near and long-term implications for the company's capital structure. My recent coverage of SharpLink Gaming ( SBET ), a digital sports media and performance marketing firm, that adopted an Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) corporate strategy with a $463 million ETH buy last month, showed significant supply overhang from equity fund raises and potential for heavy dilution. Another company I covered recently was Next Technology ( NXTT ), a Chinese tech firm that touts AI and blockchain service offerings in addition to its recent pivot to a Bitcoin corporate treasury strategy. An in-depth analysis revealed that no tangible backstop business exists yet for the company, nor were there any working products in its acclaimed tech verticals, nor revenue, nor backlog yet. This underscores the critical importance of due diligence when investing in crypto treasury companies. This article initiates coverage on Bitmine Immersion, examining its core Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining business and its pivot to Bitcoin and Ethereum treasury strategy, and the broader implications of this pivot. The main goal is to give investors a grounded view of what's driving this stock, how sustainable the thesis is, and whether there is long-term value beyond the current hype created by the crypto treasury pivot. Bitmine Immersion Technologies - Company Profile Bitmine calls itself a ""Bitcoin network company that drives value through BTC treasury and multiple Bitcoin income streams."" As its primary business, Bitmine mines Bitcoin just like any other Bitcoin miner. The company currently operates two mining sites in Texas and two mining sites in Trinidad and Tobago. One of Bitmine's main differentiators in the mining business is its use of immersion-cooled infrastructure, which involves submerging ASIC miners in thermally conductive liquid instead of relying on the more common air cooling. Immersive cooling isn't novel or proprietary to Bitmine, but Bitmine is one of the miners that has fully adopted this cooling method as the only operational standard. I covered the benefits of immersive cooling last year in an article for MARA Holdings ( MARA ), where I talked extensively about MARA's two-phase immersion cooling system. Just a side note, If you are interested in understanding what it entails and the implications for mining operations and long-term OpEX reduction, you can refer to that piece on Mara Holdings , which explains it in detail. Bitmine calls part of its model ""synthetic mining,"" which is to acquire Bitcoin hashrate not by buying hardware but via leasing or contract-based access to mining power, essentially paying for the right to use the hashrate without owning the underlying machines. It is like an institutional-grade version of cloud mining. In cloud mining, smaller retail miners typically prepay for a fixed slice of hashrate from a provider, while in this case, it is large-scale miners that lease the equipment or the output through structured agreements. Synthetic mining is also different from colocation or traditional hosting arrangements, in that, in synthetic mining, as Bitmine defines it, hashrate exposure is secured via futures or revenue-sharing contracts, and they do not own or operate the physical ASICs themselves. An instance of this is the 12-month forward contract with Luxor, a hashrate derivatives provider, which allowed Bitmine to pre-sell future hashrate in exchange for upfront capital to finance new ASICs. BMNR was uplisted to NYSE last month, following a 1 for 20 reverse stock split in May, and a public offering of 2,250,000 shares of its common stock at $8.00 per share. BMNR is up over 3,000% since announcing the initiation of an Ethereum treasury strategy last month. How A PIPE Capital Infusion Changes The Math For Bitmine Bitmine has had a crescendo of catalysts in the space of a month that has set off a rally for the stock: NYSE uplisting in early June, followed by the announcement of the purchase of 100 BTC for the Bitcoin treasury strategy. The 100 BTC was purchased with the $18 million raised from the public offering mentioned earlier, and an additional 54.167 BTC were purchased on June 17, bringing the company's total BTC in treasury to 154.167 BTC. Then, the most recent crown jewel of $250 million PIPE to initiate an Ethereum treasury strategy . These are well-timed announcements, if you ask me. Bitmine has also launched a Bitcoin Treasury Advisory Practice , an expansion into potential higher-margin service offerings. As part of this push, the company signed a $4 million deal with a U.S.-listed firm to lease 3,000 ASIC miners through 2025 and provide $800k worth of consulting services focused on Bitcoin Mining-as-a-Service (MaaS) and corporate treasury strategy. According to management, this single deal surpasses Bitmine's total FY24 revenue which was $3.3 million, suggesting that advisory services could become a meaningful growth driver for the company. In the recently released financials of Bitmine's latest 10-Q , which is for fiscal Q3 2025, there are several interesting line items in the analysis of the capital structure of Bitmine. I'll also show how the announced $250 million PIPE raise is the most significant and transformative event in the history of the company by integrating the impact into the balance sheet of the company. Income statement (10-Q) On the income statement for FQ3, we can see the emergence of consulting revenue of $35k. Though it is still a small figure compared to total revenue, its emergence on the income statement is still evidence of Bitmine's new Bitcoin treasury advisory business line. Another consideration is that the majority of the consulting revenue from the $4 million deal is still unrecognized, hence the large increase in Customer Advances line on the balance sheet. Balance sheet (10-Q) One noteworthy line on the balance sheet is the over 100% increase in customer advances, jumping from $703k to $1.8 million YoY, clearly showing upfront payments for services yet to be rendered, a direct reflection of the new revenue streams. Beyond this, the balance sheet also shows a substantial increase in cash and cash equivalents, rising from $499k to $1.4 million. Cryptocurrencies held also increased from just $78k about a year ago to $1.2 million as of FQ3 end in May. Current assets increased from $1.56 million to $2.18 million, and that number is likely to jump significantly when the $250 million PIPE closes and most of the proceeds go to the planned Ethereum treasury holdings. And considering that the fund is from a PIPE equity raise, there will likely not be a matching increase in current liabilities. That would put Bitmine's balance sheet on a relatively similar attractive footing with peers that have also adopted a BTC and ETH treasury strategy like Bit Digital ( BTBT ). But for now, and based on the FQ3 results, Bitmine's balance sheet lacks significant underlying financial strength in short-term liquidity. To make the situation worse, loans payable to related parties and the interest accrued on these related party loans are about $2.4 million in total. This alone exceeds the $2.18 million total current assets of the company, which is an alarming concern. Bitmine appears to be a highly leveraged business. Total shareholders' equity in the FQ3 balance was $2.9 million. This makes up about 35% of the $8.3 million in total assets, while the remaining ~65% ($5.4 million of total assets) are funded by liabilities. Bitmine's debt-to-equity ratio ($5.4 million / $2.9 million) is currently 1.87. For every dollar of owner's capital, Bitmine has roughly $1.87 in debt. This high leverage is on the verge of being rectified. $250 million from the PIPE means equity will increase by roughly that amount, which will cause the debt-to-equity ratio to plummet and deleverage the company's balance sheet. Shareholders' equity breakdown (10-Q) Bitmine's FQ3 balance sheet shows a significant Accumulated Deficit of $13.9 million, which is the cumulative net losses the company has incurred over its history, and this directly erodes the total Stockholders' Equity because it is recorded as a negative component of equity. While the company has managed to raise substantial capital in the past, evidenced by the $16.8 million in Additional Paid-in Capital [APIC], this capital has largely been offset by the company's historical net losses, leaving a net shareholders' equity of only $2.9 million. The shareholders' equity would have been larger if not for the accumulated deficit. Here's where the PIPE funds play another vital role in Bitmine's capital structure, as it will certainly swell the APIC and in turn swell total equity. Almost every dollar will go into the APIC line as the $4.50 price from the PIPE is significantly above the nominal par value of BMNR ($0.0001 per share). If we infuse the ~$250 million into the APIC, it will surge to over $266.8 million (from the current $16.8 million), leading to a massive increase in total equity. With Bitmine's total shareholders' equity of $2.9 million, a net loss of, say, $2 million in a quarter, would wipe out a significant portion (over 60%) of its equity. But with the ~$250 million injection into the equity, the total equity becomes ~$252.9 million; and under this new equity base, if the company still loses $2 million in a quarter, that loss would represent only a tiny fraction (less than 1%) of its new equity base. This significantly increases the company's financial resilience and provides a substantial buffer against future operational losses. Like I said earlier in this piece, the $250 million from the PIPE is the crown jewel and game-changer for Bitmine. The current capital structure of the company, characterized by high leverage and a small equity base largely eroded by accumulated deficit, but the PIPE fundamentally transforms this by infusing massive equity, drastically reducing reliance on debt, and enabling all of the company's strategic pivot. By the time FQ4 results are released and the new capital structure is reflected, I believe Bitmine will have a more attractive balance sheet and greater financial flexibility, like several of its peers. BMNR is up a lot lately and for good reason; the market has reacted to the $250 million PIPE and the ETH treasury strategy. My main goal in this piece has been to help readers understand the nuances beyond just the fresh injection of funds for ETH purchase for treasury purposes. The ETH pivot is what the market has largely reacted to. But beyond that pivot, I've shown the dramatic transformation of the company's capital structure and the journey toward enhanced liquidity and financial resilience. BMNR price trend (Seeking Alpha) Bitmine currently holds ~154 BTC, which has a carrying value of $16.6 million at the current $107,700 per BTC spot price as of July 4, 2025. Then, assuming it buys ETH with the total $250 million from the PIPE, that would give a total crypto assets holdings value of around $266.6 million (if we add the ETH purchase to the BTC holding). At BMNR current market cap of $877 million, BMNR's pro forma price-to-hold ratio (stock price against the per-share value of their crypto holdings) would be 3.29x. If we consider only the current BTC and do not include projected figures for the ETH treasury, we'd have a 52.82x ($877 million / $16.6 million) p/hold multiple for BMNR. This is in very expensive territory and not on the side of undervaluation to net asset value when compared to crypto treasury peers with stronger visibility and more robust core operating businesses, like Strategy ( MSTR ), Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), or MARA. This reinforces that BMNR is expensive at the current price level. Top 5 Bitcoin treasury holdings ( bitcointreasuries.net) MSTR currently trades at a p/hold multiple of 1.76x, MARA trades at 1.16x, and RIOT trades at 2.10x (you can get each of these p/hold numbers by dividing the market by the dollar value of the Bitcoin holdings for the respective companies). Bitmine's current p/hold is way more expensive and even the pro forma p/hold of 3.29x still suggests a notable premium relative to its digital asset holdings, especially if we consider the fact that all the aforementioned companies in the p/hold comp in this analysis all have way more robust core businesses and substantial revenue compared to Bitmine's. I am therefore initiating coverage on BMNR with a Hold rating. As an investor, I'll be closely monitoring how the company deploys the fresh capital, grows its treasury assets, and executes on its core Bitcoin mining operations. These all will be key indicators of whether Bitmine can transition from speculative upside to sustainable value creation, and whether its current valuation can eventually justify a long-term investment thesis.",SBET|ETH-USD|NXTT|BTC-USD|BTBT|MSTR|RIOT|BMNR,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MINING|ETH,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-07-05 12:00:00

Meanwhile, Dogwifhat (WIF) has slid ~4–10% intraday to ~$0.85, testing key support amid declining volume. Fundamentally, Bonk’s token burns and supply tightening, coupled with Pepe’s on-chain demand, suggest the memecoin mania may still have legs. Technically, Bonk and Pepe display bullish wedge breakouts, while WIF’s dip could mark a short-term bottom—watch for volume confirmation. Bonk (BONK) Bonk (BONK), Solana’s breakout memecoin, is once again attracting market attention as it gains upward momentum amid fresh hype surrounding potential ETF exposure and token burn events. Trading at approximately $0.00001874, the BONK price has climbed steadily in recent sessions, rising over 20% from weekly lows near $0.0000158—an encouraging sign for meme-token bulls. Despite the recent selling pressure, the BONK price remains within bullish influence as the token surges $0.00001558 to $0.00001627 The momentum is rising as the price is approaching the upper resistance of the Gaussian Channel and a rise above the range could flip the prevailing bearish trend On the other hand, the CMF is rising and sustaining above 0, hinting towards the rise in the money flow onto the platform Therefore, if the BONK price manages to rise above the channel, it may reach the neckline of the double-bottom pattern at $0.00002776, slicing above the pivotal resistance between $0.00002495 and $0.00002632 Pepe (PEPE) PEPE coin is showing signs of technical strength amid renewed crypto market optimism. It is currently trading around $0.000009890 with a modest rise of over 1.69% in the past 24 hours but still remains within a tight consolidation range. This hints towards a potential breakout, offering a potential upside of more than 50%. The PEPE price has been trading within a descending parallel channel but has formed a small ascending parallel channel within Interestingly, the CMF is dropping while RSI is making every attempt to keep the price elevated, holding the ascending support This suggests that the strength of the rally is coiling up but the money flow into the platform has decreased This may place the PEPE price at a crucial juncture as the token is required to break out of the resistance of the main channel to sustain within the ascending trend channel. Hence, the upcoming weekend could have a huge impact on the PEPE price, as a rise above $0.00001 could invalidate the bearish thesis. dogwifhat (WIF) The WIF price is trading at $0.8395, facing a 3.15% pullback in the past 24 hours; however, the weekly gains are around 4%. The trading volume has also displayed a notable rise, while the on-chain metrics also signal renewed momentum as the buyers accumulate more than 72 million WIF. Besides, the open interest is also up by 25%, hinting at a bullish bias; meanwhile, the technical indicators suggest mixed sentiments. The WIF price faced rejection from the resistance of the descending expanding channel while facing constant bearish pressure With this, the Gaussian channel has turned bearish, hinting towards a continued descending trend that may drag the levels to the support at $0.78 On the other hand, the MACD displays a drop in the buying pressure while the levels are heading for a bearish crossover The current trade setup suggests bears gaining dominance that could further drag the levels lower, followed by a bullish rebound that may breach the resistance and enter the resistance zone between $1.04 and $1.1.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,TRADING|BONK|WIF|PEPE|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-05 12:00:40

Hyperliquid Meta Trader Gives Ethereum Price Prediction As Prices Tumble,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/long-or-short-hyperliquid-meta-trader-gives-ethereum-price-prediction-as-prices-tumble/,"Ethereum’s (ETH) price prediction has become a hot topic as the market struggles to interpret mixed signals from on-chain metrics and ETF flows. Despite a flood of bullish developments in June, the token still ended the month with a 1.5% loss. Traders now question if the rally is merely delayed or altogether derailed. Meanwhile, lesser-known tokens like Remittix are quietly drawing attention for their real-world payment use cases. Hyperliquid: Cooling Momentum After a Massive Rally Hyperliquid (HYPE) soared in recent weeks but now faces a key test near the $41.55 resistance. The level aligns with a Golden Pocket Fibonacci retracement and prior price ceilings, suggesting a potential reversal zone. Technical analysts believe HYPE may have completed its impulsive rally and could now enter an ABC correction phase . Once that is seen, a pullback to the price of 26.53 can be expected, which is a strong support area. Still, the correction appears healthy and orderly, with no signs of panic selling. Unless bulls reclaim $41.55 with volume, sideways movement or a dip remains the probable path. Yet, this zone may offer a fresh entry point for traders looking to accumulate. Source: Tradingview Ethereum: Bullish Tailwinds Struggle to Lift Price Ethereum’s June metrics looked promising on paper. US spot ETFs recorded their second-best month since launch, pulling in over $1.1 billion in net inflows. Accumulation addresses, wallets that have never sold ETH, saw their highest monthly increase in history, signaling long-term holder conviction. Large companies such as SharpLink Gaming and Bit Digital bought ETH and added it to their treasuries, and staking reached an all-time high of 35.52 million ETH. However, in spite of it, ETH could not record a positive trend, being trapped between the levels of $2,300 and $2,500. Traders attribute the underperformance to global market jitters, political tensions and whale offloading. One whale recently pulled 95.3K ETH from staking, sending over 68K ETH to exchanges, a potential precursor to sell pressure. Source: Tradingview Remittix: The Utility Token Turning Heads While ETH struggles for momentum, Remittix (RTX) is emerging as a stealth contender in the utility token space. Its crypto-to-fiat bridge lets users send tokens like ETH or USDC directly to bank accounts in minutes, a real breakthrough in payments. Take Paulo, a gig worker in Brazil. Instead of losing 6–8% using traditional exchanges to off-ramp earnings, he uses Remittix to receive reais straight into his bank at just 1% cost. With upwards of $15.8 million already raised and RTX trading at $0.0811, its upside potential remains massive. Backers believe Remittix could follow, or even exceed, early-stage Ripple’s trajectory. With the $190T payments market ripe for disruption, RTX may be one of the most overlooked opportunities of 2025. What Traders Are Betting on Next Ethereum’s long-term fundamentals are strong, but short-term price action remains underwhelming. Hyperliquid’s chart setup suggests a pause, not a crash. Meanwhile, real-world use cases like those offered by Remittix are capturing investor imagination.

The victim, a pharmacy manager, alleges that the lost Bitcoin, now worth roughly $1.8 million, was stolen after a cellphone store employee gave her personal information to a hacker. The victim, Raelene Vandenbosch sued Rogers Communications and Match Transact Inc. in three provinces, alleging that the loss she suffered from the SIM swap scam was the fault of an employee of a phone kiosk owned by Match. Now, the Supreme Court in British Columbia (B.C.) has ruled that the issue be resolved in private arbitration, outside a courtroom. Canadian woman loses BTC in SIM swap scam According to a court filing submitted by the Canadian, she approached Rogers about the situation when she first discovered it. The Canadian woman said she was offered a refund on one month’s service, worth about $95. Vandenbosch then filed lawsuits in Ontario, Quebec, and B.C. to recoup more. Vandenbosch said the funds were stolen after a hacker pretending to be a technician from Rogers convinced a Match-owned mobile store employee in Montreal to share their computer screen. The Canadian native said the action allowed the hacker to gain access to her account information, even though she was in B.C. at the time. The hacker then proceeded to download all her account information onto a SIM card that was in their possession. After the deed, the hacker then allegedly hijacked her account, locking her out and stealing her Bitcoin in the process. Vandenbosch is suing for negligence, breach of privacy, and breach of contract. The Canadian is also seeking restoration of the amount that the Bitcoin was at the time of the theft and other damages and admission of guilt. In response, Rogers and Match have filed a response in court, with none of them admitting or denying the allegations. Instead, they have argued that they could resolve the issue through arbitration rather than in a courtroom. Vandenbosch also signed an arbitration agreement with Rogers as part of her cellphone plan. In a ruling by the B.C. Supreme Court Justice Anita Chan, the case is expected to go to arbitration, except for the part seeking a public admission of wrongdoing, which the judge has ruled can proceed because it is in the public interest. The judge did not rule on the facts of the case in her decision. The result could mean that if Vandenbosch continues to pursue the suit and either company is forced to admit fault, then she does not get paid back for the lost BTC. A spokesperson representing Rogers has defended the company and its security record. The spokesperson also highlighted the risk associated with digital assets. “As fraudsters use constantly evolving techniques to try and take advantage of consumers across the wireless industry, we continually strengthen our security measures to protect our customers against fraudulent activity,” the spokesperson said. Vandenbosch contends arbitration ruling In her initial filing, the Canadian said that the hacker allegedly gained access to her crypto accounts on Ledger and Shake Pay, stealing over 12 BTC, worth around $534,000 at the time. The stolen Bitcoin is now worth over $1.8 million as of today’s price. She is accusing Match of negligence and breach of privacy for failing to protect her personal information. She also claims Rogers failed to protect her privacy by allowing kiosk workers access to too much personal information and failing to mandate verification questions. Meanwhile, the Canadian native has argued that she should not be required to go through arbitration because of the amendments made by the B.C. government to the Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act in March. The government amended the legislation to bar cell phone companies from imposing these agreements on customers, arguing that forced arbitration hurts users. Vandenbosch said that these new laws should be retroactively applied to her case, but Justice Chan disagreed, saying the rules are not meant to be retroactive. “The prohibition came into force on Royal Assent of Bill 4 on March 31, 2025, and applies to new disputes that are launched after the date of Royal Assent,” a spokesperson from the B.C. Ministry of Attorney General said. “This means if a supplier had a pre-existing contract with an arbitration clause, the parties are no longer bound to arbitrate if they were not already in arbitration at the time.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The US House of Representatives passed the bill symbolically on the 4th of July, following an earlier nod by the Senate. Initially, there was significant opposition to the bill, including some staunch resistance within the President’s Republican party; however, it may be precisely what crypto users need in times of regulatory uncertainty. What is Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill? The main focus of the major legislation is on three of Trump’s key policy positions: tax cuts for companies, reduced regulations, and enhanced border control. While these three issues received major mention in the bill, some crypto-friendly Acts managed to pass through as part of the package, with strong bipartisan support. This level of cross-aisle support demonstrates just how popular cryptocurrency is among the American public. They include the Genius Act and the Clarity Act, both of which address the regulatory climate of the USA. The Genius Act sets clear rules regarding the circulation of stablecoins in the country while being open to innovative ideas coming from the sector, Hines stated . The Clarity Act, on the other hand, aims to address the major legal conundrum faced by cryptocurrencies, not just in the USA but worldwide. According to the White House advisor, this legislation draws a clear line between a digital commodity and a digital security, paving the way for crypto innovation without legal complications in the USA. Hines further states that the “Big, Beautiful Bill” will make the country a global leader in crypto innovation and adoption. He gave the President high praise and noted that it was a significant milestone for the country. Will Trump’s Bill Kickstart a New Crypto Revolution in the USA? Pro-crypto legislation and crypto-friendly policies were a major part of Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. It was in complete contrast to his opponent Kamala Harris, who failed to capitalize on the pro-crypto entirely. The Clarity Act and the Genius Act are likely to significantly support the cause of digital currencies in the country if implemented in full spirit. Trump is likely to claim that a significant portion of his promise to implement crypto reforms has been fulfilled.

This optimism is due to advanced institutional interest and on-chain metrics reflecting whale accumulation. The current bullish sentiment has boosted market-wide sentiment, and analysts are eyeing a breakout towards $3,500 in the short term. BlackRock Buys, Whale Wallets Expand According to CryptoGoos, BlackRock reportedly bought $100 million worth of Ethereum in the past 7 days, which clearly shows aggressive purchases by the world’s largest asset manager. This signals renewed institutional conviction in ETH’s future. BREAKING: BLACKROCK BOUGHT $100,000,000 WORTH OF $ETH THIS WEEK.

Also, as of early July, these addresses continue to rise, suggesting a consistent rise in confidence. Record Shorts Could Trigger a Squeeze Interestingly, while accumulation surges, speculators on CME have built one of the largest short ETH futures positions in history, according to Barchart . This extreme bearish positioning has caught the attention of analysts who are now raising odds of a possible short squeeze scenario.

Technically, Ethereum has been stuck in a sideways “box range” for weeks, but momentum is shifting. According to Mister Crypto, ETH recently performed a liquidity sweep below the box range, often a precursor to a breakout in the opposite direction. He believes a breakout from the upper box border near $2,500 could launch ETH toward $3,500 in the short term. The bottom is in. $ETH is about to explode! pic.twitter.com/HIzPJKnhCN — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) July 5, 2025 This sentiment is echoed by Ted Pillows, who notes Ethereum is “flipping $2,500 resistance into support.” Marcus Corvinus takes it further, setting sights beyond $3,500, should the $2,500 mark hold. Combined with BlackRock’s recent buy and whale wallet growth, these chart signals are gaining credibility.

BlackRock is a significant holder of Ethereum. As of early July 2025, reports indicate BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) holds around 1.57 million ETH, valued at over $3.85 billion, representing a substantial portion of the total ETH ETF market. The recent $100 million purchase (or specifically, $85.4 million on July 3) is part of their aggressive accumulation strategy, reflecting growing institutional confidence and a strategic pivot towards Ethereum. Is BlackRock’s involvement a definitive sign of institutional adoption, or could it be a short-term move? BlackRock’s substantial and continuous accumulation of Ethereum, following their success with Bitcoin ETFs, is widely seen as a definitive sign of increasing institutional adoption. While some short-term tactical trades may occur, their overall strategy, characterized by low fees and consistent inflows into their ETF products, points to a long-term commitment to integrating digital assets into traditional finance, legitimizing crypto investments for a broader institutional audience.",Price Analysis|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-05 12:19:39

The initiative of the executive power in Moscow comes amid an ongoing crackdown on miners working outside the law in Russian regions, often powering their crypto farms with stolen electricity. Russia registers mining hardware to track down rogue miners Russia’s Ministry of Energy, the Federal Tax Service (FNS) and the Ministry of Digital Development have compiled a register of devices used for cryptocurrency mining, RIA Novosti reported , quoting Deputy Energy Minister Petr Konyushenko. The gathered information has already been shared with authorities in the Russian regions witnessing increased miner activity, the government official revealed in an interview with the leading news agency, elaborating: “The creation of such a register will allow us to accurately identify consumers using electricity for mining needs. This is necessary in order to apply special regulation and taxation to those.” Konyushenko described the move as a step towards legalizing the whole industry while reducing the illegal consumption of electricity, which has been blamed for losses for the power distribution companies and the state as well as energy deficits in parts of the country. The energy ministry pitched the idea to establish a unified register of mining equipment during a working meeting on the regulation of digital currency extraction in February. The proposal was also backed by the Russian Ministry of Industry in May. Russia legalized cryptocurrency mining with a law adopted in the summer of 2024. It allows both companies and individual entrepreneurs to legally mint digital coins in the Russian Federation, provided they register with the tax authority and pay due taxes. Private citizens are allowed to mine without registration as long as their electricity consumption does not exceed a limit set by the government, which is currently 6,000 kWh a month. However, all miners, including the latter, are obliged to inform the FNS about the amount and the value of the mined cryptocurrency. Moscow cracks down on illegal crypto farms amid mining ban Russia, which has established itself as a major player in the global Bitcoin mining market over the past few years, has been struggling to bring its miners out of the shadows ever since it legalized the industry last year. Less than a third of all Russian mining enterprises have so far registered with the FNS and the new register of mining machines aims to increase the share of legal mining businesses. Other Russian authorities have also joined the hunt for underground miners. In June, the national grid operator Rosseti announced it’s developing a mechanism to pinpoint illegal mining facilities by tracking internet traffic with the help of telecom companies and mobile operators. To limit the negative consequences of the mining boom, which has caused electricity shortages, the Russian government has also imposed seasonal and permanent restrictions on the activity in parts of the vast country. Mining has been completely banned for six years in a dozen regions. This week, President Vladimir Putin justified the measures with the need to balance the exploitation of Russia’s natural resources. At a forum devoted to discussing development initiatives, Putin said that governors have been complaining about growing energy deficits and admitted: “We were forced to make certain decisions in the mining sphere.” Meanwhile, Russian law enforcement and other officials have been cracking down on mining facilities illegally tapped into electricity networks in energy-deficient regions. Last month, the authorities in Krasnoyarsk Krai, a major mining hotspot in Siberia, busted a massive crypto farm occupying almost 30,000 square meters of land, officially registered as a non-residential building on an industrial plot.

As of early July, the flagship cryptocurrency has maintained its movements around $108,000 – $110,000 region. While Bitcoin still retains its bullish market structure, recent on-chain data calls for a level of caution when investors are looking for opportunities in the market. Bitcoin Sentiment Recovers From Bearish In a July 4 post on the social media platform X, crypto analytics firm Alphractal revealed that the Bitcoin investor sentiment is “very bullish.” This on-chain observation is based on the Alpha Crypto Sentiment Gauge metric. Related Reading: XRP’s 30% Jump To $2.8: Analyst Says This ‘Classic Confirmation’ Must Happen First As its name suggests, the indicator evaluates the emotions of investors in the market, ranging from extreme fear to euphoria. These emotions are represented as color-coded interpretations, usually in red, yellow, light green, and dark green, and these further represent investor sentiment ranging from bearish to very bullish. In the chart shared by Alphractal above, the appearance of a dark green colour signals that the market sentiment is “very bullish” at the moment. Prior to their July 4 post, Alphractal reported in a June 23 post that the market sentiment was flashing bearish signals. In the post on X, the analytics firm warned that the bears could be in trouble. Interestingly, the bears were indeed in trouble, as Bitcoin picked up more buying momentum, consequently liquidating several bearish positions. However, Alphractal explained that sighting green does not necessarily mean the market may be at a top. Instead, it signals that euphoria is taking over the market, which, according to the analytics firm, unlocks a wave of opportunities for Bitcoin buyers. Alphractal said: On the other hand, red zones are usually short-lived, but offer exceptional buy opportunities — like no other indicator can. As the market displayed, the bearish signal interpreted from the Sentiment Gauge eventually provided more buying opportunities. Growing market euphoria is not the only meaning that can be derived from a green signal in the market. It could also serve as a warning for potential overconfidence in the market as Bitcoin continues to gain value. If history is anything to go by, the market could experience rapid price expansions and an increase in investor risk-on approach. On the other hand, the “very bullish” sentiment could also precede sharp corrections, especially if fueled by crowd emotion, rather than market fundamentals. Whether this green sentiment signals the next price leg up, or the establishment of a market top is yet to be known — as a result, traders are advised to remain alert. Bitcoin Price At A Glance After its early show of strength on Thursday, Bitcoin has lost nearly 2% of its value in the past 24 hours. As of this writing, the premier cryptocurrency is valued at about $107,754.

After the last few weeks of consolidation, the crypto market is showing that it could roar back to life. This can be seen in the price of Bitcoin (BTC), which appears to have stabilized at around $105,000. To take full advantage of the expected rally, investors are shifting attention back to presales. However, this rally will not be like the previous one. In the past, the crypto market has seen a surge in meme coins, which often run out of steam a few days after they launch. The investors’ focus this season is firmly on utility-driven projects that show signals of massive gains. A good example of these is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which has increasingly become the focus of crypto market analysts. So far, the project is halfway through its presale, which presents the perfect opportunity to secure your MUTM tokens and wait for launch day. The MUTM token presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised an impressive $11.7 million in the ongoing presale from around 12,700 unique buyers. Tokens in this presale are currently going for $0.03 in the current phase 5 of the presale. In the next phase 6, the token price will go up by 16.67%, significantly undercutting the current 50% discount that is currently available to buyers. If you would like to benefit from this massive discount, the steps for participating in the presale are quite simple. All you need is a wallet containing one of the accepted crypto coins, and you connect it to the presale dashboard. From there, you can purchase as many tokens as you want and wait for the price to increase. As extra motivation, the project’s team has established a $100,000 giveaway . In this giveaway, ten lucky winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. To be eligible for this massive giveaway, you only have to invest a minimum of $50 in the current presale. The massive discount, coupled with the opportunity to win $10,000, makes MUTM tokens a must-have in your crypto portfolio. Protocol design Mutuum Finance is a DeFi lending protocol where users can participate as lenders or borrowers. The lenders deposit their assets into the protocol’s liquidity pools to receive interest. Borrowers deposit their collateral into the pools to access the liquidity. To ensure long-term stability, the protocol allows users to participate as liquidators. These liquidators purchase the debt at a discount when the collateralization falls outside the safe parameters. 42x forecast for MUTM tokens According to analysts, the price of MUTM tokens could rise by as much as 42x when they go live. This forecast is based on various factors that we will discuss below. Based on this forecast, a $1800 investment in the presale today could grow to over $75,000. However, since the presale does not have any upper limits on purchases, this return could be much bigger depending on how much you choose to invest. One reason why analysts are so optimistic about the price of the tokens is the overall design of the project. Mutuum Finance plans to use protocol revenue to purchase MUTM tokens on secondary exchanges. These purchases will contribute to massive buying pressure on the tokens, leading to the price surge. The project is CertiK audited, which means that participants in the presale are assured of the safety of their purchase. So far, Mutuum Finance has received a Token Scan Score of 95. These CertiK audit results have continued to be a source of trust for the project, and this is expected to continue after they launch. It will attract new buyers to MUTM tokens, which will ensure sustained price increases. Mutuum Finance CertiK partnership Mutuum Finance is working in partnership with CertiK on a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program that will be used to ensure the safety of users on the protocol. The program will offer rewards to security experts who help identify vulnerabilities. To receive the rewards, security experts will need to present accurate and actionable bug reports to the project’s team. The rewards in the program are split into four tiers, which are critical, major, minor, and low. Depending on the type of bug that security experts uncover, they will receive a corresponding reward. The program’s design ensures that security experts will focus their efforts on major issues that could destabilize the ecosystem. This program will also ensure that Mutuum Finance develops lasting ties in the global security community, which will have immense long-term benefits for its user base. MUTM tokens could be your biggest gainer this year So far, over 60% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 have been sold, barely a month after they launched. At this rate, the tokens are expected to sell out before the end of this month. If you act now, you have a chance to get MUTM tokens at a massive discount of 50% on the final listing price of $0.06. Do not let this massive opportunity slip away from you.

47538847,https://zycrypto.com/?p=108192,1751720215,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Senator Lummis Introduces New Crypto Tax Bill With a $300 Tax-Free Threshold,https://zycrypto.com/senator-lummis-introduces-new-crypto-tax-bill-with-a-300-tax-free-threshold/,"Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced a crypto tax bill that exempts capital gains of $300 or less and has a $5,000 annual exemption cap. The US Senator has introduced the bill to address what she believes is the unfair treatment of crypto traders. Lummis said that her tax bill will allow US citizens to engage with the crypto economy without inadvertently accruing a tax bill. Lummis justifies the viability of her bill by stating that the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates it will generate $600 million by 2035. This is a significant step for the crypto community, which has faced uncertainty and regulatory hurdles for quite some time now, and would like to embrace financial innovations without having to deal with draconian tax requirements. “This groundbreaking legislation”, said Senator Lummis, “is fully paid-for, cuts through the bureaucratic red tape, and establishes common-sense rules that reflect how digital technologies function in the real world. We cannot allow our archaic tax policies to stifle American innovation, and my legislation ensures Americans can participate in the digital economy without inadvertent tax violations”. The Lummis Crypto Tax Bill would adhere to the current agenda made popular under President Trump, introducing commonsense tax legislation that allows American businesses to thrive in a competitive global market. Lummis has introduced a practical tax-free threshold for digital asset transactions that fall below $300, with an annual limit of $5,000 in transactions. In many countries, cryptocurrencies are not considered currencies, despite clear indications, including their name, as to the true intention of their creator. There remains considerable uncertainty regarding crypto regulation, particularly with respect to tax requirements. Senator Lummis’s bill, therefore, could be a very big breakthrough for crypto traders across the globe. With Lummis’ crypto tax, a person could buy a coffee without having to pay capital gains. It should be a matter of common sense that a person using cryptocurrencies to buy a coffee is not engaging in a serious investment, but is instead treating their cryptocurrency as a currency. The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that Lummis’s bill would generate $600 million through 2034, a figure that Senator Lummis likes to remind people about. Lummis stresses that the bill reflects how cryptocurrencies are used in the real world. She has described her bill as a commonsense approach. The current government in the US has been focused on cutting red tape and creating regulation that seeks to deregulate the market. Lummis, therefore, is creating timely legislation that may have a good chance of succeeding. The implications for American crypto traders would be immense and would certainly lift a weight of uncertainty from their shoulders. Lummis is concerned that inadvertent tax penalties would discourage Americans from embracing technological innovation. Senator Lummis is a Republican politician from Wyoming. She could very well succeed in passing the bill due to the substantial magnitude of the tax exemption. America could very well become a crypto superpower if the industry is given appropriate tax incentives. Senator Lummis believes this is the case and stresses the need to provide Americans with commonsense tax requirements. Lummis has frequently been an outspoken advocate for Bitcoin and other digital assets. She believes that draconian tax requirements are preventing people from experimenting with cryptocurrencies.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana, Cardano, and XYZ draw investor focus — will they lead crypto gains in the next two months of market momentum? As the upcoming two months approach, attention turns to leading cryptocurrencies such as Solana, Cardano, and XYZ. Could these prominent coins see significant gains in the next market phase? This article explores their potential for growth, analyzing key factors and market trends that might influence their ascent in the near future.

XYZVerse has launched into the memecoin market at a pivotal moment, with community-driven tokens consistently leading speculative trading. The remarkable success of memecoins such as PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk demonstrates the power of robust branding, viral marketing, and strong community involvement in achieving substantial gains. The overall market sentiment will be crucial to XYZVerse’s prospects. With the altcoin season on the horizon, lower-cap memecoins are attracting significant investor attention. As XYZVerse is currently in presale, it stands to benefit from this trend, provided it secures key exchange listings and sustains community enthusiasm after its launch. Price prediction for XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 – $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 – $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) XYZVerse taps market momentum with tokenomics, branding muscle XYZVerse is emerging as a serious contender in the memecoin sector, propelled by a mix of strategic branding, aggressive tokenomics, and bullish price projections that are drawing investor attention. The project has secured visibility through partnerships with influencers and the sports industry, amplifying its appeal across broader demographics beyond the typical crypto-native crowd. At the core of its economic model is a deflationary mechanism, with 17.13% of tokens set to be burned, reducing supply pressure and aligning with a scarcity-driven value thesis. Liquidity provisions account for 15% of the token distribution, a move the team says will help dampen volatility and support post-launch stability. Meanwhile, 10% is allocated to community incentives, a critical lever in driving user retention, fostering engagement, and strengthening loyalty during the early growth phase. Can XYZ skyrocket by 3000%? XYZVerse possesses the foundational elements for a powerful debut. However, its enduring triumph hinges on effective implementation. Should the team successfully deliver impactful marketing, secure prominent exchange listings, and foster authentic community involvement, the ambitious target of exceeding $0.10, representing approximately a 3000% increase from its current valuation, could become a reality. Solana Solana’s price has shown movement over the past week, rising by 6.51%. However, over the past month, it has decreased by 2.46%, and in the last six months, it has fallen by 29.86%. Currently, SOL is trading between $137.88 and $161.77. The nearest resistance level is at $170.18, while the nearest support is at $122.4. If the price breaks above the resistance, it could aim for the second resistance at $194.07. Conversely, if it falls below the support, it might test the second support at $98.51. The Simple Moving Averages show the 10-day SMA at $154.82 and the 100-day SMA at $151.49. Technical indicators like the RSI at 49.07 and the Stochastic at 50.11 suggest that SOL is in a neutral zone. The MACD level of 1.07 indicates mild bullish momentum. Based on this data, SOL’s price might consolidate or potentially move upward. Traders may watch for a rise of around 5% to reach the nearest resistance or a drop of about 10% to hit the nearest support. Cardano Cardano (ADA) is currently trading between $0.54 and $0.60. In the past week, it has gained 5.47%. This rise comes after a 13.21% drop over the last month and a significant 45.09% decrease in the past six months. The recent uptick suggests that ADA might be starting to reverse its downward trend. Technical indicators support this potential shift. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 60.21, indicating bullish momentum. The 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is $0.60, which is above the 100-day SMA of $0.57. This crossover points to possible short-term growth. The MACD level is positive at 0.008885, further hinting at upward movement. If ADA breaks above the nearest resistance level at $0.63, it could aim for the next resistance at $0.70. This would be an increase of around 17%. On the downside, if it falls below the support level at $0.50, it might test the second support at $0.44, a potential decline of about 12%. Traders are watching these levels closely as they could determine ADA’s next direction. Conclusion In the next 60 days, SOL and ADA may see significant gains, while XYZVerse aims to unite sports fans and meme culture for potentially substantial growth.

In a new video update, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 170,000 YouTube subscribers that based on historical precedent, the top crypto asset by market cap appears ready to skyrocket. According to Van de Poppe, BTC is flashing signs of an upcoming rally fueled by exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows. “We are currently consolidating around $100,000 only because we have a new group of participants being into the space due to the ETFs, which if that amount of money is pushing Bitcoin to $100,000, then we are I think underestimating the impact of the actual bull run to be happening and how high Bitcoin can go.” The trader goes on to say that BTC is essentially repeating the same pattern it did during its last few cycles, which this time around would see it rally to a price tag of $250,000, noting that he believes the crypto king would be $50,000 currently if it weren’t for the ETFs. “It’s remarkable and it’s comparable with the previous cycles but just at a different stage and we just need to move upwards with our expectations given that the ETF has been bringing Bitcoin towards higher valuations and I think if we didn’t have the ETF we would have been swimming around $50,000 and then it follows us with the M2 supply chart… which basically tells us that Bitcoin is going to follow that. And if Bitcoin is going to follow through with that, we are about to see Bitcoin move to $160,000- $180,000 in the next three months. And what we also know is that the second half of the year is usually the best period for crypto, if the next quarter after that is going to take place as well, it is very, very likely that Bitcoin is going to reach a number of $250,000 or potentially even higher.” BTC ETFs launched in January 2024 and have a total combined market cap of $138.5 billion at time of writing, according to data from Coinglass. BTC is trading for $107,627 at time of writing, a 1.9% decrease during the last 24 hours.

The coins, acquired initially when BTC traded below $1, were transferred on July 4 in two significant transactions, raising fears of a potential dump amid near-record prices. This was the largest shift of dormant Bitcoin in over a decade.

Traders feared that such a massive stash entering circulation could spark a correction. In response, long positions were unwound, shorts piled in around the $110,000 resistance level, and price slipped nearly 2% within hours.

Long-Term Outlook Buoyed by Liquidity Forecasts While short-term sentiment faltered, longer-term bulls found encouragement in macro commentary from Sui Group Chief Economist Hong Hao. Speaking to Phoenix Finance, Hong projected that Bitcoin could hit fresh all-time highs by late 2025, driven by strong global liquidity and dovish monetary policies. Hong emphasised that Bitcoin remains highly responsive to changes in liquidity, and with central banks likely to loosen financial conditions into 2025, risk assets like BTC stand to benefit. He also pointed to improving sentiment in U.S. equities, suggesting broader risk-on appetite could return. For now, analysts say this dual narrative—short-term caution vs. long-term optimism—will likely keep BTC consolidating as markets digest the implications of dormant coin activity. #Bitcoin $BTC is consolidating near $108K after rejecting $110,400 resistance.

A bearish divergence in the MACD histogram hints at weakening upside momentum. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Unless BTC breaks below $107,325, the structure remains intact. A bounce from the current zone could reignite trade momentum. Trade Setup : Entry Zone: $107,800–$108,100 (watch for bullish engulfing) Upside Targets: $109,307 and $110,413 Stop-Loss: Below $107,200 to reduce risk MACD Signal: Bearish crossover; wait for confirmation For a Bitcoin price prediction , the next 48 hours will be crucial, as a break below the trendline support would invalidate the uptrend. However, if the $108K level holds, this remains a classic “buy-the-dip” scenario in a structurally bullish setup. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Surges Past $1.92M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has surpassed $1.90 million in its public presale, with $1,927,122 raised out of a $2,373,526 target. The token is priced at $0.012125, with the next price tier expected within hours. Designed to merge Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s speed, Bitcoin Hyper enables fast, low-cost smart contracts, dApps, and meme coin creation, all with seamless BTC bridging. The project is audited by Consult and engineered for scalability, trust, and simplicity. The golden cross of meme appeal and real utility has made Bitcoin Hyper a Layer 2 contender to watch in 2025.

Key Takeaways: Glassnode’s James Check warns the Bitcoin treasury strategy may have limited upside left. Early movers like Michael Saylor’s Strategy are well-positioned. However, new treasury firms could struggle to differentiate and sustain premiums. “My instinct is the Bitcoin treasury strategy has a far shorter lifespan than most expect,” Check said in an X post on Friday , cautioning that many recent firms jumping into Bitcoin reserves could struggle to sustain interest or justify premiums. “For many new entrants, it could already be over,” he added. Early Bitcoin Treasuries Thrive as Newcomers Face Uphill Battle Check argued that while early adopters like Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which holds nearly 600,000 BTC, have cemented their lead, new treasury firms face a steeper climb. “Nobody wants the 50th Treasury company,” he noted, warning that investors increasingly expect clear differentiation rather than another firm adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet. “I think we’re already close to the ‘show me’ phase, where it will be increasingly difficult for random company X to sustain a premium and get off the ground without a serious niche,” Check said. My instinct is the Bitcoin treasury strategy has a far shorter lifespan than most expect, and for many new entrants, it could already be over. It's not about a measuring contest. It's about how serious & sustainable your product & Strategy is to sustain the accumulation. — _Checkmate (@_Checkmatey_) July 4, 2025 Despite Bitcoin’s recent rally to within 4% of its all-time high, Check suggested the growing number of Bitcoin treasury firms risks saturating the market. Data from BitcoinTreasuries shows at least 21 new entities added BTC holdings in the past month alone. Check highlighted that speculative retail investors may flock to these newcomers, but stressed they don’t “have infinite money” to support dozens of copycats chasing the same strategy. He noted that larger, well-established firms like Strategy have more time to prove their thesis compared to latecomers. Echoing his concerns, Taproot Wizards co-founder Udi Wizardheimer said many startups entering the Bitcoin treasury space appear to be motivated by short-term profits rather than long-term conviction. “Many of the folks raising just see easy money and have no idea what they’re doing,” Wizardheimer argued. He added that weaker players may eventually be acquired at a discount by stronger firms, though he believes the trend could still see “a few more legs.” Nobody wants the 50th Treasury company. I think we're already close to the 'show me' phase, where it will be increasingly difficult for random company x to sustain a premium and get off the ground without a serious niche. Retail speculators buy startup TCos, and they don't have… — _Checkmate (@_Checkmatey_) July 4, 2025 Doubts Grow Over Long-Term Viability of Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Skepticism around the sustainability of the Bitcoin treasury trend is growing. Breed, a venture capital firm, warned in a June 29 report that only a few Bitcoin treasury companies are likely to survive long term without falling into a “death spiral” as their stock prices converge with the value of their BTC holdings. The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms. Sigel singled out the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, arguing that these can become dilutive if a company’s stock price nears its Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Meanwhile, New York law firm Pomerantz LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Michael Saylor’s Strategy, accusing the Bitcoin-focused firm of misleading investors about the profitability and risks of its crypto investment strategy.

47539361,https://timestabloid.com/?p=73457,1751720832,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Ripple (XRP) vs SEC Case As of July 5, 2025",https://timestabloid.com/ripple-xrp-vs-sec-case-as-of-july-5-2025/,"Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel has clarified that Judge Analisa Torres has no further role in the ongoing lawsuit between the Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple. In a series of comments posted on X, Fagel addressed misconceptions within the XRP community about the current procedural status of the case and explained what remains to be decided. Fagel stated that Judge Torres’s earlier ruling against Ripple remains effective and does not require additional action from her once the parties withdraw their respective appeals. He wrote, “The parties can drop their appeals, at which time her order against Ripple takes effect. Judge Torres has no further role in this.” His remarks follow Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s announcement that the company intends to dismiss its appeal. However, Fagel noted that, as of now, no formal filing to dismiss has been recorded in the court docket. Expanding on the issue, Fagel argued that despite public statements from Ripple’s leadership, the appeal dismissal has yet to be formally filed by either side. He said neither party has officially taken that procedural step, but added that it is likely they will. “Neither party has filed to dismiss their appeals… but once they do (and they pretty obviously will), the district court’s ruling against Ripple goes into effect. There is nothing further for Judge Torres to sign off on,” he explained . His comments directly address ongoing debates in the XRP community about whether Judge Torres is still actively involved in the case. No. The parties can drop their appeals, at which time her order against Ripple takes effect. Judge Torres has no further role in this. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) July 4, 2025 SEC Meeting Unlikely to Affect Ripple Case In addition to clarifying the judge’s role, Fagel commented on the significance of the SEC’s private meeting held on July 3. Speculation within the XRP community suggested that the meeting might result in an immediate settlement or another significant decision in the Ripple matter. Fagel disagreed with these interpretations, describing the meeting as part of the agency’s routine weekly schedule. Responding to speculation, Fagel wrote , “Very, very unlikely. The meeting agenda was set well before the district court ruled against vacating the injunction. It typically takes several weeks for a matter to get on the SEC agenda for a vote. Is it possible? Sure, anything’s possible. But would be very unusual.” His view suggests that any resolution to the appeal or settlement process is not directly linked to this meeting and is unlikely to be concluded quickly. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Timing of Appeal Dismissals and Settlement Fagel also addressed the timeline for the final resolution of the case. He pointed out that although both parties will probably withdraw the appeal, the process may still take weeks or even longer, depending on how quickly the SEC moves. While acknowledging the possibility of an expedited process, he cautioned that the SEC’s internal procedures are rarely immediate. He commented , “The SEC approval process doesn’t happen overnight. It typically takes several weeks (or even months). It might be expedited, since they’ve already voted once before to dismiss the appeal.” His remarks underscore that although a settlement appears likely, procedural realities mean it could take additional time to be finalized. Fagel’s analysis has provided a clearer understanding of how the case is likely to proceed. Judge Torres’ previous ruling against Ripple will remain in place once both sides formally dismiss their appeals, but no further judicial action is required from her. The July 3 SEC meeting does not appear to be directly relevant to the Ripple lawsuit, and while a settlement remains probable, it is unlikely to occur immediately. Fagel’s comments serve as a reminder that the case’s resolution depends on procedural filings and internal SEC processes, which tend to move at a deliberate pace even when the outcome seems assured.

In 2028, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $10,005 and $11,875, with an average expected price of $10,291 In 2031, ETH could trade between $45,481 and $53,844 with an average price of $46,769. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps using blockchain technology without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps traders trade Ethereum more easily So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2025 through 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Token ETH Price $2,522 Market Cap $304.51B Trading Volume (24h) $14.61B Circulating Supply 120.71M ETH All-time High $4,891.70 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time Low $0.4209 on Oct 21, 2015 24-hour High $2,556.90 24-hour Low $2,475.75 Ethereum price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Volatility $ 2,751.39 (8.96%) 50-day SMA $ 2,556.42 200-day SMA $ 2,338.57 Sentiment Neutral Fear and Greed Index 67 (Greed) Green days 14/30 (47%) 14-day RSI 51.28 Ethereum price analysis ETHUSD 1-day chart ETHUSD chart by TradingView Based on the 1-day chart for Ethereum (ETH) on July 5, the price is currently trading within a consolidation zone, supported near the middle Bollinger Band at approximately $2,459 and facing resistance near $2,632. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 52.33, indicating mild bullish momentum but without a strong overbought signal. Price action remains largely sideways, suggesting indecision among traders. A breakout above the upper Bollinger Band could signal a bullish continuation, especially if accompanied by strong volume. Conversely, a break below $2,450 could open the door to a retest of the lower Bollinger Band near $2,286. Overall, ETH remains range-bound with a neutral-to-bullish bias. ETHUSD 4-hour chart analysis ETHUSD chart by TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart for Ethereum (ETH), the price appears to be consolidating within a narrow range near the upper Bollinger Band, around $2,524.20. The MACD is showing signs of weakening bullish momentum, with the MACD line approaching a potential bearish crossover. Additionally, the Balance of Power (BoP) is slightly positive, suggesting buyers maintain a modest edge. The Bollinger Bands are relatively tight, indicating low volatility, which could precede a breakout. However, without a decisive move above $2,637 or below $2,445, ETH may remain range-bound. Traders should watch for volume spikes and MACD confirmation for directional cues. Ethereum technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $ 2,295.90 BUY SMA 5 $ 2,429.26 BUY SMA 10 $ 2,442.39 BUY SMA 21 $ 2,465.51 BUY SMA 50 $ 2,556.42 SELL SMA 100 $ 2,220.52 BUY SMA 200 $ 2,338.57 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $ 2,478.81 SELL EMA 5 $ 2,427.39 BUY EMA 10 $ 2,268.68 BUY EMA 21 $ 2,114.52 BUY EMA 50 $ 2,158.92 BUY EMA 100 $ 2,403.06 BUY EMA 200 $ 2,645.91 SELL What can you expect from the ETH price analysis next? Based on both the 4-hour and 1-day charts for Ethereum (ETH), the market is exhibiting signs of short-term consolidation with mid-term indecision. On the 4-hour chart, ETH is trading near the upper Bollinger Band but lacks strong bullish momentum, with a flat MACD and modest Balance of Power, indicating limited buying strength. On the 1-day chart, the price remains trapped between $2,459 and $2,632, reflecting resistance overhead and support just below. The RSI hovers near the neutral zone, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. Unless ETH breaks above $2,637 or below $2,286, price action may stay sideways with mild volatility. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. What is a realistic price for Ethereum in 2025? The realistic price for Ethereum in 2025 is around $5,209 at the maximum. What will 1 Ethereum be worth in 2030? One Ethereum is expected to be worth $37,590, maximum in 2030. How high can ETH realistically go? Ethereum’s price potential depends on multiple factors, including market trends, institutional adoption, network upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Realistically, ETH could reach $5,000 to $7,000 in the next bullish cycle if demand increases and Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements boost adoption. If institutional interest strengthens, ETH may push past $10,000 over the long term, especially if Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. However, volatility remains a key risk, with price corrections likely along the way. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) efficiency could also positively influence its long-term valuation. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2027, with its potential low starting at $10,003 and a high of $11,875. Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to surpass the $25,000 level by 2029 and reach a potential high of $25,413. This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, so long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum will likely reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $53,844 in 2031. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $56,126 mark by 2031, so holding it longer can be beneficial. Recent news/ opinion on Ethereum At ETHGlobal, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin emphasized the urgent need for privacy solutions, urging developers to focus on four critical areas: private money, identity, voting, and messaging. He framed privacy as a civilizational priority, particularly for decentralized applications encouraging the ecosystem to build tools that safeguard individual autonomy in an increasingly digital world. ""On a civilizational level, there's quite alot of urgency in us figuring out privacy."" @VitalikButerin urges builders at ETHGlobal to focus on 4 key categories of privacy apps to help solve for this: 1) private money 2) private identity 3) private voting 4) private messaging pic.twitter.com/1x49zNiVZm — ETHGlobal (@ETHGlobal) May 30, 2025 Ethereum price prediction July 2025 In July 2025, Ethereum is projected to reach a minimum price of $3,772, an average price of $4,125, and a maximum price of $4,243 Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) July 2025 $3,772 $4,125 $4,243 Ethereum price forecast 2025 Changes within Ethereum itself and the larger market will affect its path in 2025. Vitalik Buterin’s RISC-V project could make Ethereum’s infrastructure stronger, which could bring in more developers and make it easier to scale. If Ethereum can successfully roll out protocol upgrades and more people start using Layer 2, momentum could return. Market rules, business integration, and trends in the crypto industry will also be very important. While positive predictions say prices could reach $6,000, bearish conditions could bring ETH down to $4,578.

47539919,https://timestabloid.com/?p=73455,1751721355,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst to XRP Holders: XRP Mega Breakout Incoming,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-xrp-mega-breakout-incoming/,"In a recent post that has stirred excitement across the crypto community, STEPH IS CRYPTO, a prominent analyst on X, issued a bold proclamation: a “mega breakout” is incoming for XRP. With XRP trading just above $2.20, mounting technical signals and broader market dynamics are aligning to suggest a major move could be imminent. Technical Compression Suggests Imminent Explosion Steph’s analysis centers around a well-defined descending triangle pattern on XRP’s 3-day chart, stretching back to January 2025. This formation, known for forecasting volatile breakouts once price compresses into a tight range, has seen XRP repeatedly test support above $2.00 while facing resistance around $2.33. According to Steph, the key signal to watch is a daily close above $2.33. If confirmed, it could trigger a sustained rally that breaks the current consolidation. Volume indicators support this view. Declining volume within the triangle suggests market indecision, but historically, this leads to explosive price action once momentum returns. #XRP MEGA breakout incoming! pic.twitter.com/ZTHaEXGgd4 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 5, 2025 Projected Price Targets: From $5 to Over $30 Using Fibonacci extensions drawn from XRP’s 2024 low to its January 2025 high, Steph outlined a series of ambitious but technically grounded price targets. The first leg, projected at $5.38, represents the 0.618 Fibonacci extension, a common target in early bullish waves. If momentum accelerates, further price levels at $11.31, $23.78, and even $37.63 come into view. Steph has consistently maintained that these projections are not short-term predictions, but part of a broader multi-leg breakout that could unfold over weeks or months. Patience, he notes, is essential. Monthly Chart Breakout on the Horizon The long-term setup also strengthens the bullish narrative. On the monthly chart, XRP appears to be forming a symmetrical triangle , with an apex estimated between early July and mid-September. This coincides with the timing window Steph referenced in previous updates. The importance of this setup cannot be overstated, historically, symmetrical triangles on higher time frames tend to precede prolonged directional moves. Key resistance zones sit between $2.40 and $2.69, which coincide with the 100-day and 200-day simple moving averages. A clean breakout above this region could see XRP reclaim $3.00 quickly, setting the stage for a move toward its all-time high of $3.40. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Market and Regulatory Tailwinds Outside of technicals, broader market dynamics may serve as catalysts. Regulatory clarity is improving, especially following Ripple’s legal progress in its battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Combined with the increasing adoption of RLUSD and Ripple’s U.S. bank charter application, institutional sentiment around XRP appears to be turning positive. Steph and other analysts also point to the current macro cycle in crypto. With Bitcoin recently breaking new highs and altcoins starting to rotate into the spotlight, XRP’s timing for a breakout could hardly be better. Caution Still Warranted Despite the optimistic outlook, risks remain. There is a notable liquidity block around $2.00, representing a large sell wall. If price rejects from resistance and breaks below support zones like $2.06 or $1.95, the bullish setup could be invalidated or delayed. Traders and investors should watch these levels closely. A Moment of Truth for XRP With converging technical signals, supportive market sentiment, and macro tailwinds, XRP appears primed for what STEPH IS CRYPTO calls a “mega breakout.” The $2.33 level is the line in the sand, clear it, and XRP could be on a fast track to its most significant rally since 2017. For holders, the next few weeks may prove pivotal. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The token in question is the native token of Four, formerly known as BNX and now operating as a memecoin startup. Known for its previous manipulative moves, this new move by BNX could herald a new wave of manipulation in the market. On the other hand, another development that attracted attention during the same period was a whale that was constantly losing in high leverage positions. Despite experiencing partial liquidation in the last 10 transactions, this investor opened short positions again with a leverage of 40x for BTC and 25x for ETH. The investor, who has lost a total of $16 million so far, has a loss of $14 million in this transaction.

Here’s What That Could Mean By January 2026,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/buying-neo-pepe-coin-today-heres-what-that-could-mean-by-january-2026,"Fresh Surge in Meme Coins Sends Signals Across Crypto Markets Crypto analysts and influencers alike are drawing bold lines between past meme coin cycles and the emerging signals playing out in real time. July's digital asset markets are delivering curious echoes of 2021—with meme coins once again stealing bandwidth from more traditional altcoins. While large-cap players like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) consolidate within tight trading ranges, token chatter is rapidly converging around newer, community-fueled entrants. Among these, Pepe Coin (PEPE) has continued to deliver unexpected strength after its May retracement, and some market watchers believe it’s flashing signs of an accumulation phase. Notably, social analytics platform LunarCrush reported that PEPE’s social volume jumped 27% this week, while its engagement rate outpaced SHIB, BONK, and FLOKI combined. Whale interest is not just returning—it appears to be recalibrating. Influencers like Cobie and Ansem have recently highlighted the shift. Cobie noted in a recent livestream that the “memecoin window hasn’t closed—only narrowed.” Meanwhile, decentralized exchange aggregator Matcha recorded an uptick in swap volume for tokens under $0.01—another clear signal that retail is sniffing out asymmetric bets ahead of what some are calling a Q4 “memebull.” Trading Desks Rotate Into Cheaper Social Coins With Narrative Hooks With much of the top-tier altcoin sector either stagnant or suffering drawdowns, smaller meme projects are absorbing that liquidity. Analysts at Kaiko and Messari have pointed to the rotation pattern where traders, especially retail-led Telegram and Discord groups, are deploying capital into coins under a penny that carry strong branding, heavy community involvement, and thematic resonance. One striking development was the listing of FARTCOIN on BitMart earlier this week, triggering a 46% intraday spike in volume. The listing, while humorous, reinforces the thesis that social virality and timing now outweigh technical fundamentals in many corners of crypto. It also suggests that centralized exchanges are once again leaning into meme narratives to boost user engagement amid trading volume slumps. Interestingly, the most consistently mentioned meme coin in Telegram alpha chats isn't even listed yet. It’s tied to a presale—and that brings us to what could be one of the most discussed pre-market entrants this year. Top 5 Meme Coins to Watch in 2025 Neo Pepe Coin (NEOP) – Emerging as a serious contender in the meme coin arena, Neo Pepe blends cultural symbolism with robust tokenomics and a community-run DAO model. With a 16-stage presale, hourly unlock mechanics, and a 2.5% auto-liquidity burn system, $NEOP is more than hype—it's a movement against centralized market saturation. Its Certik-audited smart contracts and governance-first structure place it at the forefront of this next meme cycle. Pepe Coin (PEPE) – The original frog meme token remains a core player due to its first-mover advantage and strong meme identity. Having reached all-time highs during 2023, PEPE continues to post significant volume across decentralized exchanges and maintains a loyal social following. Shiba Inu (SHIB) – Still one of the most recognizable names in meme crypto, SHIB's broad ecosystem, including Shibarium and ShibaSwap, gives it an edge beyond memes. Its large holder base and upcoming technical developments keep it in the spotlight. Bonk (BONK) – Born on Solana, BONK represents a newer generation of fast-moving meme coins backed by a vibrant community and minimal fees. It thrives on Solana's high-speed infrastructure and remains a favorite on-chain meme asset with developer engagement. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) – While it started as satire, FARTCOIN’s recent BitMart listing and volume spike prove the power of internet culture. Its irreverent branding has garnered a cult following, and its rising chart is forcing analysts to take it seriously, albeit cautiously. Matrix Gets a Meme Makeover With Emerging Symbol of Decentralization You might want to get a little Pepe. But let's be clear, a little -Neo- Pepe. Neo Pepe Coin ($NEOP) is marching toward the fourth stage of its 16-tier presale, with its current price hovering around $0.07. Once the current tranche sells out, the token price will jump to $0.08—continuing its carefully architected path to $0.16 by the presale's end. This isn’t just price gimmickry. The presale format is deeply tied to Neo Pepe 's core narrative: that decentralization should reward urgency, not whales. Unlike most meme coin launches, which often unleash their full supply into the market in a single breath, Neo Pepe’s tokenomics introduce hourly post-launch unlocks. This dynamic ensures stability and reduces the risk of sharp dumps. Meanwhile, every $NEOP transaction on Uniswap includes a 2.5% auto-liquidity fee—permanently burned LP tokens lock value, reinforcing price strength over time. Community Calls Shots in a Movement Built for Control & Clarity Neo Pepe’s design is more than marketing theatre. The protocol is governed by the NEOPGovernor contract, enabling true DAO-based governance. Holders can propose new actions, vote on treasury disbursements, and even decide which exchanges $NEOP lists on first. With 45% of the total 1B token supply dedicated to presale buyers, the early community is positioned to hold both influence and liquidity. The governance system includes a 1-day proposal delay, 7-day voting window, and a final timelock before execution. No central party has override capabilities—decisions must pass quorum and follow process. Treasury activity is governed in similar fashion, with funds used for marketing, liquidity, burns, or grants only through approved proposals. Adding credibility to the system, Neo Pepe underwent a Certik Audit and scored a 71.96—a respectable mark considering the project’s focus on immutable contracts and permanent liquidity. The full audit details can be viewed here.

Investors are particularly excited about a potential surge for SOL due to ETF optimism, while XRP could experience substantial gains. Delve into what’s driving these market movements and discover key insights on the future of these prominent cryptocurrencies. Solana Price Analysis: From Long-Term Drops to Key Short-Term Levels Solana recorded a one-week gain of 3.47% amid a month decline of 4.06% and a half-year drop of 31.18%. The price action shows mixed performance, with short-term recovery contrasting longer-term weakness. Recent gains suggest a slight lift in sentiment, but the broader trend remains bearish. Price fluctuations indicate a market in transition, with upward momentum alternating with sustained declines. Overall, Solana is still struggling to overcome longer-term downtrends. The current price moves between $131 and $173, nearing support at $107.88 and resistance at $191.77. The market shows no clear dominant trend, as bulls and bears are evenly matched, with an RSI around 47.76. Price action indicates a cautious trading approach. Traders might look to enter near support, targeting $191.77 while keeping an eye on $233.72. A breach below support could increase selling pressure, with the next support at $65.92. The momentum indicator at 3.46 and an Awesome Oscillator above one hint at modest strength, but confirmation is essential. XRP Market Snapshot: Modest Momentum Amid Mixed Trends XRP experienced modest price gains over the past week, with a weekly change of approximately 3.76%. In the last month, the coin has shifted nearly 1%, and its performance over the past six months has declined about 7.5%. During these periods, the price ranged between $1.99 and $2.41, indicating mixed trends with small upward movements amid long-term weakness. Although recent activity has provided some short-term support, the overall half-year trend remains negative, reflecting cautious profit-taking and a lack of broader momentum. Price volatility has been moderate, as the coin tested recent highs while feeling the effects of longer-term bearish pressure. Current price action shows XRP trading within a narrow range between $1.99 and $2.41, with key support levels near $1.73 and stronger backup around $1.31. Resistance appears around $2.59 and $3.02. The relative strength index is close to 52, indicating no clear dominance by bulls or bears. There is no definitive long-term trend; technical indicators like momentum and the awesome oscillator suggest a neutral stance. Traders might consider buying on dips near lower support while looking to sell or reduce exposure as the price nears resistance levels. A break beyond these ranges could present additional trade opportunities. Conclusion SOL has the potential to rise from the $150-$160 range due to enthusiasm around ETFs. XRP could see a significant increase to $5-$10. These price movements highlight growing confidence and investor interest in both assets.

A jury in California has found the tech giant must pay damages for transferring data from idle Android smartphones without permission, reports Reuters. Google says it will appeal the decision, which the lawsuit claimed triggered “mandatory and unavoidable burdens shouldered by Android device users for Google’s benefit.” The jury found the data transfers violated California’s privacy laws, and the money will be handed exclusively to users in the state. According to the lawsuit, which was initiated in 2019, the company used customers’ cellular data to transfer information that was used for things like targeted advertising. In court, Google argued that the transfers were fully legal and covered by the company’s privacy policies and terms of service, and no users were harmed in any way. After the verdict was announced, Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said the jury’s decision “misunderstands services that are critical to the security, performance, and reliability of Android devices.” Google is also facing a lawsuit on the transfers that represent customers in the rest of the country, which is set to start in the first half of next year.

Insider Credentials Sold for $2,700 According to Brazilian newspaper São Paulo, the attack began when a C&M employee exchanged their login credentials for approximately $2,700. The credentials granted the attackers entry into the systems of C&M, which link the Central Bank with domestic banks. The hackers targeted six institutions and withdrew cash from reserve accounts. One C&M employee suspected of making the breach possible through selling their access credentials has been detained by Brazilian police. $30M–$40M Cleaned via Crypto Blockchain analyst ZachXBT reported that the hackers instantly moved $30 million to $40 million to Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and USDt (USDT). Those assets were cleaned via Latin American crypto exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) desks. The use of crypto for laundering is pointing towards increasing overlap among traditional finance systems and blockchain-based technologies in cybercrime operations. Centralized Systems Susceptible to AI-Era Threats The breach is a wake-up call to growing fear surrounding centralized software networks . Professionals say such networks are vulnerable to insider threats, ransomware, and exploits — particularly in a world where AI tools can be leveraged by cybercriminals to help them identify and breach such networks. Shielded Technologies CEO Eran Barak explained that hackers view centralized platforms as “massive ROI targets” due to the quantity of sensitive data and money that they hold. Decentralization as a Defense Barak demonstrated that decentralized blockchain systems, such as those utilizing zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), provide a less appealing target in that the hackers would need to break individual wallets rather than a central database. “If you can only access one account at a time, the payoff isn’t worth the risk,” Barak said.",Blockchain|Sticky|Web3,EN,0,0,FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|BTC|ETH,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-07-05 13:32:05

To this end, cryptocurrency trading expert Ali Martinez has identified the $2.38 mark as the key barrier preventing XRP from a major breakout, according to a July 4 post on X. Martinez arrived at this target by analyzing XRP’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) chart, which shows $2.38 as the highest concentration of previously transacted XRP, representing over 2.75 billion tokens, or 4.33% of the total supply. XRP URPD chart. Source: Glassnode The URPD metric, which tracks the price levels where tokens were last moved, indicates strong resistance at $2.38, as many holders may look to sell or break even at that point. However, the analyst believes a decisive break above $2.38 could “trigger a major move” by clearing both psychological and technical resistance levels. Such a breakout would invalidate significant overhead supply and potentially usher in renewed bullish momentum. Martinez also noted strong support between $0.50 and $1.80, particularly below the $1 level. Still, the key challenge remains the $2.38 zone, which has remained untested since XRP’s all-time highs. XRP price in consolidation Meanwhile, analyst CrediBULL Crypto emphasized XRP’s potential for a breakout in a July 5 X post. He pointed out that XRP is entering its eighth consecutive month of consolidation above its previous all-time high monthly close, an important technical milestone. This sustained price action above a former resistance-turned-support area signals growing strength and maturity. Aside from being one of the only coins in this entire market with the clearest/cleanest impulsive PA (aside from $BTC ) starting at it's launch off of .50, $XRP is currently going on it's EIGHTH month of consolidation above the prior ATH monthly close. You 👏 Are 👏 Not 👏… https://t.co/sM4zJgK378 pic.twitter.com/EucpQZVaLF — CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) July 5, 2025 The analyst added that the ongoing consolidation, following a sharp breakout, suggests XRP may be preparing for another strong upward move. If confirmed, it could mark a new bullish impulse, further cementing XRP’s status as one of the most technically resilient digital assets.

The entrepreneur’s crypto ventures suffered as a result. He runs educational platforms, and his YouTube channel has roughly 40,000 subscribers. The incident left the family deeply traumatized, which reportedly forced them to relocate. Backstory Of The Kidnapping Stéphane himself has described the incident on his profile on the X platform, with the story also being covered on a local news outlet. Early in the morning of December 20th, Winkel alerted the local authorities that his wife had been abducted and taken hostage right in front of their home in Forest. The police chased the perpetrators’ van and managed to stop them by taking the van used for the offence off the road, near Bruges. Apart from the prison sentences, the court also ordered the offenders to pay at least 1 million euros ($1.2 million) in damages to the affected party. The court has also stated that the original masterminds of the plot remain at large while denying the defendants’ claims that they were coerced with death threats to carry out the kidnapping. According to the original report on the incident, a minor was also involved, but this matter is being handled separately by a juvenile court. Despite the distressing experience, Winkel remains devoted to his followers and will continue to create content, but with a more cautious approach: “No more contests or wallet demonstrations, instead focusing on education, simplification, and market analysis. I will share my experience to help others avoid such situations.” A Worrying Trend Unfortunately, this is yet another example of increasingly aggressive kidnappings, or attempts at such, of prominent figures in the crypto space around the world, who maintain public profiles. As CryptoPotato reported earlier this year, a kidnapping attempt of a crypto exec was thwarted as he and his wife fought off the assailants who tried to abduct their child and young grandson. The BBC also posted a story about a cryptocurrency millionaire’s father, who was captured and held for a 5-7 million euro ($5.8M-$8.2M) ransom, and was later rescued, albeit missing a finger. A high-profile kidnapping also took place in January, where the Ledger co-founder, David Balland, and his wife were rescued after being taken hostage from their home. They were demanded to pay a 10-million euro ($11.7M) ransom.

For context, Binance Coin (BNB) soared from $13.28 in January 2020 to $686.31 in May 2021, a 5,068% gain in 16 months. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) mirrors BNB’s early potential with its structured presale and utility-focused ecosystem.

The center is supported by a HK$3 billion (~$380 million) subsidy program to boost AI development in the region. According to reports, the scheme has seen about 20 applications, with 10 projects already approved. One of the projects, the Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Centre, created a multilingual transcription system and an application that looks just like ChatGPT, used by over 70% of government departments. There are also plans to build another supercomputing facility in Sandy Ridge, Northern Metropolis, to expand resources for AI startups. Cyberport presently hosts over 400 AI companies, with about 120 joining last year. The facility plays host to firms like iFlyTek, Inspur Cloud, and Baidu Apollo. Hong Kong’s utilization rate reflects China’s national AI push The 90% utilization rate of the Hong Kong AI supercomputing facility has shown a stronger demand in the broader national context of AI development. China has positioned itself as a global AI economy, snatching the second spot, just behind the United States. The Chinese government has also had multiple national plans since 2016 to prioritize AI infrastructure and funding. The move also aligns with the city’s target of achieving 15,000 petaflops of computing power by 2030, with 3,000 petaflops from the AI supercomputing center by early 2026, showing its alignment with the artificial intelligence goals of mainland China. This push also comes amid the intensifying race between China and the United States for the lead in terms of tech. To aid its push, Hong Kong has pushed about HK$2.83 billion into semiconductor research to develop technologies that are not heavily restricted by US export controls. The rapid adoption of the supercomputing center reflects Hong Kong’s role in China’s technological self-sufficiency push. The utilization rate also shows how much computing power has become important for AI development. Hong Kong’s HK$3 billion subsidy scheme directly addresses the need for local firms to access high-performance computing for developing advanced AI models. The region has also been focusing on computing resources as a part of its coordinated approach, making a HK$1 billion investment in the AI Research and Development Institute and funding for semiconductor technology. China to receive a boost in the global tech race The approach also follows the same pattern adopted in mainland China , where the government has invested more than $1 billion in domestic AI ventures, recognizing that computational resources are the foundation for innovation. The model of subsidizing 70% of computing costs also shows that governments view AI infrastructure as an important public tool that requires public investment to remain in the competitive sector. Hong Kong is also positioned as a connector between Chinese AI capabilities and international markets. It also aids Hong Kong’s strength in finance and healthcare while addressing the challenges in the local AI industry, including talent shortages similar to that of mainland China, where there are only 39,000 AI researchers compared to the United States which has 78,000. It is creating an identity as an AI hub that connects the technological ambitions of China with the rest of the global community.

The CMB is Turkey’s financial regulator and will start legal proceedings against the various crypto services. Turkey has recently taken steps to reduce unauthorized services being offered to Turkish citizens. PancakeSwap is one of the most successful Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), alongside Uniswap and Curve. PancakeSwap had more than $325 billion in trading volume in June. It’s unclear at this stage why Turkish officials deemed the websites to be unauthorized, but the CMB would likely prefer that crypto services be appropriately registered. PancakeSwap is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) on the Binance Chain. Turkey’s Capital Markets Board (CMB) blocked the DEX as part of a campaign to block unauthorised crypto projects. Turkey is intensifying its efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency industry. This is the first time Turkey has blocked a DEX. Governments around the world are seeking ways to regulate cryptocurrency as the relatively new technology becomes increasingly mainstream. One key area of concern is the phenomenon of ‘pig butchering’, where wealthy crypto holders are swindled out of their holdings with scams. Governments worldwide are deeply concerned about this trend. Turkey may be reducing its reliance on technologies that scammers could exploit. Turkey has emerged as a significant growth market for cryptocurrencies, with a notable increase in crypto trading from 25.1% in 2023 to 27% in 2024. However, this extra amount of trading has attracted the attention of Turkish regulators. Turkish crypto traders have been taking a keen interest in long-term investments and crypto use cases that promote financial inclusivity. Turkish authorities, however, are concerned about the price volatility of digital assets and illicit activities on the blockchain. They have tackled this problem by setting new standards for the crypto industry, including Know Your Customer (KYC) and licensing requirements. It is very possible that PancakeSwap was shut down due to not having the appropriate licenses to operate in the country. Yet PancakeSwap is a DEX, which means that it does not operate like a traditional finance business. The Capital Markets Board (CMB), the primary regulatory body in Turkey, has taken charge of the situation, outlining a new cryptocurrency agenda for 2025. The CMB now has full authority to regulate crypto service providers. First, the CMB identifies a crypto service provider, and then it regulates the service provider. This is what most likely happened with PancakeSwap, despite being a DEX, which was identified by Turkish officials as a crypto service provider. The CMB has been relentless in its efforts to tackle crypto crimes, making it mandatory to conduct identification checks for crypto transactions exceeding $425. Crypto transactions will further require a 20-letter note appended to the blockchain, ensuring a clear paper trail for all cryptocurrency activities. Crypto payments have been banned since 2021. Many countries around the world have adopted a heavy-handed approach to crypto trading. Turkey may very well be one of those countries. According to Turkish officials, a Crypto Service Provider must develop internal risk management strategies and have procedures in place to address money laundering on their platform. This includes reporting any suspicious activities to the appropriate authorities. Failure to report suspicious activities may prompt an external review by government officials. The Turkish government has established multiple threshold limits to prevent money laundering within the country, including a daily limit of $ 3,000 and a monthly limit of $50,000. Such measures would make it difficult for money launderers to conduct their business with ease. Crypto Service Providers that don’t abide by the rules may see their licenses revoked. The Turkish government is also trying to tackle illegal gambling, which has become a difficult business to cut back on.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|Turkey,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-07-05 13:48:01

The press release shared with Cryptonews notes that Modhaus’s fan engagement platform Cosmo will launch on Abstract. With this, the partners aim to bridge global entertainment and blockchain, they said. Cosmo is a platform that enables millions of fans to collect digital collectibles and voting tokens, which they can use to vote on specific decisions. They can also collect digital photocards and complete interactive quests. According to Michael Lee, Abstract co-founder and CEO, “Cosmo is exactly what Abstract was built for—a space where fans don’t just watch, they vote, collect, and move in sync with their favorite artists.” Moreover, moving to Abstract will provide Cosmo and its users with faster performance and scalable infrastructure, the teams claim. Also, they gain simpler onboarding via an email, Touch ID, or Face ID. “Fans will gain all the benefits of blockchain without ever needing to understand it,” the announcement says, as well as “deeper integration into a growing ecosystem of culturally relevant, consumer-first applications.” According to Modhaus CEO Jaden Jeong, “fans deserve a real seat at the table—not just as viewers, but as participants in the creative process.” The partnership with Abstract, he continues, will enable Modhaus to create an immersive and democratic standard for artist-fan interaction “without forcing fans to navigate the complexities of blockchain technology.” You may also like: K-pop Agency Modhaus Announces $8 Million Series A Investment A South Korean blockchain-based K-pop startup has raised $8 million in its series A funding round.Modhaus announced in a statement today that the series A funding round has pushed their total fundraising to $12 million overall.

Meanwhile, launched in 2021, Modhaus is a South Korean entertainment company behind K-pop groups tripleS , ARTMS , and idntt . The company raised $8 million in a series A funding round in late 2023, resulting in a total of $12 million. The team argues that “fans should hold more power over the production of their favorite artists.” It adds that “Modhaus will expand the role of fans from mere consumers to decision-making producers.” Cosmo has so far seen 266,000 users, 9 million photocards minted, and 1.5 million monthly transactions. Source: Modhaus Moreover, the partnership between these two companies comes as the multi-billion global K-pop fandom market continues to surge, powered by digitally native users. When it comes to Modhaus’s groups specifically, tripleS has recorded 3.4 million followers and won Best New Female Artist at the major award show, the 2023 MAMA Awards. Furthermore, ARTMS hit #1 on Billboard’s Top New Artist Albums, seeing over 24 million streams on Spotify.

In light of this, a leading crypto analyst warns that current price action lacks the strength needed for a powerful upward move, urging traders to remain cautious. The analyst notes that without a clear breakout signal, entering the market now could expose investors to potential downside risks. $2,800 Breakout Key For Ethereum Price Bull Rally A new analysis released on the X social media platform by market expert Daan Crypto Trades reveals that the Ethereum price has continued to trade within a well-defined price channel, currently holding above the $2,500 level at $2,527. The analyst emphasized that $2,800 remains the key breakout point that could trigger an Ethereum bull rally. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts $10,000 ATH For Ethereum This Cycle, Here’s Why The market expert shared a chart highlighting that ETH remains confined between a “range low” of $2,313 and a high of $2,736, with multiple failed attempts to break out of this tight structure. The chart also shows that the mid-range level of around $2,519 has become a critical point of control. Despite a brief rally that pushed the Ethereum price above $2,570 earlier this week, the cryptocurrency was still unable to sustain the upward move, slipping back below the $2,519 level before recovering to its current price of around $2,527. Daan Crypto Trades explains that the reason for Ethereum’s sluggish performance is its continued struggle to establish a solid footing in the $2,500 price region. Given the clear price imbalance in this zone, the analyst advises traders to exercise caution before entering the market. Within this range, traders may encounter increased price volatility and potential fakeouts, both above and below the key support and resistance levels. Given the unstable market environment, Daan Crypto Trades suggests that until Ethereum breaks and holds above the $2,800 mark, traders are likely to face more sideways action and unpredictable price swings. A clean breakout above $2,800 could be the key to the start of a bullish trend, improving conditions for ETH and pushing it out of its present downtrend. ETH Four-Year Consolidation Sees An End Market expert Mister Crypto has also shared insights on the current Ethereum price action. The analyst declared in a recent X post that ETH is on the verge of exiting a prolonged multi-year consolidation phase. His chart, which visualizes the cryptocurrency’s historical price movements, marks two key periods—a powerful 48x rally from 2018 through 2021, followed by a four-year horizontal consolidation range that spans from the 2021 top to the present day. Related Reading: The Ethereum Waiting Game: Breakout To $2,800 Or Crash To $2,000? The analysis suggests that this extended period of range-bound movement could be a prelude to a potentially explosive bull trend, similar to the breakout seen in the past. In line with this, Mister Crypto marks a large open-ended “??X” label on his chart, suggesting the next breakout phase is imminent—though the precise magnitude is left speculative.

In a Saturday X post , the exchange apologized for its mishap, conceding that its compliance and risk systems still grapple with false positives and operational shortcomings. The exchange, however, claimed it is working to improve its risk control processes promptly. OKX says it performs checks on its employees as well In its X post, OKX also detailed the necessity of its compliance and risk control systems and what they mean for users. It explained that the processes are vital to ensure the platform remains free from illicit use and meets the required compliance laws. The exchange also asserted that it vets its staff and upholds a zero-tolerance stance on misconduct, including spreading disinformation, engaging in insider activities, or undermining user rights. It added that it has several internal monitoring checks to help spot infractions and take action promptly. For its clients, the exchange stated that its systems perform identity verification (KYC checks), monitor transactions, screen against sanctions lists, and detect potential market manipulation. It also incorporates third-party databases with proprietary behavioral models to help identify suspicious or risky accounts. Should an account be verified to have breached legal requirements or user agreements, the exchange responds by issuing notices, requesting additional information, suspending certain features, or closing the account permanently. However, if a user’s account is tied to sanctions or terrorism, the exchange will freeze their assets. OKX acknowledges false positives and asks users not to worry The exchange, however, revealed that its compliance and risk control systems are not 100% accurate, having flagged several normal users as risky. The exchange argued that many service providers typically use an aggressive play in identification checks, driven partly by regulatory guidance recommending prudence in risk oversight. As a result, even fully compliant users with normal activity may occasionally receive additional information requests from the compliance team. The notice also claimed that platforms evaluate customer risk levels on multiple factors. If one’s account is found to be high risk, more investigation into where the funds originate is conducted. The exchange, nevertheless, acknowledged that false positives are an issue in any compliance system. It further commented, “We are continuously improving the user experience for submitting documents after triggering risk controls. If you are asked to provide information such as the source of funds, proof of address, or past employment details, please don’t worry—just submit the information truthfully.” It also assured users that as long as they are not involved in any criminal activity, their account and funds will not be affected, and the platform is still obligated to protect their privacy. One X user, however, accused OKX of maliciously freezing user account funds and excessively collecting user privacy information. He explained that the exchange had asked for more information multiple times and even froze about 10,000 USDT in his account. He claimed he contacted the platform’s customer service and submitted tickets, which led to more inquiries about his work history and residential addresses. From his experience, he concluded that the exchange only wanted to trouble its consumers, saying it should be a wake-up call to everyone. He claimed the exchange starts by asking for additional info and then moves on to ask for more repeatedly before eventually freezing your account and rejecting your application.

Currently in phase 5 of an 11-phase presale, the token trades at $0.03, a 200% jump from its initial $0.01. This decentralized finance (DeFi) project offers a robust lending platform, blending peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer models. Its recent CertiK audit, scoring an impressive 95.00, signals strong security, boosting investor trust. As phase 5 nears 60% completion, the window to buy at this price narrows, promising a 100% return at the $0.06 launch. Let’s explore where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could head by 2026 and beyond. Robust lending redefines DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is transforming the decentralized lending practice through its bi-model. The peer-to-contract takes liquidity pools into account with smart contracts; interest rates will be automatically adjusted relative to market dynamics. This will help the lenders to get consistent returns and at the same time the borrowers get loans in a secure way. Conversely, the peer-to-peer model allows direct negotiations, ideal for volatile assets like meme coins. This flexibility sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart from traditional platforms. Furthermore, the project’s mtTokens, issued when users deposit assets like ETH or DAI, grow in value and enable trading or staking. This utility drives real-world demand in the crypto market, positioning Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a top crypto to buy now. Security and incentives bolster trust Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has finalized a CertiK audit, earning a 95.00 security score with no vulnerabilities found in its smart contracts. No security incidents have occurred in the past 90 days, reinforcing its reliability. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program with CertiK, split across four severity tiers to reward vulnerability discoveries. A $100,000 giveaway also excites investors, offering 10 winners $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. To participate, investors submit a wallet address, complete quests, and invest at least $50 in the presale. Moreover, a dashboard rewards the top 50 holders with bonus tokens, encouraging long-term commitment. These initiatives strengthen Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in the crypto market. Price predictions and AAVE’s historical surge Forecasting Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s price involves analyzing its tokenomics and market trends. With a launch price of $0.06, buying now at $0.03 guarantees a 100% return. Post-launch, experts predict a climb to $3 by 2026, driven by lending utility and buyback mechanisms, yielding a 9,900% ROI from the current price. By 2030, some forecast $30, a 99,900% gain, fueled by stablecoin integration and Layer 2 scaling. For context, AAVE in 2020 traded at $0.50, soaring to $666.86 in May 2021, a 133,272% ROI in under 18 months. While AAVE rode DeFi’s early wave, its growth slowed post-2021. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with stronger fundamentals, could outpace such gains in the evolving crypto market. Consequently, its structured presale and utility make it a top crypto to buy now. Looking ahead Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a promising player in the crypto market, blending innovative lending with robust security. Phase 5, over 60% sold, offers a fleeting chance to buy at $0.03 before the price rises to $0.035 in phase 6. The project’s audited contracts, bug bounty, and $100,000 giveaway enhance its appeal.

According to Conner, the surge in stablecoin volume, strong inflows into spot ETH ETFs, and ETH reserves on centralized exchanges falling to record lows could trigger this explosion. Conner noted that stablecoin transfer volume has increased for 21 consecutive months and that monthly transfer volume is now rivaling Visa’s transaction volume. He argued that this is driving sustained demand for Ethereum block space and creating an on-chain cash engine for ETH. Related News: Sweden's Minister of Justice Makes Critical Statements on Cryptocurrency: Issues New Instructions In June, there was a total net inflow of $1.17 billion into spot Ethereum ETFs. Fund managers expect this figure to multiply several times in the second half of 2025. This indicates that institutional investor interest in Ethereum continues to grow. Conner stated that the total ETH balance on centralized exchanges has decreased to just 9 million ETH. This figure was recorded as the lowest level since 2015. The decreasing supply stands out as a factor supporting upward price pressure. Conner, who stated that Ethereum has been trading sideways in the $2,400-$2,600 range for weeks, said that these periods of low volatility usually result in sudden and sharp movements. According to the analysis, if the ETH price decisively breaks through the $2,600 resistance, the rise could be fast and violent. *This is not investment advice.

Investors Are Hedging With RTX, SUI & KAS",https://coinpedia.org/press-release/is-ethereum-going-to-find-resistance-at-2500-or-are-more-losses-incoming/,"The post Is Ethereum Going To Find Resistance At $2,500 Or Are More Losses Incoming? Investors Are Hedging With RTX, SUI & KAS appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum has shown signs of life, but traders aren’t fully convinced just yet. With $2,500 acting as a stubborn resistance level, investors are watching closely for the next big move. Meanwhile, some are playing it safe by hedging into rising altcoins like Remittix (RTX) , Sui (SUI) and Kaspa (KAS), which offer fresh momentum, real use cases, and a different kind of upside. Ethereum Breaks Above $2,500 and Eyes Key Resistance Ethereum has just pulled off a solid 7.5% daily gain, jumping from $2,380 to around $2,585. This move is reigniting hopes for a bullish reversal. The rally pushed ETH back into familiar territory, setting sights once again on the $2,700 resistance that’s been acting as a gatekeeper for any major breakout. For weeks, Ethereum has danced between $2,400 and $2,800, with sharp drops below $2,550 shaking short-term confidence. Today’s recovery brings fresh optimism, but many investors are no longer going all-in on ETH alone. With market uncertainty still in play, projects like Remittix (RTX), Sui (SUI) and Kaspa (KAS) are drawing attention as hedge plays especially among those who want real-world use cases or exposure to newer tech stacks. Ethereum’s move is strong, but the market isn’t betting blindly anymore. Businesses Adopt RTX While Ethereum Faces Uncertainty While Ethereum struggles to reclaim its highs, Remittix (RTX) is quietly building a reputation as one of the few tokens delivering real-world value. Its crypto-to-fiat system allows cross-border payments to land directly in bank accounts, no banks, no delays, no hidden fees. The current price sits at $0.0811, but with growing adoption across regions like Africa and Southeast Asia, analysts are paying attention. For investors seeking stability beyond ETH’s volatility, RTX offers a refreshing use case and a compelling hedge. SUI Breaks Out and Holds Strong Above the $3 Mark Sui (SUI) is quietly building momentum as traders look for alternatives beyond Ethereum’s choppy range. Now priced at $3.02, SUI has climbed over 13% this past week, breaking out from a clean ascending triangle pattern that’s caught the attention of technical analysts. After bouncing from lows near $2.30, it’s now consolidating in the $2.90–$3.10 zone. With a $10.4 billion market cap and rising interest, Sui is becoming a favored as investors look for newer, high-performance chains with real upside. Investors Hedge With Kaspa While ETH Tests Resistance Kaspa (KAS) is quietly turning heads as a pure proof-of-work alternative in a market dominated by Layer 1 hype and VC-backed chains. Trading at around $0.076 with a $2 billion market cap, it’s not in the top 20 yet. But its GHOSTDAG tech enables one-second block times with fast confirmations, without sacrificing decentralization. No pre-mine, no central team and no venture capital, just organic growth and grassroots support. As Ethereum’s next move remains unclear, some investors are betting on Kaspa as a long-term hedge, particularly with Remittix.

Most of the $255 billion sector is currently concentrated in U.S. dollar-backed tokens, which account for $241 billion of that total, according to RWA.xyz data. Former European Central Bank board member and chair of Société Générale, Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, has said that the imbalance could sideline Europe in the next phase of global finance. Writing in the Financial Times , Bini Smaghi noted that the European Union already has the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) law, which forces issuers to back tokens with cash and high-grade sovereign bonds. The bloc also runs a pilot regime for trading on distributed ledgers. Yet the euro barely features in today’s stablecoin market because banks and policymakers shy away from the new technology, he wrote. Société Générale, it’s worth adding, launched its own e uro-backed stablecoin back in 2023. Last month, it also launched a U.S. dollar-backed one. He says the hesitation risks European monetary sovereignty. If consumers and companies adopt dollar stablecoins for everyday payments and savings, deposits could drain from euro-area banks to US-linked platforms. That shift would erode the ECB’s grip on money flows and blunt its ability to steer rates or calm markets, Bini Smaghi added. He argued that regulators should lean in, not block progress. By sponsoring euro-pegged tokens and coordinating standards, the ECB could modernize cross-border payments and help unify Europe’s capital markets. Should Europe stay on the sidelines, “it will be accepting its marginalization in the future of global finance,” he wrote.",Finance|Europe|Stablecoins|ECB|News,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-05 14:56:17

As summer heats up, Mutuum is quickly emerging as the top token to buy. Phase 5 Presale of Mutuum Finance is over 60% sold out with MUTM priced at $0.03. The presale has raised over $11.7 million and attracted more than 12,700 unique holders. This is the lowest MUTM will ever be priced, with a 16.67% jump scheduled when phase 6 kicks off. While Solana (SOL) continues to hold its ground, much of its explosive early growth has already been priced in. In contrast, Mutuum Finance, still in its presale phase, offers a rare chance to get in early on a potential breakout star. Mutuum Finance Presale Phase 5 Mutuum Finance is gaining momentum in Phase 5 of its presale. The project stands out from others by offering a scalable system of finance with a real-world use case. Investor interest is gaining momentum with the project having raised well over $11.7 million already and having over 12,700 token holders. Mutuum Finance introduces a non-custodial liquidity protocol in which users retain their total ownership of assets. The project features a double-model approach that incorporates Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending to foster increased flexibility and efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system uses smart contracts to deliver automated lending without any human intervention and instead, the smart contracts respond to the market by offering dynamic interest rates. Through the assistance of this auto mechanism, the world of borrowers and lenders becomes stable and predictable. Peer-to-Peer model on the other hand cuts out middlemen and thus offers a direct link between lenders and borrowers. CertiK-Certified, Fully Collateralized Stablecoin, and $50K Bug Bounty A fully collateralized USD-pegged stable coin on the Ethereum chain is also being developed by Mutuum Finance. Top blockchain security company, CertiK, has also audited the smart contracts of the project. Besides making one confident about the integrity and transparency of the code base, the conducted audit shows that the project is serious about the design of a secure DeFi protocol. To pursue this commitment further, the official Bug Bounty Program on the Mutuum Finance, organized together with CertiK, has been deployed, with a 50,000 USDT. The program covers four levels of vulnerabilities including critical, major, minor and low. Mutuum Finance Giveaway Is Live To commemorate its early traction and to give back to the community Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is organizing a huge $100,000 giveaway . 10 winners from the early investors will be chosen to win $10,000 in Mutuum Finance tokens each. Through its unique leaderboard mechanism the top 50 Mutuum Finance holders will be rewarded. As the users climb the ranks they will be rewarded in bonus tokens token holding fun and competitive one. The mechanism drives both excitement and loyalty and bootstraps ecosystem growth in high-gear. As Solana (SOL) matures and its early explosive growth levels off, savvy investors are looking for the next big altcoin poised to deliver outsized returns, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly claiming that spotlight. With over $11.7 million raised, more than 12,700 holders, and a presale that’s over 60% sold out at just $0.03, Mutuum is showing all the signs of a breakout project. Its dual lending model, CertiK-audited smart contracts, and upcoming stablecoin signal real-world utility and long-term vision. Combined with a $100,000 giveaway and a gamified leaderboard rewarding top holders, Mutuum isn’t just building hype, it’s building an ecosystem. Join the presale now and secure your position before prices rise and the next Solana-sized wave begins.

Litecoin (LTC) price action recently pushed past a key level, while a bullish VeChain (VET) price prediction points to a possible rally toward $2. But while these established coins attract attention on charts, BlockDAG is building momentum through fundamentals. With its GLOBAL LAUNCH release offering BDAG at $0.0016 until August 11, confirmed deals with the Seattle Orcas and Seawolves, and over $331 million raised so far, BlockDAG is making a case as one of the best Web3 crypto coins to follow this cycle. VeChain Targets $2 With Bullish Triangle Pattern VeChain has caught the market’s attention following a technical setup highlighted by EGRAG CRYPTO. If VeChain can maintain strength above $0.06, it may trigger a breakout from a symmetrical triangle, setting up a bullish move. The current VeChain (VET) price prediction sees a potential rally toward the $1.80 to $2 range. The outlook gains additional support from investor overlap with communities like XRP, who are showing renewed interest. EGRAG also pointed to a “double tap” on the ascending trendline, which could mean bullish control if the pattern holds. While no timeline is fixed, the projected move could materialize by early 2026. With expanding enterprise adoption, growing interest in smart contracts, and a reliable technical base, VeChain remains a solid contender among the best Web3 crypto coins, especially if the pattern plays out. Litecoin Regains Critical Zone and Strengthens Its Technical Outlook Litecoin has started to gain momentum again after climbing back into the $86–$88 price range, a level that has historically acted as a major turning point. Holding above this zone on the weekly chart could signal a shift toward the $130 mark. The current Litecoin (LTC) price action hints at a potential breakout after an extended consolidation phase. Analysts consider this move important as broader market sentiment stabilizes. On-chain activity is also encouraging, more than 156,000 LTC (worth over $13.5 million) are now locked into the MimbleWimble Extension Block (MWEB), improving privacy and network efficiency. Support from miners and nodes for MWEB exceeds 90%, and future possibilities like smart contract integration via Aztec’s LitVM could make Litecoin more competitive. Together, these developments could elevate Litecoin’s position among the best Web3 crypto coins to monitor in the coming year. BlockDAG Gains Ground With $0.0016 Launch, Real Utility, & Mainstream Reach While Litecoin and VeChain focus on potential technical breakouts, BlockDAG is taking a different approach, by building real traction. Its GLOBAL LAUNCH release has dropped BDAG’s price to $0.0016, significantly lower than its earlier Batch 29 rate of $0.0276. This offer runs through August 11 and has already helped BlockDAG raise more than $331 million during its presale. Beyond price incentives, BlockDAG is expanding its reach through strategic partnerships. The project is now the Official Blockchain Partner of the Seattle Seawolves (Major League Rugby) and Seattle Orcas (Major League Cricket). These collaborations bring blockchain into the sports world with NFT-backed fan tokens, interactive experiences, and exclusive digital content tailored for growing fan communities. By merging crypto with sports engagement, BlockDAG is working to attract everyday users, not just crypto natives. That aligns with the project’s broader vision of real-world adoption and scalable Web3 solutions. Technically, BlockDAG blends blockchain and DAG into one architecture, offering faster transactions, improved scalability, and EVM compatibility. Developers also benefit from its low-code smart contract builder. Its X1 App, already in use by over 2 million users, leverages a Proof-of-Engagement mining model that keeps users active and rewarded. As BlockDAG heads toward listing at $0.05, analysts are suggesting up to 10,000x ROI potential, with BDAG possibly reaching $20 post-launch. Listings on MEXC, LBank, CoinStore, BitMart, and XT.com are already locked in. Concluding Thoughts Both Litecoin (LTC) price action and the current VeChain (VET) price prediction are pointing toward possible bullish runs. Litecoin’s reclaim of a long-term equilibrium zone and VeChain’s potential triangle breakout setup show momentum building for both. Still, BlockDAG is offering more than a strong chart, it’s showing consistent delivery. With $0.0016 GLOBAL LAUNCH release pricing still live, real-world sports partnerships, more than $331 million raised, and over 2 million app users, the project is doing more than waiting for a breakout, it’s creating one. For those looking at the best Web3 crypto coins with both near-term energy and long-term value, BlockDAG appears well-positioned to lead the conversation heading into 2025.

However, the bears had other ideas, and not only forced the price back to the upper trendline, but drove it back inside the flag. Is this just a postponement of the breakout, or could the price be brought lower still? Is $BTC going to break out or not? Source: TradingView The short-term chart for $BTC shows a fakeout of the bull flag. When the price was over $110,000 on Thursday this was probably the last thing that the bulls expected. That said, $BTC was becoming overbought, and once the first breakout confirmation had been made, and the price rolled over again, the bulls suddenly lost their nerve and the price receded back into the bull flag. One further bearish factor that will give the bulls food for thought is that the surge out of the bull flag did not put in a higher high. It got pretty close, but pretty close still isn’t a higher high. On the more positive side of things, the overbought condition for $BTC is resetting as the Stochastic RSI indicators on the 4-hour time frame have now hit the bottom. Having said that, the 8-hour and 12-hour Stochastic RSIs still have a way to go, and might even start turning up before they get to the bottom. $106,000 important level to hold Source: TradingView The daily chart reveals that the price is still above the $106,000 support. This is an important level because it marks the top of some candle bodies from December 2024 through to January 2025. If this level continues to hold, the breakout and fakeout of the bull flag could just be a momentary setback. Weekly close crucial for deciding next week’s price direction Source: TradingView The 4 of July holiday in the United States may have had something to do with the lacklustre trading of $BTC on Friday. Be that as it may, looking at the macro picture, the surge out of the falling wedge pattern has turned into a classic bull flag, and it might be expected that this plays out to the upside, even if it does take a while longer. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators are still sitting on a knife edge. Any positive or negative price action over this weekend could tip the scales in either direction.

ETH Price Analysis",https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-gains-4-this-week-what-are-the-next-targets-eth-price-analysis/,"Ethereum remains range-bound between the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, signalling a consolidation phase. However, a decisive breakout in either direction will likely define the next major trend, with market sentiment leaning toward a potential bullish breakout in the coming days. ETH Price Analysis: Technicals By Shayan The Daily Chart ETH is currently consolidating between the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, entering a decisive phase in its price action. After breaking above the pivotal 200-day MA around $2.5K, an area that has acted as strong resistance in recent weeks, the price has pulled back to retest this level. This pullback is crucial: if bullish demand resurfaces and holds ETH above this moving average, it would likely ignite another leg upward, targeting the $2.8K resistance zone. For now, the cryptocurrency appears to be range-bound between $2.5K and $2.8K, and a clear breakout from this zone will likely set the stage for the next significant trend direction. Market participants are closely watching for a bullish continuation, which could solidify ETH’s reversal structure. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, ETH’s recent rally encountered resistance at a key bearish order block between $2625 and $2670, where sellers re-entered the market. This rejection has pushed the price back toward the $2.5K support level, a historically significant zone for ETH. This area now serves as a crucial battleground. If buyers manage to defend it, Ethereum could regain momentum and reattempt a breakout above the overhead supply. However, failure to hold $2.5K could trigger extended consolidation or even a retracement toward lower supports. Source: TradingView Onchain Analysis By Shayan The funding rate remains a key indicator of market sentiment in Ethereum’s futures market. In a healthy uptrend, this metric typically trends upward, reflecting increasing confidence and positioning from long-biased traders in both spot and perpetual markets. Currently, however, ETH’s funding rates have been declining amid price consolidation between the 100-day and 200-day moving averages. This suggests reduced bullish conviction and signs of buyer exhaustion, raising the likelihood of continued short-term sideways movement. For Ethereum to break above the critical $2.6K and $2.8K resistance zones, stronger demand must flow into the derivatives market, lifting the funding rate to more positive levels. Until that shift materializes, the consolidation phase is likely to persist. Source: CryptoQuant The post Ethereum Gains 4% This Week, What are the Next Targets?

Recession fears ballooned earlier this year when the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow indicator predicted a 1.5% contraction for the first quarter of the year, while the actual fall was softer at 0.5%. Tensions escalated in March as U.S. President Donald Trump announced a series of reciprocal tariffs on what he branded “ Liberation Day ,” rattling investors already wary of a slowing economy. The Fed’s decision to slow the pace of shrinking its balance sheet added fuel to concerns. By April, Wall Street giants like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan were raising red flags. Goldman put recession odds at 45% at the time , and Polymarket odds climbed as high as 66%. Another spike came in May after former U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that Trump’s tariffs could have a “tremendously adverse” effect on the economy. Yet behind the headlines, negotiations with China progressed. The market coined the so-called TACO (Trump Always Chicken Out) trade , referencing the U.S. President’s negotiations pattern, where tariffs are announced but then reversed. Goldman Sachs cut its 12-month recession odds to 30% last month, reflecting a more optimistic outlook as financial conditions eased and trade threats receded. Whether a recession hits in 2025 remains uncertain.

Analysts note that since breaking above the $0.50 level, it has shown one of the strongest and clearest uptrends. Among major cryptocurrencies, only Bitcoin displays a more established and solid market structure. The monthly XRP chart is quietly showing strength. Historically, the $1.90–$2.00 zone has served as a key resistance level. But in 2024, XRP decisively broke above $2 and since then, the price has stabilized and is holding steady above it.

With price holding steady and low volatility, the pressure is building. When assets move like this, major breakouts often follow. According to Elliott Wave theory , XRP is all set to enter a strong upward trend. This means that we could see the price rise through five distinct waves, pushing it beyond $30 by mid-2026. Multiple Drivers Behind XRP’s Growth Analys t Vincent Code also predicts that XRP could hit $30–$50. He cited several reasons for XRP’s rise. RippleNet could capture 20–30% of the $1 trillion cross-border payments market. More than 50 countries may adopt XRP for CBDC bridges. A big crypto bull run in 2026–2027 could spark strong market excitement. Demand for RLUSD is also growing. Further, Ripple’s 2024 agreement with Saudi Arabia’s central bank could pave the way for XRP to be used in oil-related settlements. He also expects that an XRP Spot ETF approval could bring $20–$50 billion in institutional investments. Analyst MelarinX says that XRP is coiling like a spring and quietly building energy before a big breakout. Davinci Jeremie , a Bitcoin proponent has also made a U-turn and predicted that XRP could possibly hit $24 this year.

Russian state media reported on the development. RUBx will have one-to-one backing of Russian Rubles to validate the token. Alexander Nazarov, Deputy General Director for Rostec, stated that the company would maintain a reserve to enable one-to-one backed rubles, allowing users to redeem their tokens. RUBx will operate on the TRON network, backed by Rubles stored in the Russian state treasury, ensuring the stablecoin adheres to local laws and regulations. The code for RUBx will be available on GitHub to enhance the project’s transparency. RUBx will be audited by the firm CertiK as part of the regulatory requirements to ensure the stablecoin adheres to standard practices. Rostec will be the sole issuer of the stablecoin . Rostec stated that the stablecoin has been designed to comply with the Bank of Russia’s requirements, allowing for its integration into the financial system. The stablecoin will be used in conjunction with RT-Pay, allowing clients to utilize RUBx outside of business hours, conduct transactions, and even execute smart contracts. The Bank of Russia specified particular requirements for the stablecoin to prevent money laundering and terror financing. Initially, the stablecoin will be utilized for specific profitable projects, and subsequently, it will be expanded to serve retail consumers and businesses. RT-Pay will connect RUBx to traditional banking services, allowing clients to transfer their stablecoins to external wallets and pay for services and products within Russia. RUBx, therefore, will be connected with the broader crypto ecosystem and will have the ability to interact with smart contracts. The TRON network is a fitting blockchain for this project because it has a stable ecosystem with reportedly high transaction speeds and low costs. Justin Sun, the co-founder of TRON, has recently partnered with USDT Tether to increase the blockchain’s access to the stablecoin market. TRON manages its token, TRX, which has a market capitalization of $26.8 billion and ranks eighth globally in the cryptocurrency world. TRON also allows Tether’s USDT to operate on its ecosystem. TRON has fast speeds and cheap transaction fees. USDT can be transferred on the blockchain for free using the gas-free wallet option. TRON is an interesting cryptocurrency because it features a pricing structure similar to XLM, characterized by low volatility, while hosting USDT in a manner comparable to tokens like Ethereum and Solana.",Cryptocurrency|News|Russia|stablecoin|Tron News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|USDT|FIAT|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-07-05 15:09:47

Cardano and XRP whales are now taking notice, as the project’s PayFi innovation opens up an entirely new world for real-world crypto adoption. What Makes PayFi Stand Out From ADA & XRP Remittix’s PayFi allows crypto holders to move BTC, ETH or XRP to traditional bank accounts in four and a half minutes. That bridge to the physical world is what XRP and Cardano have been reaching for, but Remittix seems to be there first. Cardano is trading at $0.5761, down by 4.12% with volume down by 50.24%. XRP also fell by 2.37% to $2.21, volume down 54.2%. The two cryptocurrencies have long touted mass adoption with seamless payments but now are at risk of being displaced by a leaner and faster model. Remittix, for its part, is already conducting full wallet flight testing and hopes to formally launch in Q3 2025. Why Whales Are Taking Remittix Seriously Whales prefer to track utility not buzz. And Remittix has aplenty. With over 547 million tokens already sold, an active presale at $0.0811 and an active 50% token bonus, large investors are considering gigantic upside potential. The project is seeking an $18M soft cap and having already received $15.9M+, it’s close to reaching that goal in a hurry. But what really makes it stand out is that it doesn’t merely guarantee cross-border payments, it does them. Whereas Cardano’s ongoing-building ecosystem or XRP’s perpetual fight against regulations, Remittix is giving consumers an instant use case anybody can comprehend: send crypto, get fiat. Can Remittix Catch Up with XRP And Cardano? If trends continue the way they are, it might. The demand for fast, efficient and global payment systems is growing rapidly. XRP and ADA helped create the early narrative on crypto utility and Remittix is turning that utility into reality with minimal friction. Remittix’s whitepaper has goals for global expansion and its product is already in functional test stages. That’s greater than several layer-1s or cross-border coins in the same tier. Investors are now wondering: if Remittix can do in one click what XRP and ADA have only dreamed about, why risk being short on the newer project? A Real Chance At The Top 10? Remittix isn’t some pretty-looking site coin. It’s a full payment system with real-world usage. By touching upon the crossroads between crypto and fiat, it’s addressing one of the biggest problems in crypto adoption today. As PayFi continues to gain steam and as whales continue to pour in, Remittix could threaten the very foundations that ADA and XRP were established on. If it continues to gain strength on this trajectory throughout Q3 and onwards, it would not be so surprising for Remittix (RTX) to climb into the top 10 crypto rankings.

In 2029, the coin could be worth between $36.06 and $42.44, an average price of $37.05 In 2031, RPL will range between $74.07 and $89.07. Unlike traditional staking services, Rocket Pool allows users to pool their Ethereum (ETH) to run validator nodes on the Ethereum network. Thus, participants can participate in the staking process without requiring the full 32 ETH to run a validator node. Furthermore, Rocket Pool introduces the concept of “rETH” tokens, which are issued to users who stake ETH in the Rocket Pool network. These rETH tokens represent users’ stake in the pool and can be traded or transferred independently of the underlying ETH, providing liquidity and flexibility to participants. Overall, Rocket Pool aims to democratize Ethereum staking and contribute to the decentralization of the Ethereum network by providing a secure, efficient, and accessible platform for staking participation. As DeFi continues to gain traction, Rocket Pool stands out as a pioneering project at the forefront of innovation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

The price currently trades around $4.81, beneath the midline of the Bollinger Bands, indicating downward pressure. The Bollinger Bands are narrowing, suggesting reduced volatility and the potential for a breakout. RSI stands at 43.64, reflecting weak momentum and signaling that bears may still be in control. The token has struggled to gain traction above $5.18, a key resistance level. Without a decisive break above this threshold, RPL is likely to continue consolidating within the $4.40 to $5.20 range. RPL/USD 4-hour price chart analysis RPLUSD chart by TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart of Rocket Pool (RPL), the asset remains locked in a sideways trend within the $4.67 to $5.00 range, with a slight bearish undertone. The Bollinger Bands are tightening, reflecting low volatility and the possibility of an impending breakout. RPL is currently trading along the lower band, which may hint at a potential short-term bounce, though the absence of strong volume limits confidence. The MACD line sits below the signal line, suggesting weakening momentum, while the Balance of Power at -1.00 indicates bearish dominance. Unless momentum shifts upward, RPL could face continued price stagnation or further downside.

Based on both the 4-hour and 1-day charts, Rocket Pool (RPL) displays sustained bearish sentiment with limited volatility. On the 1-day chart, RPL is trending beneath the 20-day simple moving average, and the RSI hovers below 50, indicating weak buying pressure. Bollinger Bands remain relatively constricted, pointing to a lack of momentum for a breakout. The 4-hour chart reinforces this view, with the MACD remaining in negative territory and the Balance of Power deeply bearish. Unless RPL decisively reclaims the $5.18 resistance level with stronger volume and momentum, it is likely to experience continued sideways consolidation or a gradual decline. Is Rocket Pool a good investment?

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/veteran-trader-to-xrp-holders-you-are-not-bullish-enough-heres-why/,"Veteran crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto has sparked renewed optimism in the XRP community with a bold assertion: “You are not bullish enough.” In a recent post on X, CrediBULL pointed to XRP’s strong and sustained technical positioning as evidence that most traders are drastically underestimating what could be a massive upcoming move. With XRP now entering its eighth consecutive month of consolidation above a key historical level, his statement has struck a chord across the crypto space. A Clean, Impulsive Rally from $0.50 CrediBULL highlights a critical detail that sets XRP apart from nearly every altcoin in the market: its clear and impulsive price action since rebounding from the $0.50 level. In technical terms, an impulsive move is the beginning of a strong bullish trend, often serving as the first leg of a multi-wave rally. According to CrediBULL, XRP and Bitcoin are currently the only major coins exhibiting such clean impulsive structures , a rare and powerful signal in a market often dominated by erratic volatility. Aside from being one of the only coins in this entire market with the clearest/cleanest impulsive PA (aside from $BTC ) starting at it's launch off of .50, $XRP is currently going on it's EIGHTH month of consolidation above the prior ATH monthly close. You Are Not … https://t.co/sM4zJgK378 pic.twitter.com/EucpQZVaLF — CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) July 5, 2025 Since breaking above $0.50, XRP has demonstrated disciplined, wave-based movements that suggest accumulation rather than speculation. This behavior is not just bullish, it’s foundational. It means smart money could be quietly positioning ahead of a major breakout that retail investors have yet to fully price in. Consolidating Above a Major Historical Benchmark Perhaps even more telling than its wave structure is XRP’s current location on the chart. The asset has now spent eight months consolidating above its previous all-time high (ATH) monthly close, a level that capped XRP’s price in the 2017 bull run and again during much of the 2020–2021 cycle. In the world of technical analysis, this kind of sustained price action above a former ATH monthly close is highly significant. It signals that the market has re-evaluated the asset, converting long-standing resistance into solid support. For XRP, which has faced regulatory pressure and years of suppressed price action, this prolonged consolidation suggests a coiled spring preparing for release. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why Traders Are Still Underestimating XRP Despite all of this, sentiment around XRP remains curiously subdued. Many traders remain skeptical, possibly due to the coin’s long and frustrating legal battle with the SEC. But with that case moving close to fresolution, the fundamental picture for XRP has never been clearer. CrediBULL argues that this sentiment lag is precisely what makes the current setup so powerful. While most of the market looks elsewhere, XRP has quietly built a base above a critical level, supported by a clean price structure and strengthening fundamentals, including Ripple’s expanding global reach, the integration of RLUSD, and regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions. Final Thoughts CrediBULL Crypto’s message is clear: XRP holders may be significantly underestimating what lies ahead. With technicals, sentiment, and fundamentals aligning, XRP is positioned for a potential breakout of historic proportions. For those still sitting on the sidelines or doubting the setup, the veteran trader’s warning couldn’t be more timely, this may be the calm before an explosive storm.

Experts Recommend These Cheap Altcoins for New Investors,https://bitzo.com/2025/07/looking-for-under-1-crypto-picks-experts-recommend-these-cheap-altcoins-for-new-investors,"Hunters of affordable digital coins are in luck. Today's market showcases several altcoins valued under a dollar, offering enticing opportunities for new investors. Experts have pinpointed a selection of these promising low-cost cryptos. Delve into this article to uncover which coins are primed for growth. JasmyCoin Faces Downward Trend as Key Levels Hold JasmyCoin experienced a steady decline over the past week, dropping approximately 6.64%. Its performance worsened over the month with a loss close to 16.09% and plunged around 68.78% over the last six months. The extended losses reveal a continuous bearish phase that negatively impacted investor confidence. Price adjustments and diminished market sentiment kept the coin struggling to find a footing, showing a consistent pattern of pressure across various periods. This history points to a prolonged period of decline with little evidence of recovery. Presently, JasmyCoin trades within a narrow range between $0.01 and $0.02, with the nearest support at $0.01 and resistance at $0.02. A deeper support level appears at approximately $0.002. Technical indicators suggest that sellers dominate the market, with the Awesome Oscillator at -0.0008 and a Momentum Indicator at -0.001. The Relative Strength Index is around 40.79, indicating limited buying interest. While the trend lacks a clear upward trajectory, established levels offer trading opportunities. Cautious strategies may include watching for bounces around the $0.01 support for long entries, while short positions could be considered on rallies approaching $0.02. Monitoring for breakouts beyond these levels is crucial for identifying potential trend reversals. Kaspa Price Trends and Key Levels for Trading Kaspa experienced a modest weekly gain of 0.64%, yet the last month was challenging with a near 10% decline. Over the past six months, the drop reached almost 40%, showing how the coin has been under pressure. Price levels ranged between $0.0596 and $0.0916, with standard oscillators and momentum indicators hinting at subdued activity. This period highlights significant selling pressure over longer horizons even as short-term recovery signs emerged. The current trading environment sees Kaspa trading between $0.0596 and $0.0916. The nearest resistance is around $0.1078, while support is found near $0.0438, with further levels at $0.1398 and $0.0118. The small positive weekly change contrasts with a falling RSI of 45.86 and negative momentum, indicating bears currently have more control. The general trend remains unclear, and traders might look to buy near support levels while monitoring resistance zones for potential exit points. Cronos Faces Continued Bearish Trends with Key Price Levels in Focus Cronos experienced a notable slide with a nearly 19% drop in the last month and an almost 50% fall in the past six months. Price levels remained confined between $0.0696 and $0.1014 during these intervals, showing a persistent decline that eroded investor confidence. The figures display a steady downward trend as declines compounded over time with weekly losses near 0.37%, reflecting a coin under pressure. Technical measures revealed subdued momentum and low market energy, indicating struggles for recovery from successive setbacks over the observed periods. Current price action sees Cronos trading within a narrow range, marked by a support level at $0.0575 and a resistance threshold near $0.1211. Bears dominate, as a low RSI of 37 indicates weakness, with momentum indicators remaining negative. The coin has yet to break past the nearest resistance and appears cautious around established support. A potential trading idea could involve seeking buying opportunities near the lower support zone if price reversals occur, while being alert to bearish pressure that could push prices lower. The absence of a clear upward trend suggests traders should focus on managing risk. Conclusion Experts recommend JASMY , KAS , CRO , and for those looking to invest in affordable altcoins. These choices provide a good starting point for new investors. Each coin has unique features and potential for growth. Diversifying with these options can enhance a portfolio.

This interestingly bullish forecast comes off the back of another Bitcoin price rejection allowing the total crypto market cap to maintain the choppy price movement seen in the last month. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near Historic Weekly Close Despite Drop – Analyst Warns Of Volatile Weekend Rally Ahead? Crypto Market Tests $3.5T Barrier In an X post on July 4, Pillows shares an insightful technical analysis on the total crypto market cap. Using the daily CryptoCap chart from Tradingview, the renowned analyst highlights the recent formation of a bull flag hinting at an impending price breakout. For context, the bull flag is a classic bullish continuation pattern. It starts with the formation of a flagpole i.e. a strong upward price movement, as seen between early April to late May when Bitcoin reached a new all-time high. This structure is followed by the “flag,” i.e., a descending price channel that reflects a period of consolidation. This market action is seen from late May to the present, as the crypto market cap entered a temporary pullback phase. Pillows’ analysis shows a complete bull flag formation. However, the crypto market cap must achieve a decisive price close above the $3.5 trillion mark which represents the upper boundary of the flag to confirm a price breakout. If this bullish scenario occurs, Ted Pillows predicts the crypto total market cap to surge to around $4.3 trillion – $4.5 trillion in Q3 2025. Considering its market dominance levels of 62.77%, Bitcoin’s market cap could also rise to around $2.82 trillion in such bullish conditions providing a market price of $141,800 per unit. However, it’s worth noting that the occurrence of an altseason amidst this crypto price surge could alter the projected market status for the premier cryptocurrency.

Crypto Market Overview According to data from Coingecko, the total cryptocurrency cap is presently valued at $3.39 trillion following a 5.21% decline in the past day in line with the negative price changes with the Bitcoin market. However, the ongoing crypto bull run has delivered an impressive 51.24% gain over the past year. The market leader, Bitcoin, is presently valued at $108,118 reflecting a 1.46% loss in the last 24 hours as previously stated. The maiden cryptocurrency is also witnessing a 14.40% fall in daily trading volume indicating crash in transactions and market activity.

As for the greater memecoin section as gauged by the CoinDesk Memecoin Index(CDMEME), it is up 1.79% during the same period. Price action formed a 5.1% range from $0.821 to $0.864, with critical support confirmed near $0.835 on significant volume. A sharp rally earlier this week to $0.92 drew profit-taking, but technical strength remains as WIF holds above its new local floor. Blockchain analytics show whale wallets have accumulated more than 39 million tokens, a pattern that aligns with broader memecoin rotation underway across Solana-based assets. This trend comes as BONK surged earlier on ETF speculation, while WIF retests key zones with declining volume and fewer short liquidations. The passage of President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” by Congress earlier this week brought short-term calm to risk markets. Combined with better-than-expected U.S. jobs data, sentiment around risk assets improved marginally, reducing macro-related selling pressure. Even as broader crypto faces headwinds from shifting trade and monetary policy dynamics, WIF's on-chain fundamentals remain constructive. With derivatives markets booming — Binance has now facilitated $650 trillion in cumulative BTC futures volume — attention is turning to retail-driven tokens that continue to show resilience. If WIF maintains support and volume rebounds, a retest of $0.86 may be in play. Technical Analysis Highlights WIF traded between $0.821 and $0.864 over the 24-hour window ending July 5 at 14:00 UTC. High-volume bounce from $0.835 to $0.861 confirmed strong support level. Whale accumulation spiked during a 60.7M token volume surge over a 9-hour session. In the final hour (13:06–14:05 UTC), WIF rebounded from $0.828 to $0.831. Resistance formed at $0.838 with heavy sell pressure at 13:25–13:26. Temporary support held at $0.828 after sharp sell-off between 13:54–13:56. Modest late-session recovery hints at short-term consolidation range.

According to the newly updated settlement portal, General Motors will provide compensation to affected owners and lessees for issues related to excessive oil consumption in vehicles equipped with LC9 engines. The payout will go to customers in California, Idaho and North Carolina. The lawsuit alleges GM was aware of a defect triggered by excessively worn piston rings, which leads to excessive oil consumption, spark plug fouling, rough idling, rough acceleration, check engine light activation, engine shutdown commands, oil loss and potentially permanent engine damage or shutdown. Although GM has decided to settle, the company firmly denies any wrongdoing or liability and rejects the notion that any vehicles connected to the case are defective. The lawsuit alleges certain 2011 through 2014 models are defective, including Chevrolet Avalanche, Chevrolet Silverado, Chevrolet Suburban, Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Sierra, GMC Yukon and GMC Yukon XL. Eligible owners or lessees may automatically receive a pro rata payment estimated at a minimum of $2,149). North Carolina class members must submit a required Identification Form to confirm eligibility, while others generally need not file a claim unless notified.

Robinhood launched tokenized stocks on Arbitrum; BlackRock, Deutsche Bank, and Coinbase expanded Ethereum-based financial products. ETH price rose nearly 6% during EthCC 2025, with firms like BitMine and Bit Digital increasing Ethereum reserves. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said the blockchain “has succeeded beyond anyone’s expectations” during his keynote at EthCC 2025 in Cannes. The event gathered developers, company leaders, and institutions in the Palais des Festivals—the same venue used for the Cannes Film Festival. The conference showed how far Ethereum institutional adoption has progressed. Firms like Robinhood, BlackRock, Deutsche Bank, Coinbase, and Kraken are now using Ethereum for trading, tokenization, and onchain finance tools. Buterin told that institutions prefer Ethereum not for speed, but because “it’s stable and dependable, because it doesn’t go down.” He added that long-term features like privacy and censorship resistance are important to these firms.

On its first day of trading on the CBOE BZX exchange, SSK attracted $12 million in inflows with a total trading volume of $33 million. The fund offers investors direct exposure to spot Solana as well as access to staking yields. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffarth described the trading debut as “healthy,” noting that $8 million in volume was recorded within the first 20 minutes. Balchunas further noted that SSK’s launch significantly outperformed the initial trading of Solana and XRP futures ETFs, although it was surpassed by the debut of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum funds. Regulatory Highlights The fund is structured under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which allows it to bypass the standard Form 19b-4 filing process typically required for spot ETFs. Nate Geraci, President of NovaDius Wealth Management, described this approach as a “regulatory workaround.” Anchorage Digital serves as both the staking and custody partner for SSK. Growing Institutional Interest The launch of SSK coincided with a surge in institutional interest in Solana. Open interest in Solana futures on the CME reached a record $167 million, signaling increased attention from institutional investors. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have returned to positive capital inflows. Over the course of two days, investors poured more than $1 billion into these funds, offsetting a previous outflow of $342.2 million. On July 2, net inflows totaled $407.8 million, followed by $601.8 million the next day. Fidelity’s FBTC fund led the way, attracting $184 million and $237.1 million on those respective days.

Most 2025 forecasts show 2x to 4x gains depending on network adoption, ETF momentum, and Layer-2 integrations. For investors looking to beat those timelines and access Bitcoin-level wealth mechanics, Bitcoin Solaris is drawing serious attention. Now in phase 10 of its presale, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is priced at $10 with a confirmed $20 exchange listing already locked in. The difference? It’s not just a promise. Over 11,500 users are already involved. Over $5 million in presale funding has come in. And the systems that drive the token economy are either live or in advanced development. Smartphone Mining and High-Speed Architecture One of the primary reasons investors are shifting focus to BTC-S is accessibility. With the Nova App, users contribute to blockchain validation directly from their smartphones using idle CPU and storage. No staking, no infrastructure — just protocol-level integration that earns BTC-S in return. This is made possible by a hybrid architecture. Bitcoin Solaris uses Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Capacity at the base layer, while the Solaris Layer adds Delegated Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Time. That combination allows for 10,000 transactions per second with 2-second finality — and an energy profile that’s 99.95% more efficient than Bitcoin. Tokenomics That Mirror Bitcoin — Not Ethereum Ethereum’s supply is elastic. It burns fees, adjusts emissions, and reacts to market variables. Bitcoin Solaris offers a simpler proposition: 21 million tokens total, 4.2 million are available during presale. BTC-S is priced at $10 now. The launch price is set at $20. That’s more than 120% upside already confirmed—and that doesn’t factor in market demand or token velocity once listings go live. The presale ends July 31, and entry at this phase remains open to the public. As highlighted in a recent Crypto Vlog analysis , “Bitcoin Solaris is where smart money is moving. Not for hype — but for returns tied to actual usage.” Audits, Verifications, and Active Development Unlike most presale tokens, Bitcoin Solaris is already delivering. Cyberscope has completed its smart contract audit . Freshcoins audited the Nova App logic . The team is fully KYC-verified . And development isn’t waiting on listings. Development is advancing on multiple fronts. The Mining Power Marketplace — where users will be able to rent or monetize computing power using BTC-S — is actively under construction. Wallet enhancements are in progress to support broader functionality. A public testnet and full developer suite are on the roadmap for release in the near term. Ethereum will continue to grow. But Bitcoin Solaris is the only sub-$10 token on track to deliver network-driven returns before its first listing. The time window for entry is narrow — and this presale is one of the last confirmed steps before the token moves into full circulation.

While many investors still consider Solana, the current sentiment across crypto charts and the fear and greed index suggests that caution is warranted in the short term. Meanwhile, new DeFi token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining momentum. The project is in the fifth stage of the presale that is at the price of $0.03. Phase 5 is already over 60% sold out as investors rush to catch the lowest possible price. The launch price of the project is pegged at $0.06 ensuring a minimum gain of 100% to buyers who are buying MUTM in phase 5. While Solana’s price action dominates headlines, savvy investors are keeping a close eye on new cryptocurrency projects with solid fundamentals and utility, and Mutuum might just be the next big crypto to watch. Solana Could See More Downside Before Recovery Kicks In Solana (SOL) trades at approximately $149 now, yet analysts warn that Solana can still fall to the vicinity of $100 before it can formulate any significant upwall. Technical indicators are weak, and unless SOL can support major levels of support around $144 a sharper back may occur. But in case it gains the pace and crosses the resistance area at the level of $155, the rebound above the makings of the mark at the level of170 might take place in the later summer. Solana is still a good investment in the long-term, but short-term behavior has some investors walking on eggshells right now, which is why many of them are exploring brand-new projects, like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Picks Up Pace The project is in Phase 5 presale that is currently selling tokens at $0.03. The phase also includes a 16.67% return on investment to the investors as price will go higher to $0.035 in the next phase. Along with that the early forecasts indicate that MUTM can fly high to the value of $10 by the end of 2025. More than 12700 investors have already participated in the presale raising more than $11.7 million. With its game-changing dual-lending platform and upcoming USD-pegged stablecoin, Mutuum Finance stands out in the crypto market, not through hype, but through actual utility and security at scale. Stablecoin Launch, CertiK Audit, and $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch a stablecoin that is pegged to the US dollar (USD) on the Ethereum network. Besides, the project is audited by CertiK blockchain security company. This type of audit provides evidence of the readiness of the platform to become reliable and be institutional-graded transparent. As a second layer of established optimum security Mutuum Finance has launched its formal Bug Bounty Program in cooperation with CertiK to offer $50,000 USDT in reward. The rewards consist of 4 levels namely critical, major, minor and low. The program will focus on the dedication of Mutuum to security and sustainability. $100K in Leaderboard & Giveaway Prizes Up for Grabs Mutuum Finance is celebrating its fast-paced growth and thanking early bird fans by creating a $100,000 giveaway . Ten winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The project has also introduced a live leaderboard of the top 50 MUTM token holders. They will be awarded special bonus rewards adding a gamified touch to the presale and making it more fun to join. As Solana eyes a potential dip to $100, investors are hedging with high-upside projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Now in Phase 5 at $0.03, buyers are guaranteed a 2x return at launch. With $11.7M+ raised, 12,700+ investors, a CertiK audit, and a $50K bug bounty, Mutuum offers real DeFi utility and strong growth potential. Join the presale now before prices increase.

Uniswap ( UNI ) was trading at $6.95 on Saturday, July 5, which is significantly lower than its last November high of $20. This decline has brought its market capitalization to $4.8 billion, down from last year’s high of over $10 billion. UNI’s price crash has coincided with the ongoing sell-off of altcoins. The market cap of all cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and stablecoins, has dropped by nearly 30% this year. One possible reason why Uniswap price has crashed is that it has lost market share in the decentralized exchange industry. For example, its DEX volume in the last 30 days was $80 billion, much lower than PancakeSwap’s $160 billion. You might also like: Pepe price holds bullish structure despite market conditions: why a reversal can occur The DEX industry has also faced increased competition from Hyperliquid, which handled over $220 billion in volume during the same period. Other top protocols competing with Uniswap are Raydium and Aerodrome Finance. On-chain data also indicate that investors have continued dumping the UNI token. The supply of UNI on exchanges has jumped to 84.6 million, up from the year-to-date low of 69 million. Rising exchange balances is a sign that holders are selling their coins. UNI price has also dropped as the supply held by whales has dwindled. These investors hold 723 million coins, down from 824 million in January. Whale dumping signals that they expect the coin to continue falling. Uniswap supply in exchanges, whale holdings, funding rate | Source: Santiment UNI’s funding rate has also moved into negative territory, implying that investors anticipate the future price to be lower than it is today. Uniswap price technical analysis UNI price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the UNI price has crashed from a high of nearly $20 in November last year to $6.98. It has pulled back after plunging from the year-to-date low of $4.7 to the current $6.9. The Uniswap price has also formed a bearish flag pattern, which consists of a vertical line and an ascending channel. Therefore, the coin is likely to experience a bearish breakdown, with the next key point to watch being the year-to-date low of $4.70. A move above the important resistance level at $8.6, the highest swing in May, will invalidate the bullish view.

Binance advises nations on wallet security and custody strategies for sovereign crypto holdings. Bitcoin’s breakout above resistance mimics past setups that triggered strong rallies after macro fear events. Crypto influencer Crypto Rover posted on July 5 that “many countries are buying #Bitcoin for their reserves,” quoting Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ). CZ said governments are now creating national Bitcoin reserves, following the lead of the United States. He explained that once the U.S.—one of the world’s largest economies—began holding Bitcoin, other nations felt pressured to act. “The later you do it, the more expensive your crypto will be,” CZ said during a closed-door discussion. U.S. Bitcoin Holdings Push Countries to Act Zhao noted that the U.S. reportedly holds around 200,000 BTC. In response, other governments are seeking advice on how to start.

The technical picture is not looking the most bullish for Solana, despite a solid rebound on the Support 2. Prices formed a lower high double top and prices have been retracing since with RSI Momentum close to oversold on shorter timeframes. By Elior Manier The current session is marked by low volumes but still sees pockets of volatility, with broad profit-taking kicking in after two consecutive risk-on weeks. Global equities are in the red, and cryptocurrencies are also under pressure. Despite the growing institutional interest, crypto markets remain somewhat rangebound. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has been trading between $100,000 and $110,000 for over a month, while Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) continues to consolidate between $2,300 and $2,700. Investor access to cryptocurrencies is gradually becoming more streamlined, especially with the increasing adoption of financial instruments like ETFs. Nearly a year after the SEC opened the door to crypto ETFs, REX-Osprey has launched a Solana ( SOL-USD ) investing and staking ETF under the ticker SSK on the CBOE exchange. While today's pullback is part of broader market softness, let's take a closer look at Solana's technical picture to assess ongoing trends and potential levels of interest. Solana Technical Analysis Solana Daily Chart Solana Daily Chart, July 4, 2025 - Source: TradingView The technical picture is not looking the most bullish for Solana, despite a solid rebound on the Support 2 (levels detailed right after), there is an ongoing downward trendline that bulls will have to break to the upside to regain control. Inflows into the ETFs are key to support prices in this new form of cryptocurrency investing, and has helped to hold ETH and BTC prices at their levels for quite some time - Let's see how the launch of the SSK ETF helps in that aspect. Levels to keep on your chart: Support Levels: Immediate support $145 Support 2 $125 to $132 Support 3 $100 to $105 Resistance Levels: Current Pivot $150 to $160 Resistance 1 $200 to $205 Resistance 2 $225 to $232 Resistance 3 $255 to $265 ATH $295 Solana 2H Chart, July 4, 2025 - Source: TradingView Prices formed a lower high double top and prices have been retracing since with RSI Momentum close to oversold on shorter timeframes. Buyers will have to hold the last bullish confluence before bears get into full control: The upward trendline, 2H MA 200 and more importantly, the immediate $145 support. Solana vs Ethereum Relative Performance SOL/ETH Price Ratio, July 5, 2025 - Source: TradingView One of the themes of past year crypto investing was the rewiring of flows into Solana (and even more dominantly Bitcoin) - with major outflows from the ETH as the Solana protocol offers pretty similar technology but somewhat cheaper and more efficient for blockchain development. This led to a massive adoption of SOL, pushing the crypto to its $295 all-time highs, particularly towards the end of 2024. Since, Ethereum has found some strength. The upcoming challenge for markets will be to see if altcoins get more attraction as Bitcoin levels stay elevated, and if the new Solana ETF captures a bigger market share. Key levels to hold for the SOL/ETH Price Ratio is 0.057 (5.70%) - current levels and 0.03725 (3.725%) on the downside. Further upside above 7% and 9% (current highs 0.093) for Solana performance above Ethereum. Safe Trades!

On Wednesday, July 2, 2025, XRP trades at $2.19, down 1.08% from $2.21 in the last 24 hours. Daily trading volume has plummeted 28.59% to $2,906,318,584.65, hinting at fading interest among traders. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction in its presale phase 5, raising $11,700,000 with over 580 million tokens sold to 12,700 holders. Investors are eyeing its potential for a 53x return. This contrast highlights a pivot toward new opportunities. Consequently, attention is turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a promising altcoin. Ripple faces market challenges XRP is experiencing difficulties to keep up the results within the crypto market. It has also fallen to a low of 2.19 representing a 1.08% decline in one day. The trading volume has also tumbled down by almost 29% to less than $3 billion. This is indicative of a declining investor interest that may be reflected within the general conditions of the market. Although it recorded an increment of 0.15% during the last week, the Market capitalization of XRP is placed at 129.16 billion dollars. There are other coins such as Arbitrum and Celestia which outperform, whereas, XRP lags. Furthermore, macroeconomic factors may be dampening trader confidence. This sluggish performance is pushing investors to explore alternatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum finance presale surges Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing investor focus in its phase 5 presale. Priced at $0.03, the token has risen 200% from its opening phase at $0.01. Over 60% of phase 5 is already filled, signaling strong demand. The window to buy at this price is narrowing as phase 6 will increase the price by 16.7% to $0.035. At launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will list at $0.06, guaranteeing a 100% return for current buyers. Projections suggest a post-launch surge to $3.50, offering a 53x return. Additionally, the project has raised $11,700,000, with 580 million tokens sold to 12,700 holders. Innovative lending model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining decentralized finance with its dual lending system. It has a decentralized peer-to-contract model that dynamically adjusts interest rates and stabilizes the lenders and borrowers via smart contracts. The peer-to-peer approach eliminates intermediaries, allowing direct negotiations for flexible terms. This is ideal for volatile assets, offering tailored solutions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also launched a leaderboard showcasing the top 50 token holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for maintaining their ranks. Moreover, a $100,000 giveaway is boosting excitement, with 10 winners receiving $10,000 in MUTM each. Participants need a $50 presale investment and a valid wallet address. Security and stablecoin development Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is prioritizing trust with robust security measures. The team has finalized a Certik audit, earning a 95.00 security score with no vulnerabilities found in its smart contracts. A Bug Bounty Program, partnered with Certik, offers $50,000 in USDT rewards across four severity tiers. This reinforces the platform’s reliability. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins, it resists depegging, ensuring stability. Consequently, this enhances its utility for lending and staking, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a strong player in the crypto market. A shift to high-potential altcoins Ripple (XRP) price declines and reduced trading volume reflect challenges in sustaining investor interest. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a top crypto to buy now. Its phase 5 presale, with tokens at $0.03, offers a 100% return at the $0.06 launch price and a potential 53x gain if it hits $3.50 post-launch. The project’s secure, innovative lending model and stablecoin plans are driving demand. Investors are flocking to this altcoin for its real-world utility.

The upcoming surge may be the golden opportunity that brings fortunes. This article unveils three digital coins primed for dramatic growth, offering intriguing prospects for those looking to amplify their investments and achieve financial milestones. Sei Price Performance Amid Mixed Trends Sei showed a one-month surge of roughly 35% paired with a six-month decline of nearly 43%. A weekly loss around 10% points to significant short-term swings against longer-term struggles. Historical behavior reflects sharp bursts of recovery against an overall downward trend over the last half-year. Current prices trade between $0.18 and $0.36, with critical resistance near $0.44 and another level at $0.61 outlining potential hurdles for further gains. Support stands near $0.08, offering a defensive floor amid heightened volatility. The price is bouncing within a range, indicating a more neutral balance between bulls and bears, with an RSI around 54. A positive reading from the oscillator, combined with mild negative momentum, underscores a market in cautious equilibrium without a clear trend. Trading ideas suggest looking for a breakout above the $0.44 resistance to aim for the $0.61 target while having a plan to return to support at $0.08 if resistance fails. Aptos Faces Bearish Correction with Key Support and Resistance Levels Aptos experienced a noticeable decline over the past month, falling nearly 8.48% as trading activity became subdued. Over the past six months, the drop reached over 56%, signaling a prolonged period of pressure that has tempered investor sentiment. Prices have fluctuated between approximately $3.99 and $5.55, reflecting uncertainty among traders. Indicators such as a negative Awesome Oscillator and subdued momentum readings support the view of a bearish environment. These past trends showcase how the coin’s performance has been challenged by persistent downward pressure and a lack of sustained buying interest. Current price action centers around a trading range, with support at around $3.10 and resistance at about $6.22, plus secondary resistance near $7.78 and secondary support around $1.53. Bears currently dominate, as shown by negative values in momentum and moving average signals. The market lacks a clear trend, with prices oscillating within these levels. Traders might consider setting tight stops near support, looking for short-term recoveries toward resistance. A break above $6.22 could signal bullish entries, but current momentum suggests that caution remains essential in this uncertain market climate. Jupiter (JUP) Sees Volatile Swings Amid Key Support and Resistance JUP experienced a 7.00% rise over the last week despite a 16.05% drop in one month and a 54.11% decline in six months. Price movements fluctuated within a range of $0.34 to $0.57, reflecting sharp corrections amid brief recoveries. A noticeable weekly bounce contrasts with sustained downward pressure over longer periods. Historical performance reveals that short-term gains have been unable to offset deeper losses, with traders witnessing temporary optimism only to see significant overall depreciation. Previous behavior signals that market sentiment has been inconsistent, marked by short-lived rallies against persistent bearish pressure. Current price action shows Jupiter trading within a narrow band reflecting both cautious optimism and hesitation among market participants. The coin is positioned between an immediate support level at $0.21 and a nearby resistance at $0.69, with a further hurdle around $0.92. Bulls appear to be trying to push the price upward as indicated by the weekly gain, yet bears exert significant pressure given recent declines. The range of $0.34 to $0.57 demonstrates resilience, but overall sentiment remains mixed. Trading activity suggests caution, as movements near the $0.69 level could lead to a reversal if sellers act aggressively. A break below $0.21 might signal further downside, while scalping opportunities exist within these boundaries. Conclusion SEI , APT , and JUP have the potential to bring significant returns in the next bull market. SEI stands out for its innovative approach and growth prospects. APT could gain momentum with its unique features and increasing adoption. JUP is noted for its solid foundation and future plans. These coins offer promising opportunities for substantial gains in the near future. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

European Central Bank (ECB) Governing Council member, Gabriel Makhlouf has pushed back against the narrative that the euro is on the verge of replacing the US dollar as the anchor of the global financial system. The euro is not ready to challenge the dollar Makhlouf, who also serves as the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, was speaking at an economic conference in Aix-en-Provence, France, when he emphasized that Europe still lacks the structural and fiscal integration necessary to support such a shift. “Frankly, Europe’s economic system is still not formed,” he said. He also pointed out that the eurozone lacks critical elements such as a unified fiscal authority or a common safe asset comparable to the US Treasuries. Makhlouf cautioned against misinterpreting recent currency movements as signs of a fundamental transition in global financial leadership. “It’s a bit far to say that’s suddenly going to lead to the euro replacing the dollar because the euro is not ready to do that,” he explained. Makhlouf calls for deeper EU integration from the ECB Europe’s incomplete economic and fiscal integration is often cited as an obstacle to the common currency’s placing on a global stage. While the euro is used by 20 countries and serves as the second most traded currency in the world, the eurozone still lacks a central fiscal mechanism equivalent to the United States’ federal budget or debt issuance system. The absence limits the euro’s appeal as a global reserve currency. Without a unified fiscal policy or a large, liquid market for safe euro-denominated assets, international investors and governments are hesitant to fully shift their reserves or financial instruments away from the dollar. “The euro cannot quickly supplant the dollar as the anchor of the world’s financial system,” he said, reinforcing that while there may be increasing demand for alternatives to the dollar, Europe’s economic tools and institutions must first evolve. Makhlouf did not ruffle any feathers when he called on the ECB to take bold steps to increase the European Union’s economic sovereignty. He also encouraged EU leaders to view the current climate of global uncertainty as an opportunity to strengthen the currency. “These opportunities to actually increase the standing of the EU, to strengthen its sovereignty and autonomy matter, and they need to be taken,” Makhlouf urged. He advocated for reducing internal barriers in the EU’s single market and expanding joint-financing mechanisms for common priorities. Aside from Makhlouf’s remarks, several ECB officials have, in recent months, highlighted the importance of completing the EU’s banking and capital markets union, enhancing cross-border investment, and building fiscal tools that match the scale and coordination of those in the US.

As for the broader memecoin sector as gauged by the CoinDesk Memecoin Index(CDMEME), it is up 1.79% during the same period. Although FLOKI is often categorized as a meme coin, its ecosystem has long featured gaming-related functionality, including NFT-based characters, play-to-earn mechanics, and token integration for in-game rewards. But the launch of the Valhalla mainnet marks its most ambitious gaming milestone to date. On June 30, 2025, FLOKI officially launched V alhalla , a blockchain-based game inspired by Norse mythology. The game runs on opBNB , a Layer-2 network designed to enable fast and inexpensive transactions. Players take control of Veras — customizable NFT characters — in a browser-based, turn-based tactical MMORPG that blends combat, exploration, and questing with blockchain-backed rewards. The play-to-earn economy is built around FLOKI tokens, which players earn by completing in-game tasks and winning battles. To support the game’s rollout, the FLOKI team has committed millions of dollars from its treasury to fund development, marketing campaigns, and in-game incentives. That long-term investment signals the project’s intention to build a sustainable blockchain gaming ecosystem rather than a short-term promotional play. And on June 27, FLOKI announced a partnership with Method , a well-known esports organization recognized for its World of Warcraft dominance. Method will serve as a strategic content partner, producing onboarding materials, game guides, and live coverage to help Valhalla appeal to both traditional gamers and crypto-native audiences. The partnership will include branded jerseys and appearances in gaming tournaments throughout 2025 and 2026, designed to grow Valhalla’s player base and community awareness. These developments represent a pivotal moment in FLOKI’s evolution, as the project attempts to move beyond its meme origins and establish itself at the intersection of Web3 technology, entertainment, and digital asset ownership. Technical Analysis Highlights FLOKI rose 4.7% from $0.0000749 to $0.0000741 during the 24-hour window from July 4 15:00 to July 5 14:00. Peak price of $0.0000762 was recorded at 06:00 on July 5. A breakout at 06:00 was accompanied by the session’s highest volume spike of 44.98 billion tokens. Support formed near $0.0000737; resistance was established around $0.0000762. Last-hour trading (13:06 to 14:05) saw a V-shaped recovery from $0.0000740 to $0.0000741. A 3.08 billion token volume spike at 13:41 confirmed support around $0.0000742.

Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Hedera (HBAR), and Sei (SEI) have each shown significant market movement and community engagement, pointing to increasing relevance in the digital asset space. Little Pepe has introduced a utility-driven model based on Ethereum’s Layer 2 technology, targeting meme token projects and decentralized applications. It aims to combine meme culture with a fast, low-cost EVM-compatible infrastructure. The project offers features such as Ethereum tooling, anti-sniping protection, and a launchpad designed specifically for meme projects. The presale entered Stage 4 earlier than anticipated, with the token price increasing to $0.0013. The round has already attracted $3 million in contributions out of a $4.475 million target, with over 2.72 billion tokens sold. Purchases can be made using ETH, USDT, or card payments. The presale is expected to conclude ahead of schedule, with claimable tokens available post-sale through the official platform. Its $777k giveaway to the top ten presale participants is further increasing attention for the LILPEPE token. 2. Dogecoin Dogecoin (DOGE), created as a memecoin, has seen consistent adoption and a rise in trading activity. It is trading at $0.162, supported by a market cap of $24.39 billion and a 25% surge in daily volume. Despite market fluctuations, DOGE continues to be a top choice for transactional use due to its strong liquidity and brand recognition. 3. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been maintained as an Ethereum-based and community-driven coin, and its circulating supply is more than 589 trillion coins. Its trading price is at 0.00001129, and it has marked high engagement rates and more than 1.5 million holders of its tokens. Current trading action entails volume growth of almost 11% with a mark of heightened interest by traders and retailers. 4. Hedera Hedera (HBAR) is known as a high-performance consensus mechanism as well as enterprise-level applications. It is trading at 0.1494 and has dropped 0.83 percent in a day, with a market cap of 6.34 billion. The speed of transactions and low costs have been its limitations that are inherent in the older blockchain networks. 5. Sei Sei (SEI) focuses on high-speed smart contract execution and Ethereum compatibility. Despite a recent 5.96% drop to $0.2844, it is backed by a roadmap that includes a significant performance upgrade called “Giga.” SEI aims at solving the scalability and performance bottlenecks that many blockchains within the Layer 1 face, and it has a 10 billion token supply and continuous development. Conclusion In 2025, to list a few, Little Pepe, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Hedera, and Sei are already settling in as a possible option to Ethereum for investors. The projects have a variety of value propositions underneath the 0.50 price point, including community-oriented ideas and meme branding to Layer 1 and Layer 2-based technological improvements to scalability.

In letters to Zelle’s parent company and the banks – specifically JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Capital One, PNC Bank, US Bank and Truist – lawmakers demand to know more information on scams stemming from social media. In a lawsuit dropped by the Trump administration, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) accused Zelle of failing to implement adequate safeguards against fraudulent transactions, allowing scammers to exploit vulnerabilities and trigger $870 million in losses for hundreds of thousands of consumers. Now, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) are pushing for stronger consumer protections and transparency, noting JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo’s 73% transaction dominance on the network. They’re asking the banks for data on social media scam frequency, bank reimbursement policies and measures to prevent fraud, warning Zelle’s rapid growth has outpaced its security, leaving millions vulnerable. They urge banks to follow JPMorgan Chase’s lead, which began blocking Zelle payments linked to social media in February. Failure to act, they say, could prompt stricter regulations. A separate investigation by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found that JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo significantly decreased their reimbursement rate over time, from 62% of disputed transactions in 2019 to 38% in 2023. Zelle acknowledges fraud on the network but emphasizes its rarity, claiming 99.95% of transactions occur without issues.

RLUSD saw its supply grow by 47% in June, the fastest growth rate of any major stablecoin in the month. Total circulation now stands at $455 million, up from just over $300 million the previous week. Ethereum Is Driving the Surge The bulk of RLUSD’s supply is on Ethereum, which hosts roughly $390 million of the $455 million total. That’s nearly a fourfold increase since January, according to Token Terminal data . @Ripple 's RLUSD stablecoin is growing on @ethereum , with supply up ~4x since January. pic.twitter.com/nQ88TYVtnc — Token Terminal (@tokenterminal) June 28, 2025 While Ripple’s native XRP Ledger still supports around $65 million of RLUSD, Ethereum’s familiarity and deep liquidity are attracting most users. It’s become the go-to platform for DeFi integrations, exchange listings, and app-level adoption. Ripple’s willingness to support RLUSD across multiple chains shows a strategic shift. Instead of limiting the stablecoin to its ecosystem, the company is opting for interoperability. Regulatory Clarity Strengthens RLUSD Legal and regulatory progress is also fueling RLUSD’s growth. In the U.S., the recently passed GENIUS Act has established clearer rules for dollar-backed stablecoins. Ripple, having spent years in court with the SEC, now enjoys more legal clarity than many of its peers. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed the company has dropped its cross-appeal against the SEC, signaling movement toward a final resolution. That easing legal pressure has helped RLUSD gain market credibility at a crucial moment. Internationally, RLUSD recently received approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), allowing it to operate within the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), a growing financial hub for the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. A New Contender in the Stablecoin Wars While USDT and USDC continue to dominate, RLUSD’s expansion shows that demand is growing for stablecoins that combine compliance, flexibility, and global reach. Ripple’s June breakout wasn’t accidental. It’s the result of deliberate steps: legal alignment, cross-chain support, and global licensing.

Positioned as a next-generation platform, Lightchain AI aims to bring a fresh approach to decentralized innovation by focusing on transparency, scalability, and community-driven governance. As industries increasingly seek secure and efficient blockchain solutions, Lightchain AI’s upcoming debut promises to offer new opportunities for developers and enterprises alike. Though overshadowed by established names, this launch could mark the beginning of a significant shift in the decentralized technology landscape. Ethereum and Solana- Dominating Headlines with Strong Market Moves Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are stealing the crypto spotlight in 2025. Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade, comprising its largest upgrade since the Merge of 2022, has quickened transaction time and brought down fees, helping it take a stand in DeFi and smart contract applications. Although it has competition, Ethereum is nevertheless a lifeline for DeFi projects, from which more than $51.9 billion in “value” is locked. Neither Solana’s volume surge nor our claim that DEX Volumes on Solana have surpassed those on Ethereum, by the way, are breaking news or insider baseball to the Solana community itself, which has seen its volume in DEX trading spike to $64.1 billion over 30 days. Raydium and Orca meanwhile are getting credit for going parabolic but remain challenged by memecoin volatility and face increasingly stiff competition from Hyperliquid. Both networks are attracting institutional interest. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has removed a barrier for staked Ethereum and Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) – a move that may help bring even more liquidity (and confidence) to the table. XRP’s Position Strengthens as Investors Eye Regulatory Shifts XRP's market position has strengthened following the resolution of its legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On June 27, Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the company's decision to withdraw its cross-appeal, with the SEC expected to do the same, signaling the end of a nearly five-year legal battle . This move provides much-needed regulatory clarity, affirming that XRP sales on public exchanges are lawful, while institutional sales were deemed to have violated securities laws. In response, XRP's price surged to $2.20, reflecting renewed investor confidence . The resolution has also prompted a 442% increase in daily active addresses, indicating heightened network activity . With legal uncertainties behind it, XRP is poised for growth, supported by expanding institutional adoption and real-world use cases. Lightchain AI- Rising AI Blockchain Ready to Make Waves in July 2025 Lightchain AI is set to make waves in July 2025 as it transitions from a successful testnet to its highly anticipated mainnet launch. With its unique Proof-of-Intelligence consensus and the advanced Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine, Lightchain AI is designed to merge blockchain’s transparency with real AI computational power. The roadmap includes open-source releases, decentralized validator and contributor nodes, and a robust developer portal to attract builders worldwide. Focused on sustainability and constant evolution, Lightchain AI empowers community-driven governance and continuous technological refinement. Lightchain AI is set to revolutionize blockchain intelligence by merging decentralized infrastructure with advanced AI capabilities. As July 2025 approaches, this milestone promises to mark a transformative moment for its expanding ecosystem. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

In a new essay , Hayes says the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act will unlock trillions of dollars in liquidity and boost markets. According to Hayes, the GENIUS Act, which was passed in the U.S. Senate last month and is now waiting to be tabled on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, will allow too-big-to-fail (TBTF) banks to issue stablecoins and unlock up to $6.8 trillion in liquidity. TBTF banks, which include megabanks such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, are large financial institutions so critical to the economy that their failure would be catastrophic for the global financial system. In light of the GENIUS Act, Hayes says the best bet is not investing in non-bank stablecoin issuers such as Circle. “The real stablecoin play isn’t betting on crusty FinTechs like Circle—it’s understanding that the US government just handed TBTF banks the launch keys to a multi-trillion-dollar liquidity bazooka disguised as ‘innovation’… Instead, go long Bitcoin. Go long JPMorgan. Forget about Circle.” According to the BitMEX co-founder, the increased liquidity arising from allowing banks to issue stablecoins, as well as other fiscal policy measures, could send “Bitcoin pumping 10x to $1 million.” The stocks of the megabanks, on the other hand, could soar by nearly 3x as a result of the GENIUS Act, per Hayes. “If we take the average price-to-earnings ratio of the TBTF banks at 14.41x and multiply that by the cost savings and stablecoin NIM (net interest margin) potential, it comes out to $3.91 trillion. The current market cap of the eight TBTF banks is approximately $2.1 trillion, which means that stablecoins could pump TBTF bank stocks on average by 184%.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

A $455 Bet on This Cheap Token Could Become $91,000 Before Bull Run Peak in 2026",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/looking-for-the-next-solana-sol-a-455-bet-on-this-cheap-token-could-become-91000-before-bull-run-peak-in-2026,"Back in late 2020, Solana (SOL) changed hands for less than $2. Fast forward to the biggest moments of the 2021 bull run, and that same coin rocketed over $250, handing early backers an eye-popping 15,000% gain. For those who spotted the potential of a high-speed, low-cost blockchain early, life-changing wealth was created. Now, as we stand at the doorstep of the next crypto supercycle, a new contender has entered the arena. It’s not another forked meme token with no utility. Instead, it’s an emerging Layer-2 project that fuses viral meme energy with serious technological muscle: Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) . According to its presale math, a modest $455 investment today could potentially grow to $91,000 by the peak of 2026’s expected bull market. Why Little Pepe Could Be the Solana of This Cycle Just like Solana introduced a faster, cheaper alternative to Ethereum Layer-1, Little Pepe introduces an ultra-low-fee, high-speed Layer-2 blockchain powered by $LILPEPE—but with a viral twist. While Solana won hearts with its TPS stats, $LILPEPE is winning wallets with a community-first approach and meme-fueled virality that mirrors the early fervor of Dogecoin and PepeCoin. It’s not just tech for devs—it’s tech that memes can live on. Here’s why $LILPEPE’s structure draws comparison to early Solana: Ultra-Fast Throughput: Built on a Layer 2 Ethereum foundation, $LILPEPE can deliver finality faster than you can refresh Twitter, solving the gas and latency problems that drove many away from Ethereum in the first place. Zero-Tax, All-Fun Philosophy: Unlike the heavy tax models of most presale meme tokens, $LILPEPE offers a 0% buy/sell tax, making it far more appealing for long-term holders and swing traders alike. Deep Liquidity Allocations: With 10% of the total supply dedicated to liquidity and another 10% to decentralized exchange (DEX) listings, this token isn’t just built to launch—it’s built to stay. From $455 to $91,000 – Let’s Break the Numbers Down At the current Stage 4 presale rate of $0.0013 per token, a $455 investment will fetch approximately 350,000 LILPEPE tokens. Now, suppose LILPEPE achieves a price of $0.26—the same magnitude of growth Solana saw during its 2021 meteoric rise. That’s a 15,000% increase from its presale value. 350,000 tokens x $0.26 = $91,000. That’s the power of early entry during a presale—and that’s not theoretical. It’s math backed by history. But Why Is This Cheap Token Making So Much Noise? Unlike thousands of forgettable meme tokens that come and go, Little Pepe is a narrative-driven project with real utility and community involvement baked in. A Story That Sells Itself $LILPEPE isn’t a faceless protocol. It’s a storyline: a meme hero rising from the ashes of failed rugs and gas-heavy chains to build a Layer-2 kingdom. It taps into the same cultural pull that fueled Doge, Shiba, and Pepe—but adds actual tech behind it. Layer-2 Buzz The crypto community is now hyper-aware of Layer-2s like Base, Arbitrum, and zkSync. But none of them are as meme-friendly or community-magnetic as Little Pepe . It’s the only one explicitly designed to blend meme culture with high-performance infrastructure. Zero Tax, All Incentive Many meme coins tax holders on every transaction. Not Little Pepe. The project takes a radical stance: 0% tax. That means every jump this baby frog makes in price is yours to keep, untainted by contract fees or tax redirections. Brief Presale & Giveaway Details Little Pepe’s presale is currently in Stage 4, offering $LILPEPE at just $0.0013. Over $3 million has already been raised out of the $4.475 million cap, with more than 2.6 billion tokens sold. This suggests massive early interest, and time is running out. To sweeten the deal, a $777K giveaway is now live , with 10 winners standing to receive $77,000 worth of $LILPEPE tokens. Over 12,000 entries have already been logged, making it one of the largest memecoin launch giveaways this year. Final Thoughts: Is Little Pepe the Next Solana? Solana wasn’t just a coin—it was a movement. It solved a problem, created a loyal following, and scaled fast. Little Pepe could be on that same trajectory, but with a twist of humor, accessibility, and mass appeal that makes it digestible for every level of investor. Meme coins with no utility are fading fast. The winners of this next cycle will be those who bridge utility and virality, and $LILPEPE is doing exactly that. So, if you missed Solana at $2, and you’re looking for that next shot at a 15,000% return, consider whether $LILPEPE at $0.0013 is your next big bet. Because when the frog leaps, it might leap to the top 100. And a $455 investment today could be the $91,000 portfolio move your 2026 self will thank you for.

The XRP/USD continues to trade over the critical $2.20 support level, bolstered by Ripple’s aggressive push into traditional finance. The company recently filed for a U.S. national banking charter with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and is also seeking a Federal Reserve master account. If successful, these moves could integrate Ripple directly into the U.S. payments infrastructure — an unprecedented development for a crypto-native entity. The news has revived optimism among traders, who are eyeing a possible long-term surge to $10. Meanwhile, institutional sentiment is improving, driven by: Ongoing speculation of an XRP ETF filing Ripple’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) partnerships across 50+ countries Broader adoption in cross-border payments infrastructure These indicators are reinforcing a solid fundamental backdrop in XRP, even as cryptocurrency markets stays in a state of cautious consolidation. Institutional Flows and ETF Rumours Fuel Speculative Targets XRP’s demand among institutions is growing despite macro uncertainty. Ripple’s continued engagement with regulators, including its pro-CBDC positioning, has made the asset a top contender for ETF consideration. XRP EYES $10: Ripple Moves to Become a U.S. Bank Ripple’s pursuit of a U.S. banking license could be the catalyst that propels #XRP to $10+ and unlocking massive utility, adoption, and trust on a global scale. A new era for crypto is taking shape. Are you ready? pic.twitter.com/8smFXqU9Ji — XRP Governor (@xrpgovernor) July 5, 2025 Traders and analysts point to a scenario where ETF approval, combined with regulatory clarity and Ripple’s potential U.S. banking license , could propel XRP toward the $10 mark — a level once thought speculative but increasingly discussed. Banking License: May grant Ripple direct access to U.S. payment rails ETF Hopes: Could drive retail and institutional inflows CBDC Activity: Reinforces global relevance While the immediate path to $10 isn’t guaranteed, many in the market view Ripple’s alignment with traditional finance as a catalyst that may gradually close the gap. XRP Technical Outlook – Watching the $2.23 Barrier From a technical perspective, XRP remains well-supported. The 2-hour chart shows the price respecting a rising trendline from the June 23 low, with the 50-SMA ($2.2281) and 100-SMA ($2.2079) forming a critical support zone. XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview XRP price prediction and its price action have been tightening into a wedge near $2.23, a resistance level that has been tested multiple times but not yet breached. Candlestick formations are neutral to indecisive, including spinning tops, signalling a volatility squeeze. If bulls manage a breakout above $2.2340 on substantial volume, XRP could quickly target $2.2822 and $2.3400. Conversely, a break below $2.20 may invite a pullback toward $2.147 or even $2.084. XRP Trade Setup – Breakout in the Making: Entry: Above $2.23 on bullish confirmation Targets: $2.2822 → $2.3400 Stop-Loss: Below $2.20 trendline Bias: Bullish while above 100-SMA With Ripple’s institutional alignment deepening and price holding above support, XRP remains one of the most closely watched altcoins in 2025.

Drake’s betting performance has inspired memes calling it the “Drake Curse,” referencing losses in the teams and athletes he bets on. The rapper addressed that curse, telling fans he’s just a “flawed sports bettor.” Yet Drake isn’t just rolling dice. He has partnered with crypto gambling platform Stake, in a partnership that’s reported to be worth $100 million annually. Outside the casino lights, Drake has made crypto investments in firms, including MoonPay and brandished hardware wallets on social media. Interestingly, Drake’s nod to bitcoin’s volatility comes at a time that’s being interpreted as the calm before the storm. Deribit’s bitcoin volatility index ( DVOL ) has, in fact, dropped to a near two-year low at 38.",Web3|Drake|Bitcoin|News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-05 16:57:49

Now it ranks among the top tokens in the world, despite early doubt. Today, a new player is catching attention for a similar reason: solid utility, early-stage entry, and asymmetric upside. That project is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), priced at just $0.03 in Phase 5 of its presale, with over $11.7 million raised and 60% of tokens in this phase already sold. With more than 12,700 holders and deep DeFi fundamentals, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now being discussed in the same breath as XRP’s early rise. That isn’t just community hype. One notable investor who previously held a six-figure XRP portfolio has now placed $12,000 into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.03 during Phase 5 of the presale. That allocation secured them 400,000 MUTM tokens, and with the $0.06 listing price locked in, this investor is already set to double their position to $24,000 by launch day. Analysts have projected targets of $1 to $2 within the first few post-launch months. At $1, the same 400,000 tokens would be worth $400,000—a 33x return on the original $12,000 buy-in. At $2, that value becomes $800,000—a 66x return. And at $3, the investor would be holding $1.2 million, marking a 100x gain from the Phase 5 entry point. A Custom Lending Platform for the Whole Market, Not Just Blue Chips Unlike traditional DeFi platforms that focus only on blue-chip coins like ETH or BTC, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is targeting both ends of the spectrum by launching with two core lending engines. The peer-to-peer (P2P) model is built to support more volatile or illiquid tokens—like DOGE, SHIB, and other meme coins—by allowing lenders and borrowers to negotiate customized terms directly. This opens up new borrowing and earning channels for token holders who’ve typically been sidelined by major protocols. Lenders will be able to select the terms they’re comfortable with—interest rates, loan durations, and repayment conditions—without the need for a centralized intermediary. Borrowers will post overcollateralized positions, and lenders will accept or reject those terms based on their own risk profile. This design brings real freedom into the lending space, offering an alternative to one-size-fits-all models. Security Measures and Institutional Trust Growing Fast One key element helping Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gain momentum is its proactive approach to smart contract safety. The protocol has been fully audited by CertiK and is now running a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program, rewarding any white-hat developers who can identify weaknesses before launch. The bounty includes rewards across four tiers—from low severity to critical—ensuring all aspects of the system are rigorously examined. Combined with a Skynet Score of 77 and a Token Scan Score of 95, the project has built real confidence across institutional desks and high-net-worth DeFi users. Investors are already acting on that trust. A former Avalanche (AVAX) holder recently moved $18,000 into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during this phase, positioning for a clean 3x return post listing. In another case, a $25,000 whale from Phase 1 is now up to $75,000 in paper gains and targeting another 300% post launch. These are not passive bets—they’re conviction-driven entries by traders who recognize early value in scalable DeFi models with on-chain transparency. And while many presales are merely token offerings waiting for development, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to launch its beta platform at the same time as its token goes live. The team has outlined a roadmap that includes Layer-2 integration for faster, lower-cost usage, passive income through mtTokens, and the rollout of a decentralized stablecoin that will always target a $1 peg. That stablecoin will only be minted when loans are initiated with overcollateralized assets, and it will be burned upon repayment or liquidation—creating both stability and deflationary pressure within the ecosystem. As adoption grows, part of the protocol’s revenue will be used to buy MUTM tokens on the open market, sending them to mtToken stakers in dividend distribution cycles. This system will reward holders with long-term vision while creating upward pressure on the token price, especially as more users engage with the lending and borrowing functions. The listing price of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set at $0.06, meaning investors who buy in now at $0.03 already stand to double their capital by Phase 11. But many are aiming far beyond. XRP once turned pennies into fortunes for early believers, and this $0.03 DeFi token now has the same ingredients: utility, demand, and a launch window narrowing by the day.

That’s according to OKX CEO Star Xu, who has issued a detailed explanation of the exchange’s compliance and risk control procedures in response to user complaints about account restrictions and verification demands. The statement acknowledges high false-positive rates and suboptimal user experience while defending the platform’s global regulatory obligations. Xu outlined that OKX’s compliance team exceeds 600 members dedicated to preventing illegal activities including terrorist financing, human trafficking, drug trafficking, money laundering, fraud, and market manipulation. The CEO emphasized that these measures are necessary to meet legal requirements across jurisdictions where OKX operates.

Users using Tor browsers or having potential ties to sanctioned countries or political figures face heightened document requests, including proof of address, residency history, and employment verification. Source: Star Xu post Xu described the challenge of “false positives,” where legitimate users are mistakenly flagged as risky despite normal behavior. The CEO noted that even advanced industry databases and technologies cannot achieve 100% accuracy in compliance determinations. “Many service providers adopt an ‘aggressive identification’ strategy, and regulatory authorities often encourage platforms to err on the side of caution,” Xu explained. He justified why compliant users sometimes receive requests to “prove your dad is your dad.” You might also like: Solana captures 95% of tokenized stock trading volume in massive DeFi pivot OKX account restrictions may include asset freezing OKX maintains authority to issue warnings, request additional documentation, suspend account functions, or terminate accounts for policy violations. In cases involving sanctions or terrorist activities, the exchange is legally required to freeze related assets. The platform integrates third-party databases with internal behavioral analysis models to identify potential risk accounts. Xu emphasized that the compliance system starts internally with zero-tolerance policies for employee misconduct including insider trading and customer interest violations. Customer-facing compliance includes identity verification, transaction monitoring, sanctions screening, and market manipulation detection. The system automatically reviews user activity against global watchlists and regulatory requirements. Users flagged for additional verification receive requests for fund source documentation, address proof, and employment history. Xu assured users that truthful document submission would not compromise account safety for those not involved in illegal activities. The CEO highlighted strict data access controls and privacy protections for submitted documents. He also noted that improper disclosure would result in severe legal consequences for the platform.

Fake Devs, Real Theft The suspects, Kim Kwang Jin, Kang Tae Bok, Jong Pong Ju, and Chang Nam Il, allegedly posed as remote blockchain developers using stolen or fake identities to conceal their North Korean citizenship. Starting from operations in the UAE in 2019, they later secured jobs at a blockchain startup in Atlanta and a token platform in Serbia between late 2020 and mid-2021. U.S. prosecutors say Kim and Jong submitted fabricated documents to land their roles, a tactic DOJ officials describe as a rising threat to companies hiring remote IT staff. $915K in Crypto Funneled to Pyongyang Once inside, the operatives didn’t waste time. In early 2022, Jong siphoned off $175,000 worth of crypto. A month later, Kim exploited vulnerabilities in smart contracts to steal another $740,000. The stolen funds were laundered through crypto mixers and funneled to wallet addresses controlled by Kang and Chang, who allegedly registered exchange accounts using fake Malaysian IDs. The DOJ claims the scheme was part of North Korea’s broader strategy to fund illicit programs, including nuclear weapons development, by targeting vulnerable crypto infrastructure. “These schemes target U.S. businesses, evade sanctions, and funnel money directly into the regime’s weapons programs,” said John A. Eisenberg, Assistant Attorney General for National Security. DOJ’s New Crackdown on DPRK Cyber Ops The charges are part of the DOJ’s broader DPRK RevGen: Domestic Enabler Initiative, launched in 2024 to cut off North Korea’s access to U.S.-based revenue streams. The case also ties into wider efforts. Federal agents recently seized nearly 30 financial accounts, 200 laptops, and over 20 fake websites across 16 states, part of a sweep on “laptop farms” used by North Korean operatives posing as U.S. freelancers. Today, the FBI and @TheJusticeDept announced nationwide actions to disrupt North Korean schemes to defraud American companies through remote IT work, which included the arrest of a U.S. national who allegedly hosted a laptop farm for North Korean actors https://t.co/3IC28oaMFa pic.twitter.com/rsx0EPO0nu — FBI (@FBI) June 30, 2025 A separate civil complaint last month detailed how North Korean IT contractors, posing as remote developers, funneled $7.74 million in crypto to Pyongyang, all while working for over 100 U.S. companies. The Bigger Picture North Korea’s use of fake developer identities to infiltrate crypto startups shows how the regime blends social engineering, remote work loopholes, and blockchain vulnerabilities to raise capital under global sanctions. It’s also a wake-up call for blockchain firms hiring global talent.

NEAR & TAO Charts Lack Certainty,https://thecoinrise.com/win-big-in-blockdags-buyer-battles-with-50m-bdag-in-the-pool-near-tao-charts-lack-certainty/,"Doubt is spreading across the market lately. For Bittensor (TAO), its price pattern shows shakiness at $310, a mark it once bounced from but now struggles to hold with each new touch. Near Protocol (NEAR) isn’t seeing much relief either. Its price has fallen by nearly 5%, and volume plunged 27%, deepening the concerns. Both sit at points where technical structures could break or recover. However, neither offers firm clarity right now. Though BlockDAG (BDAG) moves on a stronger track. Its presale price holds steady at $0.0016 until August 11th, which remains well below its confirmed launch value of $0.05. Adding the Buyer Battle reward pool of 50 million BDAG to this setup makes the prospect highly appealing for buyers. While others are bracing for turbulence, BlockDAG buyers already see momentum on their side. TAO Price Pattern Risks: Will It Defend $310 Again? Signs of weakness surround the Bittensor (TAO) price pattern. After it failed to break past $340 again, the coin slipped back to the known demand area around $310. This level helped TAO rebound in late June, but with repeated tests, support can start weakening. The momentum readings aren’t supportive either. Its RSI is below 42, and the 50 EMA has flipped into resistance near $333. The bearish trend remains visible with its lower highs and lower lows, and the stubborn trendline still holds. Unless the Bittensor (TAO) price pattern manages to break above resistance and reclaim the EMA level, it could be headed further down towards $295 or below. NEAR Price Drop Analysis: Breakdown Before an Upside Flip? The Near Protocol (NEAR) price dropped by nearly 5% in the past day following Bitcoin’s own decline, pulling several altcoins down along with it. NEAR trades around $2.04 now, and its trading volume has shrunk by 27%, but this isn’t purely about panic exits. From a technical angle, NEAR remains near the upper boundary of its descending channel, a pattern that frequently precedes upward breaks. If buyers push through this resistance zone, price levels of $2.70 and $3.65 could come back in sight. Right now, though, the Near Protocol (NEAR) price drop looks more like a critical retest rather than an outright failure. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles Draw Intense Participation with $50M in Rewards BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles have rapidly evolved from a quiet initiative to a core driver of its presale buzz. With the reward pool now standing at 50 million BDAG coins, it has turned into a major value engine. Here’s how it works. Every day, a target purchase allocation is set. If it is not fully reached, the unclaimed BDAG coins are awarded to the day’s biggest buyer. This winner doesn’t just receive praise; they gain the unsold coins themselves, which often amounts to values in the tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. With the current presale batch price locked at $0.0016 until August 11th and the official launch set at $0.05, the ROI prospects are direct and significant. This system builds more than speed; it motivates large-volume action. BlockDAG’s presale has raised over $331 million, with total coins sold exceeding 23.5 billion. Early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1. Even more compelling is the current stage. BlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release has already happened, revealing listings on 20 exchanges. As presale supply tightens and demand spikes, missing the daily top spot could mean missing out on massive gains. Still, every buyer secures a strong entry price, regardless of battle wins. Overall, Buyer Battles are not merely about winning big; they’re about entering early when growth is tangible. Final Words! While market pressures continue to test asset strength, each tells a different narrative: opportunity is still present, though it is shifting. Bittensor (TAO) holds just above $310 with its weakening momentum hinting at possible slides, while the Near Protocol (NEAR) price drop remains technically structured within its channel, often a precursor to eventual breakout moves. Meanwhile, BlockDAG stands out with over $331 million raised, 23.5 billion BDAG sold, and a Buyer Battle reward pool of 50 million BDAG, attracting serious buying energy. For those eyeing the best crypto to buy for 2025 , BDAG appears to lead that conversation right now.

With the U.S. SEC inching closer to approving a spot Dogecoin ETF, investor optimism is surging. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts now assign a probability of 90% or higher to ETF approvals for altcoins like Dogecoin, thanks to recent filings that include “in-kind” redemptions—an ETF-friendly mechanism that significantly reduces tax burdens and slippage. If that green light comes through, it won’t just be Dogecoin that flies. A rising tide lifts all meme boats—and four meme coins stand to benefit massively, potentially delivering 20x gains or more in 2025. Let’s dive into the top contenders, starting with a presale phenom that’s quietly making waves. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE): The Meme Prince Ready to Rule In a sea of recycled memes and derivative tokens, Little Pepe stands apart. Billed as the heir to the legendary Pepe throne, $LILPEPE is more than a token—it’s the native currency of a Layer 2 blockchain designed to rival Ethereum’s limitations head-on. Boasting ultra-low fees, warp-speed transactions, and zero taxes, it’s setting a new standard for meme coin utility. The project is still in presale—Stage 4 is underway, with over $2.7 million raised out of a $4.475 million cap. More than 2.3 billion tokens have already been sold, priced at just $0.0013 per LILPEPE. That price point leaves plenty of room for exponential growth. Analysts suggest that a 5000% increase is not only possible, but likely, if Little Pepe delivers on its roadmap—from exchange listings and viral campaigns to becoming a top 100 coin on CoinMarketCap. The $777K giveaway is what makes LILPEPE stand out. Ten winners will each get $77,000 in tokens. The campaign has already received more than 12,000 entries, which has gotten people talking and involved in the community before the debut. With zero buy/sell taxes, exchange liquidity already allocated, and a full-stack marketing blitz on the horizon, $LILPEPE may become the Dogecoin of the Layer 2 era. Dogecoin (DOGE): The OG Ready to Make ETF History Dogecoin is no stranger to the spotlight, but 2025 could see it achieve institutional validation with the approval of the first spot ETF based on Dogecoin. Bitwise recently amended its ETF filing with the SEC, including “in-kind” redemption structures—a significant positive development. Now trading above $0.17, DOGE is flashing strong bullish signals, including RSI divergence and whale accumulation. Analysts forecast a move to $1.00 in the short term, with $1.40 or higher by year-end, representing a return of over 700% from current levels. DOGE’s staying power is unmatched in the history of meme coins. And with ETF legitimacy on the table, plus support from heavyweights like Galaxy Digital, Dogecoin could break through its all-time high and enter a new price paradigm in 2025. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN): From Joke to Juggernaut Launched on Solana, Fartcoin started as a meme within a meme—yet now finds itself rubbing shoulders with the top 10 meme tokens by market cap. With a valuation nearing $1 billion and daily volumes approaching $300 million, this token is no longer passing gas—it’s making serious moves. Recent listings on Coinbase and Arkham have turned Fartcoin into a real contender. Rumors of a FARTCOIN ETF filing are intensifying as institutional investors chase meme-driven liquidity. Should the meme ETF market mature alongside Dogecoin’s approval, Fartcoin could see a 1200% rally, putting a $12 target firmly within reach. For a coin born out of silliness, its momentum is no joke. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): The NFT-Meme Hybrid With Wall Street Eyes PENGU brings a unique flavor to the meme scene by merging NFT culture with DeFi momentum. The token—anchored to the wildly popular Pudgy Penguins NFT brand—saw a sharp 32% price jump following news of a PENGU ETF filing from Canary Capital, backed by none other than VanEck. PENGU’s dual exposure—both as a token and a collectible brand—offers diversified upside. Analysts believe that PENGU could rise 15 to 20 times this year, with a target price of $0.20 as it gains popularity in both the cryptocurrency and traditional financial markets. It has cultural significance, high trade volumes, and ETF tailwinds, making it one of the best prospects for 2025. Final Thoughts: Meme Mania 2.0 Has Officially Begun With Dogecoin’s ETF approval all but guaranteed, the next wave of meme coins is preparing for liftoff. Little Pepe brings fresh tech and viral energy. Dogecoin has the legacy and ETF tailwind. Fartcoin is unexpectedly gaining real credibility. And PENGU is leading a new kind of meme-NFT hybrid revolution. Investors who missed the 2021 meme run are now getting a rare second chance.

Pep eusd Chart By TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.00000888, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00000824. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe up today? Pepe’s price gained minor buying pressure after sellers failed to gain control. This triggered strong buying demand, pushing the price toward $0.00001. Will Pepe Recover? If buyers hold the price above the $0.00001 level strongly, we might see further upward rally in the Pepe price chart. What is Pepe price prediction for 2025? The Pepe price prediction for 2025 expects the meme coin to record a maximum level of $0.000035. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040. Recent news A whale moved 500 billion $PEPE worth $3.85M to Binance after facing a huge $450,000 loss for holding $PEPE for 40 days. PEPE Price Prediction July 2025 If BTC price records robust surges this month, we might see PEPE price skyrocketing. We expect the PEPE price to record minimum and maximum prices of $0.000008 and $0.000017, respectively. The average price might be around $0.000011. Month Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) July 2025 0.000008 0.000011 0.000017 Pepe price prediction 2025 The Pepe roadmap is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. Despite its robust community, this lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2025 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. In 2025, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000005. It may peak at a maximum value of $0.000035, with an average trading price of $0.000027 throughout the year.

For instance, Shiba Inu is developing Shibarium, a layer-two scaling solution on Ethereum , alongside various protocols and tools for its community. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is enhancing tools and libraries that facilitate the integration of $DOGE as a payment option for businesses.

Since the early April slide, Wall Street's tech-heavy Nasdaq index has surged 31%, while the broader S&P 500 index has rallied 24%, according to data source TradingView. Other major indices, such as Germany's DAX, France's CAC, Japan's Nikkei, and China's Shanghai Composite, have lagged behind Wall Street. Both Nasdaq and the S&P 500 traded at record highs Thursday. Demand for U.S. Treasury notes has held up amid concerns about fiscal sustainability, as noted by CoinDesk last month. The data contradicts the popular narrative that capital flows are rebalancing away from the U.S. en masse due to debt jitters and President Donald Trump's trade war and repeated criticism of the Federal Reserve. ""Several key factors that underpinned U.S. exceptionalism remain fully intact and are perhaps even strengthening further,"" Hani Redha, portfolio manager, head of strategy and research for global multi-asset at PineBridge Investments, wrote in a blog post published last month. Redha pointed to deregulation under Trump as a key factor supporting the US’s productivity supercycle – unique among global peers – and its lead globally. Economy validates U.S. exceptionalism Other economic variables, such as the real per capita GDP growth, also support the exceptionalism narrative. The metric measures the rate at which the value of goods and services produced per person in an economy is adjusted for inflation. ""The U.S. massively outperforms the EU in terms of real per capita GDP growth. The reasons for that are deeply structural and haven't changed one bit. U.S. exceptionalism - for growth at least - is here to stay...,"" Robin Brooks, senior fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution, said on X . The U.S. jobs data released Thursday further added another stake in the ‘loss of American exceptionalism narrative, as Bruce J Clark, head of rates at Informa Global Markets, said on LinkedIn. Implications for BTC and DXY The return of U.S. exceptionalism to U.S. stocks can be viewed as a positive development for bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market, given the historical positive correlation between the two. BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has already risen 44% to $108,000, rallying swiftly from the early April lows of nearly $75,000, according to CoinDesk data. Moreover, with the pro-crypto president in the White House, one may argue that bitcoin is part of the U.S. exceptionalism play. Meanwhile, the return of U.S. exceptionalism could also put a floor under the U.S. dollar. ""With today’s jobs data putting another stake in the ‘loss of American exceptionalism’ narrative, the temptation to get long dollars here for a counter-trend trade is big and growing,"" Clark noted , adding the ECB officials' growing discomfort with the strong euro. Early this week, the FT reported , quoting a senior ECB official, that the central bank may need to signal that too much strengthening in the euro could be an issue, as it might lead inflation to hover below targets. Meanwhile, in an interview with Bloomberg, ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos said that ""overshooting"" of the euro should be avoided, flagging levels above 1.20 as complicated.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Stocks|News,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|REGULATION|ASIA|FIAT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-05 17:18:10
47556575,https://thecoinrise.com/singapore-mas-tightens-grip-on-crypto-crimes-with-bank-fines/,1751735999,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/47556575.jpeg,Singapore Tightens Grip on Crypto Crimes with S$27.5M in Bank Fines,https://thecoinrise.com/singapore-mas-tightens-grip-on-crypto-crimes-with-bank-fines/,"Singapore’s financial watchdog, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), has fined nine major financial institutions a total of S$27.5 million, equivalent to $21.5 million. The penalties were issued for failures in anti-money laundering (AML) controls. This brings to a close a major S$3 billion money laundering case that shocked the country in 2023. As part of a broader global trend, Singapore is now tightening its rules to stop illegal money and punish those who break the law. MAS Names and Fines Nine Financial Giants for AML Breaches MAS announced the fines on July 3. Some of the world’s biggest names in finance were included: Credit Suisse, UBS, Citibank, UOB, Julius Baer, LGT Bank, and asset manager Blue Ocean. The regulatory agency revealed that these firms failed to detect or prevent illegal money from flowing through their systems. Credit Suisse’s Singapore branch got the most significant penalty, 5.8 million, for serious weaknesses in its AML efforts. Other banks, such as UBS, Citi, and UOB, were also fined for similar failings. UOB, the third-largest bank in Singapore, announced that it has implemented changes to address the issues and enhance its compliance systems. MAS also took action against four people linked to the case. They were banned from working in finance for up to six years. This is similar to the 2023 ban on 3AC’s two founders, who were barred for nine years. Inside Singapore’s Biggest Money Laundering Scandal This scandal started in August 2023. Police raided many luxury properties and arrested ten Chinese nationals. These individuals were later found guilty of moving illegal funds into Singapore. The money was used to buy expensive homes, luxury items, and cryptocurrencies. After being sentenced to jail terms ranging from 13 to 17 months, the individuals were deported and banned from returning to Singapore. This is Singapore’s most serious enforcement action since 2016, when it shut down BSI Bank over the 1MDB scandal. Singapore Tightens Crypto Rules to Fight Financial Crime Cryptocurrency was part of a recent money laundering case in Singapore. The police took some digital assets because they were linked to illegal money. This has raised concerns about how crypto can be used for money laundering, and why stronger rules are needed. To prevent this, Singapore is strengthening its crypto laws. From June 2025, crypto companies that serve people outside the country must get a license under the Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA). People can no longer use credit to buy crypto or earn rewards from it. Additionally, if someone sends more than SGD 1,500, they must comply with the Travel Rule, which requires complete ID checks. DeFi platforms and crypto wallets may also face new regulations if they offer services to everyday users or generate revenue from token transactions.

As for the broader crypto sector as gauged by the CoinDesk20 Index (CD20), it is up 0.27% during the same period. On July 1, BCH reached $526.5 — its highest price in eight months — as market enthusiasm, whale accumulation, and speculative inflows helped propel the token more than 75% higher over the past three months. The surge, briefly taking BCH above $528, coincided with a substantial increase in daily trading volume, which tripled to over 120,000 tokens exchanged within a 24-hour span. Much of the buying interest was attributed to capital rotation into mid-cap cryptocurrencies, as investors sought gains beyond the majors during a period of broader crypto market strength. On-chain fundamentals, however, remain lackluster. Daily active BCH addresses have dropped to a six-year low, suggesting that the rally is being driven more by speculation than by increased network utility. Despite this disconnect, technical indicators point to further upside potential. In late June, a golden cross formation appeared on BCH’s hourly chart—where the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day MA—a historically bullish signal. Adding to the speculative momentum, open interest in BCH derivatives rose 27.4% this past week to $578 million. Analysts are watching the $478 to $508 range closely, viewing it as a key support zone that could stabilize the current pullback. On July 4, analytics firm IntoTheBlock reported a 122.45% increase in large whale transactions involving over $100,000 in BCH, totaling 957,440 tokens worth approximately $482 million. This sharp rise in high-value transfers echoed earlier activity spikes seen in February, May, and late June—all of which preceded major price movements. A separate development on July 5 raised further intrigue, when a 10,000-BCH transaction worth roughly $5 million was flagged just prior to the historic movement of 80,000 dormant BTC — valued at over $8.5 billion. Experts suggest the BCH transfer may have served as a key test of wallet access before executing the massive Bitcoin transaction, which was the largest of its kind in over a decade. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin Cash Foundation published its July 1 update highlighting the release of Knuth v0.68.0, which unifies the node’s codebase and lays the groundwork for future UTXO efficiency upgrades. While no major adoption headlines emerged this week, smaller community projects continue to explore BCH-based micropayments and NFTs. Roger Ver, a longtime proponent of Bitcoin Cash, remains publicly active in promoting BCH as a scalable alternative to bitcoin, though his recent advocacy has not been accompanied by any new institutional product launches. Technical Analysis Highlights BCH traded within a $7.52 (1.57%) range between $481.83 and $489.35 from July 4 15:00 to July 5 14:00. Strong support was observed at $481.83 with elevated volume during the 04:00 hour on July 5. Resistance formed at $489.43, where repeated selling pressure capped gains. From 13:06 to 14:05 UTC on July 5, BCH gained $1.20 (0.25%), briefly breaking above $483.25 on rising volume.

Ethereum ( ETH ) was trading at around $2,500 at the last check on Saturday, July 5, within a narrow range it has maintained since May. Third-party data shows that whales and Wall Street investors have increased their Ethereum positions in the past few months. SoSoValue shows that spot ETH ETFs added over $219 million in assets this week, continuing a trend that started in May. It was the eighth consecutive week of inflows, a sign that these investors expect its price to rebound. More data indicates that whales continued to buy Ethereum this week, with addresses holding between 10 million and 100 million tokens increasing their positions to 64 million tokens. Similarly, as the chart below shows, the supply held by top addresses continued its strong uptrend, reaching a high of 75.6 million.

StakingRewards data shows a net increase of 2 million coins, worth over $4 billion, in staking pools. This increase has pushed the staking ratio to 29.45% and the staking market cap to nearly $90 billion. The ETH outflow from exchanges, coupled with rising staking, signals a shift from short-term trading toward long-term holding and yield generation. It reflects increased trust in Ethereum’s ecosystem, rising decentralization, and a maturing investor base. Ethereum price technical analysis ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Ethereum price has remained in a tight range since May this year. The accumulation and distribution indicator has continued rising and is hovering near its highest level this year. Ethereum has formed a bullish flag pattern, comprising a vertical line and a horizontal consolidation. This pattern often leads to a strong bullish breakout, equivalent to the height of the flagpole. In this case, the flagpole has a height of about 52%, and measuring it from the breakout point gives a target price of $4,287. Gains to that target level will be confirmed if it rises above last year’s high of $4,100. The bullish Ethereum price forecast will become invalid if it drops below the psychological point at $2,000.

Leading the charge is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , dominating presale headlines and positioning itself as the best crypto to buy in 2025. The project is valued at $0.03 during phase 5 of the presale, which is over 60% sold out. Investors who purchase at this time will get 100% returns on investment as soon as the token gets listed. A total of over $11.5 million has already been raised, and over 12,700 early investors are present. When the presale is in Phase 6, the token will be priced at $0.035, reflecting a 16.67% return on any stage 5 investment. While XRP moves cautiously through macro headwinds, Mutuum Finance is racing forward, tapping into fresh liquidity and FOMO-fueled momentum. XRP Holds Firm as Investors Hunt for High-Growth Altcoins XRP is currently trading at around $2.20, and is very well within its trade range of 2.15-$2.25. Although the positive legal outcome and ETF hopes kept Ripple afloat, investors are hesitating to get involved; after all, there are other tokens with lower price points that also have stronger popularity. Technical analysts are indicating the XRP to be in a consolidation process, with an upward trajectory toward $2.90-$3.00, in case of a positive outlook of the crypto psychological market. However, most of the traders are trying to find more aggressive growth in more volatile presale tokens such as Mutuum Finance. Strong Demand Powers Mutuum Finance Presale Success More than $11.7 million has been raised and over 12,700 investors joined the presale. This points to increased confidence of investors in the short-term success of the project and its long-term perspective. Mutuum Finance Sparks a Shift in Decentralized Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is disrupting DeFi lending with a platform in which customers retain total control of their assets and passively diversify to achieve the highest earning potential through a versatile safe system. The system is a sustainable dual-lending system that balances the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. In the P2C model, lending pools are governed by a smart contract. The system is made sensitive to real-time market conditions, a feature that makes returns to lenders more ascertainable and borrowers financially sound. And then there is the P2P model that does away with middlemen entirely and has the users come to terms with each other. This direct lending is especially useful with less solid assets like meme coins because in such cases, flexibility and control are given importance. Mutuum Finance To mark its initial success and as a way of giving back to society Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is organizing a huge $100,000 giveaway . 10 winners out of the early investors will be chosen to receive $10,000 each in Mutuum Finance tokens. Through its innovative leaderboard system the top 50 Mutuum Finance holders will be rewarded. As the users level up they will be rewarded in bonus tokens holding fun and competitive token. The system drives both excitement and loyalty and bootstraps ecosystem growth in high-gear. CertiK-Audited and Certified Mutuum Finance is turning momentum into measurable credibility. A rigorous smart contract audit by CertiK, the blockchain industry’s premier security firm, has confirmed that the codebase meets high levels of transparency and safety, giving investors and users peace of mind. Over $11.7 million raised and 12,700+ investors confirm strong confidence in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). At just $0.03, Phase 5 offers buyers 100% returns upon listing.

Referencing a statement that “cryptocurrency may produce the world’s first trillionaires in the next decade,” SMQKE underscored how the altcoin sector’s exponential growth is poised to challenge and overcome skepticism surrounding digital assets as viable investments. He argued that the current phase of adoption remains underestimated and that those ignoring the sector now risk missing what he called “the largest wealth transfer in history.” Early Adopters Versus Traditional Investors SMQKE drew a parallel between the ongoing rise of digital assets and the internet boom of the 1990s. However, he noted that the shift toward cryptocurrencies is likely to unfold even more forcefully, widening the gap between early crypto-native investors and those who stick to traditional strategies. According to him, early adopters of digital assets will accumulate wealth at a pace surpassing that of the most successful technology investors of previous decades. He framed this trend as a historic rebalancing of financial power, favoring those who engage early in the crypto space. To reinforce his analysis, SMQKE highlighted a historical example from early 2018. During that period, Ripple’s cofounder and former CEO, Chris Larsen , reportedly became one of the wealthiest individuals globally, largely thanks to his holdings of XRP and equity in Ripple. This milestone occurred during a relatively modest adoption wave when XRP’s price rose dramatically to over $2.50 per coin. SMQKE referenced this event as merely a preview of what he believes will happen on a much larger, global scale as the next phase of cryptocurrency adoption unfolds. Remember, back in early 2018, during a modest wave of adoption, Ripple cofounder Chris Larsen briefly became one of the richest people on the planet thanks to XRP’s explosive rise and his stake in the company. That was just the beginning. The next wave is global. It is… https://t.co/HA22lOFzp0 pic.twitter.com/XB6HAXPBTt — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 4, 2025 Global Scale and Regulatory Frameworks Looking ahead, SMQKE described the forthcoming wave of growth as “global,” “regulated,” and “built for scale.” He suggested that the conditions now emerging—including increasing regulatory clarity and scalable blockchain infrastructure—set the stage for an even more significant market expansion than what was seen in 2018. He emphasized that the earlier XRP rally and the wealth it generated for its founders were just “a warm-up,” implying that the next decade could see much larger fortunes created.

33767162,[object Object],1751736656,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Mempool Is Almost Empty Again — What’s Happening?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-mempool-almost-empty-again-what-happening/,"The Bitcoin price witnessed another week of indecisive action , bubbling between the consolidation range of $105,000 and $110,000. The premier cryptocurrency briefly broke above the $110,000 mark on Thursday, July 3, but failed to hold above the psychologically relevant threshold on the day. Despite the price resilience of Bitcoin, the market inactivity of a certain class of investors known as retail investors has persisted over the past few weeks. According to the latest on-chain data, the absence of this investor cohort is leading to a rare phenomenon on the Bitcoin network. What Does An Almost Empty Mempool Mean? In a July 4 post on the X platform, Alphractal CEO and Founder Joao Wedson revealed that the Bitcoin network is currently witnessing a period of low activity. This trend of minimal blockchain activity has led to an uncommon phenomenon where the Mempool is almost empty. For context, the mempool refers to a temporary storage area where pending BTC transactions wait to be confirmed. The mempool is typically congested during periods of elevated on-chain demand and network activity, as several transactions await processing. However, recent on-chain data from Alphractal shows that most transactions have been confirmed, leaving the mempool almost empty. The relevant on-chain metric here is the Bitcoin Mempool Transactions , which looks at the number of BTC transactions in the mempool at a given time. According to Joao Wedson, this occurrence is a clear sign that retail investors have stayed out of the market over the past few months — as the almost nonexistent backlog reflects reduced demand for the Bitcoin network. Hence, a future increase in the mempool transactions could mean a return of retail demand to the market. Impact On Bitcoin Price Typically, low transaction activity and an almost empty mempool are not a good sign for the price of BTC, as it reflects low demand from retail investors. However, there is no denying the shift in the market since the launch of the spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETF) As Bitcoinist reported earlier, the Bitcoin price has managed to remain steady despite the low retail demand, thanks to institutional players and spot ETF investors. The BTC exchange-traded funds, for instance, look set for their fourth consecutive week of positive capital inflows. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $107,700, reflecting an almost 2% decline in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the flagship cryptocurrency is up by almost 5% in the past two weeks.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin Activity|Bitcoin mempool|bitcoin price|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-07-05 17:30:56

In a third-quarter fixed income outlook note seen by Reuters , BlackRock analysts say that growing government debt is weakening demand for key US assets like the dollar and long-dated Treasuries. While de-dollarization may be far-fetched, the analysts say the government’s fiscal situation is increasing that risk, especially following the passage of President Trump’s tax and spending bill, which is expected to add up to $5 trillion to the national debt over the next five years. Says BlackRock, “We’ve been highlighting the precarious position of the US government’s indebtedness for some time now, and, if left unchecked, we view debt as the single greatest risk to the ‘special status’ of the US in financial markets.” The firm’s investment managers also warn that an increasing amount of government spending is being allocated to paying off interest on the debt. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), the US is projected to spend 5.3% of its GDP – about 29% of all its revenue – on interest on the national debt by 2034. BlackRock says there may not be enough natural demand to scoop up the amount of debt the US is trying to sell, which could prop up yields and make its debt burden even worse. “Despite proposed spending cuts, deficits are still climbing – and more of that spending is now going toward interest payments… With foreign investors stepping back and the government issuing more than half a trillion dollars of debt weekly, the risk of private markets being unable to absorb this debt and consequently pushing government borrowing costs higher, is tangible.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Pepeto Could Mirror Doge and SHIB Past Price Rallies appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The memecoin world is going through a big transformation. Where tokens once thrived purely on hype, there’s a new preference for projects that blend strong communities with usable technology. # Pepeto ($PEPETO) has quickly become a standout, and it isn’t just another frog meme coin. Instead, it’s stepping up as a serious contender by solving problems that Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) never addressed. Thanks to its generous staking incentives, cross-chain features, and its own meme-focused exchange, # Pepeto is setting itself apart. As the presale inches toward its final goal, interest among early investors is rising fast. With a roadmap that prioritizes real tools and long-term value, Pepeto isn’t just surfing the meme trend it’s driving it forward. How Pepeto Compares to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu At present, Dogecoin is priced at $0.1622 , showing a short-term bearish pattern. Over the past day, its trading volume has fallen by more than 42%. Source: CoinMarketCap Support sits around $0.1600 if this breaks, more losses could follow. The next resistance stands at $0.1700, which DOGE needs to retake to regain bullish traction. Shiba Inu is facing similar weakness, now trading at $0.00001128 . It’s dealing with falling volume and sliding investor interest. Source: CoinMarketCap Support has held near $0.00001100 so far, but dropping below could send it to the $0.00001050 range. With no clear catalysts on the horizon, Pepeto ’s focus on real-world functionality is starting to look like a major advantage. Pepeto’s Distinct Advantage: Technology and Staking Pepeto has already made waves, securing more than $5.5 million in presale contributions just shy of its $5.77 million target. The token remains affordably priced at $0.000000138, giving early supporters an appealing entry. One of its main draws is the impressive 270% annual staking reward, paid out at over 32 million $PEPETO per Ethereum block. This encourages long-term holding while strengthening the network. Of the total 420 trillion tokens, 30% are reserved for staking rewards and another 30% for presale buyers. An audit of the smart contract has further built investor confidence. A first sneak peek into the $Pepeto Exchange is finally here. Live trading charts, swap and bridge features, and over 850 high-quality tokens already approved for listing once $Pepeto secures its Tier 1 exchange.

Highlights include the release of its exchange and bridging tools, multi-phase exchange listings, and the rollout of staking. On the marketing side, Pepeto has planned an aggressive campaign, with influencer partnerships and social promotions ramping up.

A growing wave of startups is racing to cash in on generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and others, tools that promise to deliver answers directly rather than wading through the traditional Google results page. At least a dozen companies, including Athena and Profound, have secured millions of dollars to help brands adapt to the coming shift and ensure they remain visible in this new landscape. AI chatbots are rising to become the new search gatekeepers For decades, brands have optimized for Google’s first “10 blue links.” But today, those links are being bypassed altogether. Startups like Athena, founded by a former Google search engineer, offer “answer engine optimization” tools that analyze how AI chatbots ingest and surface brand content. Athena, launched last month with $2.2 million from Y Combinator , now serves clients who want to influence how AI models present their information. Similarly, Profound , backed by Kleiner Perkins and Khosla Ventures, has raised more than $20 million to help large companies, including Chime, understand and shape how AI systems reference them in answers. Google is on the defensive from competition and legal headwinds Google is hardly standing still. In 2024, the search giant launched AI Overviews, concise summaries at the top of search results, and expanded them further with AI Mode in June 2025, which offers conversational responses instead of page listings. But this AI pivot has drawn criticism. Independent publishers have lodged antitrust complaints in the European Union, arguing that AI Overviews are siphoning off traffic and revenue. Most US news sites have seen substantial drops since the feature’s debut. In the United States, the education technology company Chegg filed a suit in February, accusing Google of using AI Overviews to suppress traffic flows and damage its business, with the first court appearance scheduled as early as next week. With regulators in the EU and UK already scrutinizing Google’s dominance in search and advertising, the tech giant’s attempt to blend SEO with AI is generating significant friction. This new wave of AI optimization tools is rewriting the rules of digital marketing. The term “Answer Engine Optimization” has entered the lexicon to describe techniques aimed at ensuring brands are cited correctly by AI systems like ChatGPT, Google AI Mode, and Perplexity. As Forbes reports, some businesses have already seen significant dips in Google traffic and are urgently adapting to this shift by reformatting their content to align with AI query structures. The trend is accelerating. The AI SEO industry, once nascent, has attracted serious investor interest. Platforms like Athena and Profound have collectively raised tens of millions, with demand growing for tools that offer real-time insights into how AI ranks and references brands. Google faces a serious challenge to maintain market share Google maintains it is not being disintermediated. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet, has emphasized that AI Overviews enhance search by summarizing content and funneling traffic to a greater diversity of sites, not just a few big players. Yet, publishers argue the reality is starker, nearly 70% of news-related searches now end in zero-click queries, up sharply from 56% just a year ago . Meanwhile, OpenAI is reportedly considering its own ad-supported model for ChatGPT, potentially positioning it as a legitimate competitor for Google’s search-advertising revenue stream. A recent IBD analysis projected that “AI search ad spending” might reach $26 billion by 2029, with an open question over how much of that Google will control in a multi-AI ecosystem.

According to the most recent data from BitcoinTreasures, the company has exactly 1,000 BTC stashed, ranking it 31st in the list of corporate treasuries holding the leading asset. A New Crypto Asset For Corporate Treasures Nano Labs Ltd., a Chinese company specializing in the production of mining chips and Web3 infrastructure, which is publicly traded on the NASDAQ, has shared a press release stating that it has purchased 74,315 Binance Coin (BNB). The price per coin averaged $672.45, and the total transaction is valued at about $50 million. The native token of the leading crypto exchange is currently the fifth-largest by market cap, according to current CoinGecko data, hovering around the $100 billion mark. CryptoPotato recently reported on Nano Labs’ intention to acquire BNB through a $500 million convertible note deal. Encouraging the initiative, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) disclosed that neither he nor any of his affiliates took part in the fundraiser, though he “remains extremely supportive.” The company also plans to apply for a stablecoin license in Hong Kong and has specifically mentioned building regulatory frameworks for BTC & BNB. With this purchase, their total reserve of digital currencies is around the $160M mark, which includes Binance Coin and Bitcoin. This makes Nano Labs the first publicly traded company to hold BNB in its reserves, but others are also following suit . Before the end of last year, the company also announced that it had begun accepting payments in Bitcoin. “Nano Labs’ acceptance for payments in Bitcoin aligns with its long-term vision of staying at the forefront of technology advancements and delivering added value to clients worldwide.

On July 4th, Decrypt reported that Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer formally directed police, taxmen, and the state Enforcement Authority to step up the seizure of crypto holdings. The move comes after a law was passed in November 2023 making confiscation of digital assets lawful if their owners are unable to account for its origin—without accusations of any offense. Over $8.4 million in assets has already been seized by authorities through the law. Strömmer underscored how much better agencies can coordinate efforts when they conduct investigations into wealth tied to crypto by saying it’s “time to turn up the pressure.” Why Sweden Is Ramping Up Crypto Enforcement The operation comes on the heels of mounting concern regarding cryptocurrency activity in Sweden’s illegal economy. In a report released in September 2024 jointly by Sweden’s Police Authority and Financial Intelligence Unit, money laundering sites for groups involved in drug trafficking and fraud were exposed by certain crypto exchanges. The report urged authorities to increase their presence on crypto sites in order to disrupt illicit finance streams. With an estimated 62,000 participants in organized crime activity discovered within Sweden, cryptocurrencies have become a strategic focus due to their anonymity and borderless nature. Seized Bitcoin: Future Asset or Legal Limbo? The support also extends to Parliament. Sweden Democrat Dennis Dioukarev, who became newsworthy for demanding a national Bitcoin reserve, has proposed redirects seized crypto—especially Bitcoin—to Sweden’s central bank, the Riksbank. “Money taken from criminals would make Sweden financially stronger,” Dioukarev demanded. Yet the government has not indicated what it will do with the crypto it seizes from criminals. Strömmer’s office would not comment on whether such assets will be sold, retained, or added to a national reserve—leaving the fate of seized holdings uncertain. A New Digital Asset Era for Swedish Law Sweden’s move is a paradigm shift in how governments could address mysterious wealth in the era of crypto. While the policy has ignited privacy and due process concerns, authorities see the move as necessary to stay one step ahead of evolving financial crime. As more governments grapple with controlling virtual assets, Sweden’s controversial model could become a European—and world—blueprint.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-07-05 17:39:00

According to the settlement administration portal, impacted customers at Arizona-based Evolve Bank & Trust who file a claim and provide documentary evidence of losses resulting from the data breach stand to receive up to $3,000. A flat cash payment of $20 will also be available but claimants can only choose one or the other, not both. “In addition to selection one of the Cash Payment options, Settlement Class Members may elect one (1) year of monitoring that will provide the following benefits: Credit Monitoring, real-time alerts, and insurance coverage for up to $1,000,000 for identity theft.” Claims must be filed by October 30th. A final approval hearing of the settlement will be held on November 14th. The lawsuit against Evolve Bank & Trust was filed in January and alleges that cybercriminals infiltrated the billion-dollar lender’s information systems and gained access to sensitive and confidential information. In a notice to customers in July of 2024, Evolve Bank said the data breach had occurred between February and May of 2024. “…it appears the criminals downloaded information from our databases and a file share that included names, Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, and contact information for most of our personal banking customers, as well as customers of our Open Banking partners. We have also learned that personal information relating to our employees was also likely affected.” Evolve Bank & Trust, which started as First State Bank in 1925, is headquartered in West Memphis, Arizona.

With a surge in interest and a growing community, this coin is poised for significant growth. Find out which rising star could soon rival the likes of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu . Dogwifhat Price Movements and Key Levels Analysis WIF experienced a weekly advance of 8.50% despite a monthly decline of 4.61%, followed by a six-month drop of 60.12%. Price action fluctuated within a range of $0.642 to $1.081, reflecting significant volatility over time. Technical measures hinted at a balance with the Awesome Oscillator at 0.012 and a Momentum Indicator at 0.045. The Relative Strength Index lingered near 49.56, suggesting that buying and selling pressures are nearly equal. Past performance reflects intermittent bullish spurts and deep bearish corrections, shaped by market dynamics and inherent coin volatility. The current situation reveals a price oscillating between solid support at $0.42 and sharp resistance at $1.30, with a second resistance up to $1.738. Price remains in a narrow band, indicating no clear trend from bulls or bears. Overall sentiment leans slightly bearish, shown by a Summary Recommendation of -0.155 and a Moving Average Recommendation of -0.40. Some technical signals, including a positive Oscillators Recommendation of 0.091, hint at recovery potential. Traders may consider long positions near support, with attention to a break above $1.30 for upward momentum, while preparing defensive measures if support at $0.42 fails. Pepe (PEPE) Price Snapshot: Past Trends and Current Levels Pepe experienced notable shifts over the past month and six months. A one-month decline of 18.08% indicates short-term challenges, while a six-month drop of 53.18% points to a longer-term downturn. A quick one-week gain of 5.78% suggests minor recovery attempts amid ongoing volatility. Price movements show a market under pressure where declining trends have dominated, yet brief intervals of upward movement hint at potential opportunities for committed buyers. The current trading range places Pepe’s price between $0.0000075 and $0.0000128, with support at $0.0000053 and resistance at $0.0000159. Technical indicators reflect a nearly balanced market sentiment with an RSI reading of 45.35. Bulls are attempting to push the price upward, as shown by the recent one-week gain. However, the steep drop over the last month and the significant decline in the past six months highlight the prevailing bearish bias. Traders might consider buying on dips near support while monitoring for any upward breakout signals near resistance. Pudgy Penguins Price Surge Amid Mixed Longer-Term Trends PENGU rally over the past month has lifted prices by nearly 62%, contrasting with a six-month decline of about 59%. This highlights a volatile market history. A one-week jump of roughly 52% indicates a recent surge in buying interest, which may not last. Previous trading sessions have shown rapid gains followed by a return to bearish pressures over a longer period. Short-term jumps can mask deeper struggles that intermittently weaken momentum in the long term. Current price action faces resistance near $0.02, with another barrier around $0.03. Support levels remain low at approximately $0.00, offering little cushion if bearish pressure returns. Oscillator readings show an RSI of 72, signaling strong short-term buying energy, although momentum indicators suggest caution. Bulls are in temporary control, but the lack of a clear trend warrants vigilance. Traders could target breakouts near resistance while staying aware of potential retracements. Conclusion WIF , PEPE , and PENGU all have strong communities and unique appeals. Each has potential to attract the attention currently held by Dogecoin and Shiba Inu . These coins benefit from their growing popularity and increased social media engagement. The right marketing and user adoption can position them as significant players in the meme coin space. Keeping an eye on these coins could reveal which one will rise to challenge the dominance of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

However, a new project is taking the spotlight in crypto circles, Ruvi AI (RUVI) . Analysts have been bullish on Ruvi AI, forecasting an impressive 13800% ROI , largely thanks to its utility-driven approach and structured growth taking inspiration from Cardano’s strategic methodology. With $2.2 million raised , 180 million tokens sold , and an investor base exceeding 2,000 holders , Ruvi AI has shown early successes that suggest this could be the next big opportunity for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Here’s why analysts believe Ruvi AI’s potential could outshine its peers. Security and Transparency at the Core Ruvi AI has gained recognition for prioritizing transparency and security, two critical elements in building investor confidence, especially in the volatile world of crypto. Its third-party audit by CyberScope is a testament to this commitment, ensuring the smart contracts behind Ruvi AI are robust and free from vulnerabilities. For investors, this audit provides peace of mind that the project’s foundation is reliable and future-proof. Additionally, Ruvi AI’s partnership with WEEX Exchange guarantees post-presale liquidity , ensuring token holders have seamless access to trade their assets upon listing. This move not only reinforces trust in the platform but also ensures that investors face no uncertainty about their exit strategy. Real-World Utility Brings Long-Term Value While Cardano has gained admiration for its scalability and problem-solving capabilities in the blockchain world, Ruvi AI echoes a similar focus by addressing real-world challenges through a blend of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) .

This broad, utility-driven approach ensures Ruvi AI remains a relevant and in-demand token, opening doors to continuous value growth. Strong Presale Momentum Validates Growth Prospects With $2.2 million raised in its ongoing presale, Ruvi AI has quickly captured market attention. Over 180 million tokens sold and an investor base of 2,000+ holders showcase the project’s widespread appeal and credibility. At its current Phase 2 price of $0.015 , Ruvi AI is an affordable entry point for investors seeking exponential returns. Upon conclusion of the presale, the token’s value will rise to $0.07 , offering a near 5x ROI to Phase 2 participants. Analysts expect even steeper gains, predicting a $1 valuation post-listing , translating to a 66x ROI and potentially reaching a 13800% ROI long-term. Boost ROI With Ruvi AI’s VIP Investment Tiers Investors looking to maximize their returns have much to gain from Ruvi AI’s VIP tiers , which offer generous bonuses.

In a recent post on X, Farina urged investors to “ Buy XRP before the U.S. Treasury announces this big deal with Ripple ,” suggesting that a transformative development is on the horizon, one that could dramatically shift XRP’s position in the global financial system. Edo Farina Sparks Speculation Edo Farina is no stranger to XRP enthusiasts. Known for his detailed analysis of Ripple’s escrow structure, Farina has long speculated that institutions such as the U.S. Treasury, the IMF, and the BIS may have undisclosed access to escrowed XRP . He recently reignited debate by claiming that a major deal between Ripple and the U.S. Treasury is imminent, a deal that could change the trajectory of the asset and reward early investors handsomely. While his claims are unverified, Farina’s past insights and deep understanding of the XRP ecosystem continue to influence market sentiment. Buy $XRP before the U.S Treasury announces it — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 3, 2025 Ripple’s Strategic Moves with U.S. Regulators What lends weight to Farina’s prediction is the series of aggressive regulatory steps Ripple has taken in recent months. Ripple has officially applied for a U.S. national bank charter and a Federal Reserve master account . If granted, these would give Ripple direct access to the Fed’s payment infrastructure, something no crypto-native firm has achieved to date. Ripple is also expanding its stablecoin ecosystem. Its recently launched RLUSD is already being used to tokenize U.S. Treasuries, a move backed by high-profile partners like BlackRock and Ondo Finance. More than $670 million in tokenized Treasury assets are now live on the XRP Ledger, marking a significant step toward institutional adoption. These are not mere ideas, they’re regulatory filings, on-chain integrations, and strategic partnerships with major players in global finance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Price Outlook and Market Sentiment Despite broader market volatility, XRP has remained relatively stable, hovering around the $2.20 to $2.30 range. Analysts believe that successful approval of Ripple’s charter applications or a formal partnership with the U.S. Treasury could act as a catalyst for a breakout, with targets ranging as high as $10. Chart analysts are also watching closely. Recent patterns suggest XRP may be gearing up for a move toward the $2.65 resistance zone, as bullish momentum continues to build. Reality vs. Hype It’s important to distinguish speculation from fact. While Ripple’s real-world progress is undeniable, no official statement from the U.S. Treasury has confirmed a partnership or strategic deal. Farina’s call to action should be seen as a speculative viewpoint, not insider confirmation. However, the groundwork Ripple is laying, particularly its alignment with U.S. financial regulation, is very real, and could eventually lead to the kind of major announcement Farina anticipates.

A total of 80,000 BTC were transferred to another cryptocurrency wallet. This transfer, confirmed by on-chain data, caused a great resonance in the crypto community, while Bitcoin analyst Sani made a striking claim about the identity of the whale: These BTCs may belong to Roger Ver. Analyst Sani made the following statement in his post on X (formerly Twitter): “I think the 80,000 BTC may belong to Roger Ver. Why? Last year, MrHodl was discussing Roger and his potential BTC holdings during a Twitter Space. After this conversation, I started looking into Roger Ver’s past purchase activity. I compared these dates to my database of unidentified addresses and only identified six addresses with 60,000 BTC.” Related News: Sweden's Minister of Justice Makes Critical Statements on Cryptocurrency: Issues New Instructions Noting that all six of these addresses made transfers today, Sani added that two other addresses that were previously registered in his system with the “Individual X” tag and therefore filtered were also activated. Thus, these chain transactions, which resulted in the transfer of a total of 80,000 BTC, drew attention to Roger Ver. Sani also suggested that this move could be part of a possible deal Roger Ver could make with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Known in the crypto world as “Bitcoin Jesus,” Roger Ver is known as one of the early investors in Bitcoin, but in recent years he has become a controversial figure, particularly with his support for Bitcoin SV. *This is not investment advice.

Currently trading at $105,734, BTC faces declining momentum as short-term holders cash in profits. Institutional interest persists, with public companies snapping up 131,000 BTC in Q2 2025, yet cooling derivatives activity signals a shift to a ranging phase. Amid this slowdown, investors are eyeing new opportunities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi project, is capturing attention with its innovative lending model and presale success. Consequently, many are exploring whether this altcoin could be the next big crypto investment. Mutuum Finance presale surges forward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is advancing rapidly through its presale, now in Phase 5 at $0.03 per token. Over $11,700,000 has been raised since the presale began, with more than 580 million tokens sold and 12,700 holders joining the project. Phase 5 is over 60% filled, signaling that the window to buy at this price is narrowing. The next phase, Phase 6, will see a 16.7% price hike to $0.035, with the token set to launch at $0.06, guaranteeing a 100% return on investment for current buyers. Moreover, analysts project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could hit $3 post-launch in 2025, offering substantial upside. Innovative DeFi lending model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in the crypto market with its dual lending approach. The platform blends Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer systems, ensuring flexibility for users. Peer-to-Contract uses smart contracts to ensure that interest rates are automatically adjusted according to the market conditions to give a stable lending environment. ON the other hand, Peer-to-Peer facilitates direct interactions between the lenders and the borrowers and, as such, is most suitable when it comes to volatile assets that require custom terms. The model combines the priority of transparency and the control that the user can have over it, which distinguishes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) among centralized services. Furthermore, the project’s mtTokens enable users to earn interest while retaining liquidity, tradable within the ecosystem. This utility positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a top crypto for investors seeking practical DeFi solutions. Security and rewards drive confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has finalized a CertiK audit, earning a 95.00 security score with no vulnerabilities in its smart contracts. This robust security bolsters investor trust in the crypto market. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, offering $50,000 in USDT rewards across four severity tiers: critical, major, minor, and low. The team also introduced a leaderboard rewarding the top 50 holders with bonus tokens, incentivizing long-term commitment. Stablecoin and scalability vision Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum, fully collateralized to minimize depegging risks. By stabilizing the price of this stablecoin, lending, staking, and generating yield will be simplified, and the patients will be no longer affected by the volatile crypto market. To reduce gas costs and increase the speed of transactions, the Layer 2 scaling strategy laid out in the project is designed to make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ready to conquer the international market. These characteristics improve the efficiency of capital and the experience of users, which makes this platform the best in the crypto market. Consequently, investors are drawn to its blend of stability and innovation, positioning Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a top crypto to buy now. Looking ahead with optimism As Bitcoin’s rally cools, investors are seeking the best crypto to buy now, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a strong contender. The fact that it was successful in presale, has a secure infrastructure, and some innovative features such as a native stablecoin and Layer 2 scaling makes it a great option. The project’s focus on real-world DeFi utility, coupled with a projected $3 price in 2025, offers significant growth potential. To explore this opportunity, participate in the ongoing presale. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up as a key player in the crypto market, ready to deliver value to early investors.

Let’s explore these questions in our Cryptopolitan price predictions from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Aptos Symbol APT Current price $4.42 Aptos crypto market cap $2.84B Trading volume $160.42M Circulating supply 644.52M All-time high $19.90 on Jan 30, 2023 All-time low $3.09 on Dec 30, 2022 24-hour high $4.46 24-hour low $4.36 Aptos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 5.44% 50-day SMA $4.91 200-day SMA $6.40 Current APT crypto sentiment Bearish Green days 12/30 (40%) Fear and Greed Index 67 (Greed) Aptos price analysis At press time, July 5, Aptos traded at $4.41, a 0.63% recovery in 24 hours, with its trading volume dropping by 39.69%. The price chart shows that Aptos could be heading for a retest after a daily breakout. Aptos 1-day chart price analysis APTUSD chart by TradingView At current levels, Aptos is moving along the moving averages as the market consolidates. The William Alligator trendlines signal low volatility, and the relative strength index is in neutral territory. The MACD histograms indicate little market momentum. Aptos 4-hour chart price analysis APTUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart, like the daily chart, shows waning volatility with negative price momentum on the MACD histograms. Watch the $4.40 level on the chart at the channel’s lower trendline if it breaks downwards. The cryptocurrency could find support near a narrow range of consolidation. Investors should monitor the $4.56 level upon a price reversal. A rally into this area would likely face resistance from an earlier low at the flattening 100-day SMA.

Aptos historic price sentiment Aptos price history chart by CoinGecko Aptos raised seed funding in January 2022, led by a16z. Series A funding included Apollo, Dragonfly, Franklin Templeton, and others. Some members previously worked on the Diem blockchain proposed by Facebook. The Aptos mainnet launched in October 2022 with an initial supply of 1 billion tokens. After the launch hype, Apt fell to its lowest in December 2022, at $3.09. A month later, the tables turned, as it peaked at a time high of $19.90 on January 30, 2023. It pumped, partly driven by the NFT market. Collections such as Aptos Monkeys and Aptomingod have attracted more users. On June 6, it fell below its initial listing price and extended the losses in the preceding months. In October, it started correcting, rising as high as $8.47 in November. In 2024, it broke above $10, reaching $18 in March. From April, it reversed, falling below $10. By September, it had fallen as low as $6. It recovered in October, rising above $7.50. It crossed into November, trading at the $8.9 mark, and rose to as high as $13.91.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. After ADA’s past rallies, LILPEPE emerges in 2025 with a 21,017% upside forecast and game-changing Layer-2 utility. Cardano (ADA) has had its moments in the history of cryptocurrency. With massive rallies in 2017 and again in 2021, it became a symbol of long-term growth potential. But in 2025, a new contender is emerging — not just to compete with ADA, but potentially to outshine it completely with what analysts say could be a 21,017% rally. Meet Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , a viral memecoin with real utility, built to power the next generation of crypto culture through a dedicated Layer-2 blockchain. You might also like: Missed Solana? This crypto under $0.0015 could make millionaires faster than SOL did The Cardano legacy: Explosive past, but slowing momentum? In 2017, Cardano (ADA) surged an incredible 3,400%, riding the first major wave of crypto adoption. It returned again in 2021, with a 1,500% rally that took ADA near $3.00, making it one of the most valuable blockchains by market cap. Today, it trades far below this, around $0.55. Source: TradingView Built as a proof-of-stake alternative to Ethereum, Cardano promised low fees, scientific development, and scalability. But years later, it’s still facing adoption hurdles. While the recent launch of cbADA (wrapped ADA on Ethereum Layer 2 Base) has rekindled DeFi interest, critics argue that the chain has lost momentum. The number of daily active users has declined from over 50,000 to under 20,000. Developers are still building, but traction is moderate compared to other Layer 1s, such as Solana or Base. While ADA still holds long-term promise, its next breakout may take some time. The challenger: Little Pepe Enter Little Pepe , a fresh contender with the soul of a memecoin and the structure of a real tech project. Unlike Dogecoin or Pepe, which were purely cultural movements, LILPEPE is building actual infrastructure for the meme economy. What makes it different? Built on its own Ethereum Layer‑2 for meme token trading Pepe’s Pump Pad is a launchpad for secure, fair memecoin deployments. Zero-tax, bot-resistant trading with ultra-low gas fees. $777,000 viral giveaway fueling massive community growth. Tier-1 exchange listings already confirmed post-launch. Can LILPEPE actually rally 21,017%? The numbers may seem wild, but they’re grounded in the math of memecoin history. Current Presale Price (Stage 4): $0.0013 Target Price for 21,017% gain: $0.273 At $0.273, Little Pepe would still be trading under a $27 billion market cap, just a little below where ADA sat at its 2021 peak. Considering that PEPE hit $1.5 billion with zero utility and DOGE hit $88 billion, a $27 billion valuation for a Layer-2 meme chain isn’t outrageous. In fact, its virality and utility might be what pushes LILPEPE further than its predecessors. Why LILPEPE has the tools for a 21,017% run Let’s break down the factors that could enable such an explosive move: Infrastructure = Stickiness: Most memecoins fade because they have no reason to stay relevant. LILPEPE’s Layer-2 and Pump Pad ecosystem creates ongoing utility for developers and traders. Network Effect: Every memecoin launched on the Pump Pad drives more demand for LILPEPE tokens for fees, staking, and liquidity. Market Fit: Memecoins thrive on hype, and LILPEPE’s $777k giveaway , influencer coverage, and Telegram virality are positioning it for a breakout similar to SHIB in 2021. Presale Model Works: With Stage 4 nearly 80% sold out at the time of writing, and a listing price set at $0.003, early investors are already looking at a potential 2.3x return before launch. If this momentum continues, and LILPEPE becomes the go-to chain for meme launches, a 100x or even 200x run isn’t just possible; it’s structured into the roadmap. How LILPEPE could flip Cardano Here’s the thing: Cardano was once what Little Pepe is now, an early mover, delivering a new solution before anyone else. In 2017, Cardano was a novel proof-of-stake chain. In 2025, LILPEPE is the first Layer-2 built for memes. Before SHIB, there was DOGE. Before Solana, there was Ethereum. Crypto rewards first-of-its-kind tokens, especially when paired with cultural momentum. And in 2025, Little Pepe is both the first and the most viral. If LILPEPE can: Onboard top memecoin creators Dominate transaction volume Sustain token launches through Pump Pad. Expand staking + Layer-2 governance LILPEPE could quickly outperform legacy projects like ADA, especially among the new wave of retail investors looking for low-cost, high-return tokens with real utility. Final thoughts: The Frog might leap further than the chain With memes merging into infrastructure and community replacing brand loyalty, tokens like LILPEPE are poised to go where few dare aim. A 21,017% rally may sound wild, but so did DOGE at $0.74. So did SHIB at a $40B market cap. If Little Pepe becomes the home of meme culture and builds a sticky, transaction-heavy ecosystem, $0.27 could be the beginning. Join the LILPEPE presale before Stage 4 sells out and the next price tier kicks in. This could be a window to get in while it’s still under $0.002.

Since its launch in January 2024, it has garnered strong support from both major investors and regular buyers. IBIT is now the third-highest revenue ETF among more than 1,100 funds managed by BlackRock, demonstrating its rapid growth in a short period. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Boasts of Strong Revenue According to a recent report, IBIT now manages $76 billion in assets. The fund charges a 0.25% fee, which generates approximately $191 million in annual revenue. This puts it just behind two of BlackRock’s largest ETFs, the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF and the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF. However, the IBIT Bitcoin ETF is very close to outpacing these crypto funds in revenue. It is only $20 million behind the top fund and $16 million behind the second. The crypto fund needs just $9 billion more in assets to become the company’s top revenue-generating ETF. If the strong market interest continues, IBIT could reach that goal soon. More people are seeking easy ways to invest in digital assets, which could help the crypto investment fund rise even higher in the rankings. IBIT Named the Fastest-Growing ETF in History IBIT is growing faster than any other ETF ever . It has attracted a significant inflow of investors in a short time, surpassing the inflow of most ETFs in the market. It reached $2 billion in inflows just days after launching. Within six months, it crossed $50 billion in assets, making it one of the fastest-growing ETFs ever. This growth came from steady investments by hedge funds, companies, and financial advisors. This is happening because more people and companies are adding Bitcoin (BTC) into their balance sheet. A Sign of Growing Trust in Bitcoin One reason IBIT is doing well is that it makes buying Bitcoin simple. Investors do not need to open special crypto wallets or worry about how to keep their digital assets safe. With IBIT, they can invest in Bitcoin through a trusted and regulated fund. This makes it easier and safer for many to get involved with the top digital coin. BlackRock says IBIT’s growth demonstrates that more professional investors are now trusting Bitcoin. The way IBIT is growing is like how gold ETFs grew when they first started. This indicates that Bitcoin is beginning to be viewed as a conventional investment , alongside stocks or gold. As a result, the leading crypto asset is becoming a more accepted part of regular investment plans.

Mutuum Finance sits at phase 5 of presale for $0.03. The phase is already over 60% sold out. Having already raised more than $11.7 million raised and attracted over 12,700 investors, Mutuum Finance showing strength. While SHIB’s community-fueled rally hints at short-term gains, Mutuum Finance has long-term potential, with projections placing its 2025 price target near $3, a staggering 9900% ROI from current levels. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Builds Bullish Momentum Shiba Inu (SHIB) is showing signs of bullish momentum in early July currently trading around $0.00001141. Over the past few weeks the token has held a tight trading range but has seen an uptick in on-chain activity and token burns two key indicators that often precede upward movement. Technical analysts point to a potential breakout if SHIB can hold above the $0.00001175 resistance level which could open the door to further gains. While it’s still seen largely as a community-driven meme coin renewed interest from traders and an improving technical outlook are giving SHIB a second wind. Meanwhile newer projects like Mutuum Finance are starting to pull investor attention heading into the second half of 2025. Mutuum Finance Presale Soars Past $11.7 Million Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has reached above 12,700 investors in a presale that exceeds more than $11.7 million. Project hype is at its peak and this is certainly a great sign of the future of the project. MUTM tokens are currently priced at $0.03 in phase 5 but will soar 16.67% in phase 6. This phase is over 60% sold out as investors scramble to get in at the lowest price possible. The demand is becoming exponentially high and the fact that Mutuum Finance is a game-changer in DeFi is all the more valuable considering that it will be amongst the top-trending crypto investments of 2025. MUTM Giveaway: $100,000 in Rewards Up for Grabs Mutuum Finance is set to reward the early supporters it has on its platform and has established a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 participants will be chosen and rewarded with $10,000 MUTM tokens. It will be a reward to the quickly expanding community inside the project and gratitude for early investors. But time’s running out.

The reward is split into four categories critical, major, minor, and low, so it will be guaranteed that all levels of vulnerability will have its reward. This is another step that proves Mutuum has an active attitude to safety and its commitment to the creation of a reliable financial environment. As Shiba Inu (SHIB) gears up for a potential July breakout, savvy investors are turning their attention to the long-term powerhouse, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With over $11.7 million raised, more than 12,700 investors onboard, and the current Phase 5 presale over 60% sold out at just $0.03, the momentum is undeniable.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading at $108,000, lower than this week’s high of $110,000, and 10% above the lowest point this month. Spot Bitcoin ETFs continued their strong performance this week, with their cumulative inflows soaring by $769 million. That’s down from $2.2 billion the previous week. The weekly decline is partially due to the fact that this week had four U.S. trading days, in observance of Independence Day — a federal holiday in the United States. These ETFs have experienced cumulative inflows of $49 billion, indicating that they may surpass the $50 billion mark next week. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, whose ticker is IBIT, has had cumulative inflows of $52.6 billion. IBIT now holds over $76.5 billion in assets, making it one of the biggest ETFs in the United States. It ranks in eighth position among all BlackRock ETFs as it recently passed the iShares Core S&P Total US Stock Market ETF and the iShares Russell 2000 ETF. Observers note that the fund is likely to reach the $80 billion milestone soon. IBIT has been the fastest-growing ETF ever and is continuing to close the gap with the SPDR Gold Trust, which has $101 billion in assets. GLD was established in 2004.

Recently, shareholders of Vanadi Coffee approved a strategy to acquire more Bitcoin for its balance sheet. The publicly-listed chain that currently operates six cafes based only in Alicante, now aims to become the largest Spanish company with a Bitcoin treasury. Swedish gaming and web3 company Fragbite Group is also establishing a Bitcoin treasury to ‘future-proof’ its balance sheet. The firm has also appointed a dedicated director to oversee its Treasury operations.

It has remained above the 200-day Weighted Moving Average and formed two unique patterns that often lead to more gains. It has formed a cup-and-handle pattern and is now in the latter section. It has also formed a bullish flag pattern, which has a tall vertical line and a falling channel. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where Bitcoin breaks out and surges to a high of $144,000 in the coming months. A drop below the lower side of the flag section will invalidate the bullish outlook.

The speaker of the New York City Council, Adrienne Adams, says the most populous US city is allocating $3 million to a guaranteed income program. The program will “provide direct cash grants to expecting mothers and foster youth facing housing insecurity.” Mayor Eric Adams hailed New York City Council’s $115.9 billion budget, which was agreed upon in late June, as the “Best Budget Ever.” While information was scant on how the New York City guaranteed income program will be rolled out, how long it will run, how many participants will be selected and other key details, this is not the first time the Big Apple is allocating funds to such an initiative. In the 2025 financial year, the New York City Council allocated $1.5 million to support a guaranteed income pilot program designed to assist “expectant mothers to improve maternal health and reduce child poverty.” This was the first time municipal funds had been used in a guaranteed income program. To run the program, the city partnered with The Bridge Project, a nonprofit focused on helping low-income expectant mothers. A total of 161 pregnant women experiencing housing insecurity who were selected to participate in The Bridge Project initiative will receive regular income with no strings attached for the first three years of their children’s lives.

He alluded to two things that need to happen for the altcoin to reach this ambitious target. Factors That Will Make XRP Price Surge 35,000% In an X post, Ripple Pundit stated that the XRP price will jump by over 35,000% on the day that Ripple makes their banking license public. He added that the SEC announcement of dropping its appeal will also boost the altcoin further. Ripple has applied for a national banking license with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Related Reading: Can The XRP Price Rally 1,538x To Reach $3,380? Shocking Prediction This move is expected to expand the crypto firm’s services, which is bullish for the XRP price, considering the altcoin’s role in Ripple’s payment solutions. As such, XRP is likely to record more adoption, especially from institutional investors, as the crypto firm onboard more clients through this banking license. Crypto pundit Vincent Van Code also agrees that a Ripple banking license could have a massive impact on the XRP price. He recently predicted that the altcoin could rally to between $30 and $50. It is also worth noting that Brad Garlinghouse declared his 1,000% commitment to XRP, which indicates that the altcoin remains a huge part of the company’s plans. Meanwhile, as Ripple Pundit predicts, an SEC announcement of its decision to drop its appeal in the lawsuit against Ripple would also boost the XRP price. Ripple has already announced its decision to drop its cross-appeal. All that is remaining for the long-running legal battle to end is for the Commission to also drop its appeal. A conclusion of the lawsuit would finally remove the legal uncertainty that had plagued the altcoin for a long while. The Next Wave For XRP Starts Here In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades declared that the next wave for the XRP price starts from the $2.23 level. She claimed that the altcoin has continued to show strength during this consolidation. The analyst added that the Ripple bank charter application added serious momentum at just the right time. The news helped push XRP above the $2.25 resistance. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Is Moving According To Plan, Here’s Why $1.90 Is Important Commenting on the current price action, CasiTrades stated that the XRP price is now seeing rejection at $2.268, which is the .382 retracement of the local wave. She remarked that this suggests that XRP needs another low before launching higher. The analyst said that based on the technical indicators, the next best entry is lining up at $2.235. She explained that this level is the .236 retracement and that multiple internal subwave targets are clustering there. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.22, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

In a new press release , the Fed is prohibiting former Jonah Bank employee Kendall Hickman from participating in activities related to financial institutions after she was allegedly found to have embezzled $33,212 from a nonprofit organization. According to the Fed, Hickman worked for both the Wyoming-based bank as well as moonlighted for an unnamed nonprofit organization as a bookkeeper. She worked for both firms from July 2021 to June 2023, and through unexplained means, she managed to embezzle the funds from the nonprofit, but was allegedly caught by authorities. The Fed says Hickman’s actions “constituted violations of law or regulation and involved personal dishonesty.” Though she has repaid the nonprofit in full and has consented to the enforcement actions against her, she has neither admitted nor denied any of the allegations. The prohibition order notes that taking this enforcement action doesn’t bar it from taking further actions against Hickman later on. If Hickman were to violate this order, she would be charged with separate civil or criminal penalties, according to the press release. Jonah Bank, the nation’s 1,474th-largest bank, has $529 million worth of assets under its management and was established in 2006.

Despite strong on-chain growth—rising transactions, record stablecoin supply, and expanding real-world asset tokenization—Stellar Lumens ( XLM ) plunged to a critical support level amid a sustained negative funding rate, suggesting growing bearish pressure. If this support breaks, XLM could fall another 36%, underscoring the widening disconnect between network fundamentals and market sentiment. This week, Stellar dropped to the key support at $0.2175. That’s down by 35% from its highest point in May. It has also dropped by 62% from its 2024 high. XLM could be at risk of a steeper bearish breakdown as its funding rate crashed to its lowest level since June 30. It has remained in the negative zone on most days since May. A funding rate is a small fee exchanged between long and short traders in perpetual futures contracts to balance the market. A negative rate means that there are more short positions than long positions, with short traders paying long traders. Stellar funding rate | Source: Santiment Still, on the positive side, third-party data shows that the network is doing well. According to Artemis , the number of operations on Stellar rose to 197 million in June, while the stablecoin supply soared to a record high of $667 million. Additional data indicates that the total value locked in real-world asset tokenization has risen to $487 million. It has jumped in the last five consecutive months, helped by the Franklin OnChain US Government Money Market Fund.

The number of active addresses in the network rose by 10% to 146,700. XLM price technical analysis Stellar price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the Stellar Lumens token price dropped to a key support level at $0.2175, a notable point that coincided with the lowest point in April, when most altcoins also plummeted. The support level was the lower side of the descending triangle pattern, a popular bearish continuation pattern. It has moved below the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level, where most rebounds happen. XLM price has dropped below the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages. Therefore, a move below the lower side of the triangle will indicate further downside, with the next key level to watch being at $0.15, which is 36% below the current level.

SHIB surged over 60,000% from its 2020 launch to its early 2021 all-time peak of $0.00008845, only to slide 90% in following years. PEPE rose to a high of $0.0000167 in May 2024, then retraced to lower price levels. Even the late 2024 market bull run wasn’t enough to get it back to record highs. Their volatile cycles rewarded early buyers but offered little structural support. That raises a critical question for investors: which is the best memecoin to buy in 2025? Pepeto’s Ancient Seed, Present Fun, and Future Value New meme token Pepeto was conceived around the image of a mythical frog deity, dubbed the “God of Frogs,” who traversed eras carrying six powerful doctrines: power, energy, precision, efficiency, technology, and optimization. Those doctrines have been translated into measurable components: community influence, active development, curated token listings, high-efficiency utility, interoperable tools, and ongoing performance updates. The approach builds a culturally resonant branding with an infrastructure full of utility, a lauded change away from hype-driven memes. Pepeto Breaks New Ground for Meme-Coin Infrastructure Pepeto has raised approximately US $5.5 million in presale financing while trading at US $0.000000138 per token. Token holders can stake for an estimated 270% annual return, a rare yield in meme tokens. The team recently unveiled a demo of the Pepeto Exchange, complete with live trading visuals, swap and bridge tools, and a library of over 850 approved assets, even before achieving Tier 1 exchange listings. A first sneak peek into the $Pepeto Exchange is finally here. Live trading charts, swap and bridge features, and over 850 high-quality tokens already approved for listing once $Pepeto secures its Tier 1 exchange. While markets remain uncertain, the team behind the God of Frogs… pic.twitter.com/ndk5gYs6y4 — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) June 23, 2025 Over 31 trillion Pepeto ($PEPETO) tokens have been locked into the project’s staking contract, accounting for roughly 7% of the token’s total supply. According to figures released by the development team, stakers can anticipate an annual reward rate of approximately 270%, translating to around 22% monthly returns. Staking payouts will be distributed at a rate of 32,015,981.73 PEPETO per Ethereum block and are scheduled to roll out gradually across a two-year period following the activation of the claim mechanism. Upcoming updates on PepetoSwap integration and mobile apps indicate continuous product rollout. Audited contract code reinforces security fundamentals. Why Now Is the Time to Buy Pepeto A US $100 investment now secures over 724 million Pepeto tokens. Price discovery ahead of Tier 1 listings means potential for a major upside once tradable. The presale stage also supports staking participation, distributing yield to early adopters. Social traction, product features, and transparent tokenomics form a credible foundation when compared to SHIB and PEPE, which rely largely on community sentiment and momentum cycles. Pepeto’s development focus , staking, vaults, audits, live tools, and a bridge-enabled exchange sets it apart from meme tokens built on brand recognition. Deliverable infrastructure, not just social trends, redefines what “holding a meme-coin” means. Analysts expect the broader market entering consolidation phases through late 2025, offering a window where structured tokens outperform sentiment-driven assets. Boosted by yield and development progress, Pepeto may emerge as a top pick for investors seeking both upside and utility. Participation is open now. Visit pepeto.io to secure tokens at current pricing, begin staking for high yield, and gain early access before listings begin. About Pepeto Pepeto is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency project blending the playful spirit of memecoins with a powerful utility-driven ecosystem.

Blockchain analytics platform Whale Alert first flagged the transaction, which came just days before Ripple’s scheduled release of 1 billion XRP from escrow. The timing and scale of this move have raised eyebrows across the crypto community. With Ripple’s routine monthly token unlock known to increase circulating supply, many suspect that SBI’s transfer was a strategic play, possibly to front-run any downward price pressure that might follow the anticipated token release. XRP Holds Steady Amid Uncertainty Despite the noise around this massive transaction, XRP’s price has remained range-bound for weeks. The fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization continues to hover between $2.10 and $2.20, leaving investors in a state of limbo. 320,000,000 #XRP (703,517,724 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallet https://t.co/EzDk6g8ZUw — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) June 30, 2025 Still, technical analyst Lingrid remains optimistic. She believes XRP is quietly positioning for a breakout, supported by a series of bullish patterns within a broad ascending channel. According to her analysis, the altcoin has repeatedly bounced from lower support levels, creating a “stair-step” climb toward a critical resistance line. “As long as XRP holds above the $2.00 support level,” Lingrid explained, “there’s a strong chance we could see a breakout to the $2.45 region. Buyers are steadily building pressure just beneath resistance, suggesting a potential spike is near.” Momentum Building for Next Bullish Leg? Adding to the growing anticipation is well-known crypto strategist DonAlt, whose previous calls on XRP’s price movements have proven remarkably accurate. Reflecting on the current market setup, he suggested that XRP may be gearing up for “Round 2” of its bullish surge. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 His perspective echoes the broader market sentiment that XRP’s recent consolidation could be laying the groundwork for another parabolic move. If history is any indication, such quiet phases often precede explosive price action, especially when accumulation and technical resilience are evident. With the release of 1 billion XRP , the market remains on edge. XRP is currently trading at around $2.22, and all eyes are on whether the asset can break through resistance or succumb to increased selling pressure. Regardless of the outcome, SBI’s massive XRP movement signals that major institutional players are actively positioning themselves ahead of key market events, reminding everyone just how closely the fate of XRP is tied to both strategic foresight and broader market dynamics.

Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Could Do It in Months",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-10000-in-solana-sol-make-you-a-millionaire-by-2030-little-pepe-lilpepe-could-do-it-in-months/,"As more people learn about blockchain technology, Solana (SOL) continues to emerge as a serious player in building fast, low-cost applications. Institutional money is flowing in, and buzz around a possible Solana ETF is growing, prompting people to wonder whether a $10,000 investment today could snowball into millions by 2030. That dream feels far away, yet a fresh meme coin called Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has burst onto the scene and promises eye-popping gains that could show up in a matter of months. While analysts expect Solana to climb steadily over the next few years, early buyers of Little Pepe may experience the explosive profit that has only been heard about in wild crypto stories. Solana’s Bullish Outlook: A Gradual Journey to $500 by 2030 As of July 1, 2025, Solana trades at around USD 147.92, and the charts appear promising. The real excitement surrounding the coin right now stems from the brand-new Solana ETF, set to debut tomorrow, July 2. Fresh, well-heeled money usually floods into a fund when it opens, and that extra buying could push trading volume-and, in turn, demand for SOL-higher yet. Many analysts now expect the price to settle in the $160 to $170 range within a short period. Longer-dated call options, however, had already traded as high as $520 by late 2025 and even reached $500 by 2029, according to notes from VanEck and Standard Chartered Bank. For investors who prefer slow, steady gains, Solana’s past performance and clear roadmap are getting very hard to ignore. Those who still hope for moon-shot profits overnight should remember that big climbs like these rarely happen fast; they usually unfold a little at a time, month after month, year after year. Seasoned traders will tell you patience pays, while anyone craving quicker returns might soon decide Solana moves too slowly to meet their plans. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): A Faster Path to Explosive Growth While Solana aims for slow and steady growth, Little Pepe is sprinting straight toward the moon. Unlike many meme coins that live only on buzz, LILPEPE blends fresh ideas with real speed. Currently, the project is still in presale and has already raised over $2.8 million, selling 2.5 billion out of the 10 billion supply. At just $0.0013 per token, early backers can lock in the price before the official exchange listing at $0.003-a a built-in 2.5x profit the moment trading begins. What sets Little Pepe apart is its new Layer-2 chain, explicitly designed for meme tokens, and a zero-tax trading rule that charges no fees at the wallet level. This design turns a fun project into something investors can use every day without losing cents on each swap. Bold forecasts put LILPEPE on a 50x path by the end of 2025 for anyone willing to stake a small position today. With an active community, a clear roadmap, and Lightning-like technology, the token is already outpacing giants. Why Little Pepe Might Sprint Ahead of Solana Right Now Solana is climbing thanks to its rock-solid technology, high-profile backers, and the new ETF that many believe will attract new buyers and push the price higher. Because of this, long-term investors picture steady adoption nudging the project charts upward over the years. Little Pepe, on the other hand, storms in with zero-fee trading, fun tools, and a lively, hands-on crew that marketers love. While Solana focuses on measured growth, Little Pepe pursues the wild pop that can turn a small bag into a big profit in a matter of weeks. If you want action right now, Little Pepe could be your fast-lane ticket, earning its place as one of the boldest meme-coin bets as we head into 2025. Conclusion: Solana or Little Pepe-Which Investment Fits You? Deciding between Solana (SOL) and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) comes down to your mood toward risk and the kind of reward you want to see from your cash. Solana operates a busy chain that big companies are increasingly noticing, and many professionals believe its price will inch upward in a steady, if slow, manner. Because of this, the coin suits individuals who prefer reliable, consistent gains over significant price drops and sudden price fluctuations. If that sounds like you, let Solana lead your slower, safer profit quest. Little Pepe , on the other hand, can shoot up overnight a meme go viral, so daring traders may chase those massive swings, even though they know the whole bag could vanish. Do you picture turning a tiny bet into a big pile before breakfast? Then Little Pepe may be your ticket. But if you want a smoother ride built on years of solid proof, keep your eyes on Solana as your main plan.

This bold accumulation suggests growing institutional or project-level confidence, hinting at a possible shift in momentum. With SOL trading just below key resistance levels, market watchers are beginning to ask: is this the early signal of a rally that could push Solana back toward the $200 mark? Solana Eyes New Highs Amid Price Swings Source: tradingview Solana (SOL) trades between $138 and $162, showing a recent uptick of over 4% in a week. Despite a monthly dip of just over 3%, the coin holds promise. Key support stands near $122, with resistance looming at $170. If it crosses the second resistance at $194, SOL sees a potential surge, possibly rising by around 20% from current levels. Though it dropped around 31% over six months, the market shows interest, signaling potential growth. A balance between current price support and short-term growth indicates SOL may soon test upper limits with renewed momentum. Conclusion The strategic $2.7 million SOL buy has added a bullish undertone to Solana’s current market position. While resistance levels still need to be cleared, the renewed confidence and improving technical signals point toward a possible upward breakout. If momentum holds, SOL could once again approach the $200 range—turning this treasury move into a potential turning point for the asset’s mid-term trajectory.

With ADA stabilizing near key support and inching upward, attention is shifting to whether other major Layer-1 coins like Polkadot (DOT) and Avalanche (AVAX) could follow suit. Both have faced recent volatility, but technical setups suggest a possible turning point. This week, all eyes are on whether DOT and AVAX can mirror Cardano’s momentum—or carve out their own recovery path. Cardano's Price Holds Steady, Eyes on Potential Growth Targets Source: tradingview Cardano (ADA) is trading between $0.54 and $0.60, showing signs of stabilization around its 10-day and 100-day average of about $0.58. The coin has seen a tiny jump of over 2.5% this week, indicating some recovery momentum. If ADA breaks past its resistance level of $0.63, it could push towards $0.70, a rise of around 17%. Yet, caution lingers as ADA has slid over 13% in the past month and nearly 47.5% in half a year. With its RSI under 46, ADA isn’t overbought, suggesting more room for growth if buying pressure increases. Market watchers are closely monitoring its next moves. Polkadot Holds Steady, Eyes Growth Amid Volatility Source: tradingview Polkadot (DOT) is hovering between just over three dollars, showing a slight drop from last week. The currency is battling near a key resistance level close to four dollars. If Polkadot crosses this, it might climb more than 15% towards the next resistance zone situated in the mid-four dollar range. But if it slips below its current mark, it may test its support near two and a half dollars. Polkadot is trying to find stability with a mild bearish mood as shown by its momentum indicators. However, if it gains upward strength, Polkadot could reverse its downward trend. For now, it's a waiting game to see if the bulls take charge. Avalanche (AVAX) Fights to Break Free from $20 Grip Source: tradingview Avalanche's (AVAX) price currently floats between seventeen and nearly twenty dollars. The coin struggles to push past the twenty-dollar resistance but remains above the strong support near fifteen dollars. Recent patterns show a slight weekly rise of over one percent, but the monthly drop exceeded ten percent. Over six months, the coin’s value has plummeted over fifty percent. If momentum builds, AVAX might target the next resistance at twenty-three dollars, marking a potential gain of around twenty percent from current levels. However, the recent past suggests caution is warranted due to volatile downtrends. The key levels to watch remain clear as holders and potential investors keep an eye on market movements. Conclusion Cardano has shown renewed strength. Interest is now turning to Polkadot and Avalanche. Polkadot looks to expand its capabilities with its unique approach to connecting blockchains. Avalanche is making strides with its efficient network and fast transactions. Both projects have the potential to see increased activity and development. Observers will be watching to see if this momentum will continue or spark similar trends in the coming days. This week could offer more insights into where these projects are heading.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-05 19:25:00

However, Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, sees things differently. Rather than panic, he welcomes the idea of a price drop. Kiyosaki believes that a crash would be a perfect moment to increase his Bitcoin holdings, turning fear into opportunity. A Clear Strategy Behind the Bold Message In a recent X post , Kiyosaki strongly reacted to the ongoing noise surrounding a potential Bitcoin crash. He criticized those spreading fear, claiming that they aim to scare off short-term investors. For him, falling prices are not a problem but an invitation to buy more. Kiyosaki’s approach is not new. He has long seen Bitcoin as a haven against inflation and the weakening of traditional currencies. While others worry about temporary dips, he remains focused on the coin’s long-term value. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $108,062, up by 0.53% in the last 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap data. Robert Kiyosaki hopes the crypto prices drop so he can add more of it to his portfolio. This mindset follows his earlier declaration that he plans to buy more Bitcoin before it reaches a major milestone. He has shared his belief that Bitcoin could climb to $1 million within the next ten years. For Kiyosaki, the market volatility or fear of a downturn does not affect his future expectations. Support from the Bitcoin Community Kiyosaki is not alone in his belief. He referred to fellow Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, who recently predicted much higher future prices. Saylor believes Bitcoin could reach $13 million in the next ten years. He thinks the digital coin might even hit $21 million by the mid-2040s, matching its total supply of 21 million coins. These bold predictions make Kiyosaki even more confident in Bitcoin. He says Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and limited supply are big reasons why it will grow in value over time. Robert Kiyosaki Looks to Bitcoin as the Dollar Loses Strength Robert Kiyosaki’s support for Bitcoin is closely linked to his concerns about traditional paper money, especially the US dollar. Over the years, he has often said that the dollar is losing value. He believes this is because central banks continue to print more money, especially during times of economic crisis. This leads to higher inflation, which makes everyday goods more expensive and savings less valuable. As a result, Kiyosaki views Bitcoin as a more effective way to protect one’s money. Since Bitcoin has a fixed supply, it can maintain its value more effectively over time. He also believes that future economic problems will exacerbate the issues with fiat money, which is why he continues to invest in the top cryptocurrency.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Timmer says that based on a historical relationship between Bitcoin and the global money supply metric the top digital asset by soon print new all-time highs. “With both liquidity improving per the global money supply and the stock market reaching new highs, it’s no surprise that Bitcoin is on the move again. Both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are being supported for now, and Bitcoin should be at new all-time highs soon enough if this momentum continues.” Source: Jurrien Timmer/X Timmer also says that a weakening US dollar may drive more investors into gold and, potentially, Bitcoin as a hedge against currency debasement. “One of the big questions remains whether a new world order is emerging in which the US dollar loses at least some of its supremacy and is supplanted by a mixture of other fiat currencies and hard money (gold and perhaps Bitcoin). Maybe this regime change was signaled three years ago when gold stopped trading in lockstep with real rates.” Lastly, the analyst says the Sharpe ratio is now starting to favor BTC over gold as a better return on investment. The ratio was created by Nobel laureate William Sharpe and is designed to show the amount of return an investor could potentially get for enduring the volatility of a risky asset. “With risk appetites rising, the baton has been passed back to Bitcoin, following the pattern of recent months. You can see that in the chart below, with the two Sharpe ratios converging.” Source: Jurrien Timmer/X Bitcoin is trading for $107,792 at time of writing, down 1.9% in the last 24 hours.

If this claim is confirmed, this incident could go down in the history of cryptocurrencies as the biggest digital theft. Grogan also shared an important detail supporting his claim: “14 hours ago, a low-amount test transaction was carried out on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network from an address belonging to the BTC whale cluster. This may have been done to understand whether the private key was valid.” He noted that all BTC assets started to move within approximately 1 hour after this transaction. Related News: Japan's Prominent Bank Announces Collaboration with a Surprising Altcoin Conor Grogan emphasized that this test operation, especially on the BCH network, was remarkable and said, “BCH is not very well tracked by whale tracking systems. So it is as if the address owner tested the private key here in order to remain anonymous.” Moreover, other BCH addresses connected to the same set of wallets are still dormant, further raising suspicion, according to Grogan: “If someone gained access to their wallets, why didn’t they also take their other BCH balances?” Grogan also stated that he found the possibility of this address belonging to a major exchange weak. The presence of both BCH transactions and the fact that BTC transfers appear to have been made manually indicate that these movements indicate individual access, not an exchange system. “If this is truly a hack, it could be the biggest digital theft in human history,” he said. However, Grogan added that the data he had was not yet conclusive and that all findings were speculative at this stage. *This is not investment advice.

Moscow attaches importance to boosting investments in infrastructure and raising more capital, including through digital means, the Russian government official indicated. BRICS nations hold half of global assets The financial assets of BRICS member states are now exceeding $60 trillion, Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov announced during a meeting of the Board of Governors of the group’s New Development Bank in Rio de Janeiro. “We see that the population of the countries of the Global South stands at almost 70% of the global population and their share in the global gross domestic product is almost 60%,” Siluanov elaborated, quoted by the Russian TASS news agency, and stressed: “The total volume of financial assets reached more than $60 trillion, that is, over 50% of the global level.” Founded almost 20 years ago by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, joined later by South Africa, BRICS has established itself as a key intergovernmental platform for cooperation between emerging markets. Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates are now also in the club. Its Shanghai-headquartered New Development Bank ( NDB ), formerly known as the BRICS Development Bank, was established to support both public and private projects by providing loans and guarantees and through other financial tools. Siluanov highlighted its important role as a financial institution that many countries can rely on. “We talk today about the decade of operation of the New Development Bank, the main financial instrument for new investments, for new projects being implemented in our countries – not only in BRICS countries but also in countries of the Global South,” the Russian representative added. The minister also underscored the importance of increasing investments in infrastructure. He believes a new approach is needed to attract funds that will ensure stable capital inflows in the long run. That includes employing digital financial assets, he noted. BRICS working on cross-border payments The countries in the Global South need to build a strong financial market and create infrastructure with seamless capital flows, Anton Siluanov emphasized at the board meeting, noting that those in the BRICS space have been working to achieve that. He also revealed: “We discuss measures on cross-border payments, development of inter-depositary interaction, establishment of reinsurance capacity, and the launch of credit rating methodology.” The head of Russia’s Ministry of Finance also spoke about “the need to be in the trend” when it comes to new technologies. In that regard, he pointed to the opportunities presented by the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI). At the same time, he warned about the risks of increasing inequalities among countries and insisted: “We, therefore, need to cooperate in the AI areas as actively as possible and the NDB should be the leader in this area, pooling the efforts of our countries.” While Siluanov touched on several important topics, BRICS leaders and NDB executives have a number of other issues to discuss this weekend, including the organization’s response to current global challenges such as the ongoing clash over trade sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump’s policies. On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that the meeting hosted by Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is expected to adopt a joint statement condemning “unilateral protectionist measures” and the “indiscriminate raising” of tariffs which are “not good for the world economy” and development. The document is not going to explicitly mention the United States, but analysts claim that while trying to avoid direct confrontation with Washington, BRICS is trying to fill the void left by the current U.S. administration and advance its own agenda.

As investors rush to get a piece of the action, certain altcoins are experiencing remarkable growth. Discover which cryptocurrencies are set to gain the most from this bullish trend. This market outlook is brought to you by Outset PR , a crypto-native PR agency dedicated to helping projects gain visibility during crucial market moments, transforming favorable conditions into media traction and attention into sustained momentum. Solana Shows Promise Despite Recent Volatility Source: tradingview Solana's price is currently moving between the low $130s and mid $160s. It faces resistance just above $170, so it might climb around 10% from its current high. If it overcomes this, it could aim for nearly $195, marking a possible rise of over 20%. The support is just above $120, offering a cushion if prices drop. Though the coin's value decreased by over 30% in six months, its current moves and recent weekly gain hint at potential recovery. Its indicators show it's not overbought, suggesting more room for growth. Solana has a chance to rebound from its past dips, depending on market conditions. Ethereum Sways Between Bulls and Bears, Eyeing Key Levels Source: tradingview Ethereum is currently trading between roughly $2283 and $2624. Recent market activity shows a slight weekly gain of 5.6%, though it's down 1.62% over the past month and a significant 30.27% in six months. Its price nears the simple moving averages, suggesting stability. The nearest resistance at $2748.90 could be the next target if upward momentum continues, with room for an approximate 20% jump to the next resistance at $3089. However, should the support at $2066.94 fail, the price might re-test the stronger floor at $1725.96. Ethereum's RSI near 41.39 indicates it's neither overbought nor oversold, providing ample room for movement either way. XRP Shows Resilience, Eyes on $2.81 for a Bullish Break Source: tradingview XRP is currently trading between $2.02 and $2.34, showing some stability. The coin's price climbed over 6% in the past week yet dipped slightly over the month. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 42, indicating it's neither overbought nor oversold. The next key resistance is at $2.48, with another hurdle at $2.81. If XRP breaks through these, it could see a significant rise. The price might surge about 20% from its current upper level if it reaches the second resistance. Its simple moving averages hover around $2.24, suggesting a steady outlook. With careful watch, investors consider these levels for possible gains.

Pepeto could mirror DOGE and SHIB’s past price rallies,https://crypto.news/best-memecoin-to-buy-now-pepeto-could-mirror-doge-and-shibs-past-price-rallies/,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Pepeto rises as a utility-driven memecoin, aiming to outgrow DOGE and SHIB with tech, staking, and real use cases. The memecoin space is transforming quickly. Coins that once relied purely on viral hype are now losing ground to projects that mix community spirit with real-world functionality. Pepeto (PEPETO) is stepping onto the stage as more than another frog-inspired token. It’s shaping up to be a strong contender by fixing the gaps that limited earlier giants like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Supported by staking yields, cross-chain features, and a dedicated meme-focused exchange, Pepeto is building a framework for longer-term growth. As the presale moves closer to completion, interest from investors keeps growing. With a roadmap centered on actual technology and practical use cases, Pepeto isn’t simply joining the meme trend; it’s aiming to lead it.

In the past day, its volume has dropped by over 42%. Source: CoinMarketCap Key support is holding at $0.1600, and a slip beneath this could trigger more losses. Resistance is set at $0.1700, and DOGE will need to retake this level to confirm any renewed bullish momentum. Shiba Inu, meanwhile, is under selling pressure as well, changing hands at $0.00001128. The token faces declining volume and waning investor interest. Source: CoinMarketCap Support is still intact around $0.00001100, but a breakdown could drive it closer to the $0.00001050 region. Both coins currently lack clear catalysts, which gives Pepeto’s approach, rooted in real utility, a clear edge in today’s market. Pepeto’s edge: Real tech and high-yield staking Pepeto has already caught attention by raising over $5.5 million in presale funding, approaching its $5.77 million target. The token price remains at $0.000000138, offering early adopters an attractive entry point. A standout feature is the 270% annual staking yield, distributing over 32 million PEPETO for each Ethereum block. This incentivizes holding for the long term and helps reinforce the protocol’s stability. With a total supply of 420 trillion tokens, 30% is allocated to staking rewards and 30% to presale buyers. The project’s smart contracts have also been audited, adding credibility. A first sneak peek into the $Pepeto Exchange is finally here.

As investors scan the market for the best crypto to buy now, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a top performer. Mutuum Finance is presently in phase 5 of its presale and has already sold out over 60% of this phase. The project has already raised over $11.7 million and has gained 12,700 investors. Although XRP’s ETF news may dominate headlines, seasoned investors are closely watching Mutuum Finance. XRP Gains Momentum Amid ETF Approval Speculation XRP is trading at about $2.30, returning to the limelight after investors were stirred by euphoria of an XRP spot ETF. The SEC in recent news permitted Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund to also revolve around XRP which brought the chances of acceptance to more than 90%. This has given rise to renewed activity around the token that has already registered a marked increase in terms of trading volume and demand by institutions. In case the ETF sees the light of the day, XRP may break a major resistance and even move towards $2.65-$3.00 in the short-term. Although ETF news on XRP has been making the news, investors are also considering other tokens with strong potential such as Mutuum Finance. Phase 5 of Mutuum Finance Presale Over 60% Sold Out Mutuum Finance presale Phase 5 is underway and gaining a lot of steam very rapidly. Already over 12,700 investors have come aboard the project and raised over $11.7 million, which is testimony to the fact that it is no experiment in DeFi. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction, with over $11.7 million raised and 12,700+ investors on the roster. With Phase 5 having crossed the 60% mark, price increases are imminent. Mutuum Finance Launches $50K Bug Bounty, USD-Pegged Stablecoin Expected Mutuum Finance is introducing an Ethereum-based fully-collateralized stablecoin. The asset will always be stable during market downtrends unlike algorithmic stablecoins that are known to depeg during a volatile market. Mutuum Finance in its focus on security and transparency has even initiated its official Bug Bounty Program in association with CertiK with a reward value of 50,000 USDT. The reward is given in four categories, critical, major, minor and low where there is coverage and reward for all types of vulnerabilities. This is another aspect that reflects the proactive approach of Mutuum towards establishment of trust in the form of strong infrastructure and beneficial security. Evolution of DeFi as a Viable Dual-Lending Formula Mutuum Finance (MUTM) boasted a dual-pronged lending model that combined Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) platform is meant to meet the need of all the investors who want to earn a passive income by investing his USDT into smart contract pools that promise consistent passive income in accordance with its interest rate that fluctuates up and down according to the market trend. In addition, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) enables lenders and borrowers to be fully involved in setting terms of an exchange with no interference by a third party. This model is common with users managing less secure assets. The project is already audited by CertiK and is paving the way for massive adoption, and investors who heed the call now stand to benefit the most in the future. To top it all off, the platform is running an incredible $100,000 giveaway , with 10 lucky winners getting $10,000 worth of Mutuum Finance tokens each.

He explained that LTC’s price action remains closely tied to Bitcoin’s movement and overall market sentiment, with the $96 level standing out as the next resistance. Bearish Daily Close For Litecoin Amid Bitcoin Correlation According to CryptoWzrd, Litecoin closed the day with a bearish daily candle, while mirroring Bitcoin’s price action. This alignment suggests that LTC remains heavily influenced by broader market sentiment and BTC’s directional moves. Meanwhile, the LTCBTC pair ended the session indecisively, offering no clear signal of strength or weakness against Bitcoin at the moment. Related Reading: Litecoin Surges Past Descending Resistance – Bulls Target $97.10 Level The analyst noted that for a sustained upside move in Litecoin, healthier and more constructive candles are needed on the LTCBTC chart. Without stronger signals from this pair, confidence in a breakout remains limited. Adding to the cautious tone, CryptoWzrd pointed out that a decline in Bitcoin dominance would be a critical factor in unlocking altcoin momentum, including for Litecoin. From a technical standpoint, Litecoin is currently aiming for the $96 daily resistance level. CryptoWzrd explained that a successful push above this barrier could open the door for a stronger rally, potentially extending toward the $128 resistance zone. However, that scenario depends on supportive market conditions and renewed strength across altcoin charts. On the downside, $80 stands out as the key daily support level that traders should monitor. A breakdown below this zone could trigger a deeper correction and delay any near-term bullish ambitions. Maintaining support above this level would be crucial in preserving the broader structure and keeping upward targets in play. Looking ahead, CryptoWzrd emphasized his focus on the lower time frames to spot potential scalp opportunities. By analyzing intraday chart formations, he aims to capitalize on short-term price movements while the broader market context unfolds. Traders following LTC closely will want to keep an eye on these short-term setups for quick entries and exits amid ongoing volatility. Intraday Volatility Signals Patience Over Action In conclusion, CryptoWzrd noted that today’s intraday chart for Litecoin was marked by volatility and a bearish tone, making it a challenging environment for clean trade setups. He emphasized the importance of waiting for a more favorable trading location before entering any positions, as the current conditions lacked clear direction and structure. Related Reading: Litecoin Could Be ‘Just Weeks Away’ From Third-Ever Golden Cross — Expert According to the analyst, a move above the $90 intraday resistance would be a positive signal and could present a potential long opportunity. However, if the price gets rejected at that level, it may lead to further downside pressure. For now, CryptoWzrd remains patient, waiting for the market to establish a healthier setup before taking action.

Many projects are growing in new ways with fresh updates, stronger networks, and bigger presales. People who want to stay ahead in crypto need to know which names are making real moves. Right now, BlockDAG, Aptos, SEI, and XRP are standing out. Each of these coins has something strong going for it , from large community support to fresh tech upgrades. In this article, we’ll break down what makes them worth your attention today. Stay with us as we go through the details that could shape the top altcoins to watch in 2025. 1. BlockDAG: Big Presale and Mining Growth BlockDAG is clearly one of the top altcoins to watch in 2025 thanks to its mix of smart technology and fast-growing user base. The project uses both DAG and Proof-of-Work systems to handle between 2,000 and 15,000 transactions each second. The presale has been huge so far, raising $331 million, with over 23.5 billion coins sold. Right now, BlockDAG (BDAG) is in Batch 29, with coins priced at $0.0276. But in a special GLOBAL LAUNCH release offer, people can get them for just $0.0016 until August 11. This brings back one of the lowest prices seen since the early batches, even as the final launch price is set at $0.05. More than 2 million users are already mining on BlockDAG using the X1 Miner App. Plus, the X30 and X100 mining rigs are rolling out in July and August, bringing more power to the network. The testnet is live and supports smart contracts and no-code tools, making it easy for anyone to join. With over 20 exchange listings planned, BlockDAG offers both short-term energy and long-term promise. It’s easy to see why it’s among the top altcoins to watch in 2025. 2. Aptos: Steady Network Activity and Strong Volumes Aptos keeps its spot as one of the top altcoins to watch in 2025 because of its solid network and steady growth. The current price is around $4.56, with small daily changes and a recent high of $4.69. Aptos has seen a lot of trading on DEXs, with over $205 million in daily volume. It also supports more than $540 million in tokenized real-world assets, showing that the project’s tools are being put to good use. The Aptos network has processed 3 billion transactions so far and has about 18 million active users each month. This level of activity helps it stay strong even when markets move up and down. Analysts think the price could stay between $3.87 and $5.00 for now, but the project’s solid base means it could keep its place among the top altcoins to watch in 2025 . Its growth points to long-term staying power. 3. SEI: Faster Tech and New Use Cases SEI earns a place among the top coins with its focus on speed and new tech. SEI’s price is about $0.275, down 8% over the week but still higher than its older lows. This comes after SEI V2 launched. The update added a high-speed, parallel EVM and cut block finality to 400 milliseconds. This makes SEI a good fit for DeFi and big players needing fast and smooth operations. SEI also gained from Wyoming’s stablecoin pilot, which pushed the price up by 13% in mid-June. The price might dip toward $0.20 if trading slows, but SEI’s roadmap and real-world links show that the project could still grow. If you want a coin that blends speed, low costs, and fresh ideas, SEI fits well on the list of top altcoins to watch in 2025. 4. XRP: Legal Steps and New Chain Features XRP stays in focus as one of the top altcoins to watch in 2025 because of its legal updates and network changes. The price is around $2.18 to $2.19, with slight drops lately. But Ripple’s progress in its SEC case helps hold interest. In late June, Ripple pulled its cross-appeal, and the SEC may do the same, moving closer to the end of this long case. Though Ripple’s bid to cut its fine from $125 million to $50 million was denied, people see the overall legal steps as a positive sign. On the tech side, Ripple launched the XRPL EVM sidechain on the mainnet. This opens new doors for smart contracts and fresh use cases. XRP’s price is moving between $2.00 and $2.35 for now, but traders are watching for a jump if an XRP ETF gets a green light. Final Thoughts BlockDAG, Aptos, SEI, and XRP all stand out as the top altcoins to watch in 2025 because of their clear progress and strong plans. Each one brings something fresh , BlockDAG with its huge presale and mining tools, Aptos with steady use and volumes, SEI with its fast network, and XRP with its legal clarity and new tech. There are always risks in crypto, but these projects have a mix of growth and active teams that make them worth a closer look. Always take time to learn more before making decisions. The crypto world moves quickly, and being informed helps you stay ahead. Keep an eye on these coins as they help shape what’s next for crypto and the top altcoins to watch in 2025.

New York City police are warning senior citizens to be on the lookout for a trio of scammers at ATMs after a crime spree that occurred between May and June, reports The New York Post. Authorities warn that the group – made up of two men and a woman – act as good Samaritans by offering to help the elderly use the ATM or strike up a conversation with them as a distraction to try and steal their bank cards. Police say that on May 14th, the trio stole $20,000 from the bank account of a 90-year-old woman and drained $3,000 from the account of an 83-year-old woman in two separate incidents that occurred just one hour apart. On June 2nd, one of the thieves started up a conversation with a 71-year-old man while withdrawing cash at a Chase Bank ATM. While the victim was distracted, the scammer stole the man’s bank card and linked up with another man at a different Chase Bank ATM location, where they tried to take out $5,500. The 71-year-old says the scammers charged $6,000 to his account in just one hour. The thieves struck again on June 19th when they targeted an 86-year-old woman and stole about $24,000 from her account. According to the police, the trio is responsible for stealing at least $70,000 from elderly victims. Authorities say that a total of nine incidents of thieves using the same scheme against seniors at Chase Bank, Bank of America, Capital One and Citibank locations in New York were reported between May 8th and June 26th.

However, there are clear signs that the remainder of the year could present much stronger momentum for the cryptocurrency. Several key developments are on the horizon, which may justify taking a position in XRP before the end of summer. This article examines three major factors that could drive demand: regulatory clarity, the emergence of XRP-focused treasury strategies, and the potential approval of spot XRP ETFs. Regulatory clarity approaching The long-standing legal uncertainty surrounding XRP is close to resolution. Ripple, the company associated with XRP, has indicated since March that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was preparing to drop its case against it. In June, Ripple further stated it planned to withdraw any future appeals, while the SEC similarly suggested it would cease pursuing additional appeals. Although final paperwork remains outstanding, the case is expected to conclude by the end of July. Beyond the lawsuit, significant legislative efforts are progressing in Congress to create a more structured regulatory environment for digital assets. Two proposed laws — the Genius Act and the Clarity Act — are considered particularly relevant to XRP. The Genius Act sets out rules for stablecoins, a segment where the XRP blockchain could see new growth. Meanwhile, the Clarity Act would establish a regulatory framework for all digital assets. It could remove barriers for institutional investors wary of compliance risks. Both bills are projected to reach President Donald Trump’s desk for signature before Congress recesses in August, creating an environment of regulatory certainty that could benefit XRP’s adoption and value . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Treasury Companies Gaining Traction Another trend worth noting is the rise of companies adding XRP to their corporate treasuries. In June, VivoPower International announced plans to acquire $120 million worth of XRP for its balance sheet, marking the first such move of its kind. Soon after, Trident Digital Tech Holdings revealed it would allocate $500 million in XRP. These decisions echo the approach taken by Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, which amassed a significant Bitcoin position over the past five years, now valued at $65 billion. Although current XRP treasury initiatives are limited to smaller companies, there is growing anticipation that a larger firm may follow suit in the coming months. Analysts have suggested the possibility of a “MicroStrategy of XRP” emerging before the end of summer, which could further validate and elevate the asset in corporate finance circles. Spot XRP ETFs under review Perhaps the most anticipated development is the SEC’s pending decision on spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Bloomberg estimates a 95% likelihood that the SEC will approve a spot XRP ETF this year. The deadline for a final decision is mid-October. However, approval could come earlier. The recent SEC approval of a Grayscale fund holding XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum suggests momentum is building toward acceptance of dedicated spot XRP ETFs. If approved, spot ETFs would allow institutional capital to flow into XRP more easily, particularly once regulatory legislation is finalized. Industry observers have noted that such developments would signal that “it’s OK to invest in XRP,” removing legal and compliance concerns that previously restrained investment from larger entities. Looking Beyond Summer Investors should remain mindful of potential risks despite these positive catalysts. XRP has fallen short of expectations before, and if any of these developments fail to materialize, its price may stagnate or grow only modestly. However, if the three catalysts align as anticipated, there is optimism that XRP could retest its historical highs and strengthen its position in the market before year-end. Given the current trajectory and the convergence of these factors, summer 2025 appears to offer a unique opportunity for those considering entering or expanding their positions in XRP.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) has maintained its cult-like following, but many investors are questioning whether SHIB can maintain its dominance or if the next wave of viral token trends lies elsewhere. Two coins, in particular, are drawing intense interest and could outperform SHIB in the months ahead: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) and Bonk (BONK). Both projects are riding the meme momentum yet pushing into new terrain. Here’s why they deserve serious consideration now. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): A Meme Coin With Layer-2 Muscle Little Pepe launched as a full-fledged Layer-2 blockchain dedicated to memecoins. Built for speed, affordability, and fair distribution, it addresses common pain points: outrageously high gas fees, sniping bots, and jacked-up taxes. Its presale is currently in stage four, priced at $0.0013, and has already raised more than $3 million. The momentum is undeniable: the first three stages sold out in rapid succession, signaling real demand. The clever tokenomics reserve a chunk for liquidity, staking rewards, and marketing, and eliminate tax on trades, giving holders freedom to trade without drag. Little Pepe’s roadmap further makes it a compelling choice for a price explosion. Having started with a frenetic presale, its layer 2 chain, meme launchpad, and top centralized exchange listing are on the horizon. That trajectory, along with a massive giveaway of $777,000 in tokens for lucky participants, makes LILPEPE the best meme coin to invest in now. Comparing its current valuation to SHIB’s early days, LILPEPE has the optics of a breakout story. If narrative, community, and tech align, it could potentially surpass SHIB’s growth in just a few months. Bonk (BONK): Solana’s Meme-Built Challenger While Little Pepe brings a Layer-2 twist, Bonk is treading an untapped niche in the Solana ecosystem. Bonk has cultivated a faithful army of followers thanks to its Solana foundation and low fees. It thrives in a vibrant environment where developers and users value speed and affordability. SOL’s resurgence has kept Bonk in play, and with growing TVL and NFT sales in Q2 2025, it’s poised for another breakout. BONK benefits from both Solana’s infrastructure and the decentralized ethos that meme coins embody. What was once a quirky experiment is now a true ecosystem with real-world activity. If SOL continues to attract new users, Bonk’s viral potential makes it a smart micro-cap play with upside far beyond novelty. Why SHIB’s Crown Isn’t Unbeatable Shiba Inu has a reputation, but that’s also its burden. Its billion-dollar market cap means it needs massive adoption to make a significant impact. Recent months have shown flat trading ranges and fading hype, despite occasional NFT drops and community initiatives. SHIB’s core audience—retail meme fans—can’t fully scale SHIB’s valuation alone. Meanwhile, newer meme coins are armed with leaner tokenomics, faster tech, and fresher marketing approaches. That gives them an agility that SHIB can’t match. Riding Tomorrow’s Meme Wave In today’s meme coin arena, speed of iteration matters as much as sincerity of hype. Investors are flocking to projects with layered narratives, real technical differentiation, and active token utility. LILPEPE checks those boxes: a dedicated Layer-2, burner mechanics, tax-free trades, staking options, and plans for a meme launchpad. With over $3 million raised in presale and anti-bot protections in place, its launch offers both momentum and design that SHIB has moved past. Bonk offers a different strategy—an open ecosystem, on-ramp for Solana’s next generation, and grassroots engagement that could spark another viral moment. With SOL’s infrastructure supporting it, BONK has upside beyond meme appeal. A Bullish but Disciplined Outlook Speculating on meme coins isn’t for the faint of heart. This space thrives on narrative, community energy, and social media momentum. But you don’t need to bank your future on these picks—just allocate a portion of your capital to participate in potential upside. Buy into the presale for LILPEPE, set entry for BONK, but always stay alert. The next few months will reveal whether communities hold, issues launchpads, or mainstream memes resurface. If either token builds traction without losing focus, their compounded moves could leave SHIB trailing in the dust. Final Thoughts Little Pepe is positioning itself not just as a meme coin, but as a generational protocol with real blockchain vision. Bonk is capturing Solana’s growing hint of soul, where community and decentralized apps matter again. Both offer the kind of agile potential and foundational story that could capsize SHIB’s legacy. If you believe meme coins still have life, now’s the time to invest in these low-priced meme coins.

The swift sellout underscores strong community interest and bullish sentiment surrounding the project. Source: Codename:Pepe X account Next on the roadmap is the Token Generation Event (TGE) and exchange listing. Within the community, anticipation is building that $AGNT could soar as much as 1000x from its presale launch price. Why $AGNT Could Be the Next 1000x Meme Coin Codename:Pepe is engineered to be a smart, adaptive platform. According to its developers, the AI framework is designed to: Spot Emerging Meme Coins Analyze Market Sentiment Deliver Actionable Trading Insights Optimize Automated Trading The development team is actively enhancing both AI capabilities and blockchain integration, ensuring the platform evolves in tandem with the broader crypto ecosystem. Codename:Pepe brings together two of the most compelling forces in today’s market: AI innovation and meme coin virality. With a focus on real utility, intelligent automation, and community-powered growth, it stands out among the latest wave of crypto launches. As the listing date approaches and momentum builds, the limited presale supply and tiered pricing model could make $AGNT one of the top-performing tokens post-launch, possibly achieving 1000x growth from its presale price. Grab the Next 1000x Meme Coin — Get Ready for $AGNT Listing Now Chainlink's Rebound: How LINK Could Break Past Its All-Time High Chainlink connects smart contracts with real-world data through oracles. This decentralized network ensures blockchain applications access accurate off-chain information. By bridging data sources and smart contracts, Chainlink is vital to many blockchain systems. As decentralized finance (DeFi) grows, so does the need for reliable data sources like Chainlink. Its oracles provide secure data to DeFi applications, making it integral to the ecosystem. This positions Chainlink as a key player in the expanding DeFi market. LINK, Chainlink's token, hit an all-time high of $52.88 in May 2021. While it has fluctuated since, the increased use of Chainlink suggests potential for future gains. Past trends indicate LINK could respond positively to market growth. Forecasts for LINK's future price vary. By 2025, CoinCodex predicts an average of $38.85. InvestingHaven expects it could range between $17.13 and $44.47. Looking to 2030, estimates place LINK between $66.85 and $137, showing optimism. Chainlink's technology and role in DeFi make it a project to watch. As the crypto market evolves, it may benefit from the demand for decentralized data solutions. Whether LINK surpasses past highs depends on many factors, but its potential is significant. Polkadot's Potential: Bridging Blockchains for a Connected Future Polkadot is a unique cryptocurrency that aims to connect different blockchains, allowing them to communicate and share information seamlessly. Unlike other networks labeled as Layer 1 or Layer 2, Polkadot is considered a Layer 0 protocol, serving as the foundation for multiple blockchains to interact. Its native token, DOT, plays a key role in securing the network and enabling holders to participate in governance decisions. The project was founded by Gavin Wood, one of the original co-founders of Ethereum. His expertise and vision have inspired confidence in Polkadot's potential to revolutionize how blockchains work together. By facilitating cross-chain transactions, Polkadot seeks to overcome the limitations of isolated networks and promote a more interconnected ecosystem. Since its launch, DOT has experienced significant price movements. In 2021, it reached an all-time high of $55, reflecting strong investor interest. However, like many cryptocurrencies, it faced volatility and adjustments in the following years. By 2025, the market has witnessed DOT's resilience and the continued dedication of its development community. Looking ahead, various analysts have shared their price predictions for Polkadot. DigitalCoinPrice forecasts an average price of $14.24 in 2025 and a rise to $23.75 by 2027. Changelly offers a more cautious outlook, predicting prices between $6.66 and $7.54 in 2025 but expecting growth to $14.25 by 2027. By 2030, optimistic projections see DOT reaching an average trading price of $36.63, with potential highs above $50. As the blockchain landscape evolves, Polkadot's mission to connect networks remains relevant. While challenges exist, such as competition from projects like Ethereum and the development of cross-chain bridges, Polkadot's innovative technology and strong community support suggest it could be an attractive option for investors looking toward the future. Its ability to adapt and address the needs of an interconnected ecosystem may determine its success in the coming years. Polygon's POL Token: A Journey from Past to Future Polygon changed its token from MATIC to POL to support upgrades and align its brand. This move strengthens the platform, which connects blockchains. POL powers the network and rewards those who validate transactions. In September 2024, as the migration began, signs were promising. The market cap increased, showing confidence in the platform. This positive trend continued into 2025, reflecting strong community support. Experts predict that by 2025, POL could average $1.50. A minimum price of $0.60 is expected, with potential highs up to $2.50. By 2030, the average price might reach $3.00, possibly hitting $5.00 if adoption grows. Polygon tackles blockchain scalability and usability. It links different blockchains without compromising decentralization. As it matures, its growth potential makes POL attractive in the market. With ongoing development and adoption, POL is a promising asset. Its journey from MATIC to POL enhances its ecosystem and embraces future opportunities. TRON Takes Off: Why TRX Is the Crypto to Watch in 2025 and Beyond TRON is a public blockchain platform that supports smart contracts. It's open-source and works smoothly with Ethereum. This means developers can easily move their apps from Ethereum to TRON. The platform aims to make transactions fast and cheap, giving users and developers a better experience. TRON uses a Proof-of-Stake system. This involves 27 super representatives who validate transactions and earn rewards. New blocks are added every three seconds, much faster than some older blockchains. This speed allows TRON to handle more transactions efficiently. In early 2018, TRX, the coin that runs on the TRON network, hit an all-time high of $0.3004. Then, in December 2024, it surged nearly 100% to reach $0.4407. Although it has dipped since then, many are hopeful. With Donald Trump's second term, there's buzz about crypto growth. His World Liberty Financial platform bought $4.66 million worth of TRX in January 2025. Experts have positive predictions for TRX. By the end of 2025, it could reach up to $0.45. In 2026, it might climb to $0.60, and by 2030, it could hit $1.20. These numbers suggest strong potential for growth. TRON's technology and recent developments make it stand out in the crypto market. Its fast transactions and compatibility with Ethereum position it well for future success. Many are considering TRX as a promising investment in the current market cycle. Conclusion In conclusion, while coins like LINK, DOT, POL, and TRX have shown promise, their short-term potential may be limited in the current bullish market. They may offer steady growth, but they might not deliver rapid returns soon. On the other hand, Codename:Pepe crypto is emerging as a standout opportunity.

47566671,https://timestabloid.com/?p=73463,1751746557,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Is Qubetics the Most Potential Crypto After Hitting $700K Volume as Bitcoin Cash Climbs and Hyperliquid Grows,https://timestabloid.com/is-qubetics-the-most-potential-crypto-after-hitting-700k-volume/,"Is it too late to get into the next 100x opportunity, or is it just getting started? With Bitcoin Cash gearing up for a possible 197.8% surge this September and Hyperliquid recording over $2 billion in daily trading, crypto markets are buzzing with action. But while those names command attention, Qubetics has already moved from $0.40 to $4.20 in just one hour post-launch—landing in the CoinMarketCap top 10 instantly. That kind of momentum isn’t just rare; it’s game-changing. Qubetics ($TICS) is now trending as one of the most potential crypto projects due to its interoperable architecture, no-KYC transaction model, and massive staking rewards. As Bitcoin Cash stabilizes and Hyperliquid expands its DeFi stack, the crypto community is starting to look at $TICS as more than just a launch-phase performer. This comparison explores how these three projects stack up based on the latest updates, real-world utility, and governance models. Qubetics Enables Real Cross-Chain Transactions Without KYC For years, transferring assets between chains like Bitcoin and Ethereum meant dealing with bridges, complex interfaces, and high fees. Qubetics simplifies that by offering a Layer 1 protocol where multi-chain swaps, trades, and transfers happen in one place—no bridges, no wallet switching, and no KYC required. A real-world example is a user holding BTC who wants to swap it for $TICS without using a CEX or bridge. On Qubetics, that’s done directly within the wallet app, making it a top contender for the most potential crypto with real cross-chain power. DPoS Governance Turns Token Holders Into Decision-Makers Qubetics uses a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) model that empowers $TICS holders to shape network activity. Anyone with at least 5,000 $TICS can become a delegator and stake their tokens with trusted validators. Validators, who must hold 25,000 $TICS, earn 30% APY and confirm blocks. Delegators receive a portion of those rewards passively. This model creates a secure, decentralized system where decision-making is shared while still rewarding participation. Qubetics Launch Proved the Market Is Still Rewarding Innovation The token launched at $0.40 and skyrocketed to $4.20 in its first hour—a 950% gain or 10.5x increase. This launch came after a massive presale, which raised over $18.4 million from more than 28,500 early buyers, distributing 517 million tokens. In the first 24 hours post-launch, trade volume crossed $700,000 and buy pressure built at the $2 support level. Scenario-based returns show how powerful this launch was: someone who joined at $0.01 with $100 ended up holding 10,000 tokens. At $4.20, that became $42,000—representing a 41,900% return. Even those who went in bigger saw life-changing results. A $10,000 entry at $0.01 would mean 1,000,000 tokens, turning into $4.2 million at the all-time high. These numbers explain why Qubetics is now being called the most potential crypto by those watching launch-phase multipliers and long-term token models. Bitcoin Cash Set for Long-Term Gains Despite Recent Volatility Bitcoin Cash is currently trading around $479 with a market cap nearing $9.5 billion. Recent sentiment remains bullish, with the Fear & Greed Index hovering in the 60s and 70s. Price projections suggest a potential high of $1,413 this year, with 2026 estimates averaging around $806. Analysts have noted that Bitcoin Cash could see monthly gains as high as 197.8%, especially during surges tied to broader Bitcoin market cycles. Even though BCH dipped to $386 recently, dropping by over 5%, it rebounded with monthly growth of 14.2% and a 3-month uptick of 20.7%. While it may not deliver the same explosive return as new projects, Bitcoin Cash holds strong as a reliable, well-distributed coin that consistently performs across cycles. It remains a go-to for participants looking for maturity and predictability. Hyperliquid Is Quietly Building a DeFi Powerhouse Hyperliquid’s ecosystem has scaled rapidly in recent months. It currently records over $2 billion in daily trading volume and generates $1 million in daily fees, putting it ahead of even Ethereum’s fee intake despite ETH’s larger TVL. Over 35 protocols now run on Hyperliquid’s EVM-compatible layer, including yield-generating vaults offering up to 17% APY to liquidity providers. Its native HYPE token handles governance, gas fees, and staking rewards. Notably, Hyperliquid didn’t take VC money—31% of the token supply was airdropped to early participants. With 100,000 TPS, sub-second transaction finality, and over $10 billion in daily perpetual trading, it’s become a magnet for high-volume traders and institutions. While it doesn’t offer the early-mover ROI of Qubetics, Hyperliquid is positioning itself as a high-speed, utility-rich protocol that has staying power. Qubetics Still Leads as the Most Potential Crypto Comparing these three side-by-side, Qubetics comes out strong across launch stats, governance, and user-level accessibility. It’s the only one of the three offering a 30% APY to validators and real interoperability across chains without any bridge or KYC friction. Bitcoin Cash remains a strong bet for those chasing consistency and long-term gains. Hyperliquid delivers on scalability and DeFi yield—but doesn’t match Qubetics’ early ROI and staking incentives. With the ability to become a delegator at just 5,000 $TICS and a validator at 25,000 $TICS, Qubetics makes it easy for more participants to engage in earning while also contributing to network governance. Price predictions aiming at $10–$15 post-mainnet now look grounded in reality. For those eyeing returns and tech that works across platforms, Qubetics stands out as the most potential crypto in the current market cycle. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics the most potential crypto in 2025? It combines a 950% launch gain, 30% APY staking, cross-chain functionality, and DPoS governance into one protocol with no bridges or KYC. How is Bitcoin Cash expected to perform in the coming years? Analysts predict it could reach $1,413 this year and average $806 in 2026, with solid monthly growth and strong community support. What is driving growth for Hyperliquid in DeFi markets? Over $2 billion in daily volume, $1 million in fees, high APYs, and rapid adoption by over 35 protocols have made Hyperliquid a rising force. Summary Qubetics is now regarded as one of the most potential crypto assets following a historic launch that saw its token jump from $0.40 to $4.20 in one hour. With a 30% APY for validators, seamless Bitcoin interoperability, a real DPoS model, and no-KYC trading, it has redefined what new projects can achieve. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash holds its ground as a stable mid-to-long-term asset, and Hyperliquid continues scaling its DeFi infrastructure with high-speed execution and deep liquidity. Still, only Qubetics delivered a 420x ROI from its presale price of $0.01—making early participants millions. In 2025, Qubetics is the one to watch.

While PEPE and SHIB caught the early wave, a fresh contender emerges with promises of greatness. This new project aims to surpass these meme coin giants, offering potential sky-high rewards. Dubbed Codename:Pepe, this coin leaps into the spotlight with unwavering ambition. Inspired by past successes, it blends cutting-edge AI with community power to carve a unique path.

Grab the Next 1000x Meme Coin — Get Ready for $AGNT Listing Now PEPE Coin: The Meme That Took Over the Crypto World In the early 2000s, a cartoon frog named Pepe, created by Matt Furie, became an internet sensation. This meme has now evolved into a cryptocurrency sensation known as PEPE Coin. Embracing its meme origins, PEPE Coin has captured the hearts of many with its simplicity and strong community spirit. PEPE is a deflationary meme coin built on Ethereum's ERC-20 standard. The project's goals are straightforward and fun, summarized in three phases: Meme, Vibe and HODL, and Meme Takeover. Unlike others, PEPE doesn't make lofty promises. It stays true to its meme roots, focusing on community and transparency. By 2024, PEPE had soared to an all-time high of $0.00002825. After this peak, it faced a significant correction, losing about 68.59% of its value. This volatility is typical in the crypto world, especially for meme coins. However, the dedicated community believes in its potential for a rebound. Looking ahead, various predictions paint an optimistic future for PEPE. By 2025, forecasts suggest it could reach up to $0.000055. Predictions for 2030 are even more hopeful, with some expecting the coin to hit as high as $0.000159. By 2050, there's speculation that PEPE could achieve remarkable heights, reflecting its enduring appeal. PEPE Coin's blend of meme culture and crypto technology makes it a unique player in the market. Its simple approach and strong community support position it well in the current cycle. While the crypto space is unpredictable, PEPE's journey shows that a meme can become a movement. Shiba Inu's Journey: From Meme Coin to Crypto Contender Launched in 2020, Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a meme coin hoping to mimic Dogecoin's hype. It gained quick fame thanks to mentions by Vitalik Buterin and Elon Musk. Built on Ethereum, SHIB began as a simple payment token but soon expanded its ambitions. The creators launched a decentralized exchange and an NFT project, adding real utility to SHIB. These moves attracted more users and set SHIB apart from other meme coins. The ecosystem grew with ventures into the metaverse, games, and merchandise. By 2025, SHIB has experienced notable price movements. After its rise in 2021, it hovered around $0.00001. Predictions suggested it could reach up to $0.0000526 by 2025. This reflects optimism about SHIB's projects and community support. Bullish indicators point to potential growth, but competition is fierce. New meme coins like BONK and PEPE pose challenges. SHIB's evolution and innovation are key to maintaining its market position. SHIB's future hinges on its ambitious projects and community. While past performance isn't a guarantee, developments up to 2025 indicate SHIB could stay influential in the crypto world. Conclusion In a market where early sensations like PEPE and SHIB have already made their explosive moves and now show reduced short-term potential, Codename:Pepe crypto emerges as a compelling alternative. By harnessing genuine artificial intelligence to navigate the complex meme coin arena, it offers a fresh opportunity for substantial gains that others may no longer provide. With a fully automated AI trader and a community-driven approach, Codename:Pepe crypto is positioned to deliver maximum profits in the current bullish climate. Investors seeking the next significant breakthrough may find that this asset not only outperforms the competition but also provides the tools and collaborative support necessary for success in the fast-paced world of meme coins.

Overview Cryptocurrency Alchemy Pay Token ACH Price $0.01780 Market Cap $163.83Million Trading Volume (24-hour) $8.97M Circulating Supply 10 Billion ACH All-time High $0.1975 Aug 06, 2021 All-time Low $0.001338 Jul 20, 2021 24-h High $0.01814 24-h Low $0.01773 Alchemy Pay price prediction: Technical analysis Price Prediction $ 0.147431 (612.46%) Price Volatility 9.59% 50-Day SMA $0.026115 14-Day RSI 36.23 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 57 (Greed) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.024616 Alchemy Pay price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: ACH is currently experiencing a bearish trend on both the 4-hour and 1-day charts Indicators like RSI and Balance of Power show weak buying pressure and dominant selling momentum A recovery depends on reclaiming and holding above the $0.0185 resistance level ACH/USD 1-day chart ACHUSD chart by TradingView Based on the 1-day chart of Alchemy Pay (ACH) on July 5, the token is trading in a prolonged downtrend, constrained within the lower region of the Bollinger Bands. The price consistently fails to breach the mid-band resistance, signaling weak bullish momentum. The RSI currently hovers around 41, indicating the market remains in a bearish or neutral territory without strong buying pressure. The price action suggests consolidation with a slight bearish bias, and without a catalyst or significant volume increase, further downside cannot be ruled out. For any recovery, ACH must decisively break above the $0.0199 resistance and hold above the middle band line. Alchemy Pay 4-hour price chart ACHUSD chart by TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart of Alchemy Pay (ACH), the token continues to exhibit a bearish posture, with price action consistently hugging the lower Bollinger Band. This persistent downward trajectory reflects weak momentum and selling pressure. The MACD remains flat with histogram bars near the baseline and signal lines close to neutral, indicating low volatility and the absence of a strong directional trend. The Balance of Power indicator leans bearish at -0.44, underscoring the dominance of sellers. Without a decisive break above the $0.0184 resistance and a sustained push through the mid-band, further decline or sideways consolidation remains the likely scenario.

This comes as Bitcoin attempts to reclaim the $110,000 level, which has acted as a major resistance point in recent sessions. As of press time, BTC was trading at $108,118, up 0.5% in the past 24 hours and nearly 1% over the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold For the price outlook, analysis by TradingShot , in a TradingView post on July 5, highlighted that Bitcoin is flashing a strong bullish signal after completing a golden cross on the four-hour chart. The cryptocurrency is now holding above its four-hour 50-period moving average ( MA ), a key support level that, if maintained, could fuel a sharp rally. According to TradingShot, the current setup mirrors Bitcoin’s April–May rally, when a similar channel up pattern peaked near the 2.618 Fibonacci extension . The fractal shows the same series of lower highs, eventually broken by a strong upward move. Bitcoin price analysis chart.

If the pattern holds, TradingShot projects BTC could reach $130,000 by early August, aligning with the 2.618 Fibonacci level. Bitcoin’s key price levels to watch On the other hand, analysis by Ali Martinez in an X post on July 5 identified key price levels to watch. He noted that investors should keep an eye on $106,738 and $98,566. This is based on the latest In/Out of the Money Around Price analysis, which shows strong buyer interest concentrated in these two ranges, where significant numbers of addresses previously accumulated BTC.

Below that, another cluster of 1.71 million addresses is positioned near $98,566, providing additional support. On-chain data shows 89.36% of BTC holders are still “in the money,” highlighting resilience despite volatility, while just 10.36% are underwater.

Treasury firms divide the crypto community,https://crypto.news/bitcoin-treasuries-divide-crypto-bros-fiat-disguise/,"Bitcoin treasury companies — entities that accumulate the digital asset (usually through borrowed assets) — offer clients indirect exposure through their stock. Some believe that these companies bring Bitcoin to Wall Street. Others think that these treasury companies are doing the opposite: turning bitcoiners into so-called “fiat bros.” From self-custody of private keys to indirect Bitcoin ‘exposure’ In 2021, billionaire and X owner Elon Musk famously replied “Your app sucks” to a crypto wallet that didn’t support user access to their private keys. Now, when Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin treasury companies get so much attention, it may seem that self-custody has silently left the scene. Although the big narrative is occupied with the news about treasury companies spending millions of dollars (of borrowed money) to buy as many bitcoins as possible, bitcoiners who (at best) don’t care about “indirect exposure to Bitcoin” didn’t go anywhere. They are just not as visible on social and mass media. Indirect Bitcoin exposure, or owning paper Bitcoin, is owning certain assets issued by the company that strategically accumulate Bitcoin on its balance sheets. Stocks of Bitcoin treasury companies (for instance, MSTR by Strategy) or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of asset management companies holding Bitcoin (for example, IBIT by BlackRock) are two of the most popular types of assets that expose users to Bitcoin. It is assumed that owning these assets allows holders to benefit from the price movements of Bitcoin as they are reflected in the value of these assets. That’s why Bitcoin ETFs, stocks of Bitcoin treasury companies, Bitcoin derivatives, and similar assets are considered to be holding Bitcoin, although it’s essentially paper Bitcoin. Read more: How we went from Bitcoin whitepaper to “paper” Bitcoin Are treasury companies Trojan-horsing Wall Street? Some view treasury companies as a straightforward means for institutional and corporate investors to enter the crypto market. Indeed, for companies, buying stocks of Strategy is easier than buying Bitcoin in terms of the law. Strategy is holding nearly 600,000 bitcoins, and engaging in such a regular activity as buying MSTR stocks exposes corporate buyers to Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. As treasury companies continue to accumulate bitcoins relentlessly, they increase buying pressure, which prevents the BTC price from experiencing significant drops. Corporations buying stocks of treasury companies indirectly invest in Bitcoin. Bitcoin treasury companies short fiat money and buy bitcoin. Greatest business model in human history. — Joe Burnett, MSBA (@IIICapital) July 1, 2025 Michael Saylor, the Chairman of Strategy, said he wants to bridge the cryptocurrency economy and traditional capital markets. Some view him and other treasury companies as a Trojan horse that takes Bitcoin to Wall Street. However, some see the opposite happening – treasury companies are turning bitcoiners into traditional finance investors. Treasury companies’ critics stress that, despite much talk about Bitcoin, these companies are operating in the conventional finance sector and promoting their stocks to both TradFi (traditional finance) and crypto investors. Who’s Trojan Horsing Who? @americanhodl8 deserves an Oscar for this Bitcoin masterpiece 🔥 pic.twitter.com/mek5h12RMo — Walker⚡️ (@WalkerAmerica) June 30, 2025 Notably, these companies don’t pay their employees in crypto, nor do they accept Bitcoin as a payment method for their stocks, among other things. Literally, these companies don’t offer any kind of Bitcoin experience to their clients and employees. For the TradFi sector, treasury companies serve as a way to profit from Bitcoin’s value growth. However, for Bitcoin investors, these companies may appear to be a TradFi agent’s invasion that seduces people to stop buying and holding bitcoins and switch to a traditional instrument like stocks. The Bitcoin standard narrative allegedly only serves as a promotion tool for the audience of Bitcoin enthusiasts. https://t.co/RASOc9PsWg — Satoshi’s Journal (@SatoshisJournal) November 10, 2024 While there is nothing wrong with competing for investors, it seems that bitcoiners are angered by the fact that treasury companies have infected most of the Bitcoin-related media with promotional posts about them. Self-custody advocates argue that Bitcoin podcasters, Crypto X, crypto conferences–all these platforms are “shilling” Strategy and Nakamoto stocks. As a result, it leaves too little space for conversation with those who share similar values, such as independence and a self-custody philosophy. ""Every podcaster who is not a treasury company executive is a policy failure. We must seize the means of paper bitcoin production"" Wow! (pic unrelated) pic.twitter.com/6142sYrBFy — Andrew M. Bailey (@resistancemoney) July 3, 2025 Another concern associated with treasury companies is that their strategies may not be so safe, and at some point, they will have to sell the bitcoins they buy. It may trigger a domino effect that could bury even giants like Strategy. According to a recent report from venture capital company Breed, most Bitcoin treasury companies are unlikely to survive a “death spiral” that may be triggered by a sudden drop in the BTC price. The chances of the companies resurrecting after the crash are thinner, especially given their centralized nature.

However, as the crypto industry evolves, projects like Ruvi AI (RUVI) are capturing the spotlight with their utility-driven approach , emphasis on transparency , and early-stage growth . With analysts predicting a $1 valuation for Ruvi AI , delivering an astounding 66x ROI , it’s no wonder many investors are wondering whether Ruvi AI might take the lead over Tron in the coming bull run. Here’s why Ruvi AI, with its groundbreaking innovation and investor-friendly framework, might just outpace Tron. Building Trust with Transparency One of the standout features of Ruvi AI is its commitment to security and building investor trust . Unlike many early-stage tokens, Ruvi AI has already undergone a third-party audit by CyberScope , a highly respected blockchain auditing firm. This comprehensive inspection ensures that Ruvi AI’s smart contracts are free from vulnerabilities, significantly reducing risk for investors. Additionally, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange , ensuring post-presale liquidity . This guarantees seamless trading as soon as the presale concludes, addressing a crucial concern for early backers. Combined, the audit and strategic partnership make Ruvi AI an attractive and secure choice in a market often plagued by uncertainty. Real-World Utility Fuels Demand Where Tron focuses on blockchain for content-sharing and decentralized applications, Ruvi AI takes a broader, multi-industry approach . The project leverages the combined power of AI and blockchain technology to build scalable solutions across marketing , entertainment , and finance , industries actively seeking innovation. Ruvi AI’s Game-Changing Applications Marketing Ruvi AI’s AI-powered tools allow businesses to optimize advertising campaigns by achieving higher precision in targeting, reducing inefficient spend. These tools enable companies to get better results from their ad budgets, making Ruvi AI indispensable for modern marketing strategies. Entertainment For content creators, Ruvi AI offers blockchain-secured payment systems , ensuring fairness and transparency in revenue streams.

This makes Ruvi AI highly relevant in a sector that demands efficiency and security. Such broad and applicable use cases distinguish Ruvi AI from other cryptocurrencies and help sustain long-term demand for its token. Presale Success Highlights Market Confidence Early-stage enthusiasm for Ruvi AI has translated into remarkable presale outcomes. Key achievements so far include: $2.2 million raised , providing significant capital to fuel development and expansion. Over 180 million tokens sold , a clear indication of investor demand and confidence. A growing base of more than 2,000 holders , reflecting a strong, supportive community. Ruvi AI’s current Phase 2 token price of $0.015 makes it easily accessible for new investors. Once the presale concludes, this price will rise to $0.07 , representing a nearly 5x ROI for early supporters. Analysts predict Ruvi AI could reach a valuation of $1 per token post-listing , potentially delivering a jaw-dropping 66x ROI . Maximize Returns with VIP Investment Tiers Ruvi AI offers VIP investment tiers , which incentivize significant contributions by offering substantial bonuses. Here’s how the tiers are structured: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These VIP tiers allow investors to maximize their holdings at the ground level, providing significant long-term value as Ruvi AI’s growth gains traction. Why Ruvi AI Could Leapfrog Tron Tron revolutionized the content-sharing space, but Ruvi AI breaks the mold by catering to multiple high-demand industries and backing its growth with powerful AI tools. Unlike Tron, which depends on its ecosystem’s adoption, Ruvi AI’s applications span diverse sectors, creating both stability and scalability. With audited security , a focus on innovation , and real-world utility , Ruvi AI offers a foundation for exponential growth. Its presale performance of $2.2 million raised and 180 million tokens sold only cements its position as one of the most promising tokens in this bull run.

If you are looking for the top cryptos to buy, focus on those with clear direction, steady growth, and actual products. Here, we explore four notable names: BlockDAG, PI Network, SUI, and Hyperliquid. Each one brings a different approach, pricing, and roadmap that could affect how they perform ahead. Whether your interest lies in mining features, staking setups, or fast trading networks, these choices offer a lot to review. Let’s take a closer look at why they’re gaining traction. 1. BlockDAG Expands With Active Mining and Broad User Base BlockDAG has attracted attention by combining large-scale presale results, working systems, and a mobile mining app used by more than 2 million people. Its current presale price is set at $0.0016 until August 11, 2025. Over 23.6 billion coins have been sold so far, bringing in nearly $331 million. The planned listing price is $0.05, leaving early participants with the chance for up to 25x gains. The roadmap includes 45 presale batches. The project has also completed audits from Halborn and CertiK to support its system build. As part of its rollout, BlockDAG (BDAG) is also launching hardware rigs to support mining. X30 and X100 are being released on July 7, and the X10 unit will follow on August 15. The team aims for a listing in the top 30 on CoinMarketCap after launch. Confirmed exchange listings include MEXC, BitMart, CoinStore, XT.com, and LBank. Features like EVM support and a no-code dApp creator give it functionality expected from a full Layer 1 platform. For those comparing current options, BlockDAG remains one of the top cryptos to buy based on activity and development progress. 2. PI Network Expands With Staking Tools and App Features PI Network is moving forward with new tools and updates across its system, holding a price near $0.49. In the last week, it introduced the Pi App Studio, which lets users create dApps without writing code, and also launched the “Ecosystem Directory Staking” tool. This feature allows users to stake in support of useful apps and projects across the network. So far, over 13 million people have completed migration to the open mainnet. The team has also launched .pi domain auctions and a revised KYC process to help move beyond mobile-only usage. A key point to watch is the upcoming unlock event. About 19.2 million PI are expected to be released on July 4, with more than 268 million over the rest of the month. This may affect the price in the near term. Still, PI Network remains a popular choice for developers and active users, which could help reduce the effect of selling pressure. For those interested in projects with strong user networks and new tools on the way, PI deserves attention in your list of top cryptos to buy. 3. SUI Maintains Steady Price With Quiet Growth Path SUI is now trading around $2.78, with its daily range between $2.66 and $2.78. Unlike some others in the list, SUI has not released major updates in recent days. That can be seen as a strength for those who prefer stable movements and low drama. The platform is backed by reliable tech and active developer support, helping it keep a steady valuation while others see bigger shifts. Financial rising graph and chart with lines and numbers that illustrate stock market behaviour. Concept of successful trading. Dark blue background. 3d rendering Even with less news, SUI is still moving forward. Many still consider it a capable Layer 1 that could gain ground slowly. It appeals to users who value quiet progress instead of marketing headlines. Though it may not grab as much attention, its mix of stability and performance holds value. For those studying the top cryptos to buy with long-term use in mind, SUI has qualities worth noting. 4. Hyperliquid Shows Strong Market Activity and Upward Trend Hyperliquid, using the ticker HYPE, has surged since April, rising nearly 300%. It now trades between $38 and $39, just 16% below its mid-June high of $45.5. Trading activity remains strong, with daily volumes near $230 to $240 million. The project now controls a large part of the decentralised perpetuals market, with about 70% share, and puts most of its trading fees back into buybacks. Technically, HYPE remains above its 20-day EMA, which is around $37.5, a level some analysts watch closely. If demand stays strong, the price could retest the $43 to $45 range or aim for $50 in July. Hyperliquid focuses on trading and liquidity, not mining or staking. For those looking at the top cryptos to buy based on real trading use, this is one project that shows how fast traction can drive growth. Final Say Looking for the top cryptos to buy takes more than chasing hype. It helps to look for working features, clear goals, and active user support. BlockDAG brings live mining, strong presale figures, and a roadmap in motion. PI Network continues to build new tools, even with a big unlock ahead. SUI focuses on long-term growth through steady use, while Hyperliquid shows what fast adoption in trading can do. Each of these projects brings something different to the table, whether through mining, staking, or high-volume exchange activity. Be sure to look at the fine details, from unlock dates to market performance, before making any decisions. With the right research, solid opportunities can be found even in a busy market.

However, as the crypto market continues to evolve, a new player is emerging with audacious potential, Ruvi AI (RUVI) . Analysts are buzzing about Ruvi AI, tipping it as this summer’s smartest investment pick. With a robust foundation already in place and a forecast for up to 104x ROI , Ruvi AI is positioned to shake up the market and, quite possibly, leave Cardano behind. Here’s why experts believe Ruvi AI’s utility-first approach and early victories set it apart as an opportunity that should not be overlooked. Security and Transparency Win Over Investors Transparency and security are often non-negotiable for investors, and Ruvi AI delivers on both fronts. The token’s third-party CyberScope audit is a significant differentiator, confirming the validity and security of its smart contracts. This audit alleviates concerns about potential vulnerabilities, making Ruvi AI an excellent choice for those entering the market cautiously. Adding further confidence is Ruvi AI’s strategic partnership with WEEX Exchange , which provides post-presale liquidity to ensure seamless trading post-launch. These features not only assure investors of the token’s reliability but also position Ruvi AI for sustained market stability, qualities that speculative competitors often lack. Real-World Utility Drives Demand Ruvi AI is far more than a speculative crypto asset. It’s designed to integrate blockchain technology with powerful artificial intelligence (AI) , offering scalable solutions for contemporary challenges in marketing , entertainment , and finance . This utility-driven foundation ensures that Ruvi AI appeals to industries in need of innovation while maintaining consistent demand for its token.

This comprehensive approach sets Ruvi AI apart from other cryptocurrencies that often fail to move beyond speculative utility. Impressive Presale Success Ruvi AI’s presale performance has captured the attention of analysts and investors alike. Key milestones include: A total of $2.2 million raised , ensuring robust funding to fuel project growth. Over 180 million tokens sold , signifying a strong demand base. A community of 2,000+ holders , highlighting investor interest and confidence. Currently, Ruvi AI is priced at $0.015 per token during Phase 2 of presale , presenting an excellent entry-level opportunity. At the end of the presale, the token price will rise to $0.07 , delivering an immediate 5x ROI for early participants. Analysts predict post-listing valuations to reach $1 per token, an extraordinary 66x ROI , with longer-term figures climbing toward 104x ROI . Boost Returns with Ruvi AI’s VIP Tiers Ruvi AI offers exclusive VIP investment tiers to amplify returns for early backers, providing substantial bonuses designed to optimize profitability.

These investment tiers significantly elevate growth potential, solidifying Ruvi AI’s place as a standout option in the crowded crypto landscape. Why Ruvi AI Could Surpass Cardano While Cardano continues to innovate, its progress has often been measured and slow. Ruvi AI, by contrast, combines rapid growth with auditable security and practical utility, making it a faster-moving project that appeals to a broader range of investors. Ruvi AI’s $2.2 million raised , audited smart contracts , and forecasted long-term ROI of up to 104x underscore its potential as a game-changing investment. Its current affordability at $0.015 per token also ensures accessibility for investors aiming to capitalize on exponential growth.

47569567,https://timestabloid.com/?p=73499,1751749217,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Rumors: Bitcoin Early Adopters Are Selling Out to Buy XRP,https://timestabloid.com/rumors-bitcoin-early-adopters-are-selling-out-to-buy-xrp/,"A fresh wave of speculation is rippling through the crypto market following a viral X post by Edo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy and a long-time XRP advocate. According to Farina, some early Bitcoin adopters may be cashing out of their BTC holdings to accumulate XRP, marking what could be a major shift in sentiment among crypto’s earliest investors. A Strategic Rotation? Farina’s remarks draw attention to a potential change in the behavior of early BTC holders. He likened the current opportunity to buy XRP near the $2 mark to buying Bitcoin when it traded under $100, a historic moment that minted many of today’s crypto millionaires. The recent dip in XRP’s price below $2 and its quick correction may be a calculated trap to shake out weak hands, allowing savvy investors to accumulate. He went further, claiming that some veteran Bitcoin holders used this opportunity to exit BTC and rotate into XRP, betting on its long-term breakout potential. While this claim lacks concrete on-chain evidence, it has captured the attention of traders looking for signs of a broader market realignment. RUMORS: BTC EARLY ADOPTERS ARE SELLING OUT TO BUY $XRP . — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 4, 2025 The XRP Adoption Narrative Farina has long promoted XRP as a sleeping giant poised for mass adoption. In previous posts, he introduced the concept of the “XRP Adoption Candle,” suggesting a coming wave of institutional use, regulatory clarity, and potential ETF listings. In his view, XRP’s fundamentals, especially its use in real-world cross-border transactions, are becoming too compelling to ignore. He’s warned followers not to make the same mistake early Bitcoin holders did when they sold at $500, only to see BTC surge past $100,000. According to Farina, selling XRP at $10 or even $20 could one day look just as short-sighted . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Skepticism and Reality Check Despite Farina’s assertions, no verifiable on-chain data confirms a mass migration from BTC to XRP. While XRP wallet activity has surged up nearly 500% since 2022, analysts note that most of this growth has been retail-driven. Bitcoin, by contrast, remains the institutional heavyweight, still dominating capital inflows and long-term holding behavior. Farina’s claim that Bitcoin early adopters are reallocating into XRP may be more speculative than factual, for now. But it taps into a growing belief that XRP’s moment is near and that its current price level represents a historic buying opportunity. Whether the rumor proves true or not, it reflects a palpable shift in sentiment, one that could redefine the next phase of crypto market leadership.

By 2028, NEAR is expected to rise to a maximum price of $9.57 , driven by mainstream adoption. Looking ahead to 2031, NEAR Protocol could witness a significant surge, with its price potentially reaching $22.22 or beyond. The rising bearish sentiment within NEAR Protocol’s community is bringing a cautious approach among traders. As NEAR continues to advance its technology and forge strategic partnerships, questions surrounding its price potential persist, inviting further analysis and exploration of its prospects. Overview Cryptocurrency NEAR Protocol Ticker NEAR Price $2.14 (-1.75%) Market Cap $2.63 Billion Trading Volume 24-h $150.99 Million Circulating Supply 1.22 Billion NEAR All-time High $20.42 Jan 17, 2022 All-time Low $0.526, Nov 04, 2020 24-h High $2.21 24-h Low $2.02 NEAR Protocol price prediction: Technical analysis Sentiment Bearish 50-Day SMA $2.57 200-Day SMA $3.49 Price Prediction $4.70 (119.82%) F & G Index 18.06 (extreme fear) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 14-Day RSI 31.09 NEAR Protocol price analysis: Near falls back to $2.10 TL;DR Breakdown: NEAR Protocol price analysis shows bearish pressure after falling below $2.15. NEAR price fell by 1.5% at the time of writing. NEAR Protocol has support and resistance at $2.10 and $2.20, respectively. Near Protocol price analysis for July 5 shows that NEAR price rose past $2.3 but failed to hold momentum and crashed back to $2.00 NEAR Protocol price analysis 1-day chart: NEAR faces bearish volatility toward $2 The 1-day NEAR/USD price chart indicates that the near protocol price trades in a steady downwards trend since rising toward $2.6. Sellers are now aiming for a strong push below $2 to initiate a breakdown below the trendline. NEAR/USDT price chart: TradingView The technical indicators suggest falling bullish momentum as NEAR falls toward $2.10 with the MACD bullish at 0.021 units suggesting low and decreasing bullish pressure. The EMAs are below the mean position, and the latest data shows declining bullish pressure. The RSI also shares this sentiment as the indicator rose to 45.00 from the 50.00 index level; though, it suggests room for further downwards movement. The wide Bollinger Bands suggest low volatility, indicating that the $2.10 level resistance may hold for the week. NEAR price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour price chart of NEAR shows that NEAR has found strong support at the $1.80 price level enabling the price to recover rapidly to $2.10 as bulls sought to go higher. However the recent rejection at $2.350 may result in another crash below the $2.00 price level. NEAR/USDT price chart: TradingView The RSI is at 41.96, suggesting that the asset is near the center of the the neutral region, which indicates that NEAR price observes slight bearish sentiment with room for movement in either direction. The MACD is showing steady bearish candles, with the MACD line at -0.014, showing rising bearish pressure. NEAR Protocol technical indicators: Levels and actions Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 2.32 SELL SMA 5 $ 2.34 SELL SMA 10 $ 2.26 SELL SMA 21 $ 2.21 SELL SMA 50 $ 2.46 SELL SMA 100 $ 2.50 SELL SMA 200 $ 3.21 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 2.25 SELL EMA 5 $ 2.32 SELL EMA 10 $ 2.40 SELL EMA 21 $ 2.48 SELL EMA 50 $ 2.77 SELL EMA 100 $ 3.34 SELL EMA 200 $ 3.98 SELL What to expect from NEAR Protocol price analysis? NEAR/USDT price chart: TradingView NEAR observes the bulls crashing into an iron board at the $3.3 mark that has sent the price crumbling back toward the $2 mark. If the bulls are unable to defend the level, any short-term gains made by the asset might be neutralized. As previously expected the price rose to $2.35 but failed to continue with the momentum. As such, traders should expect the coin to consolidate around the $2.10-2.20 mark for the next few day. Key levels to watch are $2.06 and $2.24 with each level suggesting a breakout from the consolidation. Is Near Protocol a good investment? NEAR Protocol distinguishes itself in the cryptocurrency market capitalization, emphasizing scalability, usability, and developer-friendliness. It aims to facilitate the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, catering to developers and end-users. NEAR’s innovative technology and user-centric approach make it attractive for mainstream adoption of blockchain applications. With a focus on user experience and developer tools, NEAR Protocol is positioned to drive significant medium term growth in the decentralized application ecosystem. Its potential to disrupt traditional industries and capture market share in the blockchain space makes it an intriguing investment opportunity for those interested in innovative technology solutions. Why is NEAR up? NEAR found strong support at the $1.80 price level that enabled the price to recover rapidly to $2.10 as bulls sought to go higher. However the recent rejection at $2.350 may result in another crash below the $2.00 price level. Will NEAR recover? NEAR protocol price has seen a massive selloff in the last thirty days as price fell from near the $3.00 mark to the current $2 price level. However, analysts believe that this bearish momentum will be short-term, predicting a price range of $2.25 and the $5.5 by the end of 2025. Will NEAR reach $10? NEAR protocol price is experiencing a volatile market movement that may see it reach the $10 mark before the end of 2027. Will NEAR reach $20? NEAR protocol price is expected to cross the $20 threshold by 2031 This supports the long term forecast as the industry continues to see increasing adoption across the mainstream. The bullish rally will be supported by NEAR’s vision of a scalable future and user and developer-friendly architecture that sets it apart from other blockchains. Will NEAR reach $50? The chance of NEAR protocol price reaching the $50 mark depends on various circumstances, such as future network development, market regulations, and the broader cryptocurrency market growth. If NEAR continues its current trajectory, it can reach $50 in the next several years. Does NEAR have a good long term future? Yes, NEAR has a good long-term future due to its innovative technology, focus on scalability and strong ecosystem development, which supports a favorable price prediction . However, the project must keep up with sector developments to maintain its edge in the digital ecosystem. Recent news/opinions on Near Protocol NEAR protocol’s Chain Signatures tech added support for EdDSA signing.

NEAR Protocol historic price sentiment NEAR price history The Near Protocol (NEAR) began its journey in August 2020, aiming to create a scalable and permissionless blockchain. The first recorded trade value in October 2020 was $1.072, closing the year at $1.459 after a recovery. In 2021, NEAR showed an uptrend, starting at $1.305 and reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $7.572 by March 13. A market downturn pushed the price down to $1.537 by July 19, but it rebounded to $11.776 on September 9 and further to $13.168 on October 26. By 2022, NEAR’s price crashed to below $2.00, losing over 90% of its peak value. Throughout 2023, NEAR saw low volatility, with prices remaining below $2.50 for most of the year. Since the start of 2024, NEAR has experienced a strong recovery, climbing to $7.80. However, after reaching the $8.00 mark in mid-May, it fell back to $5.60. In June, NEAR traded between $4.48 and $7.66. It rose from $5.20 to $6.04 in July but closed the month below $5.00. NEAR started August at $5.00, declining to $3.89 by the end of the month. In September 2024, the asset bounced back and closed the month above the $5.20 mark. In October, the price stumbled and fell to $4.850 in the first few days before closing the month below the $4.00 mark leaving a negative outlook at the start of November. November saw NEAR making remarkable strides as the bulls held strong control of markets during the month, a trend that was expected to continue into December. However, the month saw NEAR plummet from heights of $7.00 to fall below $5 before closing the month. In January the price could not find a stable foothold and the price continued dwindling, closing the month just above $4.00 In February the price fell significantly towards the $3.00 mark and continued to decline ending the month at $2.80. In March the price continued to decline ending the month near $2.50, a trend that continued in April ending the month at $2.35. In May the price recovered but only to the extent of reversing April’s losses as the month ended below $2.50. June saw further decay as despite the early bullish signals, bears dominated the month and NEAR closed the month around $2.12.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|NEAR|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-05 21:05:00

As major technology companies ramp up spending on data centers, AI chips, and other backend equipment that support AI and cloud computing products, it has resulted in a surge in demand for Foxconn’s manufacturing capabilities and revenue. Foxconn reports record Q2 revenue Taiwanese electronics giant Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd, announced record-breaking second-quarter revenue on Saturday. The increase in revenue was driven by increased demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing products. Foxconn is the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer and the biggest assembler of Apple Inc.’s iPhones. The company reported second-quarter revenue of T$1.797 trillion (approximately $55.2 billion), a figure that represents a 15.82% year-on-year increase. The figure surpassed market expectations, beating the T$1.7896 trillion forecast from LSEG SmartEstimate. Foxconn’s cloud and networking division, which serves major AI players like Nvidia Corp, saw significant growth. Sales from smart consumer electronics, which include Apple’s iPhone, showed a “flattish” year-on-year performance. Nevertheless, Foxconn reported a strong finish to the quarter, with its June revenue rising 10.09% on the year to T$540.237 billion, a record high for that month. The company did not provide a numerical forecast but said it expects growth in the third quarter compared to Q1 2025 and Q2 2024. Global concerns factor heavily in future quarterly forecasts Despite the impressive performance, Foxconn stressed the need for vigilance amid growing global uncertainties. “The impact of evolving global political and economic conditions and exchange rate changes will need continued close monitoring,” the company stated, without offering specific details. Foxconn stated that these external risks could undermine its performance going forward. The company’s call for caution follows renewed trade tension threats from the U.S. President, Donald Trump, who announced that he has signed letters to 12 countries detailing proposed tariffs on their exports to the U.S. These “take it or leave it” offers are reportedly set to be sent out on Monday. While no countries have been specifically named so far, the president’s actions could escalate global trade tensions and affect companies like Foxconn, which rely on complex cross-border supply chains. China-U.S. trade relations have historically been strained, even with the recent agreement between the world’s two largest economies regarding export restrictions. There is still the existential threat of relationship breakdowns and trade policy shifts that could have ripple effects on the firm’s business model. Currency fluctuations are also on the company’s radar. Exchange rate shifts have already affected Foxconn’s smart electronics division, and continued volatility could erode margins or complicate cost management across its international operations. Foxconn’s stock surged dramatically by 76% in 2023, significantly outperforming Taiwan’s broader market index, which rose 28.5%, but the stock has declined 12.5% so far in 2025. On Friday, the firm’s shares closed down 1.83% ahead of the revenue release, compared to a 0.73% drop in the Taiwan Weighted Index (TWII). The company is scheduled to release its full second-quarter earnings report on August 14.

This latest price pullback forces Bitcoin to maintain a consolidatory movement that has dominated the majority of last month drawing speculations about a potential market top. Interestingly, prominent market analyst Ted Pillows has weighed in on this discourse stating that historical data shows that Bitcoin is yet to achieve a peak price for the current market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To See 52% Increase To $166,000, Analyst Reveals Tight Timeline Bitcoin’s Consolidation: A Preparation For Final Bull Leg In an X post on July 4, Ted Pillows shares a bullish market insight following another Bitcoin price dip. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency seemed on course to resume its market uptrend after a significant price rebound from $99,000 in late June following weeks of downward consolidatory movement. However, another decisive rejection in the $110,000 indicates Bitcoin’s prices remain range-bound thereby worsening investors’ concern across the market. In interpreting this situation, Pillows has called for calm stating the recent price dip is merely a “leverage flush” that requires no panic. Using a visual study on the BTC weekly chart, the renowned analyst shows that the current and previous price pullbacks are part of a predictable pattern that has played out across previous Bitcoin cycles. The chart shows that after each halving event, Bitcoin tends to peak approximately 18 months (518 days) later. With the most recent halving occurring in mid April 2024, the expected peak for this cycle would fall somewhere around Q4 2025, specifically on October 13, 2025, consistent with historical performance. Furthermore, a recurring 140-day rally window is also depicted in the chart, usually forming the final leg of the bull run. In each previous cycle, this 10-bar stretch delivered parabolic price movements. If history is rhyming once again, Bitcoin is now within range of initiating this 10-week bull run, suggesting the equivalent rally seen in previous could soon kick in. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 As Analyst Calls It A ‘Powder Keg’ How High Can Bitcoin Price Go? Based on Pillows’ recent analysis, Bitcoin may be gathering momentum for its final rally of the present market cycle. The extent of this anticipated uptrend remains unknown; however, the presence of bullish factors most notably the high influx of institutional investment and the US pro-crypto policies supports a range of sky scraping targets. For example, Pillows has previously shared that the popular stock-to-flow model which uses Bitcoin’s scarcity to project long-term price trajectory has predicted a potential price target of $368,925 by 2025 end. If this prediction holds true, Bitcoin investors are eyeing an estimated 242% from current market prices. At press time, Bitcoin continues to trade at $108,299 reflecting a 0.83% gain in the past week.

This move is part of the platform’s effort to comply with India’s evolving tax regulations. However, it comes at a time when Indian investors are already burdened by strict tax rules . Bybit’s New GST Rule Affects a Wide Range of Crypto Trading The new GST rule will apply to all asset transfers between users and merchants on the trading platform. The tax will be taken directly from the assets users receive when they trade on the platform. This means users will receive slightly less cryptocurrency after each transaction, as the GST will be automatically deducted. The GST will be calculated based on the price difference, also known as the spread. Notably, this will be visible in each user’s transaction history along with the trading fees. Bybit confirmed that over 310,000 active Indian users will be affected by this update. Also, this new policy will apply to a wide range of trading activities. This includes spot and margin trading, derivatives, fiat purchases using bank cards, and even staking. Bybit explained that any service fees or earnings from these products will now be taxed under India’s GST rules. Bybit To End Key Features for Indian Users Bybit, which recently launched its decentralized exchange, Byreal , is also making significant changes to its services. Starting July 9, the exchange will remove several popular features for users in India. These include crypto loans, the Bybit fiat card, and trading bots. This update is part of a broader enhancement to the platform, affecting how users trade and utilize crypto on Bybit. The exchange emphasized that existing crypto loans must be paid back by July 17. Any unpaid balances will be settled automatically. The fiat card will be disabled for new transactions by that same date, and new card applications will no longer be accepted. Trading bots will be automatically deactivated starting July 9 as part of the broader service adjustments. Ongoing Challenges for Indian Crypto Investors Since 2022, India has introduced strict tax rules on cryptocurrency, including a 30% tax on profits and a 1% TDS on every transaction. These earlier rules have already led to a decline in trading activity. Now, Bybit’s upcoming 18% GST is set to add more pressure. Although the impact on crypto use in India is unclear, many traders are likely to feel its effects. While Bybit has complied with local tax laws, these changes may shape how people invest in cryptocurrency as we move forward.

While major players like ADA remain in consolidation, Mutuum Finance, a new DeFi crypto project is starting to spark serious interest across the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is at a low price of $0.03, the lowest it’ll ever be ahead of upcoming price increases. Phase 5 Presale of Mutuum Finance is currently more than 60% sold and is available at just $0.03. Over 12,700 investors participated in the Mutuum Finance presale. It has already raised the amount that exceeds more than $11.7 million. For those looking to diversify their crypto investment ahead of the next market move, this could be one of the top cryptocurrencies flying under the radar. Cardano Treads Water Ahead of Summer, Investors Eye Alternatives Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at around $0.56, holding steady but showing limited momentum as the broader altcoin market remains uncertain. Despite ongoing development and recent institutional interest, like Franklin Templeton’s integration of a Cardano node, ADA has struggled to break out of its tight range between $0.53 and $0.56. Analysts suggest that unless a strong catalyst appears, ADA could remain in this consolidation phase throughout the summer. While long-term fundamentals remain intact, some traders are looking elsewhere for faster returns. One presale token drawing increased attention right now is Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Experiences Strong Investor Uptake Mutuum Finance is gaining significant momentum in Phase 5 of the presale. The project stands out from others by offering a scalable system of finance with a real-world use case. Investor interest is gaining momentum with the project having raised well over $11.7 million already and having over 12,700 token holders. Introducing a DeFi Lending Model Mutuum Finance introduces a non-custodial liquidity protocol in which users retain their total ownership of assets while they participate in decentralized lending. The project adopts a double-model approach that incorporates Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending to foster increased flexibility and efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system uses smart contracts to deliver automated lending without any human intervention and instead, the smart contracts respond to the market by offering dynamic interest rates. Peer-to-Peer model removes middlemen and thus offers a direct link between lenders and borrowers. The model is highly favored by users in dealing with volatile assets where flexibility and tailor-made terms are required. CertiK-Audited with a $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance is also operating on the development of the fully collateralized Ethereum-based USD-backed stablecoin. The project incorporates smart contracts that are audited by security company, CertiK. Besides the guarantee of ensuring good maintenance of the code, this audit signifies that the team will be persistent to build a safe protocol DeFi. In order to reinforce this commitment, Mutuum Finance has implemented its Official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK through which it has allocated $50,000 in USDT rewards. The program has four levels, critical, major, minor, and low, and makes sure that any level of vulnerabilities are discovered and rewarded. As Cardano (ADA) continues to hover in a narrow range with limited short-term momentum, investors seeking higher-growth opportunities are turning toward early-stage projects with real utility. Mutuum Finance has emerged as a clear frontrunner, raising over $11.7 million and drawing in more than 12,700 investors during its presale, now over 60% sold out at a price of just $0.03. With a powerful DeFi lending model, CertiK-audited smart contracts, and a $50,000 bug bounty program, Mutuum offers both innovation and credibility.

As institutional interest in XRP gains traction across North America, the groundwork is being laid for what many believe could be the next big wave in crypto adoption, pending one breakthrough. XRP ETFs Gaining Ground in North America CryptoSensei highlighted that three major investment firms, Purpose Investments, Evolve ETFs, and 3iQ, have already secured regulatory approval for XRP ETFs in North America. Collectively, these firms manage over $32 billion in assets. Purpose Investments leads with $23 billion under management, followed by Evolve ETFs with $7 billion and 3iQ with $2 billion. While these approvals have primarily come from Canada, a jurisdiction known for its progressive stance on digital assets, they signal growing institutional confidence in XRP as a legitimate financial instrument. Canada has historically led the charge in crypto ETF approvals, having greenlit Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs long before the U.S. followed suit. The approval of XRP ETFs there could be the first domino in a broader shift toward mainstream adoption. This will make #XRP explode… #Crypto pic.twitter.com/aO2v2DBAg4 — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) July 5, 2025 Institutional Demand Waiting on U.S. Clarity According to CryptoSensei, between 11 and 12 major U.S. institutions have filed for XRP ETFs . However, none have been approved, largely due to the ongoing legal uncertainty surrounding Ripple and its native token. The crux of the delay remains the SEC’s long-running lawsuit against Ripple Labs, which alleges the company engaged in unregistered securities offerings through its XRP sales. Although Ripple scored a partial victory in July 2023 when Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security in itself, the case remains unresolved. Most recently, on June 26, 2025, Judge Torres rejected a proposed settlement agreement, leaving the legal status of XRP in limbo. Days later, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the company would no longer pursue a counter-appeal, and the SEC is expected to drop its appeal as well, effectively allowing the case to close. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 August Could Be the Turning Point CryptoSensei believes August could mark a decisive moment. “We will get an update on that in August. Please God, let this be finished and done in time,” he said, expressing the hope shared by many in the XRP community. A favorable conclusion to the case would remove the biggest barrier holding back U.S.-based XRP ETFs. With institutional demand already building and precedents set in neighboring markets, a final resolution in the Ripple case could ignite the long-anticipated XRP rally. If the SEC steps out of the way, ETF approvals could follow swiftly , positioning XRP for a significant price explosion fueled by mainstream investment flows. For now, all eyes are on August, as the crypto world waits to see whether XRP will finally be cleared for liftoff.

Hyperliquid’s HYPE token has surged over the last year, driven by significant trading volume and supply control. However, recent dips have raised questions about whether this momentum can be sustained. SUI, another rising contender, has attracted attention with bold price targets, but its user activity has slowed, leading to doubts about near-term growth. In stark contrast, BlockDAG’s recent partnership with the Seattle Seawolves and an impressive presale raising $331 million, with over 23.5 billion coins sold, reflects growing trust in the project. BlockDAG (BDAG) ROI since Batch 1 is 2,660%, and the special offer of purchasing tokens at $0.0016 has made it one of the most enticing long-term crypto investments available. Hyperliquid Price Outlook: Token Surges, and Momentum Hyperliquid has gained attention with a massive 1,000% surge in the HYPE token over the last year, backed by steady user demand. It has secured around 70% of the on-chain perpetuals volume and averaged $420 million in daily trading activity. This growth is largely attributed to the platform’s buy-and-burn model, where trading fees fund token buybacks, limiting supply. Despite the gains, recent price corrections raise concerns about sustaining this momentum. Hyperliquid’s airdrop strategy has helped avoid early sell-offs, but with the HYPE token experiencing fluctuations, it remains uncertain whether this rally will continue. Technical indicators suggest recovery after a brief dip from its $45 peak, but maintaining this growth will rely on consistent user engagement and managing supply efficiently. SUI Price: Bold Targets vs. User Momentum Slows The price potential for SUI has sparked debates, especially after Raoul Pal set an ambitious target of $22. However, the data suggests a more measured growth trajectory. While SUI has experienced short-term rallies, such as a 40% increase recently, its trading volume has cooled, indicating a possible slowdown in user interest. From a technical perspective, resistance around the $1.50 level remains a challenge. SUI’s price has yet to break through this ceiling, and without renewed demand, it may struggle to gain further upward movement. While SUI’s long-term fundamentals still hold promise, its immediate price potential will depend on overcoming these technical barriers and rekindling consistent usage. BlockDAG Joins Seattle Seawolves in Web3 Revolution The Seattle Seawolves have partnered with BlockDAG.Network to introduce blockchain-powered fan experiences. This collaboration aims to enhance fan interaction by offering unique digital ownership opportunities such as NFTs, tradable tokens, and exclusive collectibles linked to the team and its players. In addition, BlockDAG has become the Official Blockchain Partner of the Seattle Seawolves for the 2025 season. This partnership will include co-branded content, providing match previews, predictions, and exclusive behind-the-scenes moments across Seawolves’ social media channels. Fans will have access to blockchain-based digital assets, allowing them to collect and trade items securely. This partnership represents the merging of digital ownership with sports fan loyalty. The collaboration also underscores BlockDAG’s rising momentum, with its record-breaking presale continuing to attract attention. BlockDAG’s presale has raised over $331 million and sold 23.5 billion coins, with Batch 29 priced at $0.0276. For a limited time, buyers can purchase at just $0.0016, offering the potential for substantial returns. With the increasing adoption of Web3 technology, BlockDAG continues to solidify its status as one of the best long-term crypto investments. Conclusion While the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies often leads to unpredictable price swings, BlockDAG’s stable approach sets it apart. By locking its presale price at $0.0016, BlockDAG offers a clear, predictable entry point for buyers. This structured approach to its presale, currently in Batch 29 at $0.0276, eliminates the fear of missing out and gives participants confidence in their purchase. In the evolving landscape of crypto, where quick price spikes often distract from long-term value, BlockDAG offers a solid and stable investment opportunity. Its recent partnership and continued presale success show that its path is guided by real adoption and tangible progress, making it one of the best long-term crypto options for 2025.

But for investors chasing explosive growth, newer opportunities like Ruvi AI (RUVI) may hold greater potential. Analysts are pointing to a highly favorable set of circumstances that could see Ruvi AI reach a $1 valuation faster than expected , perhaps even challenging Binance Coin’s renowned growth trajectory. With $2.2 million raised during its presale, a robust foundation of more than 2,000 holders , and a utility-centered model, Ruvi AI is well-positioned for breakout success. Here’s how Ruvi AI is catching the attention of experts and why it could surpass expectations. Trust and Transparency Set Ruvi AI Apart At the center of Ruvi AI’s appeal is its commitment to security and transparency, qualities that are critical for early-stage crypto projects building investor confidence. Ruvi AI’s smart contracts have successfully passed a third-party audit by CyberScope , a respected blockchain auditing firm.

Ruvi AI has further solidified its reputation by partnering with WEEX Exchange , ensuring guaranteed post-presale liquidity . This allows investors to trade their tokens seamlessly once the project goes live. Together, robust auditing and liquidity strategies highlight Ruvi AI’s reliability, making it a sound investment for both newcomers and seasoned crypto enthusiasts. Real-World Applications Cement Value While speculative hype has often been a hallmark of rapid crypto growth, Ruvi AI focuses on delivering real-world utility . Combining blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI) , Ruvi AI provides scalable solutions that address core challenges in industries like marketing , entertainment , and finance . Practical Use Cases Driving Demand Marketing Businesses struggling with inefficient advertising budgets are utilizing Ruvi AI’s AI-tools for precision targeting and campaign optimization. This ensures higher returns on investment while minimizing costs.

Presale Momentum Signals Strong Market Enthusiasm Ruvi AI’s presale metrics indicate a promising future: $2.2 million raised , showcasing solid community support. Over 180 million tokens sold , signaling widespread market interest. More than 2,000 holders , highlighting its growing investor base. Currently in Phase 2 of its presale , Ruvi AI is priced at an attractive $0.015 per token . Once the presale ends, the price will jump to $0.07 , giving early participants a nearly 5x ROI . Analysts have even predicted Ruvi AI could reach $1 per token post-listing, equating to a life-changing 66x return on investment for initial backers. VIP Tiers Offer Massive Bonus Opportunities A unique feature of Ruvi AI’s presale is its VIP investment tiers , which offer substantial bonuses. These tiers make it possible for investors to amplify their returns significantly. Here’s the breakdown: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiers allow early supporters to maximize their financial gains by capitalizing on Ruvi AI’s rising token valuation. Why Ruvi AI Could Overtake Binance Coin’s Momentum While Binance Coin remains a solid investment for those seeking steady long-term growth, its established position limits its potential for meteoric short-term gains. By contrast, Ruvi AI’s early-stage potential, combined with its trusted audit , liquidity assurance , and real-world applications , makes it a more dynamic opportunity for investors seeking substantial returns. Priced at just $0.015 , Ruvi AI delivers a compelling entry point, offering exponential growth possibilities as it targets a $1 valuation and beyond. Thanks to its innovative approach, demand-driven utility, and investor-focused presale structure, Ruvi AI is setting itself up as a breakout player in the cryptocurrency space.

Outset PR Uncovers an 82% Media Meltdown That Could Block Your Reach,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/trying-to-scale-your-web3-project-in-europe-outset-pr-uncovers-an-82-media-meltdown-that-could-block-your-reach,"As crypto adoption surges across Europe, you'd expect media visibility to follow suit. But according to Outset PR’s latest report , the opposite is happening. Between January and March 2025, 82% of crypto-native media outlets in Western Europe lost traffic. The platforms that once shaped narratives and drove awareness for Web3 startups are now struggling to survive under the combined weight of regulation, algorithmic change, and shifting user behavior. If you’re trying to scale your Web3 project in Europe, this meltdown might be the invisible force throttling your reach. The Paradox: Rising Interest, Shrinking Visibility Crypto interest across the EU is rising: ownership in some countries like Slovenia, Italy, and Croatia exceeds 15%, and Europe's total on-chain crypto value exceeded $500 billion last year which accounted for over 21% of the global value. Source: Chainalysis Yet, while the audience grows, media channels are losing their grip. Outset PR analyzed 133 media outlets across the region, 87 of which were crypto-focused, and found that 82% suffered traffic losses in Q1 2025. The reasons, though varied by country, point to a common denominator: the convergence of regulatory pressure, algorithmic change, and market volatility. At the center of this shift is MiCA , the European Union’s new crypto regulation framework. While full enforcement is still rolling out, its early impact has already reshaped how crypto content is written, published, and ranked. Under MiCA-aligned interpretations, regulators from Paris to Rome began scrutinizing tone, affiliate disclosures, and investment-style language — effectively forcing outlets to recalibrate both editorial and monetization models. Some regional regulators interpreted MiCA differently, so the impact of this new framework verified depending on the country: Source: Outset report Outset’s report also revealed that just 7 outlets across the region crossed the 1 million monthly visits threshold, and accounted for 60.26% of total traffic. Another 6 made up most of the mid-tier. But beyond that, 58 outlets drew under 100K visits each, showing how fragmented and vulnerable the long tail of crypto media has become. Real Numbers, Real Fallout Outset PR’s traffic tracking via SimilarWeb and Ahrefs shows just how deep the cuts go: Italian outlets: Over 70% saw visibility drop, despite high local interest. Dutch-language media: 76% lost search traffic after Google’s March update. German-speaking sites: Nearly 40% of total outlets, yet most failed to hold their audience. UK platforms: Though not subject to MiCA, many got hit by the FCA’s expanded financial promotions regime. Source: Outset report Only a few outliers — like Bit2Me News (Spain, +149.4%) and CoinJournal DE (Germany, +23.9%) — managed to grow, thanks to multilingual content, regulatory awareness, and technical SEO strength. Algorithmic Gatekeeping: The Discover Problem Beyond traditional search rankings, Google Discover has emerged as a powerful channel for crypto media distribution. But here too, the visibility crisis is deepening. Outset PR’s report reveals that only 22.99% of crypto-native media outlets in Western Europe maintained consistent presence in Google Discover throughout Q1 2025. By comparison, 32.61% of generalist finance, tech, and economic platforms — the kind that cover crypto as part of broader business reporting — held steady in Discover. This seemingly narrow percentage gap translates into a massive disparity in reach. For Web3 founders, this shift has immediate consequences. Even the most compelling project announcements, protocol updates, or ecosystem news may never surface in front of their intended audience if they rely on media partners that are excluded from Discover. Why This Blocks Your Growth If you’re relying on crypto media in Europe to boost your brand, here’s the harsh truth: your message may never reach the audience it deserves. With fewer high-traffic platforms, limited Google Discover inclusion , and increasing compliance pressure, traditional media outreach is no longer enough. Worse still, many remaining outlets under 100K monthly visits now lack the editorial firepower or domain authority to move the needle — especially for token launches, exchange listings, or major product drops. Conclusion The European Web3 opportunity is enormous with rising user adoption, institutional momentum, and a unified regulatory framework under MiCA. But Outset PR’s latest report makes one thing painfully clear: the infrastructure for visibility is collapsing right when it’s needed most. Crypto-native media outlets are bleeding traffic. Google Discover is excluding a growing number of them. And regional regulators are rewriting the rules of public communication. For founders and marketing leaders, the implications are strategic. Getting covered is no longer enough — you need compliance-ready storytelling, multilingual editorial alignment, and a targeted outreach strategy that prioritizes quality over quantity. That’s where Outset PR comes in. As the only data-driven communications agency, Outset builds visibility strategies that match the new rules of engagement. In this new cycle, the winners won’t just be the loudest. They’ll be the most visible to the right audience, through the right channels and at the right level of credibility.
