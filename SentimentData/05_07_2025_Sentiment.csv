Investors are moving out of saturated meme tokens and back into assets with clearer narratives and forward-looking momentum. XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE are two names that keep surfacing on analyst dashboards—each for very different reasons, yet both riding a wave of renewed interest. Why Analysts Are Backing MAGACOIN FINANCE for 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE, now in Stage 3 of its rollout, has surpassed millions in funding across its early stages. The project stands out for its capped supply (170 billion tokens), zero-tax design, and smart contract audit by HashEx. But the bigger story lies in how it’s positioning itself—not just as another meme token, but as a commentary on power, decentralization, and community control. Analysts have noted its early-stage similarities to Dogecoin’s community roots, but without the infinite supply and loosely defined direction. Instead, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers something sharper: cultural positioning mixed with transparent rollout mechanics and no venture capital ownership. It’s this blend of structure and narrative that has prompted some desks to frame MAGACOIN FINANCE as the “XRP of the memecoin sector.” While XRP builds utility through institutions, MAGACOIN FINANCE leans on social ideology—yet both are pushing toward longevity, not just short-term pumps. XRP Clears Room for MAGACOIN FINANCE XRP, long a symbol of institutional crypto, is benefiting from the thaw in regulatory tensions and rising odds of ETF approval. Its settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year cleared a major hurdle, making it more accessible to funds, treasuries, and retail platforms. With Bloomberg analysts now placing XRP ETF approval odds above 90%, the token is drawing significant inflows, even as the broader market shows signs of fatigue. But this attention isn’t confined to legacy altcoins. It’s also spilling over into a new class of assets built on narrative and ideology. At the center of that shift is MAGACOIN FINANCE—a decentralized political memecoin that’s gaining ground as older meme coins slow down. DOGE and SHIB Cool Off as Traders Hunt Fresh Momentum Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, once unstoppable, are now retracing. DOGE is down nearly 50% year-to-date, with SHIB following a similar trendline. Neither token has introduced major protocol upgrades or ecosystem shifts in recent months, leaving traders to weigh opportunity cost. As capital exits from these positions, attention is turning toward meme assets that still feel early—and MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing that momentum. Its community has grown steadily across social platforms, and discussion around future exchange listings is building. While DOGE and SHIB remain cultural staples, they’re no longer driving portfolio gains. Instead, they’re digesting previous highs while newer entrants take their place in the spotlight. Bottom Line: New Cycle, New Contenders XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE represent different ends of the crypto spectrum—one institutional, the other ideological. But both are demonstrating staying power in a market that’s actively sorting substance from noise. With ETFs, audits, community growth, and clear narratives, they’ve emerged as assets that can carry into the next cycle. DOGE and SHIB aren’t gone—but their roles are shifting. No longer the face of momentum trades, they’re watching from the sidelines as newer, sharper projects take the lead.

Meanwhile, SRM Entertainment completes its historic $100 million TRX treasury launch , staking 365 million tokens with a 10% annual yield, targeting corporate balance sheet adoption. A strong technical foundation emerges with the price above the 20-day ( $0.2764 ), 50-day ( $0.2671 ), 100-day ( $0.2566 ), and 200-day ( $0.2392 ) EMAs, as institutional treasury strategies drive unprecedented corporate adoption. Source: Cryptonews The market cap reaches $26.89 billion, with a steady daily volume of $477.09 million supporting structural consolidation momentum. The following analysis synthesizes ChatGPT’s 42 real-time technical indicators, corporate treasury developments, institutional adoption metrics, and ecosystem growth data to assess TRX’s 90-day price trajectory amid the emerging altcoin treasury movement. Technical Foundation: Bullish Structure Above All EMAs TRON’s current price of $0.2834 reflects a decline of -1.25% from its opening price of $0.2870 , establishing a tight trading range between $0.2880 (high) and $0.2812 (low). This controlled volatility demonstrates uptrend stability within established parameters. RSI at 58.54 remains in healthy bullish territory, with substantial room for continued appreciation without concerns of overbought conditions. Source: TradingView MACD indicators show early bullish development, with the MACD line at 0.0008 trading above zero, confirming a positive momentum direction. The positive histogram at 0.0007 suggests building momentum acceleration, despite a slight signal line divergence. The exceptional technical strength stems from its price positioning above all major EMAs, a rare bullish alignment that indicates a robust trend structure. Trading above the 20-day EMA ( $0.2752 ), 50-day EMA ( $0.2709 ), 100-day EMA ( $0.2623 ), and 200-day EMA ( $0.2454 ) creates multiple support levels confirming sustained uptrend validity. Corporate Treasury Shift: $100M TRX Staking Strategy SRM Entertainment has achieved a major milestone, completing its $100 million TRON treasury launch by staking 365 million TRX tokens through the JustLend protocol, targeting an annual return of 10%. SRM Entertainment, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRM) announced the completion of its $100 million TRON treasury strategy deployment. The company has staked 365,096,845 TRX on JustLend to earn up to 10% annualized returns, combining staking rewards and energy rental income.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 30, 2025 The treasury strategy combines staking yields with energy rental income, creating diversified return streams that appeal to corporate treasury managers seeking yield enhancement. SRM is also rebranding to Tron Inc. with Justin Sun as an advisor. SRM Entertainment’s unique business model extends beyond crypto, manufacturing souvenirs for Disney, Universal Studios, and Six Flags, demonstrating how mainstream corporations can integrate cryptocurrency treasury strategies. The company’s $150 million market valuation, following a 13.5% stock surge, validates investor approval of crypto treasury adoption. This development positions TRON alongside Ethereum, Solana, and XRP in the emerging altcoin treasury movement, where corporations diversify balance sheets beyond Bitcoin. The 10% yield potential substantially exceeds traditional corporate cash management returns, driving institutional interest. Historical Performance: Steady Recovery Building Momentum TRON’s 2025 price action exhibits remarkable stability compared to the broader cryptocurrency market’s volatility. January-March saw consistent trading ranges of $0.25 – $0.27 , establishing a strong base for current appreciation. April and May saw minor corrections to the $0.24–$0.25 levels, representing healthy consolidation that created accumulation opportunities without breaking the technical structure. June’s recovery to a $0.27 closing price established momentum continuation patterns that support current technical positioning. Current price action above $0.28 represents the extension of the established uptrend, with corporate treasury validation providing fundamental support for continued appreciation. Support & Resistance: EMA Stack Provides Multiple Safety Nets Immediate support emerges at today’s low around $0.2783 , reinforced by the strong 20-day EMA support at $0.2752 . This confluence creates an initial foundation for any short-term retracements during the current institutional positioning. The exceptional support structure extends across multiple EMA levels, including the 50-day EMA at $0.2709 , the 100-day EMA at $0.2623 , and the 200-day EMA at $0.2454 . This tiered support system provides multiple safety nets that appeal to risk-conscious institutional investors. Resistance begins at today’s high around $0.2829 , followed by the key psychological level at $0.2850–$0.2900 . Breaking above this zone would indicate acceleration toward major psychological resistance at $0.3000–$0.3100 . Strong resistance emerges at previous range highs around $0.3900–$0.4000 , representing the December 2024 all-time highs. Stablecoin Infrastructure: USDT Dominance Drives Utility TRON’s leadership in stablecoin settlements also creates sustainable demand drivers beyond speculative trading. The network processes five times more USDT transactions than Ethereum, demonstrating superior efficiency for institutional settlement needs. $USDT supply on #TRON has surpassed $80B, now representing over 50% of all circulating #USDT . This solidifies TRON’s position as the dominant stablecoin settlement layer. Track stablecoin flows with Glassnode: https://t.co/Lk7vkD8US6 pic.twitter.com/S6dfTYFhgz — glassnode (@glassnode) June 27, 2025 Daily transactions have nearly doubled since September 2023 , indicating accelerating adoption across both retail and institutional segments. Market Metrics: Steady Growth Supporting Corporate Adoption TRON maintains a $26.7 billion market capitalization with moderate 1.35% market dominance, positioning TRX as an established infrastructure rather than a speculative altcoin. The $434.17 million daily trading volume provides adequate liquidity for institutional participation. The circulating supply of 94.78 billion TRX represents a complete token distribution, eliminating concerns about supply overhang that affect other projects. This transparency appeals to corporate treasury managers requiring predictable tokenomics. The volume-to-market cap ratio of 1.46% indicates healthy trading activity without excessive speculation. Current pricing is 36% below December 2024 all-time highs, providing attractive entry points for institutional investors while maintaining substantial appreciation from 2017 lows. Social Sentiment: Corporate Validation Drives Community Optimism LunarCrush data reveals strong community engagement with a Galaxy Score of 50, indicating positive sentiment momentum. The 86% positive sentiment reflects the community’s enthusiasm for corporate treasury developments and technical performance. Social dominance of 0.6% with 337.94K total engagements demonstrates steady community interest without speculative excess. This balanced engagement profile supports sustainable appreciation rather than pump-and-dump patterns. Recent social themes focus on corporate treasury adoption, Nasdaq milestone achievements, and technical breakout potential. 90-Day TRX Price Forecast Corporate Treasury Expansion (Bull Case – 40% Probability) Additional corporate treasury adoptions following SRM’s success could drive appreciation toward $0.35–$0.40 , representing 24–42% upside. This scenario requires successful institutional onboarding and sustained yield generation from staking strategies. Technical targets include $0.30 psychological resistance, followed by $0.35 and $0.40 based on historical levels. Corporate treasury momentum could attract additional institutional interest, creating sustained demand above speculative patterns. Gradual Appreciation (Base Case – 45% Probability) Continued steady growth within the current uptrend channels could target $0.32–$0.35 over the next 90 days . This scenario reflects sustained technical momentum, albeit without a dramatic acceleration in corporate adoption. Support at the EMA structure between $0.2450 and $0.2750 would likely hold during normal consolidation periods. Volume maintaining current levels around 120–140 million TRX daily supports measured appreciation. Technical Correction (Bear Case – 15% Probability) Breaking below the 50-day EMA support at $0.2709 could trigger a correction toward $0.2450–$0.2600 . This scenario would require broader market weakness or disappointments in corporate treasury strategy. The strong EMA support structure limits downside risk, with the 200-day EMA at $0.2454 providing key long-term trend support. TRX Forecast: Infrastructure Excellence Meets Corporate Validation TRON’s positioning reflects the convergence of technical strength, corporate treasury validation, and infrastructure advantages in stablecoin settlements. The 42-signal analysis reveals a cryptocurrency positioned for institutional adoption beyond speculative trading. SRM Entertainment’s $100 million treasury launch sets a precedent for corporate TRX adoption through yield-generating strategies. Technical indicators confirm a bullish structure, with the price above all major EMAs, while RSI positioning and positive MACD development suggest that momentum is building. Current consolidation above $0.28 , with corporate validation, creates optimal positioning for accelerated institutional adoption. The combination of technical strength, yield generation potential, and infrastructure advantages positions TRX for sustained appreciation as corporate treasury strategies expand throughout 2025 .

47482546,https://cryptonews.com/?p=379067,1751668339,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/47482546.jpeg,"Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana and Cardano by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/gemini-ai-xrp-solana-cardano-price-predictions-2025/,"Google’s Gemini predicts that leading altcoins may find new price highs through the latter part of 2025. See, in the last 24 hours Bitcoin rose to $109,997, which put it just 1.6% short of beating its historic price peak of $111,814 on May 22. Clearly bulls are looking to recapture that ground fast, which bodes well for various other leading cryptocurrencies, since Bitcoin clearly sets the pace of growth for the rest of the industry. This persistent market optimism has led many to believe that the next bull cycle could eclipse the legendary 2021 bull market, with altcoins expected to chart unprecedented highs. Here are several digital assets that Gemini has identified as having strong growth potential in the coming months. XRP (Ripple): Google’s Gemini Expects a Smooth Doubling for This Global Payments Leader According to Gemini’s forecasts, Ripple’s XRP could reach $20 by late 2025—effectively increasing ninefold from its present price of around $2.23. This positive projection is driven by growing institutional integration, strengthened regulatory clarity, and speculation regarding a potential XRP spot ETF approval, which would broaden access to institutional and retail buyers. XRP continues to enjoy worldwide recognition for facilitating quick, low-cost, and compliant cross-border payments. In 2024, the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) lauded XRP for its effectiveness in facilitating instant international remittances without intermediaries. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! UN Endorses @Ripple and @StellarOrg as Cornerstones of New Global Payments Network! #XRP and #XLM will run the new financial system! pic.twitter.com/ufewexCKmR — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 13, 2024 A landmark U.S. court decision ruled that XRP’s retail sales did not constitute securities transactions, delivering a major setback to the SEC’s long-standing claims. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed in March that the protracted legal battle had finally concluded, removing a major obstacle and lifting market sentiment for XRP and the broader altcoin space. In the short term, resistance around $3 remains a key test. Should XRP surpass this barrier in the coming months, a move toward $5 (Gemini’s most conservative target) by year-end becomes increasingly feasible. However, getting to Gemini’s most ambitious target of $20 would require serious political developments, mainly a framework for regulating crypto in the US and a peaceful solution to the Middle East crisis. It’s also worth noting that XRP is clearly the best-performing coin among the projects with billionaire market caps. In the last 365 days, its price has risen 397% compared to Bitcoin’s meager 88%. Solana ($SOL): Gemini Projects This High-Throughput Blockchain Could More-Than-Treble by New Year Solana ($SOL) remains a formidable player in the smart contract ecosystem, second only to Ethereum in terms of decentralized application deployment and user activity. With its market cap now approaching $80.5 billion, SOL continues to attract developer interest and institutional funds. Speculation is mounting around the potential approval of a Solana spot ETF in the U.S., which could mirror the substantial capital inflows seen for Bitcoin and Ethereum after their ETF launches. Moreover, discussions of including SOL within a proposed U.S. digital asset reserve are enhancing its standing among large-scale investors. From a technical perspective, Solana has reversed its previous downtrend. After sliding from highs above $250 in January to lows near $100 in April, it recently broke out from a descending wedge pattern in early April—a formation typically viewed as bullish—and now trades for $150. Gemini’s projections place SOL at $500 by the end of 2025, up from its current trading price of around $150, more than tripling its value. A bullish summer could see SOL reaching $300, while a subsequent rise into the $500 range is considered well within reach. Some analysts even believe Solana can hit the the $1,000 milestone, but it would require the green light of US crypto legislation to catalyze such a big price movement. Cardano ($ADA): Google’s Gemini Predicts a Massive 10X Upsurge for This Smart Contract Pioneer Cardano ($ADA) was recently sighted in the crosshairs of US President Donald Trump, who took to his social media platform, Truth Social, to post a proposal to include ADA as part of a US Strategic Crypto Reserve strategy. Unlike Bitcoin, which the plan suggested the government could directly acquire, Cardano would be sourced exclusively via law enforcement seizures. Created by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano staked its reputation on a rigorous, research-driven development approach and emphasis on scalability and environmental sustainability. With a market valuation near $21 billion, ADA remains a key competitor to Ethereum and is closing in on rapidly growing blockchains like Solana. Gemini’s models suggest ADA could reach $5.66 by the end of this year—a near tenfold jump from its current level of $0.58. Technically, ADA has been consolidating within a descending wedge pattern since late 2024. A breakout above its $1.10 resistance could trigger a short-term rally toward $1.50. Under a strong bull market scenario, even Gemini’s most conservative upside target of around $3 could see ADA surpassing its previous all-time high of $3.09. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): Meme-Driven Layer-2 Solution Primed for a Breakout While Google’s Gemini excels in evaluating established assets, it may not fully account for the explosive potential of early-stage projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . This presale-phase, meme-inspired Layer-2 protocol merges viral marketing with technical innovation. Although $HYPER is not yet trading on major exchanges such as Gemini, its presale has already raised over $1.9 million, with early backers eyeing potential 10X returns post-launch. Leveraging Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) architecture, Bitcoin Hyper integrates smart contract capabilities into the Bitcoin ecosystem through its proprietary Layer-2 network. Its Canonical Bridge supports rapid and cost-efficient transactions alongside an expanding suite of DeFi and NFT functionalities. Recent security audits by Coinsult found no key vulnerabilities, enhancing investor confidence. The native $HYPER token powers governance, staking, fees, and access to its ecosystem, while staking yields currently reach as high as 408% APY.

DOGE is trading below all major EMAs with a massive 636.62M volume surge as it tests key support at the $0.155–$0.160 zone. Strong selling pressure emerges as the price falls below the 20-day EMA ( $0.16855 ), 50-day EMA ( $0.17932 ), 100-day EMA ( $0.19104 ), and 200-day EMA ( $0.20457 ), amid heightened political drama, introducing volatility. Source: Cryptonews The market cap stands at $24.33 billion , with an explosive 42.16% volume surge to $908.02 million , validating institutional repositioning during periods of uncertainty. The following analysis synthesizes ChatGPT’s 42 real-time technical indicators, political developments, sentiment metrics, and technical patterns to assess DOGE’s 90-day trajectory amid escalating political tensions and chart pattern formations. Technical Breakdown: Bearish Structure Dominates All Timeframes Dogecoin’s current price of $0.16241 reflects a major 5.58% daily decline from its opening price of $0.17201, establishing a concerning trading range between $0.17296 (high) and $0.16128 (low). This $0.01168 intraday spread indicates high volatility during periods of political uncertainty. Source: TradingView RSI at 43.57 approaches oversold territory without reaching extreme levels, indicating balanced momentum despite intense selling pressure. This positioning suggests DOGE remains vulnerable to further declines without immediate reversal signals from technical indicators. MACD indicators display conflicting readings with the MACD line at 0.00176 , trading slightly above zero, which suggests underlying bullish momentum. However, the negative histogram at -0.00733 indicates strong bearish momentum divergence requiring careful monitoring for breakdown cues. Source: TradingView Political Drama Impact: Musk-Trump Tensions Drive Volatility The political feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has introduced volatility to DOGE, with speculation surrounding the DOGE agency creating uncertainty among investors. This political drama represents a departure from traditional meme-driven rallies, introducing systematic risk to DOGE’s price action. Donald Trump on whether or not he’ll deport Elon Musk amid their feud: “I don’t know. We’ll have to take a look. We may have to put DOGE on Elon, You know what DOGE is? DOGE is the monster that might have to go back and eat Elon.” pic.twitter.com/eO4FB0QTTh — Pop Base (@PopBase) July 1, 2025 Elon Musk’s speculation about a new American party has generated increased attention for potential meme coin boom scenarios, although current political tensions have overshadowed these bullish narratives.

Time for a new political party that actually cares about the people. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 30, 2025 The timing of political developments coincides with technical breakdown patterns, amplifying downward pressure. Ascending Triangle Formation: Bulls Maintain Hope Despite Breakdown Technical analysts identify a large ascending triangle pattern on weekly charts, representing a classic bullish structure despite current price weakness. The pattern shows DOGE holding trendline support around $0.17 , though the recent breakdown challenges this bullish thesis. $DOGE Weekly Chart Update $DOGE is forming a large ascending triangle pattern on the weekly — a classic bullish structure!

This pattern typically resolves with upward breakouts, though current political tensions complicate traditional technical analysis assumptions. Source: TradingView Multiple bounces off key support zones indicate institutional interest in DOGE accumulation during periods of weakness, although the recent breakdown below triangle support raises questions about the pattern’s validity. The next few weeks will be key in determining whether bulls can reclaim triangle support or bears continue driving prices lower. Historical Context: Sharp Correction from January Highs DOGE’s 2025 performance exhibits extreme volatility following January’s strong close at $0.33 , representing the local high for the year. The subsequent correction to February’s $0.20 and stabilization around $0.17 in March and April established the current trading ranges. May’s modest recovery to $0.19, followed by June’s decline to $0.16, demonstrates DOGE’s inability to sustain momentum without major catalysts. Current price action represents the continuation of the correction cycle that began after January’s peak performance. The 51% decline from January highs to current levels reflects DOGE’s high-beta nature and sensitivity to sentiment shifts. This historical context provides perspective on current weaknesses while highlighting DOGE’s potential for dramatic reversals during periods of positive catalysts. Support & Resistance: Key Levels Define Next Direction Immediate support emerges at today’s low of around $0.16128 , reinforced by the key support zone at $0.15500-$0.16000 . This confluence represents the most significant technical level for determining DOGE’s near-term direction and potential for deeper correction. Major support zones extend from $0.14000 to $0.15000, representing historical accumulation levels, followed by strong support from $0.12000 to $0.13000, corresponding to previous cycle lows. These levels provide multiple safety nets during extended correction scenarios. #Dogecoin is at the third touchpoint of an ascending channel, making it the ideal buy level before a huge surge $Doge /M1 pic.twitter.com/ZiYlzKPAaG — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) July 4, 2025 Resistance begins immediately at the 20-day EMA, located at $0.16855 , representing the first hurdle for any potential recovery attempts. The key resistance cluster lies between the 50-day EMA ( $0.17932 ) and the 100-day EMA ( $0.19104 ), creating a challenging overhead supply. Market Metrics: High Volume Confirms Selling Pressure DOGE maintains a $24.33 billion market capitalization with an exceptional 24-hour trading volume of $908.02 million , representing a massive 42.16% surge. The volume-to-market cap ratio of 3.74% suggests intense selling pressure during periods of political uncertainty. The high volume surge to 636.62M DOGE confirms institutional repositioning during breakdown attempts, validating technical analysis rather than suggesting accumulation. This volume pattern supports a bearish interpretation of current price action. Source: CoinMarketCap Current pricing represents a 78% discount to the all-time highs achieved in 2021 , although comparison to recent highs shows a 51% decline from the January 2025 peaks. This positioning provides long-term value arguments while acknowledging significant technical damage. Social Sentiment: Community Optimism Fights Technical Reality LunarCrush data reveals resilient community engagement with 83% positive sentiment despite recent price weakness. The social dominance of 2.95% with 2.71 million total engagements demonstrates DOGE’s ability to maintain attention during correction periods. Recent social themes have focused on ascending triangle formations, accumulation opportunities, and long-term bullish scenarios targeting the $1 level. The prophecy: $1 $DOGE pic.twitter.com/SESlJ33hMT — Chimp of the North (@cryptochimpanz) July 4, 2025 Community discussions emphasize technical patterns while acknowledging the short-term political headwinds that affect price action. The disconnect between social sentiment ( 83% positive) and technical indicators (bearish) represents typical DOGE community behavior during correction periods. This resilient sentiment provides fundamental support for eventual recovery scenarios. 90-Day DOGE Price Forecast Political Resolution Rally (Bull Case – 30% Probability) Resolution of Musk-Trump political tensions, combined with a breakout from an ascending triangle, could drive the recovery toward $0.25–$0.29 , representing a 54–79% upside. This scenario requires political clarity and successful defense of $0.155–$0.160 support zone with volume confirmation. Source: TradingView Technical targets include $0.20 , $0.25 , and $0.29 based on triangle pattern measurements and historical resistance levels. The meme coin narrative could resurface strongly if political uncertainties resolve favorably for DOGE-related speculation. Extended Correction (Base Case – 50% Probability) Continued political uncertainty and technical breakdown could drive DOGE toward $0.12–$0.14 , representing a 14–26% downside. This scenario assumes ongoing political tensions and failure to hold key support levels during summer trading periods. Source: TradingView Support at $0.155–$0.160 would likely fail during an extended correction, with volume normalizing around 400–500 million DOGE daily. This sideways-to-downward action provides better accumulation opportunities for long-term holders seeking lower entry points. Deep Correction (Bear Case – 20% Probability) Severe political escalation or broader market weakness could trigger a correction toward $0.10–$0.12 , representing a 26–38% downside. This scenario would require strong negative catalysts beyond current political tensions. Source: TradingView The strong community sentiment and meme coin resilience limit extreme downside scenarios, with major support at $0.12–$0.13 providing key long-term trend support for future recovery cycles. DOGE Forecast: Political Drama Meets Technical Breakdown DOGE’s current positioning reflects the convergence of political uncertainty, technical breakdown, and community resilience. The 42-signal analysis reveals that the cryptocurrency is positioned at a key juncture between pattern continuation and a major correction. Current consolidation around $0.16 with critical support at $0.155 – $0.160 creates a decision point for DOGE’s trajectory. The combination of political drama, technical weakness, and community optimism positions DOGE for volatile price action as catalysts develop throughout Q3 2025 .

As optimism for the future of digital currencies gains momentum, three standout ventures are leading the discussion. This article reveals which tokens are poised for substantial growth and why they are generating so much buzz. Hyperliquid Gains Soar Amid Key Price Levels and Momentum Hyperliquid showed steady gains with a weekly change of 8.21% and a monthly gain of 7.47%. Over the last six months, the coin surged by 54.82%, reflecting a robust upward movement. Price action during these periods reveals an asset building momentum while recovering from lower levels, indicating increasing trader confidence. The current trading range shows levels migrating between $31.70 and $46.60, demonstrating a balanced market dynamic. Bulls maintain the upper hand as the coin trades above the nearest support at $23.85, while buyers challenge resistance at $53.65. A second layer of resistance at $68.55 and support at $8.95 provide reference points for traders. Market indicators portray a nearly neutral trend with the RSI at 53.42 slightly favoring bullish momentum. Traders may consider accumulating positions near support levels while monitoring for movements above resistance, which could signal higher targets. A cautious approach is advisable if price action moves toward the lower bound, as slipping below $23.85 may trigger a bearish correction. AVAX Recent Swings and Key Levels to Watch AVAX experienced mixed price movements recently, with a weekly increase of about 5.7% followed by a monthly drop of around 13.84%. Over the past six months, the coin declined nearly 57.31%, indicating cautious trading and heightened selling pressure. The price action in the last month shows the market struggled to maintain upward momentum, with investors reacting to broader market concerns. The significant six-month decline underscores a prolonged period of downward pressure affecting trader sentiment and valuation. Price volatility and frequent adjustments have shaped AVAX’s trajectory, with investors closely monitoring temporary gains amidst an overall bearish backdrop. At present, AVAX is trading in a range between $14.82 and $21.92, with key support at $11.69 and resistance near $25.89. Current indicators, such as the Awesome Oscillator at -0.885 and a Momentum Indicator near -0.014, suggest a slight leaning toward sellers. The RSI at 46.86 implies that pressure is building on the downside, despite recent weekly gains indicating a hint of recovery. Bears are currently dominant due to the lack of a sustained upward trend, yet bulls may find opportunities if prices bounce off support. A move above $25.89 could push prices toward the next resistance at $32.99, while a slip below $11.69 may lead to drops toward $4.59. Trading within these levels suggests buying at lower extremes and potential short positions near resistance, making tighter stop-loss management advisable. Toncoin: Recent Sell-off and Key Levels to Watch Toncoin experienced a notable downtrend over the past six months, with its price dropping nearly 50.82%. In the last month, the coin’s price fell about 11.47%, indicating continued bearish pressure in the market. The trading range has been volatile, with small weekly gains of 0.04% failing to reverse the larger downward momentum. The coin's struggle to regain upward strength reflects overall weakness and uncertainty in recent sessions. Currently, Toncoin trades between $2.55 and $3.34, with immediate resistance near $3.76 and support around $2.18. Additional barriers are noted at $4.56 on the upside and $1.39 on the downside. Key indicators, including an Awesome Oscillator at -0.139 and an RSI of 42.08, highlight a lingering bearish bias. Without a clear trend, traders might look for buying opportunities near support levels or consider short plays if the price fails to break resistance. Observing price action within these levels is crucial for short-term strategies. Conclusion HYPE , AVAX , and TON are gaining traction in the crypto sector. These projects are starting to define the future of the industry. They offer fresh possibilities and innovative solutions. Each one brings unique features and potential. This prominence suggests promising developments ahead. These projects are not just trends but pivotal players. They indicate a more robust direction for the sector. Expectations are high for what they will achieve next. The conversation around them reflects the growing optimism. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

47484438,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=783458,1751670001,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/47484438.jpeg,"Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 As Analyst Calls It A ‘Powder Keg’",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-price-targets-3000/,"The Ethereum price is flashing major upside signals as on-chain and market activity align toward a potential breakout to the $3,000 level. With crypto exchange balances falling to their lowest in nine years, stablecoin rails hitting record highs, and Spot Ethereum ETF inflows spiking last month, analysts now describe ETH as a “powder keg” primed for explosive movement. Ethereum Price Eyes A $3,300 Breakout The Ethereum price action is drawing attention as it continues to trade within a well-defined consolidation range, hovering near $2,555 at the time of writing. Based on a recently released technical analysis by crypto analyst Pentoshi on X social media, ETH could be on the verge of a significant move, with $3,300 marked as the next bullish target in the near term. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts $10,000 ATH For Ethereum This Cycle, Here’s Why The crypto expert’s chart reveals that since early May 2025, Ethereum has been locked between two key levels—a support zone around $2,190 and resistance near $2,750. This range has remained intact for over eight weeks, signaling a period of accumulation and low volatility after the sharp decline experienced in the first quarter of the year. Pentoshi has pinpointed $2,100 as the key downside risk in his bullish outlook, aligning closely with the lower support zone marked on the chart. While the next bullish extension and major resistance level has been identified as $3,300, the analyst expects Ethereum to make a move toward this price level within the next three months. He suggests that the current setup offers a favorable risk-reward profile, estimating a potential upside of roughly 3.2x compared to the downside risk. Analyst Calls Ethereum A “Powder Keg” In other news, Eric Conner refers to Ethereum as a “powder keg,” highlighting a growing convergence of fundamental factors that are building up pressure and positioning the cryptocurrency for a potentially parabolic move in the market. Related Reading: The Ethereum Waiting Game: Breakout To $2,800 Or Crash To $2,000? The analyst reports that Stablecoin activity on Ethereum has reached historic highs, with the total market capitalization of on-chain dollar-denominated assets hitting $251 billion—a record that also marks 21 consecutive months of uninterrupted growth. In parallel, Ethereum Spot ETFs have brought in $1.17 billion in net inflows during June alone, marking a major shift in investors’ appetite for ETH exposure. Even more notable, the amount of Ethereum available for trading is now at its lowest level in nearly a decade, with only nine million ETH tokens on centralized crypto exchanges. This nine-year low in exchange balances signals a drying float, where any fresh demand has an outsized impact on price. Conner has stated that large-scale crypto investors are beginning to take note. He reports that wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH have accumulated more than 800,000 tokens daily during the peak week in June, marking the most aggressive absorption by whales since 2017. Currently, price action mirrors tension, and the analyst warns that if Ethereum decisively clears the $2,600 resistance level, the combination of supply scarcity, ETF-driven demand, and explosive stablecoin usage could unleash a violent and rapid breakout.

The latest example is a major partnership with Major League Rugby’s Seattle Seawolves. As of July, BlockDAG (BDAG) is now the Official Blockchain Partner of the Seawolves for the 2025 season. This marks a step toward blending Web3 tools with how fans enjoy sports. The Seattle Seawolves, founded in 2017, are two-time MLR champions and one of the league’s original teams. Known for strong play and loyal support, they stand for discipline, strength, and teamwork. These same values reflect BlockDAG’s aim to build better digital systems and strong user communities. But this deal isn’t just about branding. It shows a shift where blockchain becomes something fans can see and use. From ownership to digital access, this is a new way for fans to connect with their team. Bringing Fans Closer With Digital Access A key part of the BlockDAG-Seawolves deal is the use of blockchain tools like NFTs and fan tokens. These are not just digital items to collect. They open doors to real fan moments. Fans will be able to trade digital keepsakes, take part in team polls, and view premium content. From owning a key match moment as an NFT to joining special Q&As with players, fans now have new ways to stay connected to their team. Nicolaas van den Bergh, Chief Marketing Officer at BlockDAG, shared: “This partnership helps reshape fan experiences by building stronger ties through trust, creativity, and shared digital moments.” Stories, Content, and Inside Views The partnership also includes a co-branded content series shared on Seawolves’ official pages each month. These videos and posts will include game clips, fan input, interviews, and match polls. All of it aims to grow the team’s digital fan world and bring fans closer to the action. There will also be personal content led by players, giving fans a closer look at the behind-the-scenes life. From practice to game-day rituals, these stories are meant to create real bonds between the team and its supporters. This approach fits well with BlockDAG’s larger goals. For BlockDAG, building in Web3 is not only about tech. It’s about giving people ways to join in, be part of the story, and help shape the experience. A New Chapter in Sports and Digital Connection Shane Skinner, CEO of the Seattle Seawolves, shared his thoughts on the new partnership: “We are thrilled to partner with a leading blockchain innovator like BlockDAG to deliver immersive, digital-first experiences to our passionate fanbase.” His comment shows the deeper goal behind the partnership. The Seawolves are not using blockchain just for hype. They aim to improve how fans connect with the team and create lasting loyalty in a digital space. From BlockDAG’s side, sports offer a clear path to connect with more people. With over 200,000 BDAG holders and a crypto presale that has passed $329.5 million, the platform is growing from a focus on tech tools to building its presence in culture and trust among fans. The Seawolves collaboration is one of two major sports deals BlockDAG revealed in July. The other is with the Seattle Orcas, a cricket team in Major League Cricket. These two moves highlight a plan to reach new groups of people, from rugby followers in North America to cricket fans across the world. More Than a Deal, It’s a Direction The BlockDAG-Seawolves partnership is more than just a single news update. It shows where Web3 could go next. Sports bring people together. They carry emotion, community, and now, with help from blockchain, the chance for fans to play a more active digital role. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release coming on August 11 and BDAG coins still available at a set price of $0.0016, BlockDAG is showing signs of growing far beyond early crypto circles. It’s stepping into real-life places, from sports arenas to fan screens. For those who follow the Seawolves, this could be a fresh way to enjoy the game. For the larger crypto space, it sends a strong message: BlockDAG is not just building a network. It’s helping shape how people share, connect, and experience sports in a digital age.

Our Jito price prediction expects the JTO price to record a maximum of $8.56 in 2025. In 2030, we expect the JTO price to achieve $57.27. In December 2023, the Jito (JTO) token airdrop garnered significant attention for the Solana blockchain , which had been facing challenging times. The event also highlighted the importance of liquid staking on Solana while empowering holders to influence platform governance. Based on these developments, we’ve compiled our Jito price prediction, explored the factors behind these forecasts, and provided insights into the role and utility of the JTO token.

JTO/USDT Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and currently hovers around the 47 level, showing that bears control price momentum. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours.

The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the JITO price from an immediate surge. However, if the JITO price successfully breaks above $2.257, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $2.545. JTO/USDT Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, JITO price may drop below the immediate support line at $1.88, resulting in a correction to $1.557. Is Jito a good investment? For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network’s largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2025 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Why is the JTO down today? JTO’s price gained strong selling pressure around local highs, resulting in a strong decline. This created a push below $2. Will the JTO price recover? If buyers hold above the $2 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will JTO reach $10? JTO price might reach the $10 mark in 2025 if buying demand surges and Jito attracts altcoin investors. However, our JTO price prediction states it might reach the $10 level by 2026. Will the JTO price reach $100? Due to the effort of the Solana community, JITO Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment. Recent news/ Opinion on JTO news SOL Strategies has announced the launch of a new initiative to support critical infrastructure within the Solana ecosystem. The Canada-based public company revealed on June 26 that it has established a Strategic Ecosystem Reserve (SER), starting with a purchase of over 52,000 Jito (JTO) tokens, valued at more than $100,000. Jito price prediction July 2025 Over the last few days, JTO coin prices have aimed to surge above crucial Fib levels. If the BTC price aims for a hold above $110K this month, we might see a solid surge in the JTO price. According to technical analysis, the JTO price might record a maximum level of $2.9 and a minimum of $1.3, with an average value of $2.1 throughout July. Jito price prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high Jito Price Prediction July 2025 $1.3 $2.1 $2.9 Jito price prediction 2025 According to JTO tokenomics, additional Jito tokens will be released at the start of 2025 and will continue throughout the year. This increase is likely to exert downward pressure on the value of Jito crypto. However, 2025 is also expected to showcase the significant impact of the Bitcoin Halving, which could propel crypto markets and tokens to new all-time highs, potentially boosting the Jito token price. A comprehensive technical analysis of past pricing trends suggests that in 2025, Jito is anticipated to have a minimum price of $1.1. Its maximum price could reach $8.56, with an expected average trading value of $7.34.

Unlike many meme coins that rely purely on hype, it’s positioning itself a bit differently—mixing familiar meme energy with a pointed political angle and a zero-tax setup. That’s helped it catch the eye of investors who care about more than just quick flips. It brings together aspects of Dogecoin and SHIBA INU, but with a clearer ideological stance, which broadens its appeal. From casual meme fans to people who appreciate decentralized projects like Ethereum and Cardano, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing a diverse crowd. At this stage, its long-term path looks likely to depend on whether it can keep that community engaged as the market continues to shift. Community Still the Driving Force for MAGACOIN FINANCE Amid all these big institutional moves and network upgrades, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to stand out for a simpler reason: steady community momentum. Conversations on social media platforms and crypto forums have kept picking up, largely thanks to its decentralized governance model and unmistakable political branding. While it gets compared to the early days of Dogecoin and SHIBA INU, MAGACOIN FINANCE sets itself apart by putting ideology and a community-led structure at its core. As the broader altcoin world adjusts to new regulations and tech developments, this authentic, bottom-up energy could be its biggest strength. Solana’s First Staking ETF Could Open New Doors Over in the broader altcoin market, Solana is about to mark a milestone. On July 2, the REX-Osprey SOL+Staking ETF is set to launch, making it the first U.S.-listed ETF that combines direct Solana exposure with on-chain staking rewards. That means traditional investors can now access staking income alongside typical price movements, which could be a pretty compelling option. Analysts generally view this as a step forward that may encourage more institutional players to become involved with altcoins. Some projections for SEC approval of a straightforward spot Solana ETF by 2025 are now as high as 95%. This could also set the stage for similar products tied to networks like XRP and Litecoin. Still, not everyone’s jumping in headfirst. There are concerns about Solana’s ongoing unlock schedules and lighter network usage at present, which may keep larger investors on the sidelines in the near term. Polygon (MATIC) Navigates an Important—and Tricky—Upgrade Polygon is also going through a big moment with its upgrade to Polygon 2.0, which means moving from the old MATIC token over to the new POL asset. It’s a complex process, highlighted by Binance having to temporarily pause MATIC deposits and withdrawals on July 1. For now, MATIC is running into some resistance on the charts. Looking ahead, most forecasts for 2025 suggest a moderate upside, generally clustering around $0.27 to $0.29, while more optimistic views point closer to $0.47. However, much of that hinges on how smoothly this transition unfolds and whether Polygon can continue to expand its reach across DeFi, NFTs, and scaling solutions. The Takeaway: MAGACOIN FINANCE Stays the Course as Altcoins Shift As Solana rolls out its first staking ETF and Polygon pushes through a critical upgrade—plus MATIC testing resistance—the altcoin market is evolving. Through all of this, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out its own lane by blending meme appeal with political messaging and a community-first approach. It’ll be worth watching how this mix plays out as the next chapter for decentralized, culturally driven crypto projects unfolds.

This surge sets the stage for other digital currencies to shine. Discover the top three altcoins poised for significant growth, ready to ride the wave of Bitcoin's impressive rally. Find out which coins are primed to take off next. SUI Price Recap: Past Weakness Followed by Recent Rally SUI experienced a 9.55% decline over the past month and a steep 44.39% drop over the last six months. A recent surge saw a 12.94% gain in the past week, indicating a brief recovery amid ongoing uncertainty. The price performance shows marked volatility, reflecting shifting market sentiment and periods of bearish pressure following significant downturns. The current trading range is between $2.19 and $3.48, with immediate resistance at $4.19 and support found at $1.59. Technical indicators present a mixed picture; momentum is modest, and the RSI hovers around 50, suggesting balance after the recent bounce, while other measures indicate lingering weakness. Bulls have gained recently, but the trend remains unclear. Traders might consider waiting near support levels for opportunities to buy, while sellers could target resistance levels. Cosmos (ATOM) Price Trends and Key Trading Levels Cosmos experienced a 7.5% drop over the past month and a steep decline of nearly 44% over the last six months. Price action over the past week showed a modest gain of about 4.8%, highlighting a coin that has struggled to maintain upward momentum. Overall, the trend points to ongoing weakness, with historical price behavior indicating a longer-term bearish sentiment. Despite the brief recovery, challenges remain in reversing the downturn, leaving investors cautious about future movement. The current trading band for Cosmos rests between $3.56 and $4.63. Immediate support is positioned at $3.03, with resistance at $5.16. The relative strength index around 48.51 reflects a balance between buying and selling pressures, though negative readings from momentum measures suggest bears remain dominant. The recent uptick hasn't significantly shifted the trend, prompting traders to watch for a potential bounce near support or a breakout at resistance as market conditions evolve. Ethena (ENA) Price Snapshot: Past Performance and Current Levels Over the past month, ETHENA experienced a notable drop of 22.18% from its price levels, while a one-week uptick of 5.04% offered a brief glimpse of recovery. Over the last six months, the coin suffered a steep decline of 78.64%. Price movements ranged between $0.2011 and $0.3549, marking clear volatility. Data shows that ETHENA’s performance has been considerably downbeat, emphasizing the impact of bearish market influences and investor caution. Currently, the coin trades within a range that sets a strong support at $0.13 and offers a nearest resistance of $0.44, with a second resistance level at $0.59. Trading decisions depend on whether bulls can push the price above these resistance areas or if bears will keep the coin anchored near its low points. The momentum indicator sits very low at -0.0049, suggesting bears dominate given the falling moving average. Traders might consider short-term buying opportunities near the support level or betting on a break above the $0.44 resistance. Conclusion As Bitcoin crosses the $110k mark, attention now shifts to other promising coins. SUI , known for its strong community and unique features, is expected to gain traction. ATOM shows potential due to its interoperability between different blockchains. ENA , with its innovative technology, could also see significant growth. These altcoins are positioned to perform well in the coming days. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently announced that the company submitted its application to the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), signaling Ripple’s intention to operate under both federal and state oversight. Already holding a BitLicense from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), Ripple’s potential federal charter would place it under more comprehensive regulatory supervision. According to Garlinghouse, the goal is to enhance public and institutional trust. Direct Access to the Federal Reserve In addition to its OCC application, Ripple is also pursuing a master account with the Federal Reserve through its subsidiary , Standard Custody. If approved, this account would allow Ripple to hold reserves for RLUSD directly with the central bank. Such access could provide Ripple with a substantial advantage, offering enhanced transparency and security for stablecoin holders. True to our long-standing compliance roots, @Ripple is applying for a national bank charter from the OCC. If approved, we would have both state (via NYDFS) and federal oversight, a new (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market. Earlier in the week via… https://t.co/IdiR7x3eWZ — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) July 2, 2025 This level of direct integration with the Federal Reserve would set RLUSD apart from most stablecoins on the market, aligning it more closely with financial institutions that prioritize regulatory clarity and central bank engagement. Implications for XRP and RLUSD Ripple’s regulatory push has sparked discussion within the crypto community, especially regarding its potential impact on the utility and value of XRP. A prominent analyst, known as “XRP Investing,” suggested that with federal approval and Fed access, Ripple could be seen as operating on par with traditional banking giants like JPMorgan. He argued that RLUSD would become significantly more credible under this framework, and XRP could be increasingly adopted for international settlements. This sentiment reflects broader expectations that institutional players are more likely to engage with digital assets that operate under strict compliance regimes and central bank connectivity. Assessing XRP’s Price Potential To estimate XRP’s possible future valuation under various scenarios, ChatGPT was asked to model several assumptions. One approach evaluates XRP’s role in facilitating global payments. If Ripple captures 10% of SWIFT’s estimated $150 trillion annual volume, and XRP is used with a turnover rate of 25, the total required liquidity would be around $600 billion. With approximately 55 billion XRP tokens in circulation, this results in a baseline valuation near $10.91 per coin, assuming purely utility-based demand. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another perspective considers XRP’s use in supporting RLUSD’s transaction volume. If RLUSD grows to match USDC’s $32 billion market cap and XRP bridges half of its $100 billion in yearly transfers with a turnover rate of 20, $5 billion in XRP liquidity would be needed. Given full regulatory oversight from both the OCC and NYDFS, plus direct Fed access, a strong trust premium could apply, projecting XRP’s price to approximately $13.65. Ripple’s ambitions also extend into facilitating the transfer of tokenized real-world assets, such as bonds and real estate. With the tokenization market expected to reach over $16 trillion by 2030, Ripple capturing even a small share could require XRP to support large transaction volumes. If 3% of that market is routed through Ripple and XRP manages a quarter of that on-chain, the liquidity need could hit $120 billion. Accounting for speculative and institutional demand, this model suggests a potential price of about $21.80 per token. A final valuation scenario relies on projected transaction activity. If XRP processes $30 billion in daily settlement volume once adopted by banks, and the market applies a Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio typical of high-utility blockchains (25–30), the total implied market cap could approach $900 billion. Divided by the current supply, XRP’s estimated value would fall around $16.36. While all projections remain speculative, they demonstrate the possible valuation range for XRP if Ripple achieves full regulatory integration and expands its role in institutional finance. Approval of a national bank charter, combined with access to a Federal Reserve master account, would not only enhance RLUSD’s stability but also position XRP as a credible bridge asset in global financial systems.

33767162,[object Object],1751671855,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,90-Day Drop In Bitcoin Open Interest Signals Bullish DCA Opportunities – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/90-day-drop-in-bitcoin-open-interest-signals-bullish-dca-opportunities-details/,"Bitcoin is facing renewed volatility as it struggles to break above the $112,000 all-time high. After weeks of consolidation near record levels, market participants are watching closely for a decisive move that could signal the next major trend. Bullish momentum remains intact, but hesitation at key resistance keeps both sides on edge. Macroeconomic conditions are adding fuel to the speculation. The US Congress recently passed President Donald Trump’s long-awaited legislative bill—dubbed the “big, beautiful” bill—just ahead of the self-imposed July 4 deadline. In parallel, the latest job market data beat expectations, signaling a stronger-than-expected economy and boosting risk appetite across global markets. In the derivatives space, CryptoQuant data shows that the 90-day change in open interest (OI) has turned negative—a historically significant signal. When this metric dips below zero, it often indicates capitulation among traders and forced liquidations, which tend to cool off leverage and reset the market for healthier price action. As Bitcoin navigates this volatile mix of technical resistance and shifting macro tailwinds, the coming days could be decisive in determining whether a breakout above $112K is imminent or if another correction lies ahead. Traders remain alert as the stakes continue to rise. Bitcoin Inches Closer To Breakout As Bulls Tighten Grip Bitcoin bulls remain firmly in control, but a decisive breakout into price discovery is still needed to confirm the next leg of the rally. After climbing 47% since its April lows, Bitcoin now trades less than 2% below its $112,000 all-time high. The market is heating up, driven by waning macroeconomic uncertainty, strong equities performance, and growing investor optimism. However, with resistance so close, the next few days will be pivotal. A firm push above the all-time high could unlock a powerful expansion phase, while failure to break through may lead to a corrective retrace. Analysts are closely watching both technical and on-chain data to gauge the next move. Top analyst Darkfost shared key insights into derivatives activity, highlighting the importance of tracking the 90-day change in open interest (OI). This metric gives a snapshot of how leveraged the market is. When the 90d OI percentage flips negative, it typically signals mass liquidations or capitulation among overexposed traders, resulting in a sharp drop in open interest. According to Darkfost, these deleveraging events—especially during bull markets—have consistently created attractive opportunities to build long positions or dollar-cost average (DCA) in the spot market. They reduce risk by flushing out weak hands and clearing excessive leverage. With current data showing a recent dip in OI followed by stabilization, many traders view this as a potential reset ahead of a breakout. As Bitcoin consolidates near historic highs, the stage is set. Either bulls push beyond resistance and into uncharted territory, or bears gain temporary control. For now, momentum favors the upside—but confirmation remains key. BTC Price Action Remains Range-Bound Below ATH Bitcoin continues to trade below the key resistance at $109,300, as seen on the 4-hour chart. After failing to establish a clear breakout above this level, the price has retreated slightly to around $109,010 at the time of writing. The zone between $108K and $109.3K has become a critical area of consolidation, with both bulls and bears fighting for short-term control. The 50, 100, and 200-period moving averages are all trending upward and converging near the $106K–$106.5K region, providing strong dynamic support. Price remains above these moving averages, suggesting a bullish structure remains intact despite the recent stalling. Volume has decreased during the recent leg up, hinting at potential exhaustion, but not necessarily a reversal. A retest of the $109.3K resistance or a breakdown toward the $106K–$105K support zone could occur before any decisive move. The lower support at $103,600 continues to serve as a key level that, if broken, could signal a deeper retrace. For now, Bitcoin is in a tight consolidation range, and traders are waiting for a breakout above $109.3K or a breakdown below $106K to determine the next trend direction. Until then, volatility and uncertainty are likely to persist.

Yet this massive pool of paper gains cuts both ways, signaling both strong bullish sentiment and a latent risk of sudden sell pressure. Bitcoin’s rally above $107,000 raised unrealized profits to around $1.2 trillion. Source: Glassnode Investors are HODLing on to their Bitcoins Despite the theoretical windfall, BTC investors have demonstrated notable restraint. Data shows that realized profits are declining, long-term holder supply has reached new highs, and selling pressure from short-term holders has eased. This mix of massive unrealized gains and cautious behavior is representative of the market’s current dynamics. Bitcoin recently saw a sell-off to about $99,000 prompted by geopolitical tension between Israel and Iran. Yet, prices rebounded to $107,000 after a cease-fire, with support emerging near the $98,300 cost basis of short-term holders—a level that analysts say consolidates the bullish narrative. Off-chain capital inflows from institutional sources, such as U.S. spot BTC ETFs , averaging $298 million per week, also bolster demand even as existing investors hold steady. The combination of patient holders and fresh institutional liquidity paints a picture of a deepening, mature market. However, the situation is precarious. While holding remains dominant, a shift in sentiment could unleash significant selling pressure. Analysts warn that current price levels are “insufficient to trigger significant profit-taking,” and note that the market may need to move higher (or lower) to unlock additional supply. History says pressure to sell is due Historical precedent amplifies the concern of wholesale profit-taking. CryptoQuant’s network unrealized profit/loss (NUPL) indicator has previously flashed sell signals when unrealized profits spiked, often ahead of market pullbacks. Similarly, previous reports note that long-term holders historically start spending and increasing sell-side pressure when their average unrealized gains reach around 350%, which reportedly happens near the $100,000 price zone. This suggests that rising prices could shift sentiment even among staunch holders, creating a feedback loop of profit-taking and price corrections. Despite these risks, the institutional cohort continues to strengthen Bitcoin’s market foundation. The Gemini‑Glassnode Q2 report shows over 30% of circulating BTC now resides in centralized entities, including ETFs, exchanges, custodians, and sovereign treasuries. Moreover, off-chain venues now account for over 75% of trading volume , signaling that price discovery is migrating toward regulated, institutional platforms. That’s a structural evolution that, while supporting liquidity, could also mean more organized and potentially sudden sell pressure from big stakeholders. Analysts continue to monitor the market Several analysts note that a meaningful price move, either surpassing the $110,000–$112,000 resistance or slipping below the recent $98,000–$99,000 support band, may be required to dislodge the market’s current equilibrium. As the market stands, Bitcoin’s $1.2 trillion in unrealized gains signals both its maturity and vulnerability. The enormous paper profits reflect investor confidence and institutional backing. At the same time, it signals a latent pool of potential selling fuel, one that could ignite if sentiment cracks or technical levels fail. For now, HODLing remains the dominant behavior, institutional inflows power momentum, and averages of realized profit and liveliness continue to decline.

47487435,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=402923,1751672746,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/47487435.jpeg,Chainlink’s Consolidation Echoes Bitcoin’s 2023 As Retail Apathy Meets Whale Hunger,https://cryptopotato.com/chainlinks-consolidation-echoes-bitcoins-2023-as-retail-apathy-meets-whale-hunger/,"Chainlink (LINK) remains locked in a $12-$15 price stalemate, owing to the continued whale accumulation amid retail disengagement. On-chain data shows sustained negative exchange netflows of around 100,000 LINK per week, which indicates that whale entities are absorbing sell pressure without significant price disruption. LINK Faces Critical Test CryptoQuant stated that this trend contrasts with occasional retail-driven spikes, such as March 2025’s 5 million LINK deposit surge. Retail activity has stayed flat, as evidenced by the daily active addresses hovering between 28,000 and 32,000, while transaction counts remain stagnant at around 9,000 per day. Despite increased oracle utility, retail failed to capitalize on a minor activity bump seen in late 2024. Whale urgency is evident as exchange withdrawals peaked at 3,000 transactions per day in Q4 2024 and remain elevated, thereby steadily draining exchange reserves, which have fallen approximately 40% year-to-date. Neutral leverage metrics are preventing volatility and have allowed systematic accumulation without triggering a breakout above $15. A resolution to this deadlock will require a spike in retail participation to ignite momentum or a slowdown in whale withdrawals to weaken accumulation. Until a catalyst emerges, LINK’s structure matches Bitcoin’s 2023 consolidation phase before its surge in 2024. While this accumulation standoff continues on-chain, Chainlink has been expanding its broader ecosystem through partnerships. Collaborations With Mastercard and Visa Last month, the decentralized oracle network partnered with Mastercard to allow 3 billion cardholders to purchase crypto directly on-chain using fiat payments. The collaboration utilizes interoperability infrastructure and Mastercard’s global network to remove barriers to crypto access. Partners like Zerohash, Shift4, Swapper Finance, and XSwap support liquidity, compliance, and fiat-to-crypto conversion, bridging traditional payments with decentralized finance environments. Chainlink also completed a pilot under the HKMA’s e-HKD+ initiative with Visa, wherein the duo tested cross-border investment transactions using CBDCs and stablecoins. In the trial, ANZ’s AUD-backed stablecoin A$DC was converted into e-HKD and used to invest in a tokenized money market fund.

LINK is stuck at a technical fork, with on-chain signals showing a cautious tone among whales. BONK, however, is picking up steam with a surge in trading volume and buyer activity. But BlockDAG (BDAG) ? It’s taking a bold route, slashing its presale entry price to just $0.0016, even as its batch 29 price hits $0.0276. This firm stance, tied to its upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11, is shaking up how crypto holders think about entry points. BlockDAG Freezes Presale at $0.0016 Ahead of GLOBAL LAUNCH Release BlockDAG has made a bold and strategic move by locking its presale price at $0.0016 ahead of its highly anticipated GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. This rare decision aims to shield retail participants from last-minute price jumps, giving them the same access as early buyers had. Despite the batch 29 price currently sitting at $0.0276, this limited-time pricing dramatically lowers the entry point and sets up buyers for stronger returns. With over 23.6 billion coins sold and $329.5 million already raised, BlockDAG’s presale is quickly becoming one of 2025’s headline crypto stories. The 2,660% ROI since batch 1 is already impressive, and the fixed $0.0016 price only boosts the potential upside. It’s no surprise that those tracking the best crypto for the 2025 bull run are zeroing in on BlockDAG, not just for its numbers, but for its calculated, user-focused approach. Rather than chasing volatile price swings, BlockDAG is dialing in stability. Freezing the price helps eliminate last-minute FOMO anxiety, giving new buyers a clear and confident way in. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release countdown now underway, BlockDAG isn’t just another presale; it’s shaping up as a well-timed opportunity for those planning ahead. BONK Price Update: Momentum Builds as Traders Target Resistance BONK is heating up. Trading volume jumped 98.33% to $160.5 million, and the buy-sell delta hit +127 billion tokens, hinting at strong accumulation. After bouncing off $0.000013, BONK touched $0.00001480 before settling near $0.00001446, showing that bulls are holding their ground. Open interest is also on the rise, up 6.68%, which adds weight to the idea that traders expect another leg up. Still, $0.000015 looms as a tough resistance. If BONK clears it, a stronger rally could follow. If not, a pullback to test lower supports may be next. Indicators show a slightly overbought setup, so short-term dips wouldn’t surprise anyone. But the volume and open interest growth point to growing confidence. That’s why BONK remains on watch as a high-energy play in this current price cycle. LINK Price Forecast at a Crossroads as Bulls and Bears Pause Right now, the LINK price forecast is in limbo. Whale wallets are quiet, token movement off exchanges is slowing, and that’s a red flag for bullish momentum. LINK is holding above a short-term support zone, but the energy isn’t there to push decisively in either direction. All eyes are on the $13.5 to $13.9 range. A breakout or breakdown here could set the tone for the next move. The RSI sits in neutral territory, signaling indecision among traders. Until accumulation picks up again or a clearer trend forms, LINK’s next move is still uncertain. Whether it rallies or retreats will likely come down to how buyers respond in the next few sessions. BDAG Stands Out With Stable Entry & Long-Term Focus With BONK testing resistance and LINK caught in wait-and-see mode, BlockDAG is playing a different game. By freezing its presale at $0.0016, it strips out guesswork and gives buyers a firm entry, something rare this close to launch. Instead of reacting to market noise, BlockDAG is creating its own momentum. The GLOBAL LAUNCH release is dropping on August 11, and holders are noticing. For those tired of chasing spikes and looking for clarity, BlockDAG may just be the best crypto for the 2025 bull run , offering both structure and upside without the chaos.

47488531,https://timestabloid.com/?p=73426,1751673647,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s Projected XRP Price if It Matches Tether (USDT) Peak Volume,https://timestabloid.com/heres-projected-xrp-price-if-it-matches-tether-usdt-peak-volume/,"The potential valuation of XRP continues to spark debate across the cryptocurrency space. Despite experiencing significant price swings and a decline from its all-time high of $3.84 in 2018, many investors and analysts still believe XRP remains undervalued, particularly in light of its intended use as a bridge currency for cross-border payments. While some observers remain skeptical about its long-term prospects, others maintain that XRP could see considerable growth if it begins to facilitate large-scale financial activity, particularly within institutional frameworks. One way to assess this possibility is by using a valuation model based on real-world utility rather than speculation. Measuring XRP’s Value Through Utility A widely referenced methodology for valuing digital assets comes from a research model developed by Robert Mitchnick and Susan Athey. Unlike approaches driven by market sentiment, this model estimates fair value based on a token’s role in actual economic activity. It evaluates the relationship between transaction volume, token supply, and how frequently each token is used. Using a publicly available calculator built on this framework, we assessed XRP’s value under a hypothetical but relevant scenario: what if XRP handled the same level of daily transaction volume as Tether (USDT) did at its highest point this year? The Benchmark: USDT’s Peak Volume Tether (USDT), the most actively traded stablecoin, recorded its peak daily volume on February 3, 2025, reaching $292 billion. This volume is driven by its widespread use across crypto exchanges and trading platforms as a base pair against top assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. By contrast, XRP’s highest daily transaction volume in recent years was $51.7 billion, which it achieved in December 2023. The comparison sets a high benchmark, but it provides a meaningful reference point for exploring XRP’s potential growth under optimal adoption conditions. Parameters Used in the Valuation To simulate XRP handling a $292 billion daily volume, several parameters were applied. First, we assumed that the average holding time for each XRP token is 10 days, reflecting active use in institutional settlements. We also estimated the value of XRP held as a store of value at $180 billion. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Next, the projection was made over three years, allowing sufficient time for growth in adoption, regulatory clarity, and Ripple’s ongoing efforts to expand utility. To factor in supply changes, we projected a circulating supply of 66.2 billion tokens by that time, accounting for the gradual release of XRP from escrow, approximately 200 million per month. Lastly, to bring the projected price back to present-day terms, a 2% annual discount rate was applied, representing a modest expected rate of return over the next three years. Projected Price Outcome With all these parameters in place, the model generated a present-value estimate of $44.13 per XRP. This would represent a substantial increase from its current market value of approximately $2.28 , a potential gain of nearly 1,836%. It’s worth noting that this outcome aligns with past forecasts from analysts like Mickle and EGRAG Crypto , both of whom have separately projected a $44 price point under favorable market conditions. However, this analysis does not serve as a price prediction. Instead, it illustrates what XRP could be worth if it supports transaction volumes comparable to leading stablecoins like USDT, assuming the appropriate infrastructure and institutional participation are in place.

You’ll hear claims that XRP is already reshaping global finance and leaving old systems in the dust. According to influencer Coach JV, Ripple is building a whole new rails for money. He says XRP isn’t here to compete with banks. It’s here to replace them. Related Reading: Ethereum Network Awakens—Massive On-Chain Moves Signal What’s Coming He points out that transactions on the XRP Ledger settle in 3–5 seconds and cost fractions of a penny. That beats SWIFT transfers, which can take days and cost up to $50 per payment. XRP still trades around $2,25 but that figure, he argues, won’t stay low for long if the token keeps winning regulatory approvals and new partners. XRP is the most disruptive financial technology of our lifetime. Ripple isn’t just competing with the banking system, it’s replacing it. The old system is dead. The new financial rails are being laid right before your eyes. Stay asleep and you’ll miss the greatest wealth transfer… — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) July 2, 2025 Ripple’s Technology Versus Legacy Rails Based on reports, RippleNet now counts more than 300 financial institutions in its network. Yet daily on‑chain volumes for XRP hover around $1 billion—small next to global cross‑border flows of roughly $150 billion per day. Banks are testing the tech, but most haven’t shifted large sums yet. That gap between tests and real‑world use is one reason XRP’s price has stayed below its all‑time high for seven years. Push For Regulatory Clarity XRP backers are watching the US carefully. They see growing buzz around spot XRP ETFs. Analysts like Eric Balchunas have given those filings up to 95% odds of approval by year‑end. If an ETF hits a US exchange, they say, more money will pour in. Ripple has also been chasing money‑transmitter licenses in Europe and Asia. Every new license, they believe, brings Ripple a step closer to mainstream use. Community Calls For Patience Coach JV keeps telling followers not to panic over a stagnant price. He uses phrases like “greatest wealth transfer in history” to drive home his point. In an earlier tweet, he promised “unimaginable wealth” for anyone who holds on. Other voices, such as commentator Edoardo Farina, point out that only about 1 to 2 million people hold XRP today. That number, they say, leaves room for 100 million or more newcomers—and more buyers often means higher prices. Related Reading: The Silent Bitcoin Accumulation: Public Companies’ Surprising H1 2025 Lead Analysts Caution Over Hype Even so, some experts urge caution. They note that bold forecasts don’t guarantee buy‑in from big banks or regulators. An ETF approval won’t force funds to rush in overnight. And test programs don’t always turn into full rollouts. For now, XRP remains a high‑risk play. Investors should track on‑chain metrics and regulatory milestones before getting swept up in the hype.

While MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to hold the attention of early-stage meme-powered altcoin fans, Chainlink’s sentiment appears to be softening as technical signals point to a period of cautious consolidation. MAGACOIN FINANCE Stays Early-Stage, Community-Driven MAGACOIN FINANCE is a meme-driven altcoin and is also a decentralised political memecoin. It is gaining steady traction, while Bitcoin remains the anchor of the crypto market. It is currently trading at the minimum, and the strength of the project refers to how well it is developed and its community. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a unique, zero-tax, community-governed meme altcoin with political and cultural implications. Hashex has duly audited the coin’s token, and the project does not have VC control, unlike most other speculative meme coins, which lack absolute transparency. People who supported the coin in its earlier days do so because of its ideology, thousands of active holders, an ever-increasing Telegram presence, and decentralisation. Traders have kept MAGACOIN FINANCE on their watchlists due to rumours about upcoming exchange listings. At the same time, the narrative of early-stage momentum helps traders find culturally relevant tokens that transcend hype-driven pumps. Its hybrid identity, which combines the viral meme-coin energy with governance focus more commonly associated with larger altcoins, enables it to carve a distinct niche for itself. Bitcoin’s Bullish Momentum Gathers Pace Bitcoin’s market action this month has reinforced its reputation as the bellwether asset in the crypto market. Trading activity has surged to new yearly highs, with large derivatives traders and prediction markets reflecting growing confidence that BTC could push toward a fresh all-time high in the coming months. Current estimates place an 85% chance of Bitcoin hitting new record levels before October 2025, driven by improving liquidity, risk-on investor sentiment, and easing geopolitical tensions. Despite the optimism, short-term traders have recently locked in profits, with some data indicating that short-term holders have sold significant portions of their BTC holdings since May. This has resulted in a notable imbalance in the derivatives market, where bearish perpetual futures positions outnumber bullish longs by approximately two to one. Even so, the underlying trend remains upward as strong buy-side support keeps BTC trading well above $108,000, with analysts eyeing key resistance at $110,000 to $112,000. A breakout above these levels could open the door to further gains into the $125,000–$140,000 range. Chainlink Sees Cautious Sentiment By comparison, Chainlink (LINK) has shown signs of short-term weakness in recent sessions. As of July 2025, LINK is holding near the $13.30–$13.40 range, maintaining key support levels around $13.00. However, recent declines and an inability to reclaim the resistance levels around $13.86 to $14.36 have made some traders more cautious. On the fundamentals side, Chainlink remains a cornerstone of the blockchain data ecosystem. Its decentralised oracle services and the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) continue to attract real-world enterprise pilots and tokenisation partnerships. Yet, near-term momentum appears muted as broader market sentiment recalibrates. Analysts see potential for a bounce back into the $14.50–$15.00 range if sentiment improves. Still, any further weakness could push LINK into a deeper consolidation phase, with downside targets around $12.80 or lower. A Market Balancing Accumulation and Early-Stage Opportunity In a market where cultural tokens, foundational blockchains, and data providers all coexist, investors are watching for assets that offer a clear edge, whether that’s Bitcoin’s liquidity leadership, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s decentralised political narrative, or Chainlink’s oracle dominance. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a unique opportunity for investors to get in early on an ecosystem with massive upsides.

Jupiter (JUP) Price Insights: Past Declines and Key Support Zones JUP behavior shows a one-month drop of 18.01% and a six-month decline of 53.73%. A one-week gain of 12.07% hints at short-term movement amid longer-term pressure. Price action over the recent month was marked by a steady descent, with the half-year view underlining a significant weakening in value. The past figures indicate that the coin experienced a brief rally before facing sustained losses, highlighting a period of volatility and bearish influence. Current price stands between $0.34 and $0.57, with the first resistance at $0.69 and a higher barrier at $0.92. Support emerges at $0.21, with a secondary level at $0.00. Technical readings, including an RSI near 50, reveal a market lacking a clear trend. Bears hold sway for now, as reflected in the negative summary and moving average recommendations. Traders might target support at $0.21 for a bounce before considering a push higher, while breaks above $0.69 could trigger bullish activity. A cautious approach is advised, monitoring these key levels for decisive movements. Chainlink Price Shifts: Recent Rally Amid Long-Term Bearish Trends Chainlink experienced a modest rebound last week with a 3.75% increase. However, the asset declined about 5% over the month and saw a significant drop of over 43% in the past six months. This recent activity points to short-term gains, contrasting sharply with long-term bearish trends as selling pressure has dominated for several months. Price movements remain volatile, with brief moments of buyer activity, yet the overall trend suggests a lack of sustained upward momentum. Chainlink is currently trading within a range of approximately $11 to $15.70. Key resistance is noted around $18.03, with initial support at $8.63. Additional resistance appears near $22.73, and a secondary support level is at $3.94. Technical indicators provide a mixed picture, indicating balance between buyers and sellers, with the Relative Strength Index near 50. Recent trading reflects a minor weekly gain, but ongoing monthly and six-month declines show persistent selling pressure. Bulls need to overcome the $18.03 barrier, while bears may push prices toward support. Traders should watch for movements around $8.63 or potential pullbacks. Caution is necessary due to the mixed market signals. Aave: Price Fluctuations Signal Cautious Optimism for Recovery Over the last month, Aave witnessed modest gains as its price increased by 1.68%, following a strong one-week surge of 8.27%. The coin experienced mixed performance with a striking six-month decline of 22.90%, reflecting investor hesitance after prior volatility. Price actions during this period showcased erratic behavior, with brief bullish bursts amid broader downward trends, highlighting the challenges of market recovery. Investors exhibited cautious optimism, balancing short-term rallies with long-term decline, resulting in market sentiment oscillating between hope and uncertainty. Current prices trade between $216 and $328.64, with bulls eyeing a primary resistance level at $382.89 and a secondary target at $494.61, while bears support a near-term floor of $159.44 and a deeper level at $47.72. Indicators including an Awesome Oscillator reading of 8.83 and a Momentum Indicator of 7.18 point to moderate upward pressure, with an RSI at 53.32 suggesting near-neutral conditions. The market lacks a definitive trend, requiring careful positioning within these key levels. Traders may consider short-term entries to profit from rebounds toward resistance while using stop-loss orders beneath support levels to limit risk. Uniswap Price Rebound: Short-Term Gains Amid Long-Term Struggles Recent UNI price action shows a gain of nearly 11% over the past month following a marked recovery. Over the past six months, the coin fell by about 52%, indicating a significant long-term decline. The data outlines a striking short-term rebound contrasting with an extended downtrend, highlighting market hesitancy. The noticeable monthly improvement suggests renewed investor interest despite ongoing challenges. The contrasting figures indicate a volatile market where short-term gains exist alongside broader weakness in the coin's performance. Current activity places Uniswap between a support at $4.33 and a resistance level at $10.08, with the trading range being $5.73 to $8.61. The coin is testing these key levels as traders seek opportunities for breakouts or reversals. Indicators, such as a mildly bullish RSI at 54.19, hint at buying pressure, yet the overall trend remains unclear. There is potential for trades; bullish participants may push toward $10.08, while bearish traders could aim for a dip to support. Monitoring price reactions near these levels, along with volume, is essential for position management. Conclusion As capital shifts from Bitcoin to altcoins, key projects to monitor include JUP , LINK , AAVE , and UNI . Each of these offers unique features and potential growth. JUP focuses on creating a secure ecosystem. LINK enhances interoperability between smart contracts. AAVE allows users to lend and borrow assets. UNI is the governance token for a leading decentralized exchange. Observing these projects could provide insights into emerging trends and opportunities within the market.

MAGACOIN FINANCE Gets Early Traction at $0.00010425 While Ethereum’s developer community gears up for the next phase, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing how the meme-powered altcoin niche is evolving. Trading near $0.00010425, the decentralised political memecoin has been quietly building momentum, thanks to its clear anti-centralisation message and community-first model. Unlike typical meme tokens that rely on a few viral tweets to pump prices, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out a more structured identity. It’s both a meme-powered altcoin and a decentralised political memecoin, tapping into an ideological base that wants more than fleeting hype. Its zero-tax design, a fully audited smart contract, and a no-VC-control approach have resonated with early backers who value transparency. Telegram and X (Twitter) channels are filled with word-of-mouth updates about possible listings, and community-driven marketing. For meme traders watching Dogecoin’s recent volume dip, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s consistent engagement and ideological branding are a refreshing change of pace. Ethereum’s 2025 Upgrades: A Smart Contract Game-Changer Ethereum has long held its crown as the go-to platform for smart contracts, but network congestion and high fees have tested even its most loyal users. This year, the world’s largest smart contract blockchain is advancing with back-to-back upgrades aimed at addressing these pain points. The Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, 2025, combines the Prague execution layer fork and the Electra consensus layer upgrade, marking a major milestone since the Merge in 2022. With 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) rolled into one, Pectra introduces smart accounts, also known as “account abstraction,” making wallets significantly more flexible and secure. Now, users can even pay gas fees with tokens other than ETH, a minor detail that could have a significant impact on how dApps are used daily. Put simply, Ethereum’s 2025 roadmap appears to be a solid step forward, combining usability, scalability, and increased network participation. NEAR Protocol Slides but Holds Long-Term Promise Meanwhile, NEAR Protocol is navigating a patch of turbulence. The scalable Layer-1 blockchain is currently trading between $2.14 and $2.21, down slightly over the past few weeks. Technically, NEAR is hovering below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, often a sign that buyers are hesitant to jump in until stronger support appears. Still, NEAR’s fundamentals remain intact. The protocol continues to grow its ecosystem and developer base, and forecasts for 2025 remain moderately optimistic, with projections pointing to a potential range of $2.50 to $2.70 by year’s end if market sentiment stabilises. For now, though, NEAR is caught between broader market caution and its technical headwinds. Traders watching for value opportunities may see this consolidation phase as an entry point. Still, it’s clear that, compared to Ethereum’s upgrade buzz and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s meme-layer narrative, NEAR has work to do to regain momentum. The Takeaway: Three Projects, One Market Narrative Ethereum’s smart contract push underscores its commitment to being the backbone for DeFi, NFTs, and real-world tokenisation. MAGACOIN FINANCE shows that the meme-powered altcoin space can evolve with structure, governance, and cultural relevance.

The action is part of President Lee Jae Myung’s scramble to breathe life into a slowing economy and shield vital industries as trade tensions with the United States threaten to upend commercial ties. The supplementary budget , which was passed after bitter debates and a boycott by the opposition, is greater than the government’s proposal of 30.5 trillion won. Legislators tacked additional funding for direct cash handouts and emergency aid to distressed industries. The Finance Ministry said the new number shows the importance of falling back on more efficient support measures in light of the double risk of a slowdown in the country and international shocks. The new relief bill is arriving at a critical time. Seoul and Washington have a deadline of July 9 to resolve closing differences on the revised US-Korea Free Trade Agreement . US President Donald Trump has warned he may impose duties on imports from major trading partners, including South Korea, should the talks fail to bear fruit. Any move toward a reciprocal tariff increase from 10% to 25% would also seriously blow up Korean exports, such as automobiles, batteries, and semiconductors, propelling the economy. President Lee moves to close revenue gap with stimulus budget That bill contains a 10.3 trillion won fund to compensate for shortfalls in tax revenue. The government has been hit with lackluster corporate tax collections amid poor earnings in key sectors such as manufacturing and retail. Consumer demand is also down, putting yet more pressure on public finances. The government will fund that mostly through borrowing. The figure will mostly be for new sovereign bond issuance, spending cuts, and reallocating existing budget lines. Low-income families and struggling businesses will receive cash coupons and targeted relief. Additional money has also been allocated for industrial innovation, export assistance, and the creation of jobs. Despite a boycott of the legislation by opposition lawmakers who said the package lacked long-term vision and was not transparent, the ruling party forced the bill to pass parliament. However, the passage was a major early victory for President Lee, who was sworn in only last month after a snap election win. South Korea races to avoid US tariffs An impending trade cliff is spurring the urgency. A temporary deal that has largely kept Korean exports outside the reach of plumped‐up American tariffs expires soon. Without a new agreement, the tariffs would automatically rise to 25% on the targeted goods. President Trump has indicated that he may start sending unilateral tariff notices to US trading partners as soon as this weekend. That could give Seoul little time to respond or negotiate concessions. South Korea’s trade minister, Yeo Han-koo, is flying to Washington in a last-ditch diplomatic effort to ward off a worst-case scenario. “It’s still not clear to each side what the other side wants,” President Lee said, calling the trade talks frustrating and opaque. Failing to do so could come at a heavy cost for Korean exporters regarding near-term losses, diminished competitive standing globally, and possible layoffs. With more than 40% of GDP based on exports, Korea is extremely exposed to external shocks. If duties increase overnight, many industries, ranging from the automotive and electronics sectors to steel and shipbuilding, may lose their margins. Market analysts caution that any short-lived disruption could put a chill on GDP growth for the year and rattle investor confidence. And the political stakes are high, too. Running for president, Lee made economic reform and inclusive growth his platform. An inability to contain the fallout from tariffs imposed by the United States could undermine his administration’s credibility early in his tenure.

The move marks a major escalation in his push for what he calls “reciprocal” trade and comes just five days ahead of a self-imposed July 9 deadline for countries to strike deals with the US. Trump told reporters that “10 or 12” letters will be sent Friday, with additional notices expected in the following days. “By the ninth, they’ll be fully covered,” he said, referring to the expiration of the 90-day window he provided when initially announcing the tariff plan on April 2. The new tariffs could range from 10% to 70%, surpassing his earlier maximum of 50%. Trump pushes simple tariff deals as deadline pressures mount Trump reaffirmed his preference for direct tariff implementation over drawn-out negotiations, saying, “It’s much easier. I’d rather just do a simple deal where you can maintain it and control it.” He confirmed that payments from the tariffs would start flowing into the US beginning August 1. While importers or intermediaries pay tariffs, the ultimate cost is often passed to consumers or absorbed in profit margins. As the deadline nears, talks with key economies — including South Korea, Indonesia, the EU, and Switzerland — are in a critical phase. Bloomberg Economics estimates the average tariff on US imports could rise to 20% from just 3% before Trump took office. So far, only the UK and Vietnam have finalized agreements . A deal with China has resulted in a truce, easing tit-for-tat measures and loosening export restrictions. This week, Trump unveiled the Vietnam deal, which imposes a 20% tariff on Vietnamese exports and a 40% tariff on transshipped goods. Though lower than the initial 46%, the rates exceed the interim 10%. Vietnam, however, says negotiations are still ongoing. Global trade partners scramble for last-minute deals as tariff deadline looms Indonesia expressed optimism about finalizing a bold trade pact covering minerals, energy, and defense cooperation. Cambodia announced it had agreed on a reciprocal trade framework, with details to be made public soon. Trump had threatened Cambodia with a 49% tariff, one of the steepest. Japan, South Korea, and EU members are still finalizing accords. Some European automakers are pushing for tariff relief in exchange for increased US investment . South Korea’s top trade envoy is expected to visit Washington this weekend with fresh proposals in a last-minute attempt to avoid new tariffs. Trump has remained optimistic about reaching a deal with India but has sharply criticized Japan, describing it as a tough negotiator. This week, he said Japan might face tariffs as high as 35%. Despite growing concerns, Trump insisted there would be no delay to the deadline. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed Thursday that the president would decide whether countries negotiated in good faith and whether any extensions were warranted. “We’re going to do what the president wants,” Bessent said on CNBC. Markets slide, and fed holds firm as Trump’s tariff threats rattle the global economy Global markets reacted swiftly. Stocks in Asia and Europe dropped, and the US dollar weakened. American equity and bond markets were closed for the Fourth of July holiday. Federal Reserve officials remain cautious, with some warning that increased tariffs could stoke inflation — a concern that’s kept interest rate cuts off the table despite pressure from the White House. As Trump moves to reshape global trade through unilateral action, trading partners face a stark choice: strike a deal now or pay the price come August.

Chainlink is currently showing strong technical behavior, holding support around $12, with analysts watching for a potential climb toward $25. Meanwhile, Kaspa is working on sustainable growth into 2026, prioritizing performance upgrades instead of hype-fueled activity. However, BlockDAG is gaining attention for a different reason. With $329.5 million raised in presale, an ROI of 2,660% delivered to early holders, and a new partnership with the Seattle Seawolves, it is combining digital accessibility with real-world adoption. These three platforms continue to stand out for those following long-term crypto engagement strategies. BlockDAG Joins Forces With Seattle Seawolves to Boost Global Adoption BlockDAG has teamed up with the Seattle Seawolves to boost global adoption of its blockchain infrastructure. This collaboration introduces digital access to exclusive NFTs, fan perks, and behind-the-scenes content, all made possible through BlockDAG’s scalable Layer 1 technology. Together, the Seawolves and BlockDAG will share fresh content on social platforms, including match previews, player highlights, and interactive features that enhance fan involvement. These initiatives aim to build secure, meaningful digital touchpoints between the team and its fan base. With elements like special-access content and tradeable collectibles, the goal is to make the experience more engaging and rewarding. For BlockDAG, this partnership is another step toward connecting Web3 capabilities with everyday communities. The platform’s presale continues to gain traction, having raised $329.5 million, sold 23.6 billion coins, and reached batch 29 with a current price of $0.0276. Still, buyers can access a limited offer at $0.0016, but only until August 11. Early holders of the altcoin have already seen an ROI of 2,660%. This partnership shows why BlockDAG is being seen as one of the top crypto opportunities right now. It combines usefulness, accessibility, and popular appeal in a way that makes blockchain a direct part of the fan experience. Kaspa Price Prediction Shows Potential for Gradual Gains Into 2026 The Kaspa price prediction through 2026 points to a steady growth path fueled by strong technical capabilities. Analysts expect it to increase in value as it continues refining block timing and confirmation speeds. With a focus on performance and scalability, it appeals to those looking for stable networks that deliver consistent results. Rather than aiming for sudden price jumps, Kaspa appears ready for steady, calculated growth. This makes it appealing to users who prefer sustainable infrastructure over volatile spikes. Current forecasts suggest a more balanced price range by 2026, backed by continued technical upgrades and growing use. For those seeking dependable, low-risk returns, Kaspa could be a solid choice. Chainlink Price Prediction: July 2025 Outlook Suggests Bullish Trend The Chainlink price prediction for July 2025 suggests that upward momentum may continue if current levels hold. Technical charts show higher lows forming, with $12 acting as a strong support zone. If this level remains unbroken, LINK could push toward $18, with a breakout potentially aiming for $25. If buying activity increases, prices could extend even further, potentially landing between $31 and $41. Additionally, a rounded-bottom formation is appearing on the charts, a shape often seen before a trend reversal. However, a dip below $12 could point to weakness, putting targets between $10 and $11 in focus. This makes close tracking of support and resistance levels important in the short term. Final Thoughts Crypto platforms that offer clear value and maintain stability often gain attention beyond hype cycles. Chainlink continues to show resilience through technical strength. Kaspa is taking a methodical approach, offering consistent gains with solid infrastructure. BlockDAG, by contrast, is making headlines by applying blockchain tools in real-world areas like professional sports. With 23.6 billion coins sold and a limited-time price of $0.0016 available until August 11, BlockDAG presents a strong entry point with high growth potential. Together, these three projects are not only making moves in the market, but they are also reinforcing their relevance through technology, real-world utility, and strategic engagement. This is why they remain top coins to watch in 2025 .

Despite this short-term dip, LINK has held onto weekly gains of around 2.4%, suggesting broader market participants may still be weighing its long-term potential. While price remains rangebound, recent on-chain data indicates that LINK’s price action could be the result of diverging behavior between retail and institutional investors. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) On Standby: Bitcoin’s Next Move Holds The Key Chainlink Institutional Accumulation and Supply Pressure CryptoQuant contributor “Banker” highlighted a growing structural dynamic in the LINK ecosystem in a recent QuickTake analysis titled “LINK’s Accumulation Standoff: Whales Build, Retail Waits.” The report outlines how LINK is currently in a consolidation phase between $12 and $15, where institutional actors have been steadily accumulating tokens, while retail users remain largely passive. This discrepancy may be playing a key role in capping upward momentum despite persistent LINK outflows from centralized exchanges. According to Banker, exchange netflows for LINK have remained negative at roughly -100,000 LINK per week, signaling that more tokens are being withdrawn from trading platforms than deposited. This behavior is typically associated with accumulation activity, particularly from larger holders or “whales” who may be positioning for longer-term appreciation. Historical spikes in retail deposits, such as the +5 million LINK deposited in March 2025, have proven to be exceptions rather than the norm, as retail activity has since remained subdued. Supporting this view, active LINK addresses have hovered consistently between 28,000 and 32,000 per day, while transaction counts average around 9,000 daily. These figures have not rebounded from previous activity peaks seen in late 2024, even as Chainlink’s oracle usage has expanded. Meanwhile, elevated levels of exchange withdrawals, peaking at over 3,000 per day in Q4 2024, remain a dominant force. With leverage metrics staying neutral, whales have been able to withdraw LINK without introducing significant price volatility, resulting in a 40% year-to-date drop in exchange reserves. Market Outlook Hinges on Retail Reentry or Whale Fatigue As LINK’s consolidation persists, the path forward may depend on a shift in market dynamics. Banker points out that a meaningful breakout will likely require renewed participation from retail traders, as evidenced by a spike in active wallet addresses and transaction volume. Related Reading: Chainlink Holders Set Record As 1-Yr MVRV Signals ‘Opportunity’ If these metrics rise and price breaks above the $15 price mark, momentum could build for a stronger upward trend. On the other hand, a decline in whale-driven withdrawals or an increase in exchange inflows could weaken accumulation, potentially pushing LINK back down toward the $10 level. Banker added: Until catalysts emerge, whales silently build positions, echoing Bitcoin’s 2023 consolidation before its 2024 surge.

Dogecoin is forming a bullish pattern, and Hedera is trying to bounce back. But much of the real interest is shifting elsewhere. Web3 ai , a presale project with AI-powered features, has now sold over 23.95 billion tokens and collected more than $8.7 million. As each presale stage wraps up, people are starting to focus on platforms with real tools, not just attention-grabbing stories. This change in direction is becoming clearer. Older coins that once moved fast are now hitting resistance levels. Meanwhile, smaller AI-backed platforms are offering better early entry chances. At $0.000443 in Stage 09, Web3 ai is catching attention not as just another project, but as the best crypto investment this year with a forecasted 1,747% ROI and tools built for real users. Bullish Signs in Dogecoin but Momentum Still Lacking Dogecoin is showing a pattern that some see as bullish, including signs of a falling wedge breakout. If Dogecoin moves past $0.13 and holds it, some believe a run to $0.16 could follow. These patterns have worked for Dogecoin before, especially during strong hype periods backed by social media. But volume levels are not supporting the move right now. There’s little whale buying and the network is quiet. Even if the pattern looks good, the follow-through is still uncertain. With meme coins slowing down, this rally may not hold unless something major shifts in Q3 2025. Dogecoin is still being watched because of its long history and surprise price moves. Yet for those looking for the best crypto investment in 2025, Dogecoin’s dependence on hype makes it a hard choice compared to projects offering more stable returns and clear use cases. Hedera Faces Challenges Despite Project Growth Hedera’s price outlook has become weaker after dropping nearly 11% in recent weeks. Some experts believe HBAR could move back into the $0.12 to $0.15 range before Q3 ends, but current signals show neutral or weak trends. Its RSI is just above oversold, and the $0.10 support is under pressure. One issue is the gap between Hedera’s use cases and its price trend. It has big partnerships and is working on tokenization and digital ledger tools. But the price has not reacted to any of this. Right now, just having good tech is not enough. Markets are looking for returns, and Hedera has not offered strong gains. Unless new market forces or changes in how the token works take place, Hedera may keep moving sideways. People who want to set up their positions for 2025 might decide to look at other options, especially ones like Web3 ai that offer both high ROI and near-term reasons to grow. Web3 ai Builds Real Tools with 1,747% ROI Potential Web3 ai is drawing attention not only for its presale progress or token price but also for the tools it plans to launch soon. At $0.000443 in Stage 09, the $WAI token powers every part of this growing platform. One major highlight is the Crypto Trading Assistant, designed to offer trading help using real-time data. This tool replaces slow signals and scattered technical analysis with AI-based trade ideas, chart views, and alerts across both centralized and decentralized exchanges. It works with large sets of past data and adjusts for new changes in market mood, price swings, and token links. This helps both new and experienced traders make decisions with more confidence. Web3 ai has already sold more than 23.95 billion tokens and raised $8.7 million, showing that many are interested. The expected 1,747% ROI from the current price to launch makes the upside worth noting, especially when matched with working products. It’s not just about using AI as a buzzword, but building real tools with token-based access that sets $WAI apart from coins based only on hype. As the crypto space shifts toward platforms that offer real use, Web3 ai is getting noticed. People holding the token are not only hoping for gains, but also getting tools that help them trade smarter with AI on their side. What the Market Says Right Now Dogecoin is forming a bullish setup, but weak volume and slow trader interest are stopping big gains. Hedera has solid use cases, but its price is still close to major support levels and hasn’t picked up yet. Web3 ai, on the other hand, is seeing steady interest as its presale grows and more people explore its roadmap. With real tools for trading, a focus on AI, and a possible 1,747% return, Web3 ai is becoming the best crypto investment for 2025 . As the market shifts away from quick pumps toward smart choices, tokens like $WAI are showing why they matter. For those watching for strong projects under a cent, this might be the one where the features match the early interest.

Shiba Inu is drawing attention through accumulation trends, while Hyperliquid holds firm despite market volatility. However, both rely heavily on speculative movement and market timing. Unstaked offers something different. Its AI agent demo shows how simple it is to build and deploy intelligent tools that manage tasks like community engagement without any coding. This shift toward hands-on utility gives Unstaked broader relevance. For those evaluating the best crypto to buy, usability and live functionality make Unstaked a strong candidate in a crowded field. Shiba Inu Price Potential Builds as Accumulation Strengthens Shiba Inu is showing signs of renewed strength as significant buy orders flow in, thereby hinting at a potential shift in market sentiment. Following a stretch of subdued price action, these large-scale transactions point to calculated accumulation rather than short-term speculation. Meanwhile, the current consolidation near support levels has attracted attention, with technical indicators suggesting that buyers are stepping in at perceived value zones. As a result, this activity highlights growing optimism about Shiba Inu price potential, especially if the asset can break through nearby resistance levels. In addition, market watchers are also noting increased wallet activity and trading volume, both of which reinforce the narrative of strategic positioning. At this point, the focus now is on whether this buying momentum can sustain and translate into a broader move upward. Hyperliquid Market Crash Resilience Sparks Bullish Momentum Despite broader downturns, Hyperliquid has shown remarkable resilience, defying fears tied to the recent Hyperliquid market crash narrative. While volatility has tested many digital assets, Hyperliquid’s infrastructure adjustments and community-driven focus have helped steady investor sentiment. Specifically, strategic tweaks, including improved leverage settings and tighter risk parameters, have contributed to a stronger, more sustainable trading environment. Importantly, these changes, rather than stalling momentum, appear to have increased user confidence. Consequently, trading activity has steadily grown, and recent price movements show signs of consolidation, not collapse. Furthermore, technical indicators support the view that HYPE’s support levels are holding firm, hinting at the possibility of a breakout if momentum continues. More importantly, the ability to weather a dip without eroding user trust adds to the platform’s credibility. Looking ahead, as more users re-engage, the recovery from the so-called Hyperliquid market crash could transition from a rebound into a longer-term uptrend, driven by stability, utility, and timely adaptation. Unstaked AI Agents Show That Web3 Automation Doesn’t Need to Be Complex Unstaked’s AI agent demo highlights how effortless Web3 automation can be when designed with accessibility in mind. With that in mind, in just a few clicks, users are able to generate fully operational AI agents capable of managing tasks like community moderation, audience engagement, and outbound communication, no coding skills required. To guide this process, the interface is streamlined, with prompts guiding users through the setup process. In the past, what once required teams of moderators or marketing coordinators can now be handled by a single AI agent operating 24/7. Given this accessibility, the ease of use makes it clear that Unstaked isn’t just targeting developers. Its tools are built for creators, NFT project leads, DAOs, and everyday users who want to grow and manage communities without technical barriers. Moreover, the dashboard offers customization in tone, response behavior, and platform coverage, enabling agents to align perfectly with a project’s brand and goals. What’s more, what sets Unstaked apart is not just simplicity, but timing. The project is currently in presale stage 22, with tokens priced at $0.012091 and over $11 million raised. In contrast, with a confirmed launch price of $0.1819, the early ROI potential is drawing investor attention. Therefore, for those researching the best crypto to buy, Unstaked offers both utility and growth upside. Ultimately, this isn’t a concept, it’s a working product with real-time demos and live creation features. As a result, as users continue to experiment with Unstaked’s AI agents, one thing is clear: automation is no longer a luxury reserved for tech teams. It’s now accessible to anyone willing to explore it. Last Say Speculative growth can create headlines, but real utility drives lasting relevance. Shiba Inu gains traction through accumulation, and Hyperliquid maintains attention with its price resilience. Still, both rely on market sentiment. Unstaked takes a different route, offering hands-on tools that are already functional. Its AI agents are easy to deploy and serve practical needs like community moderation and engagement, no technical skills required. This shift from hype to usability sets it apart. For those considering the best crypto to buy , Unstaked presents a working product with clear value, giving it an edge in a space often dominated by speculation over substance.

Trump signed the one big, beautiful bill into law at a military family picnic at the White House for the Fourth of July. The president and his aides had long pegged Independence Day as a deadline for when they hoped to see the legislation on his desk, a timeline that appeared in peril just days ago. The move marks the president’s most significant legislative achievement of his second term. Until now, Trump’s presidency has largely relied on executive orders rather than congressional action. First lady Melania Trump attended Friday’s ceremony, and several Cabinet officials and numerous Republican lawmakers, including Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.), House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), and Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.). The event featured dramatic touches, including a flyover by two B-2 bombers — the same model used in last month’s strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. “This is really promises made, promises kept,” Trump said before signing the bill. Calling it “the biggest victory yet,” he touted the measure as proof of American strength and a cornerstone of his economic agenda. GOP rallies behind Trump to push budget through Congress amid tight deadline The bill’s passage reinforces Trump’s dominance within the Republican Party. GOP leaders on Capitol Hill pushed the measure through both chambers this week despite razor-thin margins, vocal opposition from Democrats, and skepticism from fiscal hawks and moderates. Trump personally lobbied key lawmakers, even inviting some to the White House to seal their support ahead of the July 4 deadline. But the political victory is not without cost. The sweeping legislation includes major spending cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs, prompting criticism from advocacy groups, fiscal watchdogs, and Democrats who warn of long-term consequences. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, approximately 11.8 million Americans could lose Medicaid coverage due to new work requirements, co-payments, and reimbursement caps. Hospitals, particularly rural ones, could face closures due to reduced federal support. Polls show the bill is broadly unpopular with the public. Democrats have vowed to use the bill as a political weapon in the upcoming midterms, while some Senate Republicans fear electoral backlash from voters reliant on safety-net programs. Trump hails ‘rocketship economy’ as $4.5 trillion in tax breaks take center stage Still, the administration insists the package will supercharge the economy. Trump dismissed concerns over rising debt: “Our country is going to be a rocketship economically.” Despite opposition forecasts, he argued that tax reform, deregulation, tariffs, and energy production will drive growth. The bill features $4.5 trillion in tax cuts , including an extension of the 2017 Trump-era tax reductions. It also offers new tax relief for tipped workers, overtime pay, certain auto loans, seniors, and parents. A key win for Republicans in high-tax states — like New York, New Jersey, and California — is expanding the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap from $10,000 to $40,000 over five years. The bill slashes incentives for renewable energy and electric vehicles to offset part of the cost, which could slow green infrastructure investments. Medicaid alone faces nearly $1 trillion in reductions, while food-aid programs will enforce expanded work requirements and penalties for states with error-prone benefit systems. In contrast, the bill delivers hundreds of billions in new military spending and greenlights additional funds for immigration enforcement, aligning with Trump’s national security agenda. As the country celebrates Independence Day, Trump is betting that this bold, controversial budget will reshape America’s economy — and his political legacy.

Stage 3 positions are filling in quickly at $0.00012255. Traders are viewing this as an early opportunity to get into a project with solid community ownership. With XRP holding on to large ETF news and Mantle making new product plays, MAGACOIN FINANCE is in the spotlight. This altcoin is drawing in retail buyers and early whales. Every round has sold out quicker than expected to date. Fixed supply and audited trust give the buyers more confidence. Most consider it a meme coin with real structure and a solid plan for growth. What Makes MAGACOIN FINANCE Different MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out by merging political storytelling with disciplined tokenomics. Each move showcases growing momentum. Investors want tokens that are not just hype. Zero-tax mechanism and community governance enable trust-building. Others liken it to Dogecoin in its infancy. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is intent on long-term assets for its owners. Its roadmap is suggesting real decentralized finance capabilities. XRP Investors Wait and Watch XRP has been a crypto behemoth for years. Frenzy over a spot ETF keeps traders active. Experts estimate the chances of approval at about 45% currently. Large ones such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have submitted. But SEC delays make Q4 the probable timeframe. Some analysts anticipate XRP price crossing previous highs if approvals come through. While waiting, diversification is going on with some XRP investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE is among the options for investors who want a new twist with a robust community backing. Mantle Becomes Useful but Uncertain Mantle’s release of the new UR Neobank was featured in the news. It had a modest price increase, even during the overall market slump. Mantle is known for its Layer 2 technology that speeds up Ethereum transactions and lowers fees. Most investors still consider Mantle to be a promising one. Its price range up to Q4 may be between $0.44 and $0.71. Others look for a surge through $1.50 if new buyers come in. But superior early-stage deals are in their opinion. That is the reason that money is flowing into names like MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE Keeps Building One of the reasons MAGACOIN FINANCE is so popular is due to its fixed supply model. It gets rid of stealth emissions and gives assurance to its holders. A third-party audit does support its security assertions. Each stage sells out quicker. This is a clear sign that indicates that demand is increasing. Crypto veterans compare it to those initial meme coins but point to its open staking model and political slant. This is to draw in purchasers who want something more than temporary hype. And it doesn’t hurt that a lot of people are moving money from XRP and Mantle to be an early adopter. Wrapping Up MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing it belongs in the 2025 altcoin discussion. Traders demand projects with thoroughly established plans, audited with integrity, and viral hype. As XRP traders await ETF listing and Mantle continues to develop its DeFi toolbox, MAGACOIN FINANCE is experiencing genuine demand for Stage 3. Look for more eyes to turn up here as the capped supply contracts and buyers continue to fill out each phase. This political-themed meme-powered altcoin demonstrates that narrative does count.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi crypto is quietly gaining momentum. The project has sold more than 60% of presale stage 5 at $0.03. MUTM has mobilized in excess of $11.7 million and has attracted over 12,700 investors. As ETH regains strength amid shifting sentiment in the broader crypto market, the spotlight is increasingly shifting to Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance could hit $3 soon after launch. Ethereum Eyes $3,000 Amid Renewed Market Optimism Ethereum (ETH) is priced at around $2,740 and it has experienced stable upward movement since improvements in the general market sentiment and the rising network activity. As analysts see it, ETH might be tested around the $3,000 mark again in the near future should the upside demand persist and risk-on macro conditions in the crypto sphere remain. The price growth of Ethereum is chiefly due to growing institutional use and improving fundamentals. Nevertheless, with the slow development on ETH, certain investors are starting to diversify into other recent assets such as Mutuum Finance, which has been drawing interests based on their growth prospects of providing speedier returns. Mutuum Finance Presale Stage 5 Gains Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up some serious traction as it reaches Stage 5 of its presale. With more than 12,700 early adopters and well over $11.7 million in funds raised, the project is taking giant strides as a major player in the DeFi. USD Stablecoin Launch & $50K Security Bounty Mutuum Finance, in its plans to build more on its DeFi, is launching a fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. In contrast to highly risk-exposed algorithmic stablecoins, this token has been designed in such a manner that it will guarantee its value even during market volatility. The project itself is about integrity and security. Mutuum Finance platform is already audited by CertiK as well, which once again shows team dedication to transparency, reliability, and sustainability. Mutuum Finance also introduced a Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, where a reward of 50,000 USDT is offered. The bounty comes in four categories, namely the critical, major, minor, and low. This will level out all the tiers of vulnerability and reward it alike. Investor Incentives In appreciation of the presale mania and as a token of appreciation to early adopters, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will distribute a total of $100,000 . Ten such winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens for being part of the early backers of the project. With the community growing exponentially, the early backers are being rewarded, not only with possible future gain, but with real, present-time rewards. As Ethereum steadily approaches the $3,000 milestone, investor attention is simultaneously shifting toward high-upside opportunities like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi project that’s already making waves. With over $11.7 million raised, 12,700+ investors onboard, and Stage 5 of the presale more than 60% sold out at just $0.03, Mutuum is capturing serious market interest. Backed by a CertiK audit, a $50,000 security bounty, and an upcoming USD-backed stablecoin, the project is setting the stage for a potential rally toward $3 post-launch. Early participants are also eligible to win a share of $100,000 in MUTM tokens. Seize this early advantage, visit the official website now and join the presale before it closes.

47496317,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=783694,1751680847,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/47496317.jpeg,Dogecoin Social Surge: Rising Buzz And Network Use Spark New Interest,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/dogecoin-social-surge-rising-buzz-and-network-use-spark-new-interest/,"Dogecoin’s price action caught traders’ attention this week. After dipping toward the $0.13–$0.15 demand zone, the meme‑coin shot higher, and a surge in derivatives data suggests many expect more gains. Related Reading: Ethereum Network Awakens—Massive On-Chain Moves Signal What’s Coming Trader Interest Climbs Around $0.19 Resistance According to market data, Open Interest jumped by 16% to reach over $2 billion. Options volume exploded by 400%. That kind of rise often points to big bets on upward swings. Right now, many eyes are on the $0.20 resistance level. If DOGE can close a daily candle above that line, it may clear the way toward $0.27. Dogecoin’s technical setup is drawing fresh looks from chart watchers. The Stochastic RSI crossed above 80, which can mark an overbought zone. Yet coins have stayed above overbought readings before when buyers kept pushing. Traders will want to see real volume behind any move above that descending trendline near $0.19. Without it, the rally may stall or give back gains. Whales Return With Spot Inflows Based on reports, Dogecoin saw a net inflow of $8.20 million into spot wallets. That marks a big shift after weeks of outflows. Large holders have been moving coins onto exchanges in the past, but now they’re pulling more in. In other cycles, fresh whale buys have lined up with mid‑term rallies. On‑chain metrics add another layer. Dogecoin’s MVRV Z‑score climbed back to 0.355 after hitting near‑historical lows late in June. That figure measures how much profit holders stand to make on average. A rising score hints that fewer holders are underwater, and that might draw in new buyers. Still, MVRV is backward‑looking. It can’t predict if price will break through key resistance. Network Activity Shows Mixed Signals Network stats tell a mixed story. Daily active addresses slid to 34 K, and transaction counts dropped to 15K as of July 3. That’s a sharp fall from the more than 500K addresses and transactions seen in the last week of June. Lower usage could sap the rally’s legs if retail traders don’t reengage soon. Related Reading: The Silent Bitcoin Accumulation: Public Companies’ Surprising H1 2025 Lead Even with these mixed signals, the mood toward Dogecoin is brighter than it was a week ago. Traders piling into options and hikes in Open Interest show speculative appetite is up. Large spot inflows show that whales have stepped back in. But network usage is lagging. If daily addresses and transactions don’t bounce back, bulls may find it harder to sustain the push.

Speaking at an Independence Day event in Ottawa, Hoekstra noted that both leaders have dedicated negotiators working on the deal. He envisioned a scenario where each leader could proudly tell their citizens, “I secured a fantastic deal for my Canada.” Hoekstra further speculated that at that moment, they would have a president who could say, ‘I got a great deal for the USA.’ Based on his argument, this was possibly a ” win-win situation.” Hoekstra expresses optimism for an end to the US-Canada trade negotiation The US, Canada, and Mexico already have a trade agreement that Trump signed in his first term. The president, however, has avoided it, setting tariffs of up to 50% on imported steel and aluminum and duties on cars and trucks. Interestingly, Canada plays an important role in exporting all of those goods. On the other hand, the Canadian government imposed counter-tariffs on tens of billions of dollars worth of American-made goods. This included automobiles and other consumer goods. Notably, Carney, Canada’s prime minister since March, chose not to respond when Trump raised the tariffs on steel and aluminum weeks ago. Meanwhile, trade talks restarted between the United States and Canada immediately after Ottawa removed a digital services tax, which the US objected to, according to White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett. Hassett stated that when he was asked about the talks starting up again. This came after Mark Carney telephoned US President Donald Trump to inform him that the tax was being canceled, the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, describing it as a big win for US tech firms. Leavitt described this as straightforward, referring to Prime Minister Carney giving in to President Trump and the US. She praised Trump’s tough negotiating approach for the change. The secretary further stated that President Trump understands that every country needs to have strong trade ties with the US. Based on Leavitt’s argument, Canada made a mistake by promising to put in place a tax that would have harmed their tech companies. The two leaders agreed on a July 21 deadline for reaching an agreement. Hoekstra, who used to be a member of the US House of Representatives from Michigan, which relies heavily on trade with Canada, asserted that they will get through this. He then concluded that when this is all over, they will be stronger and better than they were at the start. Canada drops its digital services tax on the US, resulting in a trade deal with the nation Canada backed off a plan to start imposing a new digital services tax aimed at US technology giants just hours before it came into effect in hopes of helping move forward the halted trade talks with the US. This was after Trump asked Canada to drop the tax at a G7 meeting in Canada earlier in June. According to Hassett, this is something that they had studied, and now they had agreed to it. Therefore, Hassett anticipated that they could get back to the negotiations. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick commented on the situation in a post on X. Lutnick expressed gratitude to Canada for removing its Digital Services Tax. According to him, it was intended to stifle American innovation and would have been a deal breaker for any trade deal with America. As a result of this change, stocks reached new highs on Wall Street as market sentiment lifted on hopes that the US would make progress on its trade negotiations with major trading partners, including Canada.

With its price at $0.00013428 and climbing, this new political meme token is drawing serious attention, even as Ethereum consolidates and Aptos advances with mixed market traction. Analysts and early investors see MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most compelling opportunities of 2025. Its meme appeal, political branding, and real fundamentals is driving significant forecasts from top analysts, attracting capital away from more established altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Meme-Political Star MAGACOIN FINANCE tops the watchlist of leading altcoins with a HashEx smart contract audit, a strict 170 billion token cap, and a clear roadmap focused on community-driven governance. Its narrative taps into the “Make America Great Again” movement, giving it a political edge in a crowded meme sector. Every presale phase is selling out rapidly, often driving prices higher within hours. The project already boasts 20,000+ active supporters and million dollars raised from early investors, making it one of the largest community-driven crypto launches of 2025. Backed by staking rewards with high APYs for early participants, it’s no surprise MAGACOIN FINANCE is topping analyst watchlists. Some even compare it to the earliest days of Aptos and Ethereum— but with stronger fundamentals and an actual decentralized governance framework. MAGACOIN FINANCE Vs Ethereum: Big Institutional Bets but Price Stalls Ethereum is seeing significant strategic moves from major players. BitMine Immersion Technologies, originally a Bitcoin miner, just raised $250 million to start an ETH treasury, which could make it one of the largest publicly traded ETH holders. This private placement drew top investors like Founders Fund, Pantera, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, and Thomas Lee, who will chair BitMine. Lee highlighted Ethereum’s dominance in stablecoin settlement and expects ETH to keep benefiting as stablecoin adoption grows. While this underlines Ethereum’s long-term strength to achieve $5000 in the long-term, ETH is currently consolidating as markets digest the news — pushing some investors to look for more immediate high-growth plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Aptos’ Volatility Pushes MAGACOIN FINANCE Aptos (APT) has posted some impressive milestones. CEO Avery Ching was appointed to the CFTC’s GMAC Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee, a regulatory move boosting institutional credibility. The network also saw over 1,200 smart contracts deployed in a single day, and its stablecoin supply recently hit $1 billion. Technologically, Aptos is rolling out Zaptos, a pipelined blockchain design supporting up to 20,000 transactions per second. Meanwhile, Bitwise updated filings for an Aptos ETF, and Wyoming’s stablecoin initiative is spotlighting APT. Yet despite these advances, APT flashes mixed market signals and is lagging the kind of explosive multiples speculative traders crave. Final Take: Where the Money’s Moving Ethereum continues to secure its spot as the backbone of DeFi and institutional treasuries. Aptos is innovating and securing more regulatory wins, but with limited immediate upside. In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting traders eager to ride the next bullish wave. With its low entry price at $0.00013428, audited supply cap and surging community, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming one of the top altcoins to watch for portfolio diversification with solid gains.

With constant shifts in investor behavior, technology upgrades, and unexpected market surges, knowing where to place your bets has never been more critical. As crypto adoption climbs again, everyone’s wondering which projects will actually deliver. For those looking to score big in 2025, the real search is for the top-performing cryptos today that combine fresh innovation with real user traction. Right now, four names are catching serious attention: Polkadot, VeChain, Sui, and Web3 ai. Each brings its own strengths, but Web3 ai stands out with unmatched presale ROI and AI-powered tools already attracting early whales. If you’re serious about catching the next wave of wealth in crypto, start with these top-performing cryptos today before prices run. 1. Web3 ai: Where AI Utility Meets Real ROI Potential Web3 ai is making serious noise among crypto watchers, aiming for utility-driven growth. With Stage 9 underway, the token sits at just $0.000443 and has already raised over $8.8 million. The final presale stage is set at $0.003267, with a projected listing price of $0.005242, delivering early participants up to 1747% gains. But this isn’t just about numbers. Web3 ai is backed by several smart AI tools built for real-world investing, ranging from portfolio tracking and yield management to scam alerts and market insights. Unlike speculative meme coins, $WAI serves as a gateway to staking, governance, and AI-driven trading tools. These features make it valuable even after the presale ends. Many now speculate that $WAI could climb to $5 over the long term. With both infrastructure and community growing fast, Web3 ai is one of the top-performing cryptos today, giving early backers a solid shot at outsized gains. 2. Polkadot: Tech-Driven Growth With Whale Confidence Polkadot (DOT) continues gaining traction due to its unique multichain structure and cross-chain messaging upgrades. Priced near $7.20, DOT is drawing increased whale attention after key developments in the XCM protocol and new parachain slot expansions. As more DeFi apps tap into Polkadot’s system, on-chain volume and total value locked are seeing a steady rise. With over half of DOT’s supply staked, the network shows strong internal confidence and user loyalty. Analysts expect DOT to push back into double digits as parachain growth expands. Whales have been quietly building positions throughout June, signaling long-term belief. For those looking beyond short-term pumps, Polkadot remains one of the top-performing cryptos today, driven by its solid tech and interoperability edge. 3. VeChain: Where Enterprise Adoption Meets Real Utility VeChain (VET), currently near $0.031, is backed by serious enterprise integrations. With use cases spanning logistics, healthcare, and sustainability, VET has become a go-to for corporations like Walmart China and DNV. The recent rollout of VeBetterDAO and incentive-driven marketplaces has sparked higher network activity and brought new developers into the fold. One major strength is its dual-token model: VET handles value transfers, while VTHO covers fees, keeping enterprise adoption cost-effective. Whale wallets have picked up massive amounts of VET since June, reflecting trust in VeChain’s growth story. As global attention turns toward sustainability, VeChain’s real-world blockchain usage cements its place among the top-performing cryptos today. 4. Sui: High-Speed Blockchain With a Growing Ecosystem Sui (SUI) is making headlines thanks to its high throughput and unique programming framework. Currently around $0.84, Sui leverages the Move language and handles up to 297,000 transactions per second in test settings. That kind of performance is attracting DeFi builders, NFT creators, and GameFi developers to its network. Sui also benefits from low gas fees and strong support from its foundation through grants and dev events. Whale tracking shows a growing number of large wallets accumulating SUI since new bridges and listings were announced. As user-friendly features roll out, and with more developers choosing Sui for its speed and scalability, it’s clear this coin is among the top-performing cryptos today with real breakout potential. Final Words! There’s no shortage of coins making noise, but only a few show the kind of traction, tech, and tokenomics that lead to real returns. Web3 ai, Polkadot, VeChain, and Sui are top-performing cryptos today with clear use cases and growing demand. Web3 ai leads with its presale momentum and access to real AI-powered investing tools, while Polkadot delivers cross-chain utility that developers love. Meanwhile, VeChain shows blockchain is already reshaping enterprise systems, and Sui proves next-gen blockchains can be both fast and scalable. For those aiming to make smart moves before the next crypto bull run hits full swing, these four projects deserve a close look. Stick with the top-performing cryptos today , and you might just be early to the next big breakout.

While tokens, DAOs, and smart contracts have achieved some of this, the actual process of managing decentralized communities still depends heavily on human effort. Moderating Telegram groups, welcoming new users, and keeping engagement high are tasks that remain manual, repetitive, and difficult to scale. That could soon shift. In 2025, a new concept is beginning to gain momentum at the intersection of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology: autonomous AI agents that operate independently on-chain. These are not abstract concepts, they are already being tested. Unstaked is one of the few platforms actively working to make this technology accessible for every Web3 project, regardless of scale or technical expertise. Understanding AI Agents & Their Relevance AI agents are software programs that function autonomously, respond to user input, and evolve their behavior through interaction. Unlike basic bots or scripts, these agents can learn from their environment, enhance their performance, and carry out complex workflows without direct supervision. While Web2 examples include AI-powered customer service systems and recommendation engines, Web3 presents unique demands. In this space, there are no centralized servers or private backends. AI agents must operate independently, transparently, and in a decentralized manner. This is the gap that Unstaked aims to close. Unstaked’s Infrastructure for Autonomous Web3 Agents Unstaked is building a platform that lets users design, customize, and launch decentralized AI agents using the $UNSD token. These agents are tailored to real-world applications in crypto, such as moderating community forums, handling live chats, onboarding users, responding to queries, and managing campaign execution. Unlike proprietary AI tools, Unstaked’s agents operate entirely on-chain. Every task performed by an agent is recorded and visible, allowing for transparency and accountability. This proof-of-intelligence system builds the trust needed for agents to act on behalf of decentralized communities. Unstaked has also released a product demo , offering a glimpse into its dashboard and capabilities. The interface enables users to build agents without writing code, define behavior rules, and assign tasks, all within a streamlined, no-code environment. Though the demo represents an early version, it shows Unstaked’s platform is ready for practical use, offering a much-needed solution for launching AI agents across blockchain-native ecosystems. The Role of the $UNSD Token in the Agent Economy $UNSD is central to the entire Unstaked platform. It enables users to: Deploy and run AI agents Access advanced automation templates Unlock higher-level agent behavior models Engage with agent marketplaces Pay for usage costs through crypto-native microtransactions Unstaked replaces traditional SaaS subscription models with a blockchain-based pricing structure. Agents start at just $10 to $20 per month, paid in $UNSD. This approach gives communities access to scalable automation tools at a fraction of the cost of employing human support teams. As more agents are deployed, demand for UNSD naturally rises. This builds a utility-focused feedback loop, differentiating it from many tokens that rely primarily on price speculation. Strong Presale Performance & Market Interest Unstaked is currently in Stage 22 of its presale, offering UNSD tokens at $0.01209. The projected launch price is approximately $0.1819, suggesting a potential return of 2700%, depending on platform growth and adoption. To date, Unstaked has raised more than $10.8 million and sold 1.2 billion tokens, putting it among the most active infrastructure-based crypto projects in 2025. This momentum shows that the idea of decentralized AI tools is gaining real interest beyond theory. Looking ahead, crypto communities may rely less on human moderators and support teams. Instead, autonomous agents could oversee education, onboarding, campaign management, and even trigger smart contract actions based on behavioral data. This transition is not far off. Unstaked is one of the few projects building the backend required for it. By allowing users to control agent functions and infrastructure, Unstaked combines usability, transparency, and scalability in one platform. Closing Thoughts The arrival of AI agents in Web3 is not just about convenience, it addresses a growing need. As decentralized systems expand globally, there is a rising demand for intelligent, self-managing tools. Unstaked meets this challenge with a toolkit built for real-world use. With a live demo, active presale, and product roadmap tied to actual deployment, Unstaked is shaping up to be a key player in the evolution of crypto infrastructure. As AI becomes more than just a market theme and starts powering core Web3 functions, platforms like Unstaked may become essential to how decentralized communities grow, adapt, and function.

While headlines are busy celebrating Solana’s first U.S.-based ETF and Hedera’s steady push into enterprise solutions, there’s a newcomer drawing surprising attention— MAGACOIN FINANCE . This bold, politically flavored memecoin isn’t just holding its price; it’s gaining momentum. The question buzzing through Telegram groups and crypto Twitter: could MAGACOIN FINANCE start attracting the kind of serious backing usually reserved for blue-chip tokens? What Is MAGACOIN FINANCE All About? At its core, MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t your average altcoin. It blends meme appeal with real features—like a zero-tax system, capped supply, and full smart contract audits. But the real kicker? It leans into a highly recognizable political brand, one that sparks conversation (and some controversy) everywhere it goes. The coin is built for community first. Unlike many meme coins that rely on hype alone, MAGACOIN FINANCE emphasizes grassroots momentum and long-term involvement. Its “Make America Great Again” branding is part of its identity, turning what some might see as a joke into a powerful narrative that resonates with a specific crowd. What Sets MAGACOIN FINANCE Apart in a Crowded Market Solana’s hitting its stride. It’s got a new ETF, sky-high trading volumes, and an upcoming upgrade that could make it one of the fastest blockchains around. Hedera, meanwhile, is playing the long game, building partnerships and integrating tools for regulated industries. MAGACOIN FINANCE doesn’t try to compete in the same way. It’s not built on speed or corporate partnerships—it’s built on culture. It’s early-stage, driven by people who want to see a specific message succeed. Where Solana and Hedera feel polished, MAGACOIN FINANCE is raw, loud, and unapologetically community-driven. The Buzz Is Real Check the numbers—over 20,000 members in its Telegram, with more joining daily. The website traffic is spiking, and whispers of an exchange listing are picking up steam. Investors are showing up fast, with each presale round selling out in just hours. Between the decentralized structure , strong online presence, and politically charged branding, this isn’t just another meme coin—it’s starting to feel like a movement. The Takeaway: MAGACOIN FINANCE Is One to Watch Closely While Hedera cools off and Solana dominates headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building something different. It’s not trying to replace the big names—it’s carving out its own space in the market. Whether or not it attracts institutional cash like Solana, one thing is obvious: it’s not fading into the background anytime soon.

Tron’s steady rise in USDT volume and SUI’s reaction to its big token unlock show how fast the market can change and why picking the right project could make all the difference. While both tokens continue to make an impact, BlockDAG (BDAG) is drawing attention through major figures and its upcoming BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release. With over $330 million raised, 23.6 billion coins sold, and the presale now in batch 29 at $0.0276, BlockDAG is offering a unique chance to buy in at just $0.0016 until August 11. This price, supported by full audits and growing mining support, places BlockDAG among the top choices in the best crypto coins for 2025 category. Tron Growth Sparks Discussion on Long-Term Strength The Tron (TRX) market outlook is gaining momentum, supported by its role in decentralised media and strong alliances. Its recent spike in USDT transactions has stood out during a market dip, showing stable usage. Tron continues to attract developers who value fast, low-cost transfers. Its system backs stablecoin activity and DeFi projects, which gives it practical use. Still, some concerns remain about how decentralised Tron really is and how it will handle bigger demand in the future. Questions about governance and scaling continue, yet Tron keeps showing signs that it may have more growth ahead. SUI Faces Pressure Post-Unlock but Shows Developer Appeal The SUI price movement has shifted after its recent $164 million token unlock, which brought negative pressure. Even so, SUI’s Layer 1 setup focused on speed and cost is keeping developer interest strong. It handles smart contracts and on-chain assets easily, which could help build out its platform. However, rising competition and market changes present challenges. SUI’s next steps depend on how well it manages its token system and earns continued support from its community and builders. BlockDAG Sets Stage With $0.0016 Entry and Growing User Base The BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release is putting the project in a different category from other rising coins. It’s now giving early access to one of the lowest prices offered since the first batch. With more than $330 million raised, 23.6 billion coins sold, and current pricing at batch 29’s $0.0276, the project is moving fast. Right now, a limited-time offer allows users to grab BDAG at just $0.0016 until August 11. This pricing is one of the lowest seen since batch 1 and is aimed at bringing in more users before the official launch begins. More than just a low entry point, BlockDAG is building trust through audits from Halborn and CertiK. These checks confirm the system is prepared for future expansion and focused on long-term strength. The project is not only looking at short-term growth but also shaping a stable foundation. Along with solid pricing and security, BlockDAG shows signs of real activity. Over 18,300 miners have been sold, and the X1 Mining App is helping grow its user network. These tools are already working in the market. For those following the Tron (TRX) market outlook or watching the SUI price movement, BlockDAG’s security features, strong presale numbers, and the upcoming BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release make it one to keep an eye on. It’s now gaining attention as one of the best crypto coins for 2025. Quick Take: Tron, SUI, and BlockDAG on the Radar The Tron (TRX) market outlook shows steady signs, backed by strong USDT activity. Still, some questions remain about its ability to scale and its governance structure, which may shape where Tron heads next. The SUI price movement shifted after a large token unlock changed short-term expectations. But its flexible Layer 1 design keeps builders interested, and it still holds value in the current space. BlockDAG, meanwhile, is drawing attention through its BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release, offering a rare $0.0016 entry until August 11. This price sits far below batch 29’s $0.0276. With a $330 million presale, audits from top firms, and a rising number of miners, BlockDAG is positioning itself among the best crypto coins for 2025 . For those acting early, this could be the moment that makes the difference.

Although the digital asset remains down 19% on a year-over-year (YoY) basis, some analysts are optimistic that it’s ready for a liftoff. Ethereum Enters Wyckoff ‘Liftoff’ Phase In an X post published today, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader noted that Ethereum appears to be following the Wyckoff Accumulation pattern and has successfully cleared both the ‘creek’ and ‘spring’ phases, potentially entering the ‘liftoff’ phase characterized by parabolic price action. Related Reading: Ethereum Breakout Imminent? Broadening Wedge Hints At $4,200 Surge In the Wyckoff accumulation pattern, the ‘creek’ represents overhead resistance where price struggles to break higher, while the ‘spring’ is a false breakdown below support, meant to trap bears and confirm strong hands. The ‘liftoff’ phase follows the spring, marked by a sharp recovery and breakout above resistance, signaling the start of a new bullish trend. The analyst shared the following Ethereum daily chart, which shows the cryptocurrency on the verge of a potential breakout, with its next major resistance at the $3,700 level. A successful breakout and retest of this level could set the stage for a new all-time high (ATH). Fellow crypto analyst Crypto GEMs also pointed toward Ethereum getting ready for a significant move to the upside. The analyst shared the following chart which compares ETH’s price action in 2025 to that in 2024. If Ethereum mirrors its 2024 performance, it could break above the $3,000 mark in the near term. However, not all analysts share this bullish outlook. For instance, noted crypto analyst Carl Moon shared a four-hour Ethereum chart showing the asset trading within a rising wedge pattern. He cautioned that unless ETH breaks out of this formation, it may face a drop to $2,200. To explain, a rising wedge pattern is a bearish chart formation where price moves upward within converging trendlines, indicating weakening bullish momentum. It often signals an upcoming breakdown, as buyers lose control and sellers push the price lower after the wedge is breached. ETH Network Sees Renewed Activity In a separate X post, crypto analyst CryptoGoos remarked that daily transactions on Ethereum are nearing ATH level for the first time since 2021. Typically, heightened network activity tends to precede major price movements. Analyst Crypto Rover echoed this view, noting that active addresses across the Ethereum network have hit a new all-time high. They added that ETH below $3,000 is “an absolute steal.” Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross On Daily Chart – Is A New ATH Within Reach? Meanwhile, Ethereum liquid staking is also inching toward historic levels, with 35.5 million ETH now locked. At press time, ETH trades at $2,522, down 3.8% in the past 24 hours.
