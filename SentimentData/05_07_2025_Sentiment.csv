Investors are moving out of saturated meme tokens and back into assets with clearer narratives and forward-looking momentum. XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE are two names that keep surfacing on analyst dashboards—each for very different reasons, yet both riding a wave of renewed interest. Why Analysts Are Backing MAGACOIN FINANCE for 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE, now in Stage 3 of its rollout, has surpassed millions in funding across its early stages. The project stands out for its capped supply (170 billion tokens), zero-tax design, and smart contract audit by HashEx. But the bigger story lies in how it’s positioning itself—not just as another meme token, but as a commentary on power, decentralization, and community control. Analysts have noted its early-stage similarities to Dogecoin’s community roots, but without the infinite supply and loosely defined direction. Instead, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers something sharper: cultural positioning mixed with transparent rollout mechanics and no venture capital ownership. It’s this blend of structure and narrative that has prompted some desks to frame MAGACOIN FINANCE as the “XRP of the memecoin sector.” While XRP builds utility through institutions, MAGACOIN FINANCE leans on social ideology—yet both are pushing toward longevity, not just short-term pumps. XRP Clears Room for MAGACOIN FINANCE XRP, long a symbol of institutional crypto, is benefiting from the thaw in regulatory tensions and rising odds of ETF approval. Its settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year cleared a major hurdle, making it more accessible to funds, treasuries, and retail platforms. With Bloomberg analysts now placing XRP ETF approval odds above 90%, the token is drawing significant inflows, even as the broader market shows signs of fatigue. But this attention isn’t confined to legacy altcoins. It’s also spilling over into a new class of assets built on narrative and ideology. At the center of that shift is MAGACOIN FINANCE—a decentralized political memecoin that’s gaining ground as older meme coins slow down. DOGE and SHIB Cool Off as Traders Hunt Fresh Momentum Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, once unstoppable, are now retracing. DOGE is down nearly 50% year-to-date, with SHIB following a similar trendline. Neither token has introduced major protocol upgrades or ecosystem shifts in recent months, leaving traders to weigh opportunity cost. As capital exits from these positions, attention is turning toward meme assets that still feel early—and MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing that momentum. Its community has grown steadily across social platforms, and discussion around future exchange listings is building. While DOGE and SHIB remain cultural staples, they’re no longer driving portfolio gains. Instead, they’re digesting previous highs while newer entrants take their place in the spotlight. Bottom Line: New Cycle, New Contenders XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE represent different ends of the crypto spectrum—one institutional, the other ideological. But both are demonstrating staying power in a market that’s actively sorting substance from noise. With ETFs, audits, community growth, and clear narratives, they’ve emerged as assets that can carry into the next cycle. DOGE and SHIB aren’t gone—but their roles are shifting. No longer the face of momentum trades, they’re watching from the sidelines as newer, sharper projects take the lead.

Meanwhile, SRM Entertainment completes its historic $100 million TRX treasury launch , staking 365 million tokens with a 10% annual yield, targeting corporate balance sheet adoption. A strong technical foundation emerges with the price above the 20-day ( $0.2764 ), 50-day ( $0.2671 ), 100-day ( $0.2566 ), and 200-day ( $0.2392 ) EMAs, as institutional treasury strategies drive unprecedented corporate adoption. Source: Cryptonews The market cap reaches $26.89 billion, with a steady daily volume of $477.09 million supporting structural consolidation momentum. The following analysis synthesizes ChatGPT’s 42 real-time technical indicators, corporate treasury developments, institutional adoption metrics, and ecosystem growth data to assess TRX’s 90-day price trajectory amid the emerging altcoin treasury movement. Technical Foundation: Bullish Structure Above All EMAs TRON’s current price of $0.2834 reflects a decline of -1.25% from its opening price of $0.2870 , establishing a tight trading range between $0.2880 (high) and $0.2812 (low). This controlled volatility demonstrates uptrend stability within established parameters. RSI at 58.54 remains in healthy bullish territory, with substantial room for continued appreciation without concerns of overbought conditions. Source: TradingView MACD indicators show early bullish development, with the MACD line at 0.0008 trading above zero, confirming a positive momentum direction. The positive histogram at 0.0007 suggests building momentum acceleration, despite a slight signal line divergence. The exceptional technical strength stems from its price positioning above all major EMAs, a rare bullish alignment that indicates a robust trend structure. Trading above the 20-day EMA ( $0.2752 ), 50-day EMA ( $0.2709 ), 100-day EMA ( $0.2623 ), and 200-day EMA ( $0.2454 ) creates multiple support levels confirming sustained uptrend validity. Corporate Treasury Shift: $100M TRX Staking Strategy SRM Entertainment has achieved a major milestone, completing its $100 million TRON treasury launch by staking 365 million TRX tokens through the JustLend protocol, targeting an annual return of 10%. SRM Entertainment, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRM) announced the completion of its $100 million TRON treasury strategy deployment. The company has staked 365,096,845 TRX on JustLend to earn up to 10% annualized returns, combining staking rewards and energy rental income.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 30, 2025 The treasury strategy combines staking yields with energy rental income, creating diversified return streams that appeal to corporate treasury managers seeking yield enhancement. SRM is also rebranding to Tron Inc. with Justin Sun as an advisor. SRM Entertainment’s unique business model extends beyond crypto, manufacturing souvenirs for Disney, Universal Studios, and Six Flags, demonstrating how mainstream corporations can integrate cryptocurrency treasury strategies. The company’s $150 million market valuation, following a 13.5% stock surge, validates investor approval of crypto treasury adoption. This development positions TRON alongside Ethereum, Solana, and XRP in the emerging altcoin treasury movement, where corporations diversify balance sheets beyond Bitcoin. The 10% yield potential substantially exceeds traditional corporate cash management returns, driving institutional interest. Historical Performance: Steady Recovery Building Momentum TRON’s 2025 price action exhibits remarkable stability compared to the broader cryptocurrency market’s volatility. January-March saw consistent trading ranges of $0.25 – $0.27 , establishing a strong base for current appreciation. April and May saw minor corrections to the $0.24–$0.25 levels, representing healthy consolidation that created accumulation opportunities without breaking the technical structure. June’s recovery to a $0.27 closing price established momentum continuation patterns that support current technical positioning. Current price action above $0.28 represents the extension of the established uptrend, with corporate treasury validation providing fundamental support for continued appreciation. Support & Resistance: EMA Stack Provides Multiple Safety Nets Immediate support emerges at today’s low around $0.2783 , reinforced by the strong 20-day EMA support at $0.2752 . This confluence creates an initial foundation for any short-term retracements during the current institutional positioning. The exceptional support structure extends across multiple EMA levels, including the 50-day EMA at $0.2709 , the 100-day EMA at $0.2623 , and the 200-day EMA at $0.2454 . This tiered support system provides multiple safety nets that appeal to risk-conscious institutional investors. Resistance begins at today’s high around $0.2829 , followed by the key psychological level at $0.2850–$0.2900 . Breaking above this zone would indicate acceleration toward major psychological resistance at $0.3000–$0.3100 . Strong resistance emerges at previous range highs around $0.3900–$0.4000 , representing the December 2024 all-time highs. Stablecoin Infrastructure: USDT Dominance Drives Utility TRON’s leadership in stablecoin settlements also creates sustainable demand drivers beyond speculative trading. The network processes five times more USDT transactions than Ethereum, demonstrating superior efficiency for institutional settlement needs. $USDT supply on #TRON has surpassed $80B, now representing over 50% of all circulating #USDT . This solidifies TRON’s position as the dominant stablecoin settlement layer. Track stablecoin flows with Glassnode: https://t.co/Lk7vkD8US6 pic.twitter.com/S6dfTYFhgz — glassnode (@glassnode) June 27, 2025 Daily transactions have nearly doubled since September 2023 , indicating accelerating adoption across both retail and institutional segments. Market Metrics: Steady Growth Supporting Corporate Adoption TRON maintains a $26.7 billion market capitalization with moderate 1.35% market dominance, positioning TRX as an established infrastructure rather than a speculative altcoin. The $434.17 million daily trading volume provides adequate liquidity for institutional participation. The circulating supply of 94.78 billion TRX represents a complete token distribution, eliminating concerns about supply overhang that affect other projects. This transparency appeals to corporate treasury managers requiring predictable tokenomics. The volume-to-market cap ratio of 1.46% indicates healthy trading activity without excessive speculation. Current pricing is 36% below December 2024 all-time highs, providing attractive entry points for institutional investors while maintaining substantial appreciation from 2017 lows. Social Sentiment: Corporate Validation Drives Community Optimism LunarCrush data reveals strong community engagement with a Galaxy Score of 50, indicating positive sentiment momentum. The 86% positive sentiment reflects the community’s enthusiasm for corporate treasury developments and technical performance. Social dominance of 0.6% with 337.94K total engagements demonstrates steady community interest without speculative excess. This balanced engagement profile supports sustainable appreciation rather than pump-and-dump patterns. Recent social themes focus on corporate treasury adoption, Nasdaq milestone achievements, and technical breakout potential. 90-Day TRX Price Forecast Corporate Treasury Expansion (Bull Case – 40% Probability) Additional corporate treasury adoptions following SRM’s success could drive appreciation toward $0.35–$0.40 , representing 24–42% upside. This scenario requires successful institutional onboarding and sustained yield generation from staking strategies. Technical targets include $0.30 psychological resistance, followed by $0.35 and $0.40 based on historical levels. Corporate treasury momentum could attract additional institutional interest, creating sustained demand above speculative patterns. Gradual Appreciation (Base Case – 45% Probability) Continued steady growth within the current uptrend channels could target $0.32–$0.35 over the next 90 days . This scenario reflects sustained technical momentum, albeit without a dramatic acceleration in corporate adoption. Support at the EMA structure between $0.2450 and $0.2750 would likely hold during normal consolidation periods. Volume maintaining current levels around 120–140 million TRX daily supports measured appreciation. Technical Correction (Bear Case – 15% Probability) Breaking below the 50-day EMA support at $0.2709 could trigger a correction toward $0.2450–$0.2600 . This scenario would require broader market weakness or disappointments in corporate treasury strategy. The strong EMA support structure limits downside risk, with the 200-day EMA at $0.2454 providing key long-term trend support. TRX Forecast: Infrastructure Excellence Meets Corporate Validation TRON’s positioning reflects the convergence of technical strength, corporate treasury validation, and infrastructure advantages in stablecoin settlements. The 42-signal analysis reveals a cryptocurrency positioned for institutional adoption beyond speculative trading. SRM Entertainment’s $100 million treasury launch sets a precedent for corporate TRX adoption through yield-generating strategies. Technical indicators confirm a bullish structure, with the price above all major EMAs, while RSI positioning and positive MACD development suggest that momentum is building. Current consolidation above $0.28 , with corporate validation, creates optimal positioning for accelerated institutional adoption. The combination of technical strength, yield generation potential, and infrastructure advantages positions TRX for sustained appreciation as corporate treasury strategies expand throughout 2025 .

47482546,https://cryptonews.com/?p=379067,1751668339,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/47482546.jpeg,"Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana and Cardano by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/gemini-ai-xrp-solana-cardano-price-predictions-2025/,"Google’s Gemini predicts that leading altcoins may find new price highs through the latter part of 2025. See, in the last 24 hours Bitcoin rose to $109,997, which put it just 1.6% short of beating its historic price peak of $111,814 on May 22. Clearly bulls are looking to recapture that ground fast, which bodes well for various other leading cryptocurrencies, since Bitcoin clearly sets the pace of growth for the rest of the industry. This persistent market optimism has led many to believe that the next bull cycle could eclipse the legendary 2021 bull market, with altcoins expected to chart unprecedented highs. Here are several digital assets that Gemini has identified as having strong growth potential in the coming months. XRP (Ripple): Google’s Gemini Expects a Smooth Doubling for This Global Payments Leader According to Gemini’s forecasts, Ripple’s XRP could reach $20 by late 2025—effectively increasing ninefold from its present price of around $2.23. This positive projection is driven by growing institutional integration, strengthened regulatory clarity, and speculation regarding a potential XRP spot ETF approval, which would broaden access to institutional and retail buyers. XRP continues to enjoy worldwide recognition for facilitating quick, low-cost, and compliant cross-border payments. In 2024, the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) lauded XRP for its effectiveness in facilitating instant international remittances without intermediaries. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! UN Endorses @Ripple and @StellarOrg as Cornerstones of New Global Payments Network! #XRP and #XLM will run the new financial system! pic.twitter.com/ufewexCKmR — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 13, 2024 A landmark U.S. court decision ruled that XRP’s retail sales did not constitute securities transactions, delivering a major setback to the SEC’s long-standing claims. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed in March that the protracted legal battle had finally concluded, removing a major obstacle and lifting market sentiment for XRP and the broader altcoin space. In the short term, resistance around $3 remains a key test. Should XRP surpass this barrier in the coming months, a move toward $5 (Gemini’s most conservative target) by year-end becomes increasingly feasible. However, getting to Gemini’s most ambitious target of $20 would require serious political developments, mainly a framework for regulating crypto in the US and a peaceful solution to the Middle East crisis. It’s also worth noting that XRP is clearly the best-performing coin among the projects with billionaire market caps. In the last 365 days, its price has risen 397% compared to Bitcoin’s meager 88%. Solana ($SOL): Gemini Projects This High-Throughput Blockchain Could More-Than-Treble by New Year Solana ($SOL) remains a formidable player in the smart contract ecosystem, second only to Ethereum in terms of decentralized application deployment and user activity. With its market cap now approaching $80.5 billion, SOL continues to attract developer interest and institutional funds. Speculation is mounting around the potential approval of a Solana spot ETF in the U.S., which could mirror the substantial capital inflows seen for Bitcoin and Ethereum after their ETF launches. Moreover, discussions of including SOL within a proposed U.S. digital asset reserve are enhancing its standing among large-scale investors. From a technical perspective, Solana has reversed its previous downtrend. After sliding from highs above $250 in January to lows near $100 in April, it recently broke out from a descending wedge pattern in early April—a formation typically viewed as bullish—and now trades for $150. Gemini’s projections place SOL at $500 by the end of 2025, up from its current trading price of around $150, more than tripling its value. A bullish summer could see SOL reaching $300, while a subsequent rise into the $500 range is considered well within reach. Some analysts even believe Solana can hit the the $1,000 milestone, but it would require the green light of US crypto legislation to catalyze such a big price movement. Cardano ($ADA): Google’s Gemini Predicts a Massive 10X Upsurge for This Smart Contract Pioneer Cardano ($ADA) was recently sighted in the crosshairs of US President Donald Trump, who took to his social media platform, Truth Social, to post a proposal to include ADA as part of a US Strategic Crypto Reserve strategy. Unlike Bitcoin, which the plan suggested the government could directly acquire, Cardano would be sourced exclusively via law enforcement seizures. Created by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano staked its reputation on a rigorous, research-driven development approach and emphasis on scalability and environmental sustainability. With a market valuation near $21 billion, ADA remains a key competitor to Ethereum and is closing in on rapidly growing blockchains like Solana. Gemini’s models suggest ADA could reach $5.66 by the end of this year—a near tenfold jump from its current level of $0.58. Technically, ADA has been consolidating within a descending wedge pattern since late 2024. A breakout above its $1.10 resistance could trigger a short-term rally toward $1.50. Under a strong bull market scenario, even Gemini’s most conservative upside target of around $3 could see ADA surpassing its previous all-time high of $3.09. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): Meme-Driven Layer-2 Solution Primed for a Breakout While Google’s Gemini excels in evaluating established assets, it may not fully account for the explosive potential of early-stage projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . This presale-phase, meme-inspired Layer-2 protocol merges viral marketing with technical innovation. Although $HYPER is not yet trading on major exchanges such as Gemini, its presale has already raised over $1.9 million, with early backers eyeing potential 10X returns post-launch. Leveraging Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) architecture, Bitcoin Hyper integrates smart contract capabilities into the Bitcoin ecosystem through its proprietary Layer-2 network. Its Canonical Bridge supports rapid and cost-efficient transactions alongside an expanding suite of DeFi and NFT functionalities. Recent security audits by Coinsult found no key vulnerabilities, enhancing investor confidence. The native $HYPER token powers governance, staking, fees, and access to its ecosystem, while staking yields currently reach as high as 408% APY.

DOGE is trading below all major EMAs with a massive 636.62M volume surge as it tests key support at the $0.155–$0.160 zone. Strong selling pressure emerges as the price falls below the 20-day EMA ( $0.16855 ), 50-day EMA ( $0.17932 ), 100-day EMA ( $0.19104 ), and 200-day EMA ( $0.20457 ), amid heightened political drama, introducing volatility. Source: Cryptonews The market cap stands at $24.33 billion , with an explosive 42.16% volume surge to $908.02 million , validating institutional repositioning during periods of uncertainty. The following analysis synthesizes ChatGPT’s 42 real-time technical indicators, political developments, sentiment metrics, and technical patterns to assess DOGE’s 90-day trajectory amid escalating political tensions and chart pattern formations. Technical Breakdown: Bearish Structure Dominates All Timeframes Dogecoin’s current price of $0.16241 reflects a major 5.58% daily decline from its opening price of $0.17201, establishing a concerning trading range between $0.17296 (high) and $0.16128 (low). This $0.01168 intraday spread indicates high volatility during periods of political uncertainty. Source: TradingView RSI at 43.57 approaches oversold territory without reaching extreme levels, indicating balanced momentum despite intense selling pressure. This positioning suggests DOGE remains vulnerable to further declines without immediate reversal signals from technical indicators. MACD indicators display conflicting readings with the MACD line at 0.00176 , trading slightly above zero, which suggests underlying bullish momentum. However, the negative histogram at -0.00733 indicates strong bearish momentum divergence requiring careful monitoring for breakdown cues. Source: TradingView Political Drama Impact: Musk-Trump Tensions Drive Volatility The political feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has introduced volatility to DOGE, with speculation surrounding the DOGE agency creating uncertainty among investors. This political drama represents a departure from traditional meme-driven rallies, introducing systematic risk to DOGE’s price action. Donald Trump on whether or not he’ll deport Elon Musk amid their feud: “I don’t know. We’ll have to take a look. We may have to put DOGE on Elon, You know what DOGE is? DOGE is the monster that might have to go back and eat Elon.” pic.twitter.com/eO4FB0QTTh — Pop Base (@PopBase) July 1, 2025 Elon Musk’s speculation about a new American party has generated increased attention for potential meme coin boom scenarios, although current political tensions have overshadowed these bullish narratives.

Time for a new political party that actually cares about the people. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 30, 2025 The timing of political developments coincides with technical breakdown patterns, amplifying downward pressure. Ascending Triangle Formation: Bulls Maintain Hope Despite Breakdown Technical analysts identify a large ascending triangle pattern on weekly charts, representing a classic bullish structure despite current price weakness. The pattern shows DOGE holding trendline support around $0.17 , though the recent breakdown challenges this bullish thesis. $DOGE Weekly Chart Update $DOGE is forming a large ascending triangle pattern on the weekly — a classic bullish structure!

This pattern typically resolves with upward breakouts, though current political tensions complicate traditional technical analysis assumptions. Source: TradingView Multiple bounces off key support zones indicate institutional interest in DOGE accumulation during periods of weakness, although the recent breakdown below triangle support raises questions about the pattern’s validity. The next few weeks will be key in determining whether bulls can reclaim triangle support or bears continue driving prices lower. Historical Context: Sharp Correction from January Highs DOGE’s 2025 performance exhibits extreme volatility following January’s strong close at $0.33 , representing the local high for the year. The subsequent correction to February’s $0.20 and stabilization around $0.17 in March and April established the current trading ranges. May’s modest recovery to $0.19, followed by June’s decline to $0.16, demonstrates DOGE’s inability to sustain momentum without major catalysts. Current price action represents the continuation of the correction cycle that began after January’s peak performance. The 51% decline from January highs to current levels reflects DOGE’s high-beta nature and sensitivity to sentiment shifts. This historical context provides perspective on current weaknesses while highlighting DOGE’s potential for dramatic reversals during periods of positive catalysts. Support & Resistance: Key Levels Define Next Direction Immediate support emerges at today’s low of around $0.16128 , reinforced by the key support zone at $0.15500-$0.16000 . This confluence represents the most significant technical level for determining DOGE’s near-term direction and potential for deeper correction. Major support zones extend from $0.14000 to $0.15000, representing historical accumulation levels, followed by strong support from $0.12000 to $0.13000, corresponding to previous cycle lows. These levels provide multiple safety nets during extended correction scenarios. #Dogecoin is at the third touchpoint of an ascending channel, making it the ideal buy level before a huge surge $Doge /M1 pic.twitter.com/ZiYlzKPAaG — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) July 4, 2025 Resistance begins immediately at the 20-day EMA, located at $0.16855 , representing the first hurdle for any potential recovery attempts. The key resistance cluster lies between the 50-day EMA ( $0.17932 ) and the 100-day EMA ( $0.19104 ), creating a challenging overhead supply. Market Metrics: High Volume Confirms Selling Pressure DOGE maintains a $24.33 billion market capitalization with an exceptional 24-hour trading volume of $908.02 million , representing a massive 42.16% surge. The volume-to-market cap ratio of 3.74% suggests intense selling pressure during periods of political uncertainty. The high volume surge to 636.62M DOGE confirms institutional repositioning during breakdown attempts, validating technical analysis rather than suggesting accumulation. This volume pattern supports a bearish interpretation of current price action. Source: CoinMarketCap Current pricing represents a 78% discount to the all-time highs achieved in 2021 , although comparison to recent highs shows a 51% decline from the January 2025 peaks. This positioning provides long-term value arguments while acknowledging significant technical damage. Social Sentiment: Community Optimism Fights Technical Reality LunarCrush data reveals resilient community engagement with 83% positive sentiment despite recent price weakness. The social dominance of 2.95% with 2.71 million total engagements demonstrates DOGE’s ability to maintain attention during correction periods. Recent social themes have focused on ascending triangle formations, accumulation opportunities, and long-term bullish scenarios targeting the $1 level. The prophecy: $1 $DOGE pic.twitter.com/SESlJ33hMT — Chimp of the North (@cryptochimpanz) July 4, 2025 Community discussions emphasize technical patterns while acknowledging the short-term political headwinds that affect price action. The disconnect between social sentiment ( 83% positive) and technical indicators (bearish) represents typical DOGE community behavior during correction periods. This resilient sentiment provides fundamental support for eventual recovery scenarios. 90-Day DOGE Price Forecast Political Resolution Rally (Bull Case – 30% Probability) Resolution of Musk-Trump political tensions, combined with a breakout from an ascending triangle, could drive the recovery toward $0.25–$0.29 , representing a 54–79% upside. This scenario requires political clarity and successful defense of $0.155–$0.160 support zone with volume confirmation. Source: TradingView Technical targets include $0.20 , $0.25 , and $0.29 based on triangle pattern measurements and historical resistance levels. The meme coin narrative could resurface strongly if political uncertainties resolve favorably for DOGE-related speculation. Extended Correction (Base Case – 50% Probability) Continued political uncertainty and technical breakdown could drive DOGE toward $0.12–$0.14 , representing a 14–26% downside. This scenario assumes ongoing political tensions and failure to hold key support levels during summer trading periods. Source: TradingView Support at $0.155–$0.160 would likely fail during an extended correction, with volume normalizing around 400–500 million DOGE daily. This sideways-to-downward action provides better accumulation opportunities for long-term holders seeking lower entry points. Deep Correction (Bear Case – 20% Probability) Severe political escalation or broader market weakness could trigger a correction toward $0.10–$0.12 , representing a 26–38% downside. This scenario would require strong negative catalysts beyond current political tensions. Source: TradingView The strong community sentiment and meme coin resilience limit extreme downside scenarios, with major support at $0.12–$0.13 providing key long-term trend support for future recovery cycles. DOGE Forecast: Political Drama Meets Technical Breakdown DOGE’s current positioning reflects the convergence of political uncertainty, technical breakdown, and community resilience. The 42-signal analysis reveals that the cryptocurrency is positioned at a key juncture between pattern continuation and a major correction. Current consolidation around $0.16 with critical support at $0.155 – $0.160 creates a decision point for DOGE’s trajectory. The combination of political drama, technical weakness, and community optimism positions DOGE for volatile price action as catalysts develop throughout Q3 2025 .

As optimism for the future of digital currencies gains momentum, three standout ventures are leading the discussion. This article reveals which tokens are poised for substantial growth and why they are generating so much buzz. Hyperliquid Gains Soar Amid Key Price Levels and Momentum Hyperliquid showed steady gains with a weekly change of 8.21% and a monthly gain of 7.47%. Over the last six months, the coin surged by 54.82%, reflecting a robust upward movement. Price action during these periods reveals an asset building momentum while recovering from lower levels, indicating increasing trader confidence. The current trading range shows levels migrating between $31.70 and $46.60, demonstrating a balanced market dynamic. Bulls maintain the upper hand as the coin trades above the nearest support at $23.85, while buyers challenge resistance at $53.65. A second layer of resistance at $68.55 and support at $8.95 provide reference points for traders. Market indicators portray a nearly neutral trend with the RSI at 53.42 slightly favoring bullish momentum. Traders may consider accumulating positions near support levels while monitoring for movements above resistance, which could signal higher targets. A cautious approach is advisable if price action moves toward the lower bound, as slipping below $23.85 may trigger a bearish correction. AVAX Recent Swings and Key Levels to Watch AVAX experienced mixed price movements recently, with a weekly increase of about 5.7% followed by a monthly drop of around 13.84%. Over the past six months, the coin declined nearly 57.31%, indicating cautious trading and heightened selling pressure. The price action in the last month shows the market struggled to maintain upward momentum, with investors reacting to broader market concerns. The significant six-month decline underscores a prolonged period of downward pressure affecting trader sentiment and valuation. Price volatility and frequent adjustments have shaped AVAX’s trajectory, with investors closely monitoring temporary gains amidst an overall bearish backdrop. At present, AVAX is trading in a range between $14.82 and $21.92, with key support at $11.69 and resistance near $25.89. Current indicators, such as the Awesome Oscillator at -0.885 and a Momentum Indicator near -0.014, suggest a slight leaning toward sellers. The RSI at 46.86 implies that pressure is building on the downside, despite recent weekly gains indicating a hint of recovery. Bears are currently dominant due to the lack of a sustained upward trend, yet bulls may find opportunities if prices bounce off support. A move above $25.89 could push prices toward the next resistance at $32.99, while a slip below $11.69 may lead to drops toward $4.59. Trading within these levels suggests buying at lower extremes and potential short positions near resistance, making tighter stop-loss management advisable. Toncoin: Recent Sell-off and Key Levels to Watch Toncoin experienced a notable downtrend over the past six months, with its price dropping nearly 50.82%. In the last month, the coin’s price fell about 11.47%, indicating continued bearish pressure in the market. The trading range has been volatile, with small weekly gains of 0.04% failing to reverse the larger downward momentum. The coin's struggle to regain upward strength reflects overall weakness and uncertainty in recent sessions. Currently, Toncoin trades between $2.55 and $3.34, with immediate resistance near $3.76 and support around $2.18. Additional barriers are noted at $4.56 on the upside and $1.39 on the downside. Key indicators, including an Awesome Oscillator at -0.139 and an RSI of 42.08, highlight a lingering bearish bias. Without a clear trend, traders might look for buying opportunities near support levels or consider short plays if the price fails to break resistance. Observing price action within these levels is crucial for short-term strategies. Conclusion HYPE , AVAX , and TON are gaining traction in the crypto sector. These projects are starting to define the future of the industry. They offer fresh possibilities and innovative solutions. Each one brings unique features and potential. This prominence suggests promising developments ahead. These projects are not just trends but pivotal players. They indicate a more robust direction for the sector. Expectations are high for what they will achieve next. The conversation around them reflects the growing optimism. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

47484438,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=783458,1751670001,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/47484438.jpeg,"Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 As Analyst Calls It A ‘Powder Keg’",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-price-targets-3000/,"The Ethereum price is flashing major upside signals as on-chain and market activity align toward a potential breakout to the $3,000 level. With crypto exchange balances falling to their lowest in nine years, stablecoin rails hitting record highs, and Spot Ethereum ETF inflows spiking last month, analysts now describe ETH as a “powder keg” primed for explosive movement. Ethereum Price Eyes A $3,300 Breakout The Ethereum price action is drawing attention as it continues to trade within a well-defined consolidation range, hovering near $2,555 at the time of writing. Based on a recently released technical analysis by crypto analyst Pentoshi on X social media, ETH could be on the verge of a significant move, with $3,300 marked as the next bullish target in the near term. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts $10,000 ATH For Ethereum This Cycle, Here’s Why The crypto expert’s chart reveals that since early May 2025, Ethereum has been locked between two key levels—a support zone around $2,190 and resistance near $2,750. This range has remained intact for over eight weeks, signaling a period of accumulation and low volatility after the sharp decline experienced in the first quarter of the year. Pentoshi has pinpointed $2,100 as the key downside risk in his bullish outlook, aligning closely with the lower support zone marked on the chart. While the next bullish extension and major resistance level has been identified as $3,300, the analyst expects Ethereum to make a move toward this price level within the next three months. He suggests that the current setup offers a favorable risk-reward profile, estimating a potential upside of roughly 3.2x compared to the downside risk. Analyst Calls Ethereum A “Powder Keg” In other news, Eric Conner refers to Ethereum as a “powder keg,” highlighting a growing convergence of fundamental factors that are building up pressure and positioning the cryptocurrency for a potentially parabolic move in the market. Related Reading: The Ethereum Waiting Game: Breakout To $2,800 Or Crash To $2,000? The analyst reports that Stablecoin activity on Ethereum has reached historic highs, with the total market capitalization of on-chain dollar-denominated assets hitting $251 billion—a record that also marks 21 consecutive months of uninterrupted growth. In parallel, Ethereum Spot ETFs have brought in $1.17 billion in net inflows during June alone, marking a major shift in investors’ appetite for ETH exposure. Even more notable, the amount of Ethereum available for trading is now at its lowest level in nearly a decade, with only nine million ETH tokens on centralized crypto exchanges. This nine-year low in exchange balances signals a drying float, where any fresh demand has an outsized impact on price. Conner has stated that large-scale crypto investors are beginning to take note. He reports that wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH have accumulated more than 800,000 tokens daily during the peak week in June, marking the most aggressive absorption by whales since 2017. Currently, price action mirrors tension, and the analyst warns that if Ethereum decisively clears the $2,600 resistance level, the combination of supply scarcity, ETF-driven demand, and explosive stablecoin usage could unleash a violent and rapid breakout.

The latest example is a major partnership with Major League Rugby’s Seattle Seawolves. As of July, BlockDAG (BDAG) is now the Official Blockchain Partner of the Seawolves for the 2025 season. This marks a step toward blending Web3 tools with how fans enjoy sports. The Seattle Seawolves, founded in 2017, are two-time MLR champions and one of the league’s original teams. Known for strong play and loyal support, they stand for discipline, strength, and teamwork. These same values reflect BlockDAG’s aim to build better digital systems and strong user communities. But this deal isn’t just about branding. It shows a shift where blockchain becomes something fans can see and use. From ownership to digital access, this is a new way for fans to connect with their team. Bringing Fans Closer With Digital Access A key part of the BlockDAG-Seawolves deal is the use of blockchain tools like NFTs and fan tokens. These are not just digital items to collect. They open doors to real fan moments. Fans will be able to trade digital keepsakes, take part in team polls, and view premium content. From owning a key match moment as an NFT to joining special Q&As with players, fans now have new ways to stay connected to their team. Nicolaas van den Bergh, Chief Marketing Officer at BlockDAG, shared: “This partnership helps reshape fan experiences by building stronger ties through trust, creativity, and shared digital moments.” Stories, Content, and Inside Views The partnership also includes a co-branded content series shared on Seawolves’ official pages each month. These videos and posts will include game clips, fan input, interviews, and match polls. All of it aims to grow the team’s digital fan world and bring fans closer to the action. There will also be personal content led by players, giving fans a closer look at the behind-the-scenes life. From practice to game-day rituals, these stories are meant to create real bonds between the team and its supporters. This approach fits well with BlockDAG’s larger goals. For BlockDAG, building in Web3 is not only about tech. It’s about giving people ways to join in, be part of the story, and help shape the experience. A New Chapter in Sports and Digital Connection Shane Skinner, CEO of the Seattle Seawolves, shared his thoughts on the new partnership: “We are thrilled to partner with a leading blockchain innovator like BlockDAG to deliver immersive, digital-first experiences to our passionate fanbase.” His comment shows the deeper goal behind the partnership. The Seawolves are not using blockchain just for hype. They aim to improve how fans connect with the team and create lasting loyalty in a digital space. From BlockDAG’s side, sports offer a clear path to connect with more people. With over 200,000 BDAG holders and a crypto presale that has passed $329.5 million, the platform is growing from a focus on tech tools to building its presence in culture and trust among fans. The Seawolves collaboration is one of two major sports deals BlockDAG revealed in July. The other is with the Seattle Orcas, a cricket team in Major League Cricket. These two moves highlight a plan to reach new groups of people, from rugby followers in North America to cricket fans across the world. More Than a Deal, It’s a Direction The BlockDAG-Seawolves partnership is more than just a single news update. It shows where Web3 could go next. Sports bring people together. They carry emotion, community, and now, with help from blockchain, the chance for fans to play a more active digital role. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release coming on August 11 and BDAG coins still available at a set price of $0.0016, BlockDAG is showing signs of growing far beyond early crypto circles. It’s stepping into real-life places, from sports arenas to fan screens. For those who follow the Seawolves, this could be a fresh way to enjoy the game. For the larger crypto space, it sends a strong message: BlockDAG is not just building a network. It’s helping shape how people share, connect, and experience sports in a digital age.

Our Jito price prediction expects the JTO price to record a maximum of $8.56 in 2025. In 2030, we expect the JTO price to achieve $57.27. In December 2023, the Jito (JTO) token airdrop garnered significant attention for the Solana blockchain , which had been facing challenging times. The event also highlighted the importance of liquid staking on Solana while empowering holders to influence platform governance. Based on these developments, we’ve compiled our Jito price prediction, explored the factors behind these forecasts, and provided insights into the role and utility of the JTO token.

JTO/USDT Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and currently hovers around the 47 level, showing that bears control price momentum. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours.

The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the JITO price from an immediate surge. However, if the JITO price successfully breaks above $2.257, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $2.545. JTO/USDT Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, JITO price may drop below the immediate support line at $1.88, resulting in a correction to $1.557. Is Jito a good investment? For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network’s largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2025 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Why is the JTO down today? JTO’s price gained strong selling pressure around local highs, resulting in a strong decline. This created a push below $2. Will the JTO price recover? If buyers hold above the $2 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will JTO reach $10? JTO price might reach the $10 mark in 2025 if buying demand surges and Jito attracts altcoin investors. However, our JTO price prediction states it might reach the $10 level by 2026. Will the JTO price reach $100? Due to the effort of the Solana community, JITO Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment. Recent news/ Opinion on JTO news SOL Strategies has announced the launch of a new initiative to support critical infrastructure within the Solana ecosystem. The Canada-based public company revealed on June 26 that it has established a Strategic Ecosystem Reserve (SER), starting with a purchase of over 52,000 Jito (JTO) tokens, valued at more than $100,000. Jito price prediction July 2025 Over the last few days, JTO coin prices have aimed to surge above crucial Fib levels. If the BTC price aims for a hold above $110K this month, we might see a solid surge in the JTO price. According to technical analysis, the JTO price might record a maximum level of $2.9 and a minimum of $1.3, with an average value of $2.1 throughout July. Jito price prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high Jito Price Prediction July 2025 $1.3 $2.1 $2.9 Jito price prediction 2025 According to JTO tokenomics, additional Jito tokens will be released at the start of 2025 and will continue throughout the year. This increase is likely to exert downward pressure on the value of Jito crypto. However, 2025 is also expected to showcase the significant impact of the Bitcoin Halving, which could propel crypto markets and tokens to new all-time highs, potentially boosting the Jito token price. A comprehensive technical analysis of past pricing trends suggests that in 2025, Jito is anticipated to have a minimum price of $1.1. Its maximum price could reach $8.56, with an expected average trading value of $7.34.

Unlike many meme coins that rely purely on hype, it’s positioning itself a bit differently—mixing familiar meme energy with a pointed political angle and a zero-tax setup. That’s helped it catch the eye of investors who care about more than just quick flips. It brings together aspects of Dogecoin and SHIBA INU, but with a clearer ideological stance, which broadens its appeal. From casual meme fans to people who appreciate decentralized projects like Ethereum and Cardano, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing a diverse crowd. At this stage, its long-term path looks likely to depend on whether it can keep that community engaged as the market continues to shift. Community Still the Driving Force for MAGACOIN FINANCE Amid all these big institutional moves and network upgrades, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to stand out for a simpler reason: steady community momentum. Conversations on social media platforms and crypto forums have kept picking up, largely thanks to its decentralized governance model and unmistakable political branding. While it gets compared to the early days of Dogecoin and SHIBA INU, MAGACOIN FINANCE sets itself apart by putting ideology and a community-led structure at its core. As the broader altcoin world adjusts to new regulations and tech developments, this authentic, bottom-up energy could be its biggest strength. Solana’s First Staking ETF Could Open New Doors Over in the broader altcoin market, Solana is about to mark a milestone. On July 2, the REX-Osprey SOL+Staking ETF is set to launch, making it the first U.S.-listed ETF that combines direct Solana exposure with on-chain staking rewards. That means traditional investors can now access staking income alongside typical price movements, which could be a pretty compelling option. Analysts generally view this as a step forward that may encourage more institutional players to become involved with altcoins. Some projections for SEC approval of a straightforward spot Solana ETF by 2025 are now as high as 95%. This could also set the stage for similar products tied to networks like XRP and Litecoin. Still, not everyone’s jumping in headfirst. There are concerns about Solana’s ongoing unlock schedules and lighter network usage at present, which may keep larger investors on the sidelines in the near term. Polygon (MATIC) Navigates an Important—and Tricky—Upgrade Polygon is also going through a big moment with its upgrade to Polygon 2.0, which means moving from the old MATIC token over to the new POL asset. It’s a complex process, highlighted by Binance having to temporarily pause MATIC deposits and withdrawals on July 1. For now, MATIC is running into some resistance on the charts. Looking ahead, most forecasts for 2025 suggest a moderate upside, generally clustering around $0.27 to $0.29, while more optimistic views point closer to $0.47. However, much of that hinges on how smoothly this transition unfolds and whether Polygon can continue to expand its reach across DeFi, NFTs, and scaling solutions. The Takeaway: MAGACOIN FINANCE Stays the Course as Altcoins Shift As Solana rolls out its first staking ETF and Polygon pushes through a critical upgrade—plus MATIC testing resistance—the altcoin market is evolving. Through all of this, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out its own lane by blending meme appeal with political messaging and a community-first approach. It’ll be worth watching how this mix plays out as the next chapter for decentralized, culturally driven crypto projects unfolds.

This surge sets the stage for other digital currencies to shine. Discover the top three altcoins poised for significant growth, ready to ride the wave of Bitcoin's impressive rally. Find out which coins are primed to take off next. SUI Price Recap: Past Weakness Followed by Recent Rally SUI experienced a 9.55% decline over the past month and a steep 44.39% drop over the last six months. A recent surge saw a 12.94% gain in the past week, indicating a brief recovery amid ongoing uncertainty. The price performance shows marked volatility, reflecting shifting market sentiment and periods of bearish pressure following significant downturns. The current trading range is between $2.19 and $3.48, with immediate resistance at $4.19 and support found at $1.59. Technical indicators present a mixed picture; momentum is modest, and the RSI hovers around 50, suggesting balance after the recent bounce, while other measures indicate lingering weakness. Bulls have gained recently, but the trend remains unclear. Traders might consider waiting near support levels for opportunities to buy, while sellers could target resistance levels. Cosmos (ATOM) Price Trends and Key Trading Levels Cosmos experienced a 7.5% drop over the past month and a steep decline of nearly 44% over the last six months. Price action over the past week showed a modest gain of about 4.8%, highlighting a coin that has struggled to maintain upward momentum. Overall, the trend points to ongoing weakness, with historical price behavior indicating a longer-term bearish sentiment. Despite the brief recovery, challenges remain in reversing the downturn, leaving investors cautious about future movement. The current trading band for Cosmos rests between $3.56 and $4.63. Immediate support is positioned at $3.03, with resistance at $5.16. The relative strength index around 48.51 reflects a balance between buying and selling pressures, though negative readings from momentum measures suggest bears remain dominant. The recent uptick hasn't significantly shifted the trend, prompting traders to watch for a potential bounce near support or a breakout at resistance as market conditions evolve. Ethena (ENA) Price Snapshot: Past Performance and Current Levels Over the past month, ETHENA experienced a notable drop of 22.18% from its price levels, while a one-week uptick of 5.04% offered a brief glimpse of recovery. Over the last six months, the coin suffered a steep decline of 78.64%. Price movements ranged between $0.2011 and $0.3549, marking clear volatility. Data shows that ETHENA’s performance has been considerably downbeat, emphasizing the impact of bearish market influences and investor caution. Currently, the coin trades within a range that sets a strong support at $0.13 and offers a nearest resistance of $0.44, with a second resistance level at $0.59. Trading decisions depend on whether bulls can push the price above these resistance areas or if bears will keep the coin anchored near its low points. The momentum indicator sits very low at -0.0049, suggesting bears dominate given the falling moving average. Traders might consider short-term buying opportunities near the support level or betting on a break above the $0.44 resistance. Conclusion As Bitcoin crosses the $110k mark, attention now shifts to other promising coins. SUI , known for its strong community and unique features, is expected to gain traction. ATOM shows potential due to its interoperability between different blockchains. ENA , with its innovative technology, could also see significant growth. These altcoins are positioned to perform well in the coming days. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently announced that the company submitted its application to the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), signaling Ripple’s intention to operate under both federal and state oversight. Already holding a BitLicense from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), Ripple’s potential federal charter would place it under more comprehensive regulatory supervision. According to Garlinghouse, the goal is to enhance public and institutional trust. Direct Access to the Federal Reserve In addition to its OCC application, Ripple is also pursuing a master account with the Federal Reserve through its subsidiary , Standard Custody. If approved, this account would allow Ripple to hold reserves for RLUSD directly with the central bank. Such access could provide Ripple with a substantial advantage, offering enhanced transparency and security for stablecoin holders. True to our long-standing compliance roots, @Ripple is applying for a national bank charter from the OCC. If approved, we would have both state (via NYDFS) and federal oversight, a new (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market. Earlier in the week via… https://t.co/IdiR7x3eWZ — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) July 2, 2025 This level of direct integration with the Federal Reserve would set RLUSD apart from most stablecoins on the market, aligning it more closely with financial institutions that prioritize regulatory clarity and central bank engagement. Implications for XRP and RLUSD Ripple’s regulatory push has sparked discussion within the crypto community, especially regarding its potential impact on the utility and value of XRP. A prominent analyst, known as “XRP Investing,” suggested that with federal approval and Fed access, Ripple could be seen as operating on par with traditional banking giants like JPMorgan. He argued that RLUSD would become significantly more credible under this framework, and XRP could be increasingly adopted for international settlements. This sentiment reflects broader expectations that institutional players are more likely to engage with digital assets that operate under strict compliance regimes and central bank connectivity. Assessing XRP’s Price Potential To estimate XRP’s possible future valuation under various scenarios, ChatGPT was asked to model several assumptions. One approach evaluates XRP’s role in facilitating global payments. If Ripple captures 10% of SWIFT’s estimated $150 trillion annual volume, and XRP is used with a turnover rate of 25, the total required liquidity would be around $600 billion. With approximately 55 billion XRP tokens in circulation, this results in a baseline valuation near $10.91 per coin, assuming purely utility-based demand. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another perspective considers XRP’s use in supporting RLUSD’s transaction volume. If RLUSD grows to match USDC’s $32 billion market cap and XRP bridges half of its $100 billion in yearly transfers with a turnover rate of 20, $5 billion in XRP liquidity would be needed. Given full regulatory oversight from both the OCC and NYDFS, plus direct Fed access, a strong trust premium could apply, projecting XRP’s price to approximately $13.65. Ripple’s ambitions also extend into facilitating the transfer of tokenized real-world assets, such as bonds and real estate. With the tokenization market expected to reach over $16 trillion by 2030, Ripple capturing even a small share could require XRP to support large transaction volumes. If 3% of that market is routed through Ripple and XRP manages a quarter of that on-chain, the liquidity need could hit $120 billion. Accounting for speculative and institutional demand, this model suggests a potential price of about $21.80 per token. A final valuation scenario relies on projected transaction activity. If XRP processes $30 billion in daily settlement volume once adopted by banks, and the market applies a Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio typical of high-utility blockchains (25–30), the total implied market cap could approach $900 billion. Divided by the current supply, XRP’s estimated value would fall around $16.36. While all projections remain speculative, they demonstrate the possible valuation range for XRP if Ripple achieves full regulatory integration and expands its role in institutional finance. Approval of a national bank charter, combined with access to a Federal Reserve master account, would not only enhance RLUSD’s stability but also position XRP as a credible bridge asset in global financial systems.

Yet this massive pool of paper gains cuts both ways, signaling both strong bullish sentiment and a latent risk of sudden sell pressure. Bitcoin’s rally above $107,000 raised unrealized profits to around $1.2 trillion. Source: Glassnode Investors are HODLing on to their Bitcoins Despite the theoretical windfall, BTC investors have demonstrated notable restraint. Data shows that realized profits are declining, long-term holder supply has reached new highs, and selling pressure from short-term holders has eased. This mix of massive unrealized gains and cautious behavior is representative of the market’s current dynamics. Bitcoin recently saw a sell-off to about $99,000 prompted by geopolitical tension between Israel and Iran. Yet, prices rebounded to $107,000 after a cease-fire, with support emerging near the $98,300 cost basis of short-term holders—a level that analysts say consolidates the bullish narrative. Off-chain capital inflows from institutional sources, such as U.S. spot BTC ETFs , averaging $298 million per week, also bolster demand even as existing investors hold steady. The combination of patient holders and fresh institutional liquidity paints a picture of a deepening, mature market. However, the situation is precarious. While holding remains dominant, a shift in sentiment could unleash significant selling pressure. Analysts warn that current price levels are “insufficient to trigger significant profit-taking,” and note that the market may need to move higher (or lower) to unlock additional supply. History says pressure to sell is due Historical precedent amplifies the concern of wholesale profit-taking. CryptoQuant’s network unrealized profit/loss (NUPL) indicator has previously flashed sell signals when unrealized profits spiked, often ahead of market pullbacks. Similarly, previous reports note that long-term holders historically start spending and increasing sell-side pressure when their average unrealized gains reach around 350%, which reportedly happens near the $100,000 price zone. This suggests that rising prices could shift sentiment even among staunch holders, creating a feedback loop of profit-taking and price corrections. Despite these risks, the institutional cohort continues to strengthen Bitcoin’s market foundation. The Gemini‑Glassnode Q2 report shows over 30% of circulating BTC now resides in centralized entities, including ETFs, exchanges, custodians, and sovereign treasuries. Moreover, off-chain venues now account for over 75% of trading volume , signaling that price discovery is migrating toward regulated, institutional platforms. That’s a structural evolution that, while supporting liquidity, could also mean more organized and potentially sudden sell pressure from big stakeholders. Analysts continue to monitor the market Several analysts note that a meaningful price move, either surpassing the $110,000–$112,000 resistance or slipping below the recent $98,000–$99,000 support band, may be required to dislodge the market’s current equilibrium. As the market stands, Bitcoin’s $1.2 trillion in unrealized gains signals both its maturity and vulnerability. The enormous paper profits reflect investor confidence and institutional backing. At the same time, it signals a latent pool of potential selling fuel, one that could ignite if sentiment cracks or technical levels fail. For now, HODLing remains the dominant behavior, institutional inflows power momentum, and averages of realized profit and liveliness continue to decline.

On-chain data shows sustained negative exchange netflows of around 100,000 LINK per week, which indicates that whale entities are absorbing sell pressure without significant price disruption. LINK Faces Critical Test CryptoQuant stated that this trend contrasts with occasional retail-driven spikes, such as March 2025’s 5 million LINK deposit surge. Retail activity has stayed flat, as evidenced by the daily active addresses hovering between 28,000 and 32,000, while transaction counts remain stagnant at around 9,000 per day. Despite increased oracle utility, retail failed to capitalize on a minor activity bump seen in late 2024. Whale urgency is evident as exchange withdrawals peaked at 3,000 transactions per day in Q4 2024 and remain elevated, thereby steadily draining exchange reserves, which have fallen approximately 40% year-to-date. Neutral leverage metrics are preventing volatility and have allowed systematic accumulation without triggering a breakout above $15. A resolution to this deadlock will require a spike in retail participation to ignite momentum or a slowdown in whale withdrawals to weaken accumulation. Until a catalyst emerges, LINK’s structure matches Bitcoin’s 2023 consolidation phase before its surge in 2024. While this accumulation standoff continues on-chain, Chainlink has been expanding its broader ecosystem through partnerships. Collaborations With Mastercard and Visa Last month, the decentralized oracle network partnered with Mastercard to allow 3 billion cardholders to purchase crypto directly on-chain using fiat payments. The collaboration utilizes interoperability infrastructure and Mastercard’s global network to remove barriers to crypto access. Partners like Zerohash, Shift4, Swapper Finance, and XSwap support liquidity, compliance, and fiat-to-crypto conversion, bridging traditional payments with decentralized finance environments. Chainlink also completed a pilot under the HKMA’s e-HKD+ initiative with Visa, wherein the duo tested cross-border investment transactions using CBDCs and stablecoins. In the trial, ANZ’s AUD-backed stablecoin A$DC was converted into e-HKD and used to invest in a tokenized money market fund. Chainlink’s CCIP enabled asset transfers between ANZ’s private blockchain and Ethereum’s public testnet, while Visa’s VTAP managed the token lifecycle. The pilot demonstrated instant, compliant investment fund access, which reduced settlement times from days to just seconds, even on weekends.

LINK is stuck at a technical fork, with on-chain signals showing a cautious tone among whales. BONK, however, is picking up steam with a surge in trading volume and buyer activity. But BlockDAG (BDAG) ? It’s taking a bold route, slashing its presale entry price to just $0.0016, even as its batch 29 price hits $0.0276. This firm stance, tied to its upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11, is shaking up how crypto holders think about entry points. BlockDAG Freezes Presale at $0.0016 Ahead of GLOBAL LAUNCH Release BlockDAG has made a bold and strategic move by locking its presale price at $0.0016 ahead of its highly anticipated GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. This rare decision aims to shield retail participants from last-minute price jumps, giving them the same access as early buyers had. Despite the batch 29 price currently sitting at $0.0276, this limited-time pricing dramatically lowers the entry point and sets up buyers for stronger returns. With over 23.6 billion coins sold and $329.5 million already raised, BlockDAG’s presale is quickly becoming one of 2025’s headline crypto stories. The 2,660% ROI since batch 1 is already impressive, and the fixed $0.0016 price only boosts the potential upside. It’s no surprise that those tracking the best crypto for the 2025 bull run are zeroing in on BlockDAG, not just for its numbers, but for its calculated, user-focused approach. Rather than chasing volatile price swings, BlockDAG is dialing in stability. Freezing the price helps eliminate last-minute FOMO anxiety, giving new buyers a clear and confident way in. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release countdown now underway, BlockDAG isn’t just another presale; it’s shaping up as a well-timed opportunity for those planning ahead. BONK Price Update: Momentum Builds as Traders Target Resistance BONK is heating up. Trading volume jumped 98.33% to $160.5 million, and the buy-sell delta hit +127 billion tokens, hinting at strong accumulation. After bouncing off $0.000013, BONK touched $0.00001480 before settling near $0.00001446, showing that bulls are holding their ground. Open interest is also on the rise, up 6.68%, which adds weight to the idea that traders expect another leg up. Still, $0.000015 looms as a tough resistance. If BONK clears it, a stronger rally could follow. If not, a pullback to test lower supports may be next. Indicators show a slightly overbought setup, so short-term dips wouldn’t surprise anyone. But the volume and open interest growth point to growing confidence. That’s why BONK remains on watch as a high-energy play in this current price cycle. LINK Price Forecast at a Crossroads as Bulls and Bears Pause Right now, the LINK price forecast is in limbo. Whale wallets are quiet, token movement off exchanges is slowing, and that’s a red flag for bullish momentum. LINK is holding above a short-term support zone, but the energy isn’t there to push decisively in either direction. All eyes are on the $13.5 to $13.9 range. A breakout or breakdown here could set the tone for the next move. The RSI sits in neutral territory, signaling indecision among traders. Until accumulation picks up again or a clearer trend forms, LINK’s next move is still uncertain. Whether it rallies or retreats will likely come down to how buyers respond in the next few sessions. BDAG Stands Out With Stable Entry & Long-Term Focus With BONK testing resistance and LINK caught in wait-and-see mode, BlockDAG is playing a different game. By freezing its presale at $0.0016, it strips out guesswork and gives buyers a firm entry, something rare this close to launch. Instead of reacting to market noise, BlockDAG is creating its own momentum. The GLOBAL LAUNCH release is dropping on August 11, and holders are noticing. For those tired of chasing spikes and looking for clarity, BlockDAG may just be the best crypto for the 2025 bull run , offering both structure and upside without the chaos.

Moving on to smart contract platform Ethereum ( ETH ), Martinez says he expects more choppiness until the top altcoin closes outside the $2,227-$3,385 range. “Heard a company added an inflationary asset like ETH to its balance sheet, and suddenly everyone’s bullish again. But let’s be real: I expect more chop until we get a sustained close outside the $2,227-$3,385 range.” Source: Ali Martinez/X ETH is valued at $2,579 at time of writing, a marginal increase on the day.

47488531,https://timestabloid.com/?p=73426,1751673647,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s Projected XRP Price if It Matches Tether (USDT) Peak Volume,https://timestabloid.com/heres-projected-xrp-price-if-it-matches-tether-usdt-peak-volume/,"The potential valuation of XRP continues to spark debate across the cryptocurrency space. Despite experiencing significant price swings and a decline from its all-time high of $3.84 in 2018, many investors and analysts still believe XRP remains undervalued, particularly in light of its intended use as a bridge currency for cross-border payments. While some observers remain skeptical about its long-term prospects, others maintain that XRP could see considerable growth if it begins to facilitate large-scale financial activity, particularly within institutional frameworks. One way to assess this possibility is by using a valuation model based on real-world utility rather than speculation. Measuring XRP’s Value Through Utility A widely referenced methodology for valuing digital assets comes from a research model developed by Robert Mitchnick and Susan Athey. Unlike approaches driven by market sentiment, this model estimates fair value based on a token’s role in actual economic activity. It evaluates the relationship between transaction volume, token supply, and how frequently each token is used. Using a publicly available calculator built on this framework, we assessed XRP’s value under a hypothetical but relevant scenario: what if XRP handled the same level of daily transaction volume as Tether (USDT) did at its highest point this year? The Benchmark: USDT’s Peak Volume Tether (USDT), the most actively traded stablecoin, recorded its peak daily volume on February 3, 2025, reaching $292 billion. This volume is driven by its widespread use across crypto exchanges and trading platforms as a base pair against top assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. By contrast, XRP’s highest daily transaction volume in recent years was $51.7 billion, which it achieved in December 2023. The comparison sets a high benchmark, but it provides a meaningful reference point for exploring XRP’s potential growth under optimal adoption conditions. Parameters Used in the Valuation To simulate XRP handling a $292 billion daily volume, several parameters were applied. First, we assumed that the average holding time for each XRP token is 10 days, reflecting active use in institutional settlements. We also estimated the value of XRP held as a store of value at $180 billion. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Next, the projection was made over three years, allowing sufficient time for growth in adoption, regulatory clarity, and Ripple’s ongoing efforts to expand utility. To factor in supply changes, we projected a circulating supply of 66.2 billion tokens by that time, accounting for the gradual release of XRP from escrow, approximately 200 million per month. Lastly, to bring the projected price back to present-day terms, a 2% annual discount rate was applied, representing a modest expected rate of return over the next three years. Projected Price Outcome With all these parameters in place, the model generated a present-value estimate of $44.13 per XRP. This would represent a substantial increase from its current market value of approximately $2.28 , a potential gain of nearly 1,836%. It’s worth noting that this outcome aligns with past forecasts from analysts like Mickle and EGRAG Crypto , both of whom have separately projected a $44 price point under favorable market conditions. However, this analysis does not serve as a price prediction. Instead, it illustrates what XRP could be worth if it supports transaction volumes comparable to leading stablecoins like USDT, assuming the appropriate infrastructure and institutional participation are in place.

You’ll hear claims that XRP is already reshaping global finance and leaving old systems in the dust. According to influencer Coach JV, Ripple is building a whole new rails for money. He says XRP isn’t here to compete with banks. It’s here to replace them. Related Reading: Ethereum Network Awakens—Massive On-Chain Moves Signal What’s Coming He points out that transactions on the XRP Ledger settle in 3–5 seconds and cost fractions of a penny. That beats SWIFT transfers, which can take days and cost up to $50 per payment. XRP still trades around $2,25 but that figure, he argues, won’t stay low for long if the token keeps winning regulatory approvals and new partners. XRP is the most disruptive financial technology of our lifetime. Ripple isn’t just competing with the banking system, it’s replacing it. The old system is dead. The new financial rails are being laid right before your eyes. Stay asleep and you’ll miss the greatest wealth transfer… — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) July 2, 2025 Ripple’s Technology Versus Legacy Rails Based on reports, RippleNet now counts more than 300 financial institutions in its network. Yet daily on‑chain volumes for XRP hover around $1 billion—small next to global cross‑border flows of roughly $150 billion per day. Banks are testing the tech, but most haven’t shifted large sums yet. That gap between tests and real‑world use is one reason XRP’s price has stayed below its all‑time high for seven years. Push For Regulatory Clarity XRP backers are watching the US carefully. They see growing buzz around spot XRP ETFs. Analysts like Eric Balchunas have given those filings up to 95% odds of approval by year‑end. If an ETF hits a US exchange, they say, more money will pour in. Ripple has also been chasing money‑transmitter licenses in Europe and Asia. Every new license, they believe, brings Ripple a step closer to mainstream use. Community Calls For Patience Coach JV keeps telling followers not to panic over a stagnant price. He uses phrases like “greatest wealth transfer in history” to drive home his point. In an earlier tweet, he promised “unimaginable wealth” for anyone who holds on. Other voices, such as commentator Edoardo Farina, point out that only about 1 to 2 million people hold XRP today. That number, they say, leaves room for 100 million or more newcomers—and more buyers often means higher prices. Related Reading: The Silent Bitcoin Accumulation: Public Companies’ Surprising H1 2025 Lead Analysts Caution Over Hype Even so, some experts urge caution. They note that bold forecasts don’t guarantee buy‑in from big banks or regulators. An ETF approval won’t force funds to rush in overnight. And test programs don’t always turn into full rollouts. For now, XRP remains a high‑risk play. Investors should track on‑chain metrics and regulatory milestones before getting swept up in the hype.

While MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to hold the attention of early-stage meme-powered altcoin fans, Chainlink’s sentiment appears to be softening as technical signals point to a period of cautious consolidation. MAGACOIN FINANCE Stays Early-Stage, Community-Driven MAGACOIN FINANCE is a meme-driven altcoin and is also a decentralised political memecoin. It is gaining steady traction, while Bitcoin remains the anchor of the crypto market. It is currently trading at the minimum, and the strength of the project refers to how well it is developed and its community. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a unique, zero-tax, community-governed meme altcoin with political and cultural implications. Hashex has duly audited the coin’s token, and the project does not have VC control, unlike most other speculative meme coins, which lack absolute transparency. People who supported the coin in its earlier days do so because of its ideology, thousands of active holders, an ever-increasing Telegram presence, and decentralisation. Traders have kept MAGACOIN FINANCE on their watchlists due to rumours about upcoming exchange listings. At the same time, the narrative of early-stage momentum helps traders find culturally relevant tokens that transcend hype-driven pumps. Its hybrid identity, which combines the viral meme-coin energy with governance focus more commonly associated with larger altcoins, enables it to carve a distinct niche for itself. Bitcoin’s Bullish Momentum Gathers Pace Bitcoin’s market action this month has reinforced its reputation as the bellwether asset in the crypto market. Trading activity has surged to new yearly highs, with large derivatives traders and prediction markets reflecting growing confidence that BTC could push toward a fresh all-time high in the coming months. Current estimates place an 85% chance of Bitcoin hitting new record levels before October 2025, driven by improving liquidity, risk-on investor sentiment, and easing geopolitical tensions. Despite the optimism, short-term traders have recently locked in profits, with some data indicating that short-term holders have sold significant portions of their BTC holdings since May. This has resulted in a notable imbalance in the derivatives market, where bearish perpetual futures positions outnumber bullish longs by approximately two to one. Even so, the underlying trend remains upward as strong buy-side support keeps BTC trading well above $108,000, with analysts eyeing key resistance at $110,000 to $112,000. A breakout above these levels could open the door to further gains into the $125,000–$140,000 range. Chainlink Sees Cautious Sentiment By comparison, Chainlink (LINK) has shown signs of short-term weakness in recent sessions. As of July 2025, LINK is holding near the $13.30–$13.40 range, maintaining key support levels around $13.00. However, recent declines and an inability to reclaim the resistance levels around $13.86 to $14.36 have made some traders more cautious. On the fundamentals side, Chainlink remains a cornerstone of the blockchain data ecosystem. Its decentralised oracle services and the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) continue to attract real-world enterprise pilots and tokenisation partnerships. Yet, near-term momentum appears muted as broader market sentiment recalibrates. Analysts see potential for a bounce back into the $14.50–$15.00 range if sentiment improves. Still, any further weakness could push LINK into a deeper consolidation phase, with downside targets around $12.80 or lower. A Market Balancing Accumulation and Early-Stage Opportunity In a market where cultural tokens, foundational blockchains, and data providers all coexist, investors are watching for assets that offer a clear edge, whether that’s Bitcoin’s liquidity leadership, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s decentralised political narrative, or Chainlink’s oracle dominance. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a unique opportunity for investors to get in early on an ecosystem with massive upsides.

This shift opens up new opportunities for savvy investors. Discover which DeFi projects are poised for significant growth and could potentially offer impressive returns. Jupiter (JUP) Price Insights: Past Declines and Key Support Zones JUP behavior shows a one-month drop of 18.01% and a six-month decline of 53.73%. A one-week gain of 12.07% hints at short-term movement amid longer-term pressure. Price action over the recent month was marked by a steady descent, with the half-year view underlining a significant weakening in value. The past figures indicate that the coin experienced a brief rally before facing sustained losses, highlighting a period of volatility and bearish influence. Current price stands between $0.34 and $0.57, with the first resistance at $0.69 and a higher barrier at $0.92. Support emerges at $0.21, with a secondary level at $0.00. Technical readings, including an RSI near 50, reveal a market lacking a clear trend. Bears hold sway for now, as reflected in the negative summary and moving average recommendations. Traders might target support at $0.21 for a bounce before considering a push higher, while breaks above $0.69 could trigger bullish activity. A cautious approach is advised, monitoring these key levels for decisive movements. Chainlink Price Shifts: Recent Rally Amid Long-Term Bearish Trends Chainlink experienced a modest rebound last week with a 3.75% increase. However, the asset declined about 5% over the month and saw a significant drop of over 43% in the past six months. This recent activity points to short-term gains, contrasting sharply with long-term bearish trends as selling pressure has dominated for several months. Price movements remain volatile, with brief moments of buyer activity, yet the overall trend suggests a lack of sustained upward momentum. Chainlink is currently trading within a range of approximately $11 to $15.70. Key resistance is noted around $18.03, with initial support at $8.63. Additional resistance appears near $22.73, and a secondary support level is at $3.94. Technical indicators provide a mixed picture, indicating balance between buyers and sellers, with the Relative Strength Index near 50. Recent trading reflects a minor weekly gain, but ongoing monthly and six-month declines show persistent selling pressure. Bulls need to overcome the $18.03 barrier, while bears may push prices toward support. Traders should watch for movements around $8.63 or potential pullbacks. Caution is necessary due to the mixed market signals. Aave: Price Fluctuations Signal Cautious Optimism for Recovery Over the last month, Aave witnessed modest gains as its price increased by 1.68%, following a strong one-week surge of 8.27%. The coin experienced mixed performance with a striking six-month decline of 22.90%, reflecting investor hesitance after prior volatility. Price actions during this period showcased erratic behavior, with brief bullish bursts amid broader downward trends, highlighting the challenges of market recovery. Investors exhibited cautious optimism, balancing short-term rallies with long-term decline, resulting in market sentiment oscillating between hope and uncertainty. Current prices trade between $216 and $328.64, with bulls eyeing a primary resistance level at $382.89 and a secondary target at $494.61, while bears support a near-term floor of $159.44 and a deeper level at $47.72. Indicators including an Awesome Oscillator reading of 8.83 and a Momentum Indicator of 7.18 point to moderate upward pressure, with an RSI at 53.32 suggesting near-neutral conditions. The market lacks a definitive trend, requiring careful positioning within these key levels. Traders may consider short-term entries to profit from rebounds toward resistance while using stop-loss orders beneath support levels to limit risk. Uniswap Price Rebound: Short-Term Gains Amid Long-Term Struggles Recent UNI price action shows a gain of nearly 11% over the past month following a marked recovery. Over the past six months, the coin fell by about 52%, indicating a significant long-term decline. The data outlines a striking short-term rebound contrasting with an extended downtrend, highlighting market hesitancy. The noticeable monthly improvement suggests renewed investor interest despite ongoing challenges. The contrasting figures indicate a volatile market where short-term gains exist alongside broader weakness in the coin's performance. Current activity places Uniswap between a support at $4.33 and a resistance level at $10.08, with the trading range being $5.73 to $8.61. The coin is testing these key levels as traders seek opportunities for breakouts or reversals. Indicators, such as a mildly bullish RSI at 54.19, hint at buying pressure, yet the overall trend remains unclear. There is potential for trades; bullish participants may push toward $10.08, while bearish traders could aim for a dip to support. Monitoring price reactions near these levels, along with volume, is essential for position management. Conclusion As capital shifts from Bitcoin to altcoins, key projects to monitor include JUP , LINK , AAVE , and UNI . Each of these offers unique features and potential growth. JUP focuses on creating a secure ecosystem. LINK enhances interoperability between smart contracts. AAVE allows users to lend and borrow assets. UNI is the governance token for a leading decentralized exchange. Observing these projects could provide insights into emerging trends and opportunities within the market.

MAGACOIN FINANCE Gets Early Traction at $0.00010425 While Ethereum’s developer community gears up for the next phase, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing how the meme-powered altcoin niche is evolving. Trading near $0.00010425, the decentralised political memecoin has been quietly building momentum, thanks to its clear anti-centralisation message and community-first model. Unlike typical meme tokens that rely on a few viral tweets to pump prices, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out a more structured identity. It’s both a meme-powered altcoin and a decentralised political memecoin, tapping into an ideological base that wants more than fleeting hype. Its zero-tax design, a fully audited smart contract, and a no-VC-control approach have resonated with early backers who value transparency. Telegram and X (Twitter) channels are filled with word-of-mouth updates about possible listings, and community-driven marketing. For meme traders watching Dogecoin’s recent volume dip, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s consistent engagement and ideological branding are a refreshing change of pace. Ethereum’s 2025 Upgrades: A Smart Contract Game-Changer Ethereum has long held its crown as the go-to platform for smart contracts, but network congestion and high fees have tested even its most loyal users. This year, the world’s largest smart contract blockchain is advancing with back-to-back upgrades aimed at addressing these pain points. The Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7, 2025, combines the Prague execution layer fork and the Electra consensus layer upgrade, marking a major milestone since the Merge in 2022. With 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) rolled into one, Pectra introduces smart accounts, also known as “account abstraction,” making wallets significantly more flexible and secure. Now, users can even pay gas fees with tokens other than ETH, a minor detail that could have a significant impact on how dApps are used daily. Put simply, Ethereum’s 2025 roadmap appears to be a solid step forward, combining usability, scalability, and increased network participation. NEAR Protocol Slides but Holds Long-Term Promise Meanwhile, NEAR Protocol is navigating a patch of turbulence. The scalable Layer-1 blockchain is currently trading between $2.14 and $2.21, down slightly over the past few weeks. Technically, NEAR is hovering below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, often a sign that buyers are hesitant to jump in until stronger support appears. Still, NEAR’s fundamentals remain intact. The protocol continues to grow its ecosystem and developer base, and forecasts for 2025 remain moderately optimistic, with projections pointing to a potential range of $2.50 to $2.70 by year’s end if market sentiment stabilises. For now, though, NEAR is caught between broader market caution and its technical headwinds. Traders watching for value opportunities may see this consolidation phase as an entry point. Still, it’s clear that, compared to Ethereum’s upgrade buzz and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s meme-layer narrative, NEAR has work to do to regain momentum. The Takeaway: Three Projects, One Market Narrative Ethereum’s smart contract push underscores its commitment to being the backbone for DeFi, NFTs, and real-world tokenisation. MAGACOIN FINANCE shows that the meme-powered altcoin space can evolve with structure, governance, and cultural relevance.

The action is part of President Lee Jae Myung’s scramble to breathe life into a slowing economy and shield vital industries as trade tensions with the United States threaten to upend commercial ties. The supplementary budget , which was passed after bitter debates and a boycott by the opposition, is greater than the government’s proposal of 30.5 trillion won. Legislators tacked additional funding for direct cash handouts and emergency aid to distressed industries. The Finance Ministry said the new number shows the importance of falling back on more efficient support measures in light of the double risk of a slowdown in the country and international shocks. The new relief bill is arriving at a critical time. Seoul and Washington have a deadline of July 9 to resolve closing differences on the revised US-Korea Free Trade Agreement . US President Donald Trump has warned he may impose duties on imports from major trading partners, including South Korea, should the talks fail to bear fruit. Any move toward a reciprocal tariff increase from 10% to 25% would also seriously blow up Korean exports, such as automobiles, batteries, and semiconductors, propelling the economy. President Lee moves to close revenue gap with stimulus budget That bill contains a 10.3 trillion won fund to compensate for shortfalls in tax revenue. The government has been hit with lackluster corporate tax collections amid poor earnings in key sectors such as manufacturing and retail. Consumer demand is also down, putting yet more pressure on public finances. The government will fund that mostly through borrowing. The figure will mostly be for new sovereign bond issuance, spending cuts, and reallocating existing budget lines. Low-income families and struggling businesses will receive cash coupons and targeted relief. Additional money has also been allocated for industrial innovation, export assistance, and the creation of jobs. Despite a boycott of the legislation by opposition lawmakers who said the package lacked long-term vision and was not transparent, the ruling party forced the bill to pass parliament. However, the passage was a major early victory for President Lee, who was sworn in only last month after a snap election win. South Korea races to avoid US tariffs An impending trade cliff is spurring the urgency. A temporary deal that has largely kept Korean exports outside the reach of plumped‐up American tariffs expires soon. Without a new agreement, the tariffs would automatically rise to 25% on the targeted goods. President Trump has indicated that he may start sending unilateral tariff notices to US trading partners as soon as this weekend. That could give Seoul little time to respond or negotiate concessions. South Korea’s trade minister, Yeo Han-koo, is flying to Washington in a last-ditch diplomatic effort to ward off a worst-case scenario. “It’s still not clear to each side what the other side wants,” President Lee said, calling the trade talks frustrating and opaque. Failing to do so could come at a heavy cost for Korean exporters regarding near-term losses, diminished competitive standing globally, and possible layoffs. With more than 40% of GDP based on exports, Korea is extremely exposed to external shocks. If duties increase overnight, many industries, ranging from the automotive and electronics sectors to steel and shipbuilding, may lose their margins. Market analysts caution that any short-lived disruption could put a chill on GDP growth for the year and rattle investor confidence. And the political stakes are high, too. Running for president, Lee made economic reform and inclusive growth his platform. An inability to contain the fallout from tariffs imposed by the United States could undermine his administration’s credibility early in his tenure.

The move marks a major escalation in his push for what he calls “reciprocal” trade and comes just five days ahead of a self-imposed July 9 deadline for countries to strike deals with the US. Trump told reporters that “10 or 12” letters will be sent Friday, with additional notices expected in the following days. “By the ninth, they’ll be fully covered,” he said, referring to the expiration of the 90-day window he provided when initially announcing the tariff plan on April 2. The new tariffs could range from 10% to 70%, surpassing his earlier maximum of 50%. Trump pushes simple tariff deals as deadline pressures mount Trump reaffirmed his preference for direct tariff implementation over drawn-out negotiations, saying, “It’s much easier. I’d rather just do a simple deal where you can maintain it and control it.” He confirmed that payments from the tariffs would start flowing into the US beginning August 1. While importers or intermediaries pay tariffs, the ultimate cost is often passed to consumers or absorbed in profit margins. As the deadline nears, talks with key economies — including South Korea, Indonesia, the EU, and Switzerland — are in a critical phase. Bloomberg Economics estimates the average tariff on US imports could rise to 20% from just 3% before Trump took office. So far, only the UK and Vietnam have finalized agreements . A deal with China has resulted in a truce, easing tit-for-tat measures and loosening export restrictions. This week, Trump unveiled the Vietnam deal, which imposes a 20% tariff on Vietnamese exports and a 40% tariff on transshipped goods. Though lower than the initial 46%, the rates exceed the interim 10%. Vietnam, however, says negotiations are still ongoing. Global trade partners scramble for last-minute deals as tariff deadline looms Indonesia expressed optimism about finalizing a bold trade pact covering minerals, energy, and defense cooperation. Cambodia announced it had agreed on a reciprocal trade framework, with details to be made public soon. Trump had threatened Cambodia with a 49% tariff, one of the steepest. Japan, South Korea, and EU members are still finalizing accords. Some European automakers are pushing for tariff relief in exchange for increased US investment . South Korea’s top trade envoy is expected to visit Washington this weekend with fresh proposals in a last-minute attempt to avoid new tariffs. Trump has remained optimistic about reaching a deal with India but has sharply criticized Japan, describing it as a tough negotiator. This week, he said Japan might face tariffs as high as 35%. Despite growing concerns, Trump insisted there would be no delay to the deadline. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed Thursday that the president would decide whether countries negotiated in good faith and whether any extensions were warranted. “We’re going to do what the president wants,” Bessent said on CNBC. Markets slide, and fed holds firm as Trump’s tariff threats rattle the global economy Global markets reacted swiftly. Stocks in Asia and Europe dropped, and the US dollar weakened. American equity and bond markets were closed for the Fourth of July holiday. Federal Reserve officials remain cautious, with some warning that increased tariffs could stoke inflation — a concern that’s kept interest rate cuts off the table despite pressure from the White House. As Trump moves to reshape global trade through unilateral action, trading partners face a stark choice: strike a deal now or pay the price come August.

Chainlink is currently showing strong technical behavior, holding support around $12, with analysts watching for a potential climb toward $25. Meanwhile, Kaspa is working on sustainable growth into 2026, prioritizing performance upgrades instead of hype-fueled activity. However, BlockDAG is gaining attention for a different reason. With $329.5 million raised in presale, an ROI of 2,660% delivered to early holders, and a new partnership with the Seattle Seawolves, it is combining digital accessibility with real-world adoption. These three platforms continue to stand out for those following long-term crypto engagement strategies. BlockDAG Joins Forces With Seattle Seawolves to Boost Global Adoption BlockDAG has teamed up with the Seattle Seawolves to boost global adoption of its blockchain infrastructure. This collaboration introduces digital access to exclusive NFTs, fan perks, and behind-the-scenes content, all made possible through BlockDAG’s scalable Layer 1 technology. Together, the Seawolves and BlockDAG will share fresh content on social platforms, including match previews, player highlights, and interactive features that enhance fan involvement. These initiatives aim to build secure, meaningful digital touchpoints between the team and its fan base. With elements like special-access content and tradeable collectibles, the goal is to make the experience more engaging and rewarding. For BlockDAG, this partnership is another step toward connecting Web3 capabilities with everyday communities. The platform’s presale continues to gain traction, having raised $329.5 million, sold 23.6 billion coins, and reached batch 29 with a current price of $0.0276. Still, buyers can access a limited offer at $0.0016, but only until August 11. Early holders of the altcoin have already seen an ROI of 2,660%. This partnership shows why BlockDAG is being seen as one of the top crypto opportunities right now. It combines usefulness, accessibility, and popular appeal in a way that makes blockchain a direct part of the fan experience. Kaspa Price Prediction Shows Potential for Gradual Gains Into 2026 The Kaspa price prediction through 2026 points to a steady growth path fueled by strong technical capabilities. Analysts expect it to increase in value as it continues refining block timing and confirmation speeds. With a focus on performance and scalability, it appeals to those looking for stable networks that deliver consistent results. Rather than aiming for sudden price jumps, Kaspa appears ready for steady, calculated growth. This makes it appealing to users who prefer sustainable infrastructure over volatile spikes. Current forecasts suggest a more balanced price range by 2026, backed by continued technical upgrades and growing use. For those seeking dependable, low-risk returns, Kaspa could be a solid choice. Chainlink Price Prediction: July 2025 Outlook Suggests Bullish Trend The Chainlink price prediction for July 2025 suggests that upward momentum may continue if current levels hold. Technical charts show higher lows forming, with $12 acting as a strong support zone. If this level remains unbroken, LINK could push toward $18, with a breakout potentially aiming for $25. If buying activity increases, prices could extend even further, potentially landing between $31 and $41. Additionally, a rounded-bottom formation is appearing on the charts, a shape often seen before a trend reversal. However, a dip below $12 could point to weakness, putting targets between $10 and $11 in focus. This makes close tracking of support and resistance levels important in the short term. Final Thoughts Crypto platforms that offer clear value and maintain stability often gain attention beyond hype cycles. Chainlink continues to show resilience through technical strength. Kaspa is taking a methodical approach, offering consistent gains with solid infrastructure. BlockDAG, by contrast, is making headlines by applying blockchain tools in real-world areas like professional sports. With 23.6 billion coins sold and a limited-time price of $0.0016 available until August 11, BlockDAG presents a strong entry point with high growth potential. Together, these three projects are not only making moves in the market, but they are also reinforcing their relevance through technology, real-world utility, and strategic engagement. This is why they remain top coins to watch in 2025 .

Despite this short-term dip, LINK has held onto weekly gains of around 2.4%, suggesting broader market participants may still be weighing its long-term potential. While price remains rangebound, recent on-chain data indicates that LINK’s price action could be the result of diverging behavior between retail and institutional investors. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) On Standby: Bitcoin’s Next Move Holds The Key Chainlink Institutional Accumulation and Supply Pressure CryptoQuant contributor “Banker” highlighted a growing structural dynamic in the LINK ecosystem in a recent QuickTake analysis titled “LINK’s Accumulation Standoff: Whales Build, Retail Waits.” The report outlines how LINK is currently in a consolidation phase between $12 and $15, where institutional actors have been steadily accumulating tokens, while retail users remain largely passive. This discrepancy may be playing a key role in capping upward momentum despite persistent LINK outflows from centralized exchanges. According to Banker, exchange netflows for LINK have remained negative at roughly -100,000 LINK per week, signaling that more tokens are being withdrawn from trading platforms than deposited. This behavior is typically associated with accumulation activity, particularly from larger holders or “whales” who may be positioning for longer-term appreciation. Historical spikes in retail deposits, such as the +5 million LINK deposited in March 2025, have proven to be exceptions rather than the norm, as retail activity has since remained subdued. Supporting this view, active LINK addresses have hovered consistently between 28,000 and 32,000 per day, while transaction counts average around 9,000 daily. These figures have not rebounded from previous activity peaks seen in late 2024, even as Chainlink’s oracle usage has expanded. Meanwhile, elevated levels of exchange withdrawals, peaking at over 3,000 per day in Q4 2024, remain a dominant force. With leverage metrics staying neutral, whales have been able to withdraw LINK without introducing significant price volatility, resulting in a 40% year-to-date drop in exchange reserves. Market Outlook Hinges on Retail Reentry or Whale Fatigue As LINK’s consolidation persists, the path forward may depend on a shift in market dynamics. Banker points out that a meaningful breakout will likely require renewed participation from retail traders, as evidenced by a spike in active wallet addresses and transaction volume. Related Reading: Chainlink Holders Set Record As 1-Yr MVRV Signals ‘Opportunity’ If these metrics rise and price breaks above the $15 price mark, momentum could build for a stronger upward trend. On the other hand, a decline in whale-driven withdrawals or an increase in exchange inflows could weaken accumulation, potentially pushing LINK back down toward the $10 level. Banker added: Until catalysts emerge, whales silently build positions, echoing Bitcoin’s 2023 consolidation before its 2024 surge.

Dogecoin is forming a bullish pattern, and Hedera is trying to bounce back. But much of the real interest is shifting elsewhere. Web3 ai , a presale project with AI-powered features, has now sold over 23.95 billion tokens and collected more than $8.7 million. As each presale stage wraps up, people are starting to focus on platforms with real tools, not just attention-grabbing stories. This change in direction is becoming clearer. Older coins that once moved fast are now hitting resistance levels. Meanwhile, smaller AI-backed platforms are offering better early entry chances. At $0.000443 in Stage 09, Web3 ai is catching attention not as just another project, but as the best crypto investment this year with a forecasted 1,747% ROI and tools built for real users. Bullish Signs in Dogecoin but Momentum Still Lacking Dogecoin is showing a pattern that some see as bullish, including signs of a falling wedge breakout. If Dogecoin moves past $0.13 and holds it, some believe a run to $0.16 could follow. These patterns have worked for Dogecoin before, especially during strong hype periods backed by social media. But volume levels are not supporting the move right now. There’s little whale buying and the network is quiet. Even if the pattern looks good, the follow-through is still uncertain. With meme coins slowing down, this rally may not hold unless something major shifts in Q3 2025. Dogecoin is still being watched because of its long history and surprise price moves. Yet for those looking for the best crypto investment in 2025, Dogecoin’s dependence on hype makes it a hard choice compared to projects offering more stable returns and clear use cases. Hedera Faces Challenges Despite Project Growth Hedera’s price outlook has become weaker after dropping nearly 11% in recent weeks. Some experts believe HBAR could move back into the $0.12 to $0.15 range before Q3 ends, but current signals show neutral or weak trends. Its RSI is just above oversold, and the $0.10 support is under pressure. One issue is the gap between Hedera’s use cases and its price trend. It has big partnerships and is working on tokenization and digital ledger tools. But the price has not reacted to any of this. Right now, just having good tech is not enough. Markets are looking for returns, and Hedera has not offered strong gains. Unless new market forces or changes in how the token works take place, Hedera may keep moving sideways. People who want to set up their positions for 2025 might decide to look at other options, especially ones like Web3 ai that offer both high ROI and near-term reasons to grow. Web3 ai Builds Real Tools with 1,747% ROI Potential Web3 ai is drawing attention not only for its presale progress or token price but also for the tools it plans to launch soon. At $0.000443 in Stage 09, the $WAI token powers every part of this growing platform. One major highlight is the Crypto Trading Assistant, designed to offer trading help using real-time data. This tool replaces slow signals and scattered technical analysis with AI-based trade ideas, chart views, and alerts across both centralized and decentralized exchanges. It works with large sets of past data and adjusts for new changes in market mood, price swings, and token links. This helps both new and experienced traders make decisions with more confidence. Web3 ai has already sold more than 23.95 billion tokens and raised $8.7 million, showing that many are interested. The expected 1,747% ROI from the current price to launch makes the upside worth noting, especially when matched with working products. It’s not just about using AI as a buzzword, but building real tools with token-based access that sets $WAI apart from coins based only on hype. As the crypto space shifts toward platforms that offer real use, Web3 ai is getting noticed. People holding the token are not only hoping for gains, but also getting tools that help them trade smarter with AI on their side. What the Market Says Right Now Dogecoin is forming a bullish setup, but weak volume and slow trader interest are stopping big gains. Hedera has solid use cases, but its price is still close to major support levels and hasn’t picked up yet. Web3 ai, on the other hand, is seeing steady interest as its presale grows and more people explore its roadmap. With real tools for trading, a focus on AI, and a possible 1,747% return, Web3 ai is becoming the best crypto investment for 2025 . As the market shifts away from quick pumps toward smart choices, tokens like $WAI are showing why they matter. For those watching for strong projects under a cent, this might be the one where the features match the early interest.

Shiba Inu is drawing attention through accumulation trends, while Hyperliquid holds firm despite market volatility. However, both rely heavily on speculative movement and market timing. Unstaked offers something different. Its AI agent demo shows how simple it is to build and deploy intelligent tools that manage tasks like community engagement without any coding. This shift toward hands-on utility gives Unstaked broader relevance. For those evaluating the best crypto to buy, usability and live functionality make Unstaked a strong candidate in a crowded field. Shiba Inu Price Potential Builds as Accumulation Strengthens Shiba Inu is showing signs of renewed strength as significant buy orders flow in, thereby hinting at a potential shift in market sentiment. Following a stretch of subdued price action, these large-scale transactions point to calculated accumulation rather than short-term speculation. Meanwhile, the current consolidation near support levels has attracted attention, with technical indicators suggesting that buyers are stepping in at perceived value zones. As a result, this activity highlights growing optimism about Shiba Inu price potential, especially if the asset can break through nearby resistance levels. In addition, market watchers are also noting increased wallet activity and trading volume, both of which reinforce the narrative of strategic positioning. At this point, the focus now is on whether this buying momentum can sustain and translate into a broader move upward. Hyperliquid Market Crash Resilience Sparks Bullish Momentum Despite broader downturns, Hyperliquid has shown remarkable resilience, defying fears tied to the recent Hyperliquid market crash narrative. While volatility has tested many digital assets, Hyperliquid’s infrastructure adjustments and community-driven focus have helped steady investor sentiment. Specifically, strategic tweaks, including improved leverage settings and tighter risk parameters, have contributed to a stronger, more sustainable trading environment. Importantly, these changes, rather than stalling momentum, appear to have increased user confidence. Consequently, trading activity has steadily grown, and recent price movements show signs of consolidation, not collapse. Furthermore, technical indicators support the view that HYPE’s support levels are holding firm, hinting at the possibility of a breakout if momentum continues. More importantly, the ability to weather a dip without eroding user trust adds to the platform’s credibility. Looking ahead, as more users re-engage, the recovery from the so-called Hyperliquid market crash could transition from a rebound into a longer-term uptrend, driven by stability, utility, and timely adaptation.

Trump signed the one big, beautiful bill into law at a military family picnic at the White House for the Fourth of July. The president and his aides had long pegged Independence Day as a deadline for when they hoped to see the legislation on his desk, a timeline that appeared in peril just days ago. The move marks the president’s most significant legislative achievement of his second term. Until now, Trump’s presidency has largely relied on executive orders rather than congressional action. First lady Melania Trump attended Friday’s ceremony, and several Cabinet officials and numerous Republican lawmakers, including Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.), House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), and Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.). The event featured dramatic touches, including a flyover by two B-2 bombers — the same model used in last month’s strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. “This is really promises made, promises kept,” Trump said before signing the bill. Calling it “the biggest victory yet,” he touted the measure as proof of American strength and a cornerstone of his economic agenda. GOP rallies behind Trump to push budget through Congress amid tight deadline The bill’s passage reinforces Trump’s dominance within the Republican Party. GOP leaders on Capitol Hill pushed the measure through both chambers this week despite razor-thin margins, vocal opposition from Democrats, and skepticism from fiscal hawks and moderates. Trump personally lobbied key lawmakers, even inviting some to the White House to seal their support ahead of the July 4 deadline. But the political victory is not without cost. The sweeping legislation includes major spending cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs, prompting criticism from advocacy groups, fiscal watchdogs, and Democrats who warn of long-term consequences. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, approximately 11.8 million Americans could lose Medicaid coverage due to new work requirements, co-payments, and reimbursement caps. Hospitals, particularly rural ones, could face closures due to reduced federal support. Polls show the bill is broadly unpopular with the public. Democrats have vowed to use the bill as a political weapon in the upcoming midterms, while some Senate Republicans fear electoral backlash from voters reliant on safety-net programs. Trump hails ‘rocketship economy’ as $4.5 trillion in tax breaks take center stage Still, the administration insists the package will supercharge the economy. Trump dismissed concerns over rising debt: “Our country is going to be a rocketship economically.” Despite opposition forecasts, he argued that tax reform, deregulation, tariffs, and energy production will drive growth. The bill features $4.5 trillion in tax cuts , including an extension of the 2017 Trump-era tax reductions. It also offers new tax relief for tipped workers, overtime pay, certain auto loans, seniors, and parents. A key win for Republicans in high-tax states — like New York, New Jersey, and California — is expanding the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap from $10,000 to $40,000 over five years. The bill slashes incentives for renewable energy and electric vehicles to offset part of the cost, which could slow green infrastructure investments. Medicaid alone faces nearly $1 trillion in reductions, while food-aid programs will enforce expanded work requirements and penalties for states with error-prone benefit systems. In contrast, the bill delivers hundreds of billions in new military spending and greenlights additional funds for immigration enforcement, aligning with Trump’s national security agenda. As the country celebrates Independence Day, Trump is betting that this bold, controversial budget will reshape America’s economy — and his political legacy.

Stage 3 positions are filling in quickly at $0.00012255. Traders are viewing this as an early opportunity to get into a project with solid community ownership. With XRP holding on to large ETF news and Mantle making new product plays, MAGACOIN FINANCE is in the spotlight. This altcoin is drawing in retail buyers and early whales. Every round has sold out quicker than expected to date. Fixed supply and audited trust give the buyers more confidence. Most consider it a meme coin with real structure and a solid plan for growth. What Makes MAGACOIN FINANCE Different MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out by merging political storytelling with disciplined tokenomics. Each move showcases growing momentum. Investors want tokens that are not just hype. Zero-tax mechanism and community governance enable trust-building. Others liken it to Dogecoin in its infancy. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is intent on long-term assets for its owners. Its roadmap is suggesting real decentralized finance capabilities. XRP Investors Wait and Watch XRP has been a crypto behemoth for years. Frenzy over a spot ETF keeps traders active. Experts estimate the chances of approval at about 45% currently. Large ones such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have submitted. But SEC delays make Q4 the probable timeframe. Some analysts anticipate XRP price crossing previous highs if approvals come through. While waiting, diversification is going on with some XRP investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE is among the options for investors who want a new twist with a robust community backing. Mantle Becomes Useful but Uncertain Mantle’s release of the new UR Neobank was featured in the news. It had a modest price increase, even during the overall market slump. Mantle is known for its Layer 2 technology that speeds up Ethereum transactions and lowers fees. Most investors still consider Mantle to be a promising one. Its price range up to Q4 may be between $0.44 and $0.71. Others look for a surge through $1.50 if new buyers come in. But superior early-stage deals are in their opinion. That is the reason that money is flowing into names like MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE Keeps Building One of the reasons MAGACOIN FINANCE is so popular is due to its fixed supply model. It gets rid of stealth emissions and gives assurance to its holders. A third-party audit does support its security assertions. Each stage sells out quicker. This is a clear sign that indicates that demand is increasing. Crypto veterans compare it to those initial meme coins but point to its open staking model and political slant. This is to draw in purchasers who want something more than temporary hype. And it doesn’t hurt that a lot of people are moving money from XRP and Mantle to be an early adopter. Wrapping Up MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing it belongs in the 2025 altcoin discussion. Traders demand projects with thoroughly established plans, audited with integrity, and viral hype. As XRP traders await ETF listing and Mantle continues to develop its DeFi toolbox, MAGACOIN FINANCE is experiencing genuine demand for Stage 3. Look for more eyes to turn up here as the capped supply contracts and buyers continue to fill out each phase. This political-themed meme-powered altcoin demonstrates that narrative does count.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi crypto is quietly gaining momentum. The project has sold more than 60% of presale stage 5 at $0.03. MUTM has mobilized in excess of $11.7 million and has attracted over 12,700 investors. As ETH regains strength amid shifting sentiment in the broader crypto market, the spotlight is increasingly shifting to Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance could hit $3 soon after launch. Ethereum Eyes $3,000 Amid Renewed Market Optimism Ethereum (ETH) is priced at around $2,740 and it has experienced stable upward movement since improvements in the general market sentiment and the rising network activity. As analysts see it, ETH might be tested around the $3,000 mark again in the near future should the upside demand persist and risk-on macro conditions in the crypto sphere remain. The price growth of Ethereum is chiefly due to growing institutional use and improving fundamentals. Nevertheless, with the slow development on ETH, certain investors are starting to diversify into other recent assets such as Mutuum Finance, which has been drawing interests based on their growth prospects of providing speedier returns. Mutuum Finance Presale Stage 5 Gains Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up some serious traction as it reaches Stage 5 of its presale. With more than 12,700 early adopters and well over $11.7 million in funds raised, the project is taking giant strides as a major player in the DeFi. USD Stablecoin Launch & $50K Security Bounty Mutuum Finance, in its plans to build more on its DeFi, is launching a fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. In contrast to highly risk-exposed algorithmic stablecoins, this token has been designed in such a manner that it will guarantee its value even during market volatility. The project itself is about integrity and security. Mutuum Finance platform is already audited by CertiK as well, which once again shows team dedication to transparency, reliability, and sustainability. Mutuum Finance also introduced a Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, where a reward of 50,000 USDT is offered. The bounty comes in four categories, namely the critical, major, minor, and low. This will level out all the tiers of vulnerability and reward it alike. Investor Incentives In appreciation of the presale mania and as a token of appreciation to early adopters, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will distribute a total of $100,000 . Ten such winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens for being part of the early backers of the project. With the community growing exponentially, the early backers are being rewarded, not only with possible future gain, but with real, present-time rewards. As Ethereum steadily approaches the $3,000 milestone, investor attention is simultaneously shifting toward high-upside opportunities like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi project that’s already making waves. With over $11.7 million raised, 12,700+ investors onboard, and Stage 5 of the presale more than 60% sold out at just $0.03, Mutuum is capturing serious market interest. Backed by a CertiK audit, a $50,000 security bounty, and an upcoming USD-backed stablecoin, the project is setting the stage for a potential rally toward $3 post-launch. Early participants are also eligible to win a share of $100,000 in MUTM tokens. Seize this early advantage, visit the official website now and join the presale before it closes.

After dipping toward the $0.13–$0.15 demand zone, the meme‑coin shot higher, and a surge in derivatives data suggests many expect more gains. Related Reading: Ethereum Network Awakens—Massive On-Chain Moves Signal What’s Coming Trader Interest Climbs Around $0.19 Resistance According to market data, Open Interest jumped by 16% to reach over $2 billion. Options volume exploded by 400%. That kind of rise often points to big bets on upward swings. Right now, many eyes are on the $0.20 resistance level. If DOGE can close a daily candle above that line, it may clear the way toward $0.27. Dogecoin’s technical setup is drawing fresh looks from chart watchers. The Stochastic RSI crossed above 80, which can mark an overbought zone. Yet coins have stayed above overbought readings before when buyers kept pushing. Traders will want to see real volume behind any move above that descending trendline near $0.19. Without it, the rally may stall or give back gains. Whales Return With Spot Inflows Based on reports, Dogecoin saw a net inflow of $8.20 million into spot wallets. That marks a big shift after weeks of outflows. Large holders have been moving coins onto exchanges in the past, but now they’re pulling more in. In other cycles, fresh whale buys have lined up with mid‑term rallies. On‑chain metrics add another layer. Dogecoin’s MVRV Z‑score climbed back to 0.355 after hitting near‑historical lows late in June. That figure measures how much profit holders stand to make on average. A rising score hints that fewer holders are underwater, and that might draw in new buyers. Still, MVRV is backward‑looking. It can’t predict if price will break through key resistance. Network Activity Shows Mixed Signals Network stats tell a mixed story. Daily active addresses slid to 34 K, and transaction counts dropped to 15K as of July 3. That’s a sharp fall from the more than 500K addresses and transactions seen in the last week of June. Lower usage could sap the rally’s legs if retail traders don’t reengage soon. Related Reading: The Silent Bitcoin Accumulation: Public Companies’ Surprising H1 2025 Lead Even with these mixed signals, the mood toward Dogecoin is brighter than it was a week ago. Traders piling into options and hikes in Open Interest show speculative appetite is up. Large spot inflows show that whales have stepped back in. But network usage is lagging. If daily addresses and transactions don’t bounce back, bulls may find it harder to sustain the push.

Speaking at an Independence Day event in Ottawa, Hoekstra noted that both leaders have dedicated negotiators working on the deal. He envisioned a scenario where each leader could proudly tell their citizens, “I secured a fantastic deal for my Canada.” Hoekstra further speculated that at that moment, they would have a president who could say, ‘I got a great deal for the USA.’ Based on his argument, this was possibly a ” win-win situation.” Hoekstra expresses optimism for an end to the US-Canada trade negotiation The US, Canada, and Mexico already have a trade agreement that Trump signed in his first term. The president, however, has avoided it, setting tariffs of up to 50% on imported steel and aluminum and duties on cars and trucks. Interestingly, Canada plays an important role in exporting all of those goods. On the other hand, the Canadian government imposed counter-tariffs on tens of billions of dollars worth of American-made goods. This included automobiles and other consumer goods. Notably, Carney, Canada’s prime minister since March, chose not to respond when Trump raised the tariffs on steel and aluminum weeks ago. Meanwhile, trade talks restarted between the United States and Canada immediately after Ottawa removed a digital services tax, which the US objected to, according to White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett. Hassett stated that when he was asked about the talks starting up again. This came after Mark Carney telephoned US President Donald Trump to inform him that the tax was being canceled, the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, describing it as a big win for US tech firms. Leavitt described this as straightforward, referring to Prime Minister Carney giving in to President Trump and the US. She praised Trump’s tough negotiating approach for the change. The secretary further stated that President Trump understands that every country needs to have strong trade ties with the US. Based on Leavitt’s argument, Canada made a mistake by promising to put in place a tax that would have harmed their tech companies. The two leaders agreed on a July 21 deadline for reaching an agreement. Hoekstra, who used to be a member of the US House of Representatives from Michigan, which relies heavily on trade with Canada, asserted that they will get through this. He then concluded that when this is all over, they will be stronger and better than they were at the start. Canada drops its digital services tax on the US, resulting in a trade deal with the nation Canada backed off a plan to start imposing a new digital services tax aimed at US technology giants just hours before it came into effect in hopes of helping move forward the halted trade talks with the US. This was after Trump asked Canada to drop the tax at a G7 meeting in Canada earlier in June. According to Hassett, this is something that they had studied, and now they had agreed to it. Therefore, Hassett anticipated that they could get back to the negotiations. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick commented on the situation in a post on X. Lutnick expressed gratitude to Canada for removing its Digital Services Tax. According to him, it was intended to stifle American innovation and would have been a deal breaker for any trade deal with America. As a result of this change, stocks reached new highs on Wall Street as market sentiment lifted on hopes that the US would make progress on its trade negotiations with major trading partners, including Canada.

With its price at $0.00013428 and climbing, this new political meme token is drawing serious attention, even as Ethereum consolidates and Aptos advances with mixed market traction. Analysts and early investors see MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most compelling opportunities of 2025. Its meme appeal, political branding, and real fundamentals is driving significant forecasts from top analysts, attracting capital away from more established altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Meme-Political Star MAGACOIN FINANCE tops the watchlist of leading altcoins with a HashEx smart contract audit, a strict 170 billion token cap, and a clear roadmap focused on community-driven governance. Its narrative taps into the “Make America Great Again” movement, giving it a political edge in a crowded meme sector. Every presale phase is selling out rapidly, often driving prices higher within hours. The project already boasts 20,000+ active supporters and million dollars raised from early investors, making it one of the largest community-driven crypto launches of 2025. Backed by staking rewards with high APYs for early participants, it’s no surprise MAGACOIN FINANCE is topping analyst watchlists. Some even compare it to the earliest days of Aptos and Ethereum— but with stronger fundamentals and an actual decentralized governance framework. MAGACOIN FINANCE Vs Ethereum: Big Institutional Bets but Price Stalls Ethereum is seeing significant strategic moves from major players. BitMine Immersion Technologies, originally a Bitcoin miner, just raised $250 million to start an ETH treasury, which could make it one of the largest publicly traded ETH holders. This private placement drew top investors like Founders Fund, Pantera, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, and Thomas Lee, who will chair BitMine. Lee highlighted Ethereum’s dominance in stablecoin settlement and expects ETH to keep benefiting as stablecoin adoption grows. While this underlines Ethereum’s long-term strength to achieve $5000 in the long-term, ETH is currently consolidating as markets digest the news — pushing some investors to look for more immediate high-growth plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Aptos’ Volatility Pushes MAGACOIN FINANCE Aptos (APT) has posted some impressive milestones. CEO Avery Ching was appointed to the CFTC’s GMAC Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee, a regulatory move boosting institutional credibility. The network also saw over 1,200 smart contracts deployed in a single day, and its stablecoin supply recently hit $1 billion. Technologically, Aptos is rolling out Zaptos, a pipelined blockchain design supporting up to 20,000 transactions per second. Meanwhile, Bitwise updated filings for an Aptos ETF, and Wyoming’s stablecoin initiative is spotlighting APT. Yet despite these advances, APT flashes mixed market signals and is lagging the kind of explosive multiples speculative traders crave. Final Take: Where the Money’s Moving Ethereum continues to secure its spot as the backbone of DeFi and institutional treasuries. Aptos is innovating and securing more regulatory wins, but with limited immediate upside. In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting traders eager to ride the next bullish wave. With its low entry price at $0.00013428, audited supply cap and surging community, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming one of the top altcoins to watch for portfolio diversification with solid gains.

With constant shifts in investor behavior, technology upgrades, and unexpected market surges, knowing where to place your bets has never been more critical. As crypto adoption climbs again, everyone’s wondering which projects will actually deliver. For those looking to score big in 2025, the real search is for the top-performing cryptos today that combine fresh innovation with real user traction. Right now, four names are catching serious attention: Polkadot, VeChain, Sui, and Web3 ai. Each brings its own strengths, but Web3 ai stands out with unmatched presale ROI and AI-powered tools already attracting early whales. If you’re serious about catching the next wave of wealth in crypto, start with these top-performing cryptos today before prices run. 1. Web3 ai: Where AI Utility Meets Real ROI Potential Web3 ai is making serious noise among crypto watchers, aiming for utility-driven growth. With Stage 9 underway, the token sits at just $0.000443 and has already raised over $8.8 million. The final presale stage is set at $0.003267, with a projected listing price of $0.005242, delivering early participants up to 1747% gains. But this isn’t just about numbers. Web3 ai is backed by several smart AI tools built for real-world investing, ranging from portfolio tracking and yield management to scam alerts and market insights. Unlike speculative meme coins, $WAI serves as a gateway to staking, governance, and AI-driven trading tools. These features make it valuable even after the presale ends. Many now speculate that $WAI could climb to $5 over the long term. With both infrastructure and community growing fast, Web3 ai is one of the top-performing cryptos today, giving early backers a solid shot at outsized gains. 2. Polkadot: Tech-Driven Growth With Whale Confidence Polkadot (DOT) continues gaining traction due to its unique multichain structure and cross-chain messaging upgrades. Priced near $7.20, DOT is drawing increased whale attention after key developments in the XCM protocol and new parachain slot expansions. As more DeFi apps tap into Polkadot’s system, on-chain volume and total value locked are seeing a steady rise. With over half of DOT’s supply staked, the network shows strong internal confidence and user loyalty. Analysts expect DOT to push back into double digits as parachain growth expands. Whales have been quietly building positions throughout June, signaling long-term belief. For those looking beyond short-term pumps, Polkadot remains one of the top-performing cryptos today, driven by its solid tech and interoperability edge. 3. VeChain: Where Enterprise Adoption Meets Real Utility VeChain (VET), currently near $0.031, is backed by serious enterprise integrations. With use cases spanning logistics, healthcare, and sustainability, VET has become a go-to for corporations like Walmart China and DNV. The recent rollout of VeBetterDAO and incentive-driven marketplaces has sparked higher network activity and brought new developers into the fold. One major strength is its dual-token model: VET handles value transfers, while VTHO covers fees, keeping enterprise adoption cost-effective. Whale wallets have picked up massive amounts of VET since June, reflecting trust in VeChain’s growth story. As global attention turns toward sustainability, VeChain’s real-world blockchain usage cements its place among the top-performing cryptos today. 4. Sui: High-Speed Blockchain With a Growing Ecosystem Sui (SUI) is making headlines thanks to its high throughput and unique programming framework. Currently around $0.84, Sui leverages the Move language and handles up to 297,000 transactions per second in test settings. That kind of performance is attracting DeFi builders, NFT creators, and GameFi developers to its network. Sui also benefits from low gas fees and strong support from its foundation through grants and dev events. Whale tracking shows a growing number of large wallets accumulating SUI since new bridges and listings were announced. As user-friendly features roll out, and with more developers choosing Sui for its speed and scalability, it’s clear this coin is among the top-performing cryptos today with real breakout potential. Final Words! There’s no shortage of coins making noise, but only a few show the kind of traction, tech, and tokenomics that lead to real returns. Web3 ai, Polkadot, VeChain, and Sui are top-performing cryptos today with clear use cases and growing demand. Web3 ai leads with its presale momentum and access to real AI-powered investing tools, while Polkadot delivers cross-chain utility that developers love. Meanwhile, VeChain shows blockchain is already reshaping enterprise systems, and Sui proves next-gen blockchains can be both fast and scalable. For those aiming to make smart moves before the next crypto bull run hits full swing, these four projects deserve a close look. Stick with the top-performing cryptos today , and you might just be early to the next big breakout.

While tokens, DAOs, and smart contracts have achieved some of this, the actual process of managing decentralized communities still depends heavily on human effort. Moderating Telegram groups, welcoming new users, and keeping engagement high are tasks that remain manual, repetitive, and difficult to scale. That could soon shift. In 2025, a new concept is beginning to gain momentum at the intersection of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology: autonomous AI agents that operate independently on-chain. These are not abstract concepts, they are already being tested. Unstaked is one of the few platforms actively working to make this technology accessible for every Web3 project, regardless of scale or technical expertise. Understanding AI Agents & Their Relevance AI agents are software programs that function autonomously, respond to user input, and evolve their behavior through interaction. Unlike basic bots or scripts, these agents can learn from their environment, enhance their performance, and carry out complex workflows without direct supervision. While Web2 examples include AI-powered customer service systems and recommendation engines, Web3 presents unique demands. In this space, there are no centralized servers or private backends. AI agents must operate independently, transparently, and in a decentralized manner. This is the gap that Unstaked aims to close. Unstaked’s Infrastructure for Autonomous Web3 Agents Unstaked is building a platform that lets users design, customize, and launch decentralized AI agents using the $UNSD token. These agents are tailored to real-world applications in crypto, such as moderating community forums, handling live chats, onboarding users, responding to queries, and managing campaign execution. Unlike proprietary AI tools, Unstaked’s agents operate entirely on-chain. Every task performed by an agent is recorded and visible, allowing for transparency and accountability. This proof-of-intelligence system builds the trust needed for agents to act on behalf of decentralized communities. Unstaked has also released a product demo , offering a glimpse into its dashboard and capabilities. The interface enables users to build agents without writing code, define behavior rules, and assign tasks, all within a streamlined, no-code environment. Though the demo represents an early version, it shows Unstaked’s platform is ready for practical use, offering a much-needed solution for launching AI agents across blockchain-native ecosystems. The Role of the $UNSD Token in the Agent Economy $UNSD is central to the entire Unstaked platform. It enables users to: Deploy and run AI agents Access advanced automation templates Unlock higher-level agent behavior models Engage with agent marketplaces Pay for usage costs through crypto-native microtransactions Unstaked replaces traditional SaaS subscription models with a blockchain-based pricing structure. Agents start at just $10 to $20 per month, paid in $UNSD. This approach gives communities access to scalable automation tools at a fraction of the cost of employing human support teams. As more agents are deployed, demand for UNSD naturally rises. This builds a utility-focused feedback loop, differentiating it from many tokens that rely primarily on price speculation. Strong Presale Performance & Market Interest Unstaked is currently in Stage 22 of its presale, offering UNSD tokens at $0.01209. The projected launch price is approximately $0.1819, suggesting a potential return of 2700%, depending on platform growth and adoption. To date, Unstaked has raised more than $10.8 million and sold 1.2 billion tokens, putting it among the most active infrastructure-based crypto projects in 2025. This momentum shows that the idea of decentralized AI tools is gaining real interest beyond theory. Looking ahead, crypto communities may rely less on human moderators and support teams. Instead, autonomous agents could oversee education, onboarding, campaign management, and even trigger smart contract actions based on behavioral data. This transition is not far off. Unstaked is one of the few projects building the backend required for it. By allowing users to control agent functions and infrastructure, Unstaked combines usability, transparency, and scalability in one platform. Closing Thoughts The arrival of AI agents in Web3 is not just about convenience, it addresses a growing need. As decentralized systems expand globally, there is a rising demand for intelligent, self-managing tools. Unstaked meets this challenge with a toolkit built for real-world use. With a live demo, active presale, and product roadmap tied to actual deployment, Unstaked is shaping up to be a key player in the evolution of crypto infrastructure. As AI becomes more than just a market theme and starts powering core Web3 functions, platforms like Unstaked may become essential to how decentralized communities grow, adapt, and function.

While headlines are busy celebrating Solana’s first U.S.-based ETF and Hedera’s steady push into enterprise solutions, there’s a newcomer drawing surprising attention— MAGACOIN FINANCE . This bold, politically flavored memecoin isn’t just holding its price; it’s gaining momentum. The question buzzing through Telegram groups and crypto Twitter: could MAGACOIN FINANCE start attracting the kind of serious backing usually reserved for blue-chip tokens? What Is MAGACOIN FINANCE All About? At its core, MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t your average altcoin. It blends meme appeal with real features—like a zero-tax system, capped supply, and full smart contract audits. But the real kicker? It leans into a highly recognizable political brand, one that sparks conversation (and some controversy) everywhere it goes. The coin is built for community first. Unlike many meme coins that rely on hype alone, MAGACOIN FINANCE emphasizes grassroots momentum and long-term involvement. Its “Make America Great Again” branding is part of its identity, turning what some might see as a joke into a powerful narrative that resonates with a specific crowd. What Sets MAGACOIN FINANCE Apart in a Crowded Market Solana’s hitting its stride. It’s got a new ETF, sky-high trading volumes, and an upcoming upgrade that could make it one of the fastest blockchains around. Hedera, meanwhile, is playing the long game, building partnerships and integrating tools for regulated industries. MAGACOIN FINANCE doesn’t try to compete in the same way. It’s not built on speed or corporate partnerships—it’s built on culture. It’s early-stage, driven by people who want to see a specific message succeed. Where Solana and Hedera feel polished, MAGACOIN FINANCE is raw, loud, and unapologetically community-driven. The Buzz Is Real Check the numbers—over 20,000 members in its Telegram, with more joining daily. The website traffic is spiking, and whispers of an exchange listing are picking up steam. Investors are showing up fast, with each presale round selling out in just hours. Between the decentralized structure , strong online presence, and politically charged branding, this isn’t just another meme coin—it’s starting to feel like a movement. The Takeaway: MAGACOIN FINANCE Is One to Watch Closely While Hedera cools off and Solana dominates headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building something different. It’s not trying to replace the big names—it’s carving out its own space in the market.

Tron’s steady rise in USDT volume and SUI’s reaction to its big token unlock show how fast the market can change and why picking the right project could make all the difference. While both tokens continue to make an impact, BlockDAG (BDAG) is drawing attention through major figures and its upcoming BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release. With over $330 million raised, 23.6 billion coins sold, and the presale now in batch 29 at $0.0276, BlockDAG is offering a unique chance to buy in at just $0.0016 until August 11. This price, supported by full audits and growing mining support, places BlockDAG among the top choices in the best crypto coins for 2025 category. Tron Growth Sparks Discussion on Long-Term Strength The Tron (TRX) market outlook is gaining momentum, supported by its role in decentralised media and strong alliances. Its recent spike in USDT transactions has stood out during a market dip, showing stable usage. Tron continues to attract developers who value fast, low-cost transfers. Its system backs stablecoin activity and DeFi projects, which gives it practical use. Still, some concerns remain about how decentralised Tron really is and how it will handle bigger demand in the future. Questions about governance and scaling continue, yet Tron keeps showing signs that it may have more growth ahead. SUI Faces Pressure Post-Unlock but Shows Developer Appeal The SUI price movement has shifted after its recent $164 million token unlock, which brought negative pressure. Even so, SUI’s Layer 1 setup focused on speed and cost is keeping developer interest strong. It handles smart contracts and on-chain assets easily, which could help build out its platform. However, rising competition and market changes present challenges. SUI’s next steps depend on how well it manages its token system and earns continued support from its community and builders. BlockDAG Sets Stage With $0.0016 Entry and Growing User Base The BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release is putting the project in a different category from other rising coins. It’s now giving early access to one of the lowest prices offered since the first batch. With more than $330 million raised, 23.6 billion coins sold, and current pricing at batch 29’s $0.0276, the project is moving fast. Right now, a limited-time offer allows users to grab BDAG at just $0.0016 until August 11. This pricing is one of the lowest seen since batch 1 and is aimed at bringing in more users before the official launch begins. More than just a low entry point, BlockDAG is building trust through audits from Halborn and CertiK. These checks confirm the system is prepared for future expansion and focused on long-term strength. The project is not only looking at short-term growth but also shaping a stable foundation. Along with solid pricing and security, BlockDAG shows signs of real activity. Over 18,300 miners have been sold, and the X1 Mining App is helping grow its user network. These tools are already working in the market. For those following the Tron (TRX) market outlook or watching the SUI price movement, BlockDAG’s security features, strong presale numbers, and the upcoming BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release make it one to keep an eye on. It’s now gaining attention as one of the best crypto coins for 2025. Quick Take: Tron, SUI, and BlockDAG on the Radar The Tron (TRX) market outlook shows steady signs, backed by strong USDT activity. Still, some questions remain about its ability to scale and its governance structure, which may shape where Tron heads next. The SUI price movement shifted after a large token unlock changed short-term expectations. But its flexible Layer 1 design keeps builders interested, and it still holds value in the current space. BlockDAG, meanwhile, is drawing attention through its BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release, offering a rare $0.0016 entry until August 11. This price sits far below batch 29’s $0.0276. With a $330 million presale, audits from top firms, and a rising number of miners, BlockDAG is positioning itself among the best crypto coins for 2025 . For those acting early, this could be the moment that makes the difference.

Although the digital asset remains down 19% on a year-over-year (YoY) basis, some analysts are optimistic that it’s ready for a liftoff. Ethereum Enters Wyckoff ‘Liftoff’ Phase In an X post published today, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader noted that Ethereum appears to be following the Wyckoff Accumulation pattern and has successfully cleared both the ‘creek’ and ‘spring’ phases, potentially entering the ‘liftoff’ phase characterized by parabolic price action. Related Reading: Ethereum Breakout Imminent? Broadening Wedge Hints At $4,200 Surge In the Wyckoff accumulation pattern, the ‘creek’ represents overhead resistance where price struggles to break higher, while the ‘spring’ is a false breakdown below support, meant to trap bears and confirm strong hands. The ‘liftoff’ phase follows the spring, marked by a sharp recovery and breakout above resistance, signaling the start of a new bullish trend. The analyst shared the following Ethereum daily chart, which shows the cryptocurrency on the verge of a potential breakout, with its next major resistance at the $3,700 level. A successful breakout and retest of this level could set the stage for a new all-time high (ATH). Fellow crypto analyst Crypto GEMs also pointed toward Ethereum getting ready for a significant move to the upside. The analyst shared the following chart which compares ETH’s price action in 2025 to that in 2024. If Ethereum mirrors its 2024 performance, it could break above the $3,000 mark in the near term. However, not all analysts share this bullish outlook. For instance, noted crypto analyst Carl Moon shared a four-hour Ethereum chart showing the asset trading within a rising wedge pattern. He cautioned that unless ETH breaks out of this formation, it may face a drop to $2,200. To explain, a rising wedge pattern is a bearish chart formation where price moves upward within converging trendlines, indicating weakening bullish momentum. It often signals an upcoming breakdown, as buyers lose control and sellers push the price lower after the wedge is breached. ETH Network Sees Renewed Activity In a separate X post, crypto analyst CryptoGoos remarked that daily transactions on Ethereum are nearing ATH level for the first time since 2021. Typically, heightened network activity tends to precede major price movements. Analyst Crypto Rover echoed this view, noting that active addresses across the Ethereum network have hit a new all-time high. They added that ETH below $3,000 is “an absolute steal.” Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross On Daily Chart – Is A New ATH Within Reach? Meanwhile, Ethereum liquid staking is also inching toward historic levels, with 35.5 million ETH now locked. At press time, ETH trades at $2,522, down 3.8% in the past 24 hours.

This decentralized political memecoin is gaining traction fast, leveraging cultural relevance and community-first principles to draw attention during a phase of Bitcoin consolidation. With BTC trading just under major resistance levels and short-term optimism showing signs of fatigue, traders are increasingly looking for early-stage altcoins that combine narrative strength with transparent tokenomics. MAGACOIN FINANCE is meeting that demand by offering not only meme-driven virality but also a strong ideological identity. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Grabbing Trader Interest Bitcoin remains the market anchor, but its current rangebound behavior—hovering between $106,500 and $109,000—has led many to look elsewhere for growth catalysts. As 97% of BTC supply sits in profit, profit-taking and increased volatility are likely. This has opened a window for tokens that aren’t dependent on macro catalysts. MAGACOIN FINANCE is thriving in that gap, driven by: A grassroots political theme that resonates with today’s crypto-savvy, ideologically driven investor A fixed supply and zero-tax structure that encourages clean trading and long-term holding Increasing market visibility via Telegram growth, Twitter engagement, and early analyst coverage A community-based roadmap that emphasizes decentralized control over VC-backed influence Rather than react to market cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building a brand—one that blends humor, resistance, and decentralized ideals into one package. Not Just a Meme Coin—A Cultural Statement MAGACOIN FINANCE separates itself from other memecoins through purpose. It’s not just a token chasing virality—it’s a political and cultural statement against centralization and gatekeeping in both traditional finance and blockchain governance. That positioning places it alongside community-aligned projects like Cardano and Ethereum in philosophy, while operating in the meme-layer ecosystem popularized by Dogecoin and SHIBA INU. It bridges these two worlds: the entertainment value of memes and the conviction of decentralized movements. This hybrid identity is fueling a sense of belonging among holders who view crypto not just as a market—but as a movement. Why Market Analysts Are Watching Closely With Bitcoin dominance still high and many top altcoins consolidating, attention is turning to tokens that show organic growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE has already crossed key traction milestones, including: Over 20,000 active community members across platforms Inclusion in early “watchlist” articles by altcoin analysts Strong participation from politically engaged investor segments Rumors of exchange readiness and upcoming feature rollouts As Bitcoin prepares for potentially volatile July sessions and macro conditions fluctuate around U.S. Federal Reserve decisions, many believe the cultural layer of crypto could lead the next wave of rotation. MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned as a leading candidate. The Bottom Line: MAGACOIN FINANCE Taps Into 2025’s Meme-Political Wave Bitcoin may be holding its ground just below a psychological milestone, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is moving differently. It’s not waiting for ETF headlines or macro decisions—it’s building a decentralized brand powered by meme culture and political relevance. For investors seeking the next wave of crypto identity projects—where culture, narrative, and ownership align—MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a frontrunner.

Shiba Inu Has 62% Of Its Supply Controlled By Top 10 Whales In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has shared how some top coins currently compare against each other in terms of the percentage of supply held by the ten largest wallets on the respective networks. Below is a chart showing the trend in this metric for eight cryptocurrencies: Shiba Inu, Ethereum, Pepe, USDT, USDC, DAI, Chainlink (LINK), and Uniswap (UNI). As is visible in the graph, the stablecoin USDC has the lowest amount of supply concentrated on the top 10 addresses among these assets at around 27%. Chainlink and DAI come close with the metric sitting at 32% and 33%, respectively. Others like Uniswap and Ethereum, however, have a more significant part of their supply under the control of these humongous entities: 51% and 49%, respectively. One asset that particularly stands out is Shiba Inu, with a massive 62% of its supply belonging to the ten largest whales on the network. For comparison, the other memecoin on the list, Pepe, has the same metric at 39%. Generally, the centralization of supply on just a few hands isn’t a constructive sign for any cryptocurrency’s stability, as tokens signify power on the network. It’s especially relevant in the case of a proof-of-stake (PoS) asset like Ethereum. As Santiment explains, As a retail trader, it’s generally safer to hold coins with less supply held by the most elite whales. There is less risk of sudden dumps or price manipulation should an asset’s largest whales decide to exit their positions. Given this, the assets like Ethereum, Uniswap, and Shiba Inu that currently have a majority of their supply or close to it in the hands of the top 10 whales may not be in the best position right now. In some other news, the cryptocurrency market sentiment is on the verge of extreme greed, according to the Fear & Greed Index. The Fear & Greed Index is an indicator created by Alternative that inputs a few different factors to determine the investor mentality as a score lying between zero and hundred. As displayed above, the cryptocurrency Fear & Greed has a value of 73 at the moment. This corresponds to the presence of a strong sentiment of greed present among the traders. Historically, markets have often moved in the direction that goes contrary to the expectations of the crowd. The probability of a contrary move is especially strong in the extreme ends of the index. For now, the market is still outside of the extreme greed zone, but only by a couple of units. SHIB Price At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading around $0.0000115, up over 3% in the last seven days.

Turkey’s Capital Markets Board (CMB) has reportedly blocked access to 46 crypto websites, including the second-largest global decentralized exchange, PancakeSwap. The Capital Markets Board (CMB), Turkey’s main financial watchdog, said in an official announcement that the platforms were offering “unlicensed crypto asset services” to Turkish residents—an action deemed a violation of the country’s Capital Markets Law. The list of banned entities includes a mix of crypto exchanges, trading apps, and even information-based platforms like Cryptoradar, a popular cryptocurrency price comparison site. PancakeSwap alone saw over $325.2 billion in trading volume in June, making it a major player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem alongside Uniswap and Curve. Turkish regulators now consider the platform’s operations illegal despite its global status. The CMB did not reveal the individuals who violated the regulations. It’s also not said whether the targeted platforms had received prior warning or an opportunity to comply with local laws before the shutdown. PancakeSwap had not made a public statement at the time of this writing. This marks a radical change in Turkey’s approach to crypto services and suggests a move toward centralized control in an industry meant to be borderless and decentralized. Turkey tightens crypto oversight The move against crypto sites is part of a broader push by Turkish regulators to establish order and legal clarity in a market that has expanded rapidly but in a largely unregulated fashion. Turkey introduced new regulations aimed at curbing crimes like money laundering and terrorism financing. Under these rules, crypto platforms are required to identify and verify their users, particularly when transactions involve funds from newly unregistered wallet addresses. On the other hand, users are expected to give a transaction description of at least 20 characters for each transfer. Apart from transaction descriptions, platforms are now expected to impose holding periods on crypto withdrawals when the Travel Rule is not applicable. This includes a 48-hour delay for most withdrawals and a 72-hour delay for the first withdrawal from any newly created account. If a transaction appears suspicious or lacks proper documentation, service providers can flag it as high-risk. They may then refuse or halt the transfer or impose restrictions such as bans, limits, or account freezes on the user involved. Transactions below 15,000 lira do not have to undergo identity checks. Still, regulators have warned that those trying to split larger transfers into smaller transactions to fly under the radar may also be flagged. Turkey aligns with global crypto crackdown efforts Turkey is now the latest country to join a growing list of countries closing in on the crypto industry. Russia, Kazakhstan, Venezuela, and the Philippines have all moved to restrict access to platforms that do not have local authorization and are not meeting regulatory standards. Critics say Turkey’s move should also be interpreted as part of its broader attempts to stabilize the ailing national economy and shield ordinary citizens from scams, fraud, and highly volatile financial products. Cryptocurrency adoption in Turkey has surged recently, driven by the country’s high inflation and weakening lira. To others, crypto has become an alternative store of value and carries huge risks. In 2021, it prohibited using digital assets for payments, arguing that they created a risk to financial stability. The decision mobilized public anger and prompted legal challenges, but the ban took effect. A domestic law firm started preparing to challenge the ban in court earlier this year, indicating that the legal infrastructure for crypto in Turkey remains a work in progress. This week’s enforcement action seemed to attempt to establish a position of regulatory primacy before that legal uncertainty expands. It is unclear whether the blocked platforms can reapply or appeal their banning via a local license. In the meantime, blocked platforms remain out of reach of Turkish users unless they are accessed through VPNs or other methods, putting them at legal risk.

While XRP enjoys a wave of optimism thanks to regulatory breakthroughs, traders are increasingly diversifying into newer, story-driven assets. In particular, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a notable destination for capital rotating out of large caps, drawing interest even as other networks like Sui and Pi struggle to sustain comparable momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE Taps Into Meme Energy and Political Themes While XRP consolidates around its evolving narrative, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction for very different reasons. Branded as both a meme-powered altcoin and a decentralized political memecoin , the project is cutting through the crowded crypto landscape by blending ideological messaging with internet culture. This fusion is appealing to traders who want more than technical milestones — they’re buying into a community ethos centered on decentralization and cultural identity. Unlike many projects that focus heavily on tech updates or institutional roadmaps, MAGACOIN FINANCE has leaned into its grassroots appeal. Its zero-tax approach and emphasis on community-driven governance resonate with market participants increasingly wary of centralization. As a result, it’s building a strong base on platforms like Telegram and X (Twitter), with discussions often revolving around its potential to become a flagship for political narratives within the meme coin sector. XRP Clears Major Regulatory Hurdles, Spurs Rotations XRP has been at the heart of recent market conversations, primarily due to the long-awaited resolution of Ripple’s legal standoff with the SEC. With both parties moving to withdraw appeals after a multi-year battle and a closed-door SEC session expected to formalize the end of the case, the regulatory fog that once clouded XRP’s outlook is finally lifting. This newfound clarity is fueling speculation that an XRP ETF could be right around the corner. Big institutional names have already been linked to preliminary discussions, and with court restrictions on Ripple’s institutional sales now removed, the door is open for expanded enterprise adoption. On-chain data also suggests that whales and retail holders alike are taking positions, as wallet activity and broader engagement continue to trend upward. Sui and Pi Struggle to Match Enthusiasm Despite Headlines Meanwhile, Sui and Pi are each trying to navigate their own pivotal moments — but neither has captured the same groundswell of trader enthusiasm. Sui, for example, is managing a hefty token unlock that added millions of new coins to circulation. While some investors see long-term promise in Sui’s growing ecosystem, Nasdaq’s spot ETF filing, and recent high-profile investments, short-term caution is dominating sentiment as the market processes this fresh supply. Technical patterns still point to a challenging near-term landscape, with analysts watching to see if demand can balance the latest unlock. Pi Network is also at a crossroads. Major unlock events in July are swelling the available supply, sparking concerns of potential selling pressure. At the same time, Pi’s ecosystem updates — from an AI-driven app builder to improved staking and KYC systems — show real developmental progress. However, without a major exchange listing on the horizon, many traders are choosing to remain on the sidelines. A Market Driven by Storylines as Much as Stats The contrasting trajectories of these projects highlight how sentiment and narrative continue to steer crypto flows.

However, Ethereum (ETH) has lately been sending mixed signals, which has led to a lot of doubt amongst investors. These mixed signals have pushed ETH holders into MUTM tokens as they seek out new growth. So far, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $11.7 million, a testament to the hunger for growth in the crypto sector. A major advantage that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers is that it is an early-stage project, which means all its upside has not been explored. Investors are pouring into the project in expectation of explosive growth followed by steady gains. Let us take a deep dive into this exciting project. The protocol design Mutuum Finance operates as a decentralized non-custodial lending protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. Lenders deposit assets into the protocol’s liquidity pools to earn interest, while borrowers deposit collateral into the pools to access the liquidity. To ensure the stability of the protocol, Mutuum Finance requires that all loans be overcollateralized. That means the borrowers must deposit collateral that is worth more than the value of the loan they take. This ensures that in case of rapid price shifts, there is enough of a buffer in which liquidators can act. Liquidators step in when a loan position dips below the safe level of collateralization. When that happens, they purchase the debt at a discount, helping to keep bad debt from accumulating in the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): an emerging top contender Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in the presale phase, where tokens are going for $0.03. So far, around 12,700 unique buyers have taken part in the presale, buying over $11.7 million worth of tokens. The current price of the tokens in phase 5 is a 200% increase from the initial listing price of $0.01. In phase 6, the token price will increase by 16.67% to $0.035. One of the impacts of this increase is that it will reduce the existing 50% discount on the token price based on the launch price of $0.06. That is a massive opportunity that you should not let slip away. Analysts forecast massive growth for MUTM tokens, and they expect the token price to rapidly climb 37x when the tokens go live. This massive surge will be followed by a period of growth, according to the forecasts. The projected gains mean that if you invest $1400 in the presale today, your investment could grow to over $51,000. This massive return is just a few clicks away. Best of all, since there is no upper limit on how much you can invest in the presale, it could be your biggest gainer of 2025. One of the reasons why analysts are confident about sustained gains for MUTM tokens is the planned buyback program. In this program, Mutuum Finance will purchase MUTM tokens off the open market and redistribute them to stakers. These purchases will be carefully timed to ensure that they have the optimal impact on price increases. As such, holders of the tokens can experience sustained growth of their investment the longer that they hold. Analysts also point to explosive growth when the tokens launch. A major reason for this explosive growth is the planned launch of a beta version of the platform on the token listing day. This beta version is expected to generate massive amounts of organic traffic from the project. The crypto market will test out the beta platform’s features and share the good news on social media. As word spreads on its utility, it will trigger a new stream of capital into the project, which will lead to massive long-term gains. To take full advantage of this expected surge, buying tokens now while there is still a massive discount available is your best move. Mutuum Finance partners with CertiK Mutuum Finance revealed that they have partnered with CertiK on a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program. The goal of this program is to encourage the global security community to keep a close eye on the project. Additionally, a partnership with CertiK will ensure the team has access to the best advice on how to implement industry best practices when it comes to securing the project. The bounty program is split into four tiers, which are critical, major, minor, and low. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already secured a CertiK audit, where it received a Token Scan Score of 95. The results of the audit continue to inspire confidence in investors, and this high level of trust is expected to continue long after the tokens’ launch. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is signaling massive fast gains for its early adopters. With tokens currently available at a 50% discount on the listing price, the current price of $0.03 is a perfect entry point. Do not miss out on this opportunity.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $36.8. By 2031, ICP’s price might reach a maximum of $113.32. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. The network leverages advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025?

Volatility remains low, indicating consolidation. The coin continues to remain range-bound between $4.653 and $5.139. ICP 1-day price analysis: Internet Computer sees bearish consolidation near support levels As seen on the 1-day price chart for July 5, ICP is still in a consolidation phase, maintaining a range-bound structure between key support and resistance levels. The price is currently near the lower end of this range, with immediate support at $4.443. The immediate resistance is at $4.883, with an upper resistance zone near $5.139. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The broader price movement shows a descending channel, with the price recently moving through this channel after peaking above $5.100. The MACD histogram is showing negative momentum, with the line in bearish territory, supporting the ongoing downward pressure despite the minor price fluctuations. Any break below the current range could open the door to further declines towards $4.5. ICP price analysis for 4-hour: Volume is low, as ICP retests support On the 4-hour chart, ICP sits just slightly above the lower Bollinger band at $4.661, acting as critical support. The recent price action suggests a tight range and a lack of strong directional movement. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The On-Balance Volume (OBV) is showing a downward trend, which confirms that selling pressure is dominant, despite the price attempting to hold above the support levels. A positive shift in volume accumulation would confirm more buying interest and could lead ICP to retest the $4.898 resistance. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $4.89 SELL SMA 5 $5.03 SELL SMA 10 $5.00 SELL SMA 21 $5.11 SELL SMA 50 $5.28 SELL SMA 100 $5.25 SELL SMA 200 $6.30 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $5.07 SELL EMA 5 $5.11 SELL EMA 10 $5.13 SELL EMA 21 $5.24 SELL EMA 50 $5.79 SELL EMA 100 $6.78 SELL EMA 200 $7.85 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis ICP is currently range-bound between $4.443 support and $5.139 resistance. The negative momentum on the MACD and OBV indicates downside risk. A break below $4.600 could lead to further declines, while a sustained move above $5.139 may signal a bullish shift. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed.

These laws allow enforcement agencies to confiscate assets even if it cannot be proved that someone has broken the law. This means if officials believe that anyone has earned cryptocurrency illegally or that person cannot explain where the money came from, the police and other arms of the government will be able to acquire it by law. Swedish lawmakers advocate for a national Bitcoin reserve The new laws are one of the strictest in Europe, Strömmer noted. Following reliable sources, the rule prompted the seizure of 80 million Swedish kronor, equivalent to $8.4 million in assets. According to the website of the Swedish parliament, this law also applies to children and young people, as well as those who suffered from a severe mental disorder at the time of the crime. Based on the Minister of Justice they aim to ensure that the authorities work together more closely and pay special attention to assets that bring big profits. “Now it’s a matter of turning up the pressure further,” Strömmer said. Strömmer’s requests for more active seizures come as some Riksdag lawmakers advocate creating a national Bitcoin reserve . This approach resembles the trend in the US, Czechia, and Italy. In the meantime, a leading advocate of a Bitcoin reserve, Dennis Dioukarev, a Member of the Riksdag, commented on the topic of discussion. Dioukarev told reporters he agrees with Strömmer’s calls to increase seizure enforcement. He welcomed every effort to seize illegally obtained assets. Dioukarev argued that this would help to fight crime and make life hard for criminals. As for what will or should be done with seized crypto, Dioukarev reiterates his calls for the accumulation of a strategic reserve. Based on his explanation, cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin in particular that are confiscated should be transferred to Sweden’s central bank, the Riksbank, to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve. The Swedish authorities reveal increasing cryptocurrency adoption among criminals When reporters last asked Minister Strömmer’s press office about the fate of seized cryptocurrencies, one of his press officers responded that they could not answer those questions then. This inability to comment also extended to questions about what steps Strömmer and the Swedish government intend to take to enhance crypto-related asset seizures. In 2024, 62,000 individuals were part of or linked to criminal networks in Sweden, according to the Bloomsbury Intelligence & Security Institute. Drug dealers and money launderers were among those using cryptocurrency a lot, though it is hard to measure exactly how much. Additionally, in September, the Police Authority and the Financial Intelligence Unit in Sweden reported that some cryptocurrency exchanges were skilled money launderers. The report recommended that law enforcement gradually increase its monitoring and infiltration of crypto exchange platforms to help detect and disrupt illegal operations.

An analyst suggests that the flagship crypto’s daily close could set the stage for a bullish end of the week despite potential volatility. Related Reading: SUI Prepares For Bullish Flag Breakout Amid $3 Reclaim – Analyst Doubles The Target Bitcoin Breakout To Come ‘Sooner Or Later’ At the start of the new quarter, Bitcoin has retested crucial levels, touching the $105,000 support and $110,000 resistance over the past four days. Amid its Tuesday pullback, the flagship crypto fell to a two-week low but managed to bounce from a crucial range. Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems previously noted that BTC needed a strong rebound from the “most important” support and resistance area, between the $104,000 and $106,000 price levels, explaining that failing to hold this range would open the door for a drop to the range lows around $101,000. On Friday, the analyst highlighted Bitcoin’s price action after holding the key levels, which “provided the perfect entry for a bounce, just as expected.” Following this performance, he asserted that Bitcoin is expanding on its two-month Power of Three (Po3) setup, signaling that potential further expansion is ahead. Nonetheless, he pointed out that the flagship crypto is still trading in a two-month range, suggesting a volatile price action until the price successfully breaks out, which it has attempted to do earlier this week. “Since we are in a range, we are forced to respect the key levels of the range: high, mid, and low,” Sjuul detailed, adding that all eyes are currently on the mid-range, where bulls must step in to confirm the bullish move to the range high. Based on this, the analyst forecasted another move above the $110,00 mark, where “we have left a lot of unfinished business” and “plenty of liquidity lies.” He pointed to a huge cluster near the $111,000 area in BTC’s Liquidity Heatmap, affirming that “price is attracted by liquidity, so I am expecting that level to be visited sooner or later.” BTC Eyes Pivotal Closes After being rejected from the $108,000 at the start of the week, analyst Rekt Capital noted that Bitcoin broke out of two 2-week downtrends in the past 40 days but was rejected from the crucial 6-week diagonal downtrend, around the $108,000 mark, during the same timeframe. This week, BTC closed above this resistance twice, and daily closed above the $109,000 mark on Thursday. However, Friday’s pullback saw Bitcoin drop below the crucial level, falling to the $107,245 area. The analyst considers that a key retest of the pattern is in progress. He previously explained that any dipping into the top of Bitcoin’s pattern could “technically be considered additional retesting to further solidify the recently broken black diagonal resistance into new support.” Nonetheless, BTC must close today above the diagonal resistance for a successful retest. “Bitcoin is losing the diagonal for the moment. But if price Daily Closes above the diagonal, then this will have ended as a downside wick as part of a volatile retest. Upcoming Daily Close will be pivotal,” he stated.

In 2017, Ethereum earned that spot. In 2021, it was Solana. Now, in 2025, BlockDAG appears to be stepping into that same role. What started as a quietly promising Layer 1 is now being called the most viral presale of the year. Conversations about BlockDAG (BDAG) have flooded every corner of the crypto internet, from Twitter to Telegram, Reddit threads to YouTube breakdowns. And the numbers reflect the excitement: over $329.5 million in funding, 200,000 holders, 2 million+ downloads of the X1 mining app, and 18,250 ASIC units sold. But what’s truly driving this momentum? It’s the nonstop surge in social attention, arriving just as altcoin season kicks off in Q3. X1 Miner App Explodes Past 2 Million Downloads At the core of BlockDAG’s viral rise is the X1 Miner App , a mobile mining tool that has become one of 2025’s most talked-about Web3 platforms. With over 2 million users onboard, it’s clear the growth wasn’t fueled by traditional ads or influencer campaigns. Instead, users themselves drove the buzz. Built on a Proof-of-Engagement model, the app rewards users for daily check-ins, inviting friends, and quick in-app tasks. That creates an ongoing loop where people earn BDAG, post their results, bring in new users, and repeat. Screenshots of mining rewards, invite bonuses, and leaderboard rankings now fill crypto spaces like Reddit, Twitter, and Discord. This flywheel effect has turned the X1 app into a grassroots phenomenon, where the community becomes both the miner and the marketer. As a result, the app has evolved from a utility to a social engine, pushing downloads even higher each day. BlockDAG Goes Global with Major Sports Deals BlockDAG’s presence isn’t limited to screens and feeds. It’s entering the real world through major sports collaborations. Recent sponsorships with the Seattle Seawolves (rugby) and Seattle Orcas (cricket) have made waves both inside and outside the crypto industry. Just days after the announcements, branded gear, athlete shoutouts, and behind-the-scenes content started trending. Fans, athletes, and crypto personalities began sharing BlockDAG photos online, with one message getting louder across platforms: Web3 is entering the spotlight, and BlockDAG is leading the charge. There’s more. Sources close to the project have confirmed a third U.S.-based sponsorship deal will be signed soon. It’s awaiting final regulatory clearance and could rank among the largest sports partnerships in crypto history once revealed. These aren’t just brand plays, they’re strategic bridges between Web3 and massive real-world audiences. And for BlockDAG, that bridge is proving very effective. Social Surge: BlockDAG Dominates TikTok, X, and More Building a single strong crypto community is hard. Building one across every major platform at the same time is nearly unheard of. But BlockDAG has done just that. Here’s how its online presence stacks up: Twitter (X): Over 120,000 mentions in July alone Telegram: A thriving network of 100,000+ members across buying hubs, support groups, and regional chats YouTube: Dozens of user-made videos ranging from mining tutorials to BDAG price speculation TikTok and Discord: Fast-growing followings where the conversation never slows What makes this unique is the cross-platform synergy. BlockDAG isn’t relying on one channel; it’s dominating all of them at once. That level of exposure directly supports its massive presale performance, turning online buzz into measurable ecosystem growth. BDAG at $0.0016 Until August 11: Here’s What That Means Despite all the attention, BlockDAG’s presale still offers BDAG at $0.0016, locked in until August 11. After that, the coin will move toward its confirmed launch price of $0.05. This means buyers are looking at a potential 3,025% gain from current levels. But this limited-time pricing isn’t the only thing drawing interest. Several powerful signals are converging right now: A functioning ecosystem, not just a roadmap Unmatched social buzz across every major platform Confirmed real-world sponsorships connecting Web3 to mainstream sports A launch plan is already in motion as the BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release approaches in August This isn’t hype for the sake of it. The project is laying down infrastructure and onboarding users daily, all while the broader market catches up. Final Thoughts Crypto is no stranger to buzz, but what BlockDAG is doing goes well beyond the usual trend cycle. With a mining app that’s changing how mobile users participate, real sports sponsorships bringing new eyes to Web3, and nonstop activity across Twitter and Telegram, BDAG isn’t following the market; it’s shaping it. The BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release is set for August 11, and miner hardware is ready to roll out. The app is growing. The community is expanding. And the crypto presale is entering its final stages. BlockDAG is no longer the best-kept secret in crypto. It’s the most talked-about project of the moment, and if the current pace continues, it could soon define the next chapter in Layer 1 evolution.

This rally happened as Bitcoin crossed $110,000 and Ethereum climbed beyond $2,600, fueling optimism across the crypto market. Yet beneath the surface, whale behavior hinted at a different trend one pointing toward a new contender: Pepeto. While PEPE was rallying, on-chain metrics revealed early signs of change. Whale wallets holding PEPE tokens increased their positions by 5% over the last month, while the total exchange balances dropped to their lowest level in nearly two years. Such patterns often precede either large breakouts or sudden sell-offs. Reports now suggest many whales are rotating funds into Pepeto instead. PEPE: Bullish But Facing Questions PEPE’s move higher was largely driven by positive sentiment around Ethereum and renewed confidence in the broader crypto space. As an ERC-20 token, PEPE tends to follow Ethereum’s momentum during big moves. Nansen shows whales now control around 7.95 trillion PEPE tokens, up from earlier levels, and the top 100 wallets alone hold roughly 302 trillion. Meanwhile, Pepeto still trades at just $0.000000138. However, as PEPE’s supply on exchanges keeps falling, more holders are moving assets into cold storage. Some analysts view this as preparation for volatility or an exit plan. Despite its popularity, PEPE’s lack of utility has led some investors to look for alternatives with more substance. Pepeto: Where Meme Coins Meet Real Utility As whales explore new options, Pepeto is emerging as a strong challenger. Rather than relying only on viral buzz, Pepeto focuses on practical features and sustainable value. The project includes a dedicated meme coin exchange, staking incentives, and cross-chain bridging technology. So far, Pepeto’s presale has raised over $5.5 million. With a capped supply of 420 trillion tokens, 30% is reserved for presale participants and another 30% for staking. This design supports liquidity and rewards committed investors. Holders can earn staking returns of up to 271% APY, distributed on a per-block basis over two years. Pepeto’s clear roadmap is split into four phases, each focused on building long-term trust and rolling out tools. This strategic plan helps it stand apart in a market often dominated by hype-driven tokens. A New Year’s Message from the God of Frogs As the New Year begins, the God of Frogs, Pepeto Himself, shares a message of triumph and faith for the loyal Pepeto Army: The Plan Unfolds: The roadmap progresses flawlessly, as foretold. Every milestone has been achieved, and the… pic.twitter.com/zCmy1bTRQY — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) January 1, 2025 What Sets Pepeto Apart Pepeto brings together several innovations that matter to serious investors: Smooth token bridging across major blockchains A zero-fee DEX for meme coin trading Staking with transparent, high-yield rewards As the crypto space matures, investors increasingly demand real utility and robust frameworks. Pepeto’s focus on both makes it an appealing option. Timing is everything. Whales moving from PEPE to Pepeto could be an early sign of a larger trend. For traders and holders searching for high-upside projects, Pepeto checks many of the right boxes.

Two wallets that had remained dormant for over 14 years each transferred 10,000 BTC to new addresses around early Friday, as CoinDesk reported . The two addresses had initially received their coins on April 3, 2011, when bitcoin traded at just 78 cents. That BTC is now worth over $1.1 billion per wallet at current prices, marking an appreciation of more than 13.9 million percent. The original source of the coins was wallet “1HqXB…gDwcK,” which sent 23,377.83 BTC to three separate wallets in 2011. Two of those — “12tLs…xj2me” and “1KbrS…AWJYm” — held the bulk until this week. The third wallet, which received 3,377 BTC, had already spent its funds in 2011. Late Friday, on-chain analysis firm Arkham flagged that six other wallets moved over 10,000 bitcoin (BTC) in quick succession, worth over $8.6 billion at current prices. The same entity apparently owns all of these wallets, Akrham said. However, no individual or company has publicly claimed ownership of these wallets as of Asian morning hours on Saturday. The transferred BTC was sent to fresh wallets using a modern, lower-fee address format. Neither of the new wallets has since moved the funds further, and the identity of the wallet owner remains unknown. All of these moved coins are among the rarest class of BTC: mined or transacted during the “Satoshi era,” a loosely defined period from bitcoin’s launch in 2009 through 2011, when its pseudonymous creator was still active online. Wallets from this time are considered part of crypto’s holy grail — rarely moved and often watched closely by traders for market signals, as any large sales could be perceived as an early believer or miner changing their stance on the market.",Markets|Bitcoin|News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|ARKM|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-05 05:12:31

With July already witnessing substantial movement on-chain, the search for the best crypto coins to invest in now is heating up. Several projects are drawing renewed attention from seasoned community members who’ve seen what it means to miss early gains. Whether it’s protocol-level innovation or strong post-launch market behavior, smart capital is shifting its focus toward platforms that combine real use with sustainable upside. Amid rising trade volumes and enhanced infrastructure support, a few names are surfacing consistently across reports and trend trackers. One such standout is Qubetics ($TICS), which has climbed the rankings quickly with notable user adoption, application utility, and powerful price action. Alongside Qubetics, this article will break down three more projects that have recently attracted attention for their tech fundamentals and July ecosystem developments. Each section includes contextual insight and unique investment scenarios to give clarity on why these coins are turning heads right now. Arweave, Injective, and Near Protocol each show distinct potential in data handling, DeFi scaling, and cross-chain development respectively. 1. Qubetics Redefines Crypto Wallet Access Across Chains with Seamless Interoperability Qubetics Wallet is more than just a secure storage option, it’s becoming a practical entry point to multi-chain interoperability. Designed as a non-custodial, multi-platform solution, the Qubetics Wallet allows users to manage their digital assets on iOS, Android, and desktop environments. Built with flexibility at its core, it supports not only $TICS tokens but also various other digital assets through its unified Layer 1 architecture. This means participants no longer need to shift between multiple blockchain platforms to execute basic transactions. For example, sending Bitcoin and interacting with Ethereum dApps can now be managed within the Qubetics ecosystem without switching wallets, dealing with bridges, or paying extra fees. Such frictionless cross-chain interaction has historically required centralized exchanges or complex bridging platforms, but Qubetics removes these hurdles altogether. This kind of practical deployment has put Qubetics among the best crypto coins to invest in now , especially for community members focused on utility beyond speculation. A similar shift toward end-user simplicity was seen when MetaMask began supporting multiple chains in its interface, but Qubetics is offering it natively at the protocol level. Qubetics’ Record-Breaking Launch and DPoS Rewards Model Position It for Long-Term Momentum In its first hour on MEXC and LBank, Qubetics reached an all-time high of $4.20, marking a massive 950% jump from its launch price of $0.40. With a presale starting at just $0.01, early participants saw potential 420x returns. For example, someone who placed $5,000 during the earliest presale round would have received 500,000 tokens. At the $4.20 high, that same amount was worth $2.1 million. This staggering growth has prompted analysts to forecast a $10–15 price range post-mainnet, especially as activity builds around its validator program. The project runs on a Delegated Proof of Stake ( DPoS ) model, which allows token holders to participate in governance and earn passive income. Holding just 5,000 $TICS enables delegation, while those holding 25,000 $TICS can become validators and receive 30% APY. Community members select delegates who process transactions and maintain the network, ensuring fair representation and steady reward distribution. What sets Qubetics apart is the high utility of its token. Besides delegation rewards, $TICS fuels transactions across chains, eliminating the need for bridges, complex swaps, or KYC barriers. Currently trending among the top 10 on CoinMarketCap, the $2 support level continues to attract consistent buy pressure, indicating strong market confidence. Moreover, Qubetics processed over $700K in trade volume within the first 24 hours of its exchange debut, validating its liquidity strength. Why This Coin Made it to This List: Qubetics offers real-world crypto infrastructure, passive earning potential via Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), and a historic early ROI, which together solidify its spot as one of the best crypto coins to invest in now. 2. Arweave’s Data Permanence Infrastructure Gains Enterprise and Public Support Arweave’s recent integrations are shaping up to push the project further into mainstream blockchain infrastructure. Known for its permanent data storage network, Arweave is now seeing traction in both Web3 and institutional archiving applications. Its permaweb model, which stores files forever on-chain, recently gained relevance as decentralized platforms sought alternatives to mutable and censorable storage services. July saw an increase in protocol use cases, particularly in NFT projects and decentralized identity frameworks. These applications need guaranteed content persistence, and Arweave’s low-cost storage model fits that demand. Developers no longer need to rely on third-party servers or risk broken URLs, Arweave’s network ensures content remains untouched and continuously accessible. Community discussions in tech circles also hint at possible collaborations with major content platforms and civic data storage providers, expanding Arweave’s potential market reach. Although specific partnerships remain undisclosed, its protocol’s open adoption metrics continue to trend upward this month. Why This Coin Made it to This List: Arweave’s relevance in the Web3 storage sector is growing consistently, making it one of the best crypto coins to invest in now for those eyeing blockchain infrastructure beyond transactions. 3. Injective’s Growth in On-Chain Derivatives and AI Integration Draws Market Interest Injective Protocol is carving its identity as a serious contender in the decentralized finance space. The chain focuses on fast, low-cost on-chain derivatives and is expanding its support for new DeFi primitives, including synthetic assets. What sets it apart this July is the increasing number of integrations with AI-driven financial tools, designed to optimize trade execution and liquidity routing in real time. This month, Injective unveiled updates that simplify asset listings and automate risk management on its decentralized exchange framework. These changes allow builders to deploy scalable trading products without needing to code from scratch or depend on Ethereum’s congestion-prone network. The protocol is also integrating into liquidity mining programs, drawing attention from developers who want scalable, AI-enhanced market infrastructure. Its use of the Cosmos SDK gives it fast block times, and this technical edge continues to generate traction in developer forums and launchpad platforms. Why This Coin Made it to This List: Injective offers real DeFi utility and strong technical fundamentals, making it one of the best crypto coins to invest in now for participants focused on AI, derivatives, and protocol-level innovation. 4. Near Protocol Scales With Zero-Knowledge and Modular Chain Development in July Near Protocol is ramping up its ecosystem expansion in July with a shift toward zero-knowledge proof integrations and modular app development. Known for its sharded, high-throughput structure, Near is pushing deeper into privacy layers and developer-friendly customization. These advancements have brought new dev teams into the fold and bolstered activity on Near-native apps. July also saw the roll-out of simplified account abstraction, which reduces friction for users unfamiliar with wallet seed phrases and gas fees. This push to bring Web2-like UX into crypto environments is turning heads in enterprise circles that are prioritizing onboarding simplicity for their users. Several modular components introduced by Near allow teams to plug in specialized functions like zk-verification, private swaps, or custom consensus rules, all without rebuilding full chain infrastructure. This design is helping it appeal to both early-stage startups and mature blockchain platforms. Why This Coin Made it to This List: Near Protocol’s July rollouts improve developer and user accessibility, securing its rank among the best crypto coins to invest in now for multi-chain dApp innovation. Conclusion: Why These Projects Top the List of Best Crypto Coins to Invest in Now The common thread across Qubetics , Arweave, Injective, and Near Protocol is simple: real development, strong user-facing solutions, and a growing base of supporters who see long-term viability. From Qubetics’ 30% APY validator system and native wallet to Arweave’s unmatched permanence, these aren’t just coins, they’re entire infrastructures. Injective’s AI-enabled trading and Near’s modular flexibility offer additional dimensions to what participants can build or benefit from. For those evaluating the best crypto coins to invest in now, these four projects offer a mix of usability, scalability, and credible returns. With the continued momentum seen throughout July, particularly in staking-based systems like Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), the outlook on these projects remains firm. Smart capital is watching, and many are already positioning early.

Despite the dip, price action remains constructive with higher lows forming above $2.20 — a level that has emerged as key short-term support. While macro headwinds continue to pressure digital assets broadly, XRP’s bullish structure and rising institutional narrative, including Ripple’s U.S. bank license application and ETF speculation, are keeping long-term sentiment intact. News Background The cryptocurrency market remains on edge as geopolitical and trade tensions between major economies continue to cloud investor confidence. However, XRP’s long-term outlook is bolstered by Ripple’s ongoing push for regulatory clarity and deeper financial integration. The firm’s recent application for a U.S. national banking license with the OCC, alongside a separate bid for a Federal Reserve master account, could unlock direct access to the Fed’s payment systems — a groundbreaking development for a crypto-native firm. Analysts also point to structural bullish signals, with XRP forming higher highs and higher lows across multiple timeframes.

This landmark legislative act, as reported by CBS News, is poised to reshape the nation’s financial landscape through a comprehensive package of tax breaks and significant spending cuts. For anyone following the intricacies of global markets, understanding the implications of such a monumental Trump Bill is paramount, as shifts in US Fiscal Policy often ripple through various sectors, including the burgeoning digital asset space. What Exactly is the ‘One, Big, Beautiful’ Trump Bill ? Dubbed the ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill’ by President Trump himself, this legislation represents a critical pivot in the administration’s economic strategy. Far from a simple amendment, it’s a sweeping reform designed to stimulate growth, reduce government expenditure, and, in the eyes of its proponents, usher in an era of unprecedented prosperity. At its core, the bill encompasses two primary pillars: Extensive Tax Breaks: These are designed to put more money back into the pockets of American families and businesses, encouraging investment and consumption. Strategic Spending Cuts: Aimed at trimming down federal expenditures across various departments, with the goal of reducing the national debt and fostering fiscal responsibility. The signing ceremony itself, held amidst the patriotic fervor of Independence Day, underscored the administration’s belief in the bill’s transformative power, presenting it as a gift to the American people on their nation’s birthday. But what are the specifics, and how might these changes affect the average American and the broader economy? Unpacking the Tax Reform Components: Who Benefits and How? The tax reform aspect of the ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill’ is perhaps its most immediately impactful feature. It introduces a series of adjustments aimed at both individual taxpayers and corporate entities, with the overarching goal of fostering economic dynamism. While specific details of the tax breaks are still being widely discussed, the general thrust is clear: For Individuals: Many Americans are expected to see a reduction in their tax burden, potentially leading to increased disposable income. This could stimulate consumer spending, a key driver of economic growth. The legislation aims to simplify the tax code for many, reducing the complexity of annual filings. For Corporations: A significant reduction in corporate tax rates is a cornerstone of this bill. The theory is that lower corporate taxes will incentivize businesses to invest more domestically, create jobs, and repatriate profits currently held overseas. This could lead to a surge in business expansion and innovation. Proponents argue that these tax breaks will act as a powerful stimulant, injecting capital directly into the economy. Critics, however, voice concerns about the potential for increased national debt if the cuts are not offset by sufficient revenue generation or spending reductions, and whether the benefits will be equitably distributed across all income brackets. The Promise of Government Spending Reductions: A Path to Fiscal Health? Complementing the tax breaks are the substantial government spending cuts outlined in the bill. This aspect reflects a commitment to fiscal austerity, seeking to rein in federal expenditures that have grown significantly over the decades. The targeted cuts are broad, touching various government agencies and programs. The rationale behind these reductions is multi-faceted: Debt Reduction: By spending less, the government aims to slow the growth of, and eventually reduce, the national debt, which has been a long-standing concern for economists and policymakers. Efficiency and Accountability: The cuts are often framed as a means to streamline government operations, eliminate wasteful spending, and enhance accountability across federal departments. Fiscal Discipline: This move signals a shift towards a more conservative fiscal approach, emphasizing responsible budgeting and prioritizing essential services while scaling back on others. While the long-term benefits of reduced government spending are often debated, the immediate impact can be felt in various sectors. Some programs may face reduced funding, leading to adjustments in their operations. The challenge lies in implementing these cuts without negatively impacting critical services or stifling necessary investments in infrastructure and social programs. The delicate balance between fiscal responsibility and societal well-being is at the heart of this legislative effort. What is the Anticipated Economic Impact on the Nation? The signing of the ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill’ on July 4th is undoubtedly a moment that will be analyzed for its profound Economic Impact . The combination of tax cuts and spending reductions creates a unique economic experiment, with various potential outcomes. Here’s a look at what economists and market watchers are considering: Potential for Growth: The theory behind the tax cuts is that they will spur business investment and consumer spending, leading to higher GDP growth and job creation. Lower corporate taxes could also make the U.S. a more attractive place for businesses to operate, potentially drawing in foreign investment. Inflationary Pressures: If the tax cuts significantly boost demand without a corresponding increase in supply, there could be inflationary pressures. This is a key concern for central banks and could influence future monetary policy decisions. National Debt Trajectory: While spending cuts aim to reduce the national debt, the immediate impact of significant tax revenue reductions could lead to an initial increase in the deficit. The long-term trajectory will depend on the extent of economic growth generated and the discipline of future spending. Market Reactions: Financial markets, including traditional stocks and bonds, will closely watch the implementation and early results of this bill. Positive sentiment around potential growth could boost equities, while concerns about deficits or inflation could lead to volatility. For the cryptocurrency market, while not directly impacted, the broader economic health and investor sentiment influenced by such policies can indirectly affect digital asset valuations as capital flows shift. The real-world effects will unfold over months and years, providing a crucial test for the bill’s underlying economic philosophy. Businesses will adjust investment plans, consumers will adapt spending habits, and the government will navigate a new fiscal reality. Navigating the Future of US Fiscal Policy : What’s Next? With the ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill’ now law, the landscape of US Fiscal Policy has been irrevocably altered. This legislation sets a new precedent and direction for how the government manages its finances and interacts with the economy. For citizens, businesses, and investors alike, understanding the implications and preparing for the future is key. For Citizens: Monitor your personal tax situation. The tax breaks may mean more disposable income, but it’s wise to consult with financial advisors to understand how the changes specifically affect your household and long-term financial planning. For Businesses: Evaluate the new corporate tax rates and spending environments. This could be an opportune time for expansion, investment in new technologies, or strategic restructuring to leverage the new fiscal landscape. For Investors: Keep a close eye on economic indicators. GDP growth, inflation rates, and employment figures will be critical in assessing the bill’s effectiveness. Diversifying portfolios and staying informed on how these policies influence different market sectors, including the evolving digital asset space, remains a prudent strategy. The bill represents a significant commitment to a particular economic vision. Its success will be measured not just in immediate financial metrics but also in its long-term impact on job creation, innovation, and the overall prosperity of the nation. As the country moves forward, the ongoing debate and adjustments to this new fiscal framework will undoubtedly shape the economic narrative for years to come. A New Chapter in American Economics The signing of the ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill’ on July 4th marks a pivotal moment in American economic history. By introducing a sweeping package of tax breaks and spending cuts, the Trump administration has laid out a clear vision for the nation’s financial future. While the full effects will only become clear over time, this legislation promises to ignite debates, stimulate economic activity, and challenge conventional wisdom about government’s role in the economy. It is a bold move, undertaken on a day that celebrates freedom and new beginnings, and its legacy will undoubtedly be discussed and analyzed for generations.

In a significant development, Sweden is taking a decisive stand. The nation’s Justice Minister, Gunnar Strömmer, has issued an urgent call for authorities to intensify their efforts in seizing illegally acquired assets, with a particular focus on digital currencies. This bold move signals a new era for Swedish crypto seizures , aiming to cut off funding for criminal enterprises and uphold the rule of law. Why is Sweden Intensifying Swedish Crypto Seizures ? Sweden, known for its progressive stance and robust legal framework, is now at the forefront of combating financial crime in the digital age. Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer’s recent directive underscores a growing concern among global governments regarding the use of cryptocurrencies in illicit activities such as money laundering, drug trafficking, and cybercrime. The anonymity and borderless nature of digital assets can make them attractive to criminals, posing a significant challenge to traditional law enforcement methods. The call to action by Minister Strömmer is not merely a suggestion but a reinforcement of a powerful new legal tool. A forfeiture law, which came into effect last November, empowers Swedish authorities to confiscate illicit gains, including cryptocurrencies, without necessarily needing to prove a specific underlying crime. This is a game-changer, shifting the burden and making it significantly easier for the state to reclaim assets derived from criminal activities. The emphasis is on proactive enforcement, targeting high-profit assets to maximize the impact on criminal networks. Combating Organized Crime: A primary driver is to dismantle organized crime groups by hitting them where it hurts most – their finances. Adapting to Digital Crime: Recognizing that criminals are increasingly using digital assets, the legal framework must evolve to keep pace. Recovering Illicit Gains: Ensuring that crime does not pay, and ill-gotten wealth is returned to society or used to fund public services. Understanding the New Illegal Asset Forfeiture Law The forfeiture law introduced in November is a pivotal piece of legislation in Sweden’s fight against financial crime. Traditionally, authorities would need to secure a conviction for a specific crime to seize assets. However, this new law introduces a non-conviction-based forfeiture mechanism, often referred to as “unexplained wealth orders” or “civil forfeiture” in other jurisdictions. This means if assets are deemed to be illicitly acquired, they can be confiscated even if a criminal conviction isn’t obtained, or if the perpetrator cannot be identified or prosecuted. This paradigm shift is crucial for addressing the complexities of crypto-related crimes. Tracing digital assets through multiple wallets and exchanges can be arduous, and linking them directly to a specific individual or crime can be even harder. The new law provides a broader legal basis for action. It mandates closer collaboration between various enforcement bodies, including the tax agency, police, and customs, to leverage their combined expertise and resources in identifying and seizing these assets. Key aspects of the new illegal asset forfeiture law: Feature Traditional Forfeiture New Swedish Forfeiture Law (November) Proof Required Proof of specific criminal conviction. Proof that assets are illicitly acquired (no conviction needed). Scope Tied to proven criminal acts. Broader, targets assets deemed illicit regardless of specific conviction. Asset Types Tangible assets, bank accounts. Includes all assets, specifically targeting cryptocurrencies. Enforcement Primarily police/prosecutors. Collaborative approach: police, tax agency, customs, etc. The Role of Gunnar Strömmer in This Crackdown Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer has emerged as a key figure in Sweden’s aggressive stance against illicit finance. His outspoken advocacy for more stringent enforcement of the new forfeiture law highlights the government’s commitment to tackling organized crime head-on. Strömmer’s call for agencies to “more actively apply” the law and “target high-profit assets” indicates a strategic shift towards proactive and impactful seizures rather than reactive responses. Strömmer’s vision extends beyond mere confiscation; it encompasses a holistic approach to disrupting criminal networks. By emphasizing inter-agency collaboration, he aims to create a seamless enforcement ecosystem where information and expertise are shared efficiently. This collaborative model is vital for navigating the complex and often technical nature of crypto confiscation . It acknowledges that no single agency possesses all the necessary tools or knowledge to effectively track, seize, and manage digital assets. His statements underscore the urgency and importance of this initiative for national security and public trust. The message is clear: Sweden is determined to ensure that criminals cannot hide their ill-gotten gains in the digital realm. What Does This Mean for Crypto Confiscation Globally? Sweden’s proactive approach to crypto confiscation is not an isolated incident but part of a growing global trend. As cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, governments worldwide are grappling with how to regulate them and prevent their misuse by criminals. The Swedish model, particularly its non-conviction-based forfeiture, could serve as a blueprint for other nations seeking to strengthen their legal frameworks against digital asset crime. Several countries have already begun to implement similar measures or are exploring them: United States: Has a robust civil forfeiture system that allows for the seizure of assets suspected of being involved in criminal activity, even without a conviction. United Kingdom: Introduced Unexplained Wealth Orders (UWOs) which compel individuals to explain the legitimate source of their wealth, failing which assets can be seized. Canada: Provincial civil forfeiture laws allow for the seizure of property used in or derived from unlawful activity, independent of criminal charges. The challenges in crypto confiscation remain significant. They include the technical complexities of accessing private keys, the jurisdictional hurdles of cross-border transactions, and the need for specialized training for law enforcement. However, Sweden’s push signals a commitment to overcome these challenges through legal innovation and inter-agency cooperation. This global trend suggests that the era of relatively unchecked illicit crypto activity is drawing to a close, as governments arm themselves with more potent legal tools. Navigating the Future of Digital Asset Recovery The intensification of digital asset recovery efforts by Sweden and other nations marks a critical juncture for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. For legitimate users and businesses, this means increased scrutiny and potentially more stringent compliance requirements. For those involved in illicit activities, the message is unequivocal: the digital realm is no longer a safe haven for criminal proceeds. Actionable insights for various stakeholders: For Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Service Providers: Strengthen KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) protocols. Enhance collaboration with law enforcement agencies, providing timely and accurate information when requested. Invest in advanced blockchain analytics tools to identify suspicious transactions. For Law Enforcement Agencies: Prioritize training in blockchain forensics and cryptocurrency investigations. Foster inter-agency and international cooperation to overcome jurisdictional barriers. Develop specialized units dedicated to digital asset recovery. For Individuals: Ensure all cryptocurrency holdings are acquired through legitimate means. Maintain meticulous records of transactions and sources of funds. Be aware of evolving regulations regarding digital assets in your jurisdiction. The path forward for digital asset recovery will involve continuous adaptation. As technology evolves, so too will the methods used by criminals and, consequently, the strategies employed by law enforcement. Sweden’s bold step serves as a powerful reminder that the fight against financial crime is extending deeper into the digital frontier, making the cryptocurrency space safer and more transparent for legitimate participants. Conclusion: A Safer Digital Frontier Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer’s urgent call for tougher seizures of illegal assets, including cryptocurrencies, marks a significant moment in Sweden’s commitment to combating financial crime. The new forfeiture law, coupled with a push for enhanced inter-agency collaboration, positions Sweden at the forefront of digital asset recovery. This proactive stance not only aims to disrupt criminal networks by targeting their financial lifelines but also sets a precedent for other nations grappling with similar challenges. As the world increasingly embraces digital currencies, the imperative to ensure they are not exploited for illicit purposes becomes paramount. Sweden’s actions send a clear message: the digital frontier is not beyond the reach of justice, and the era of unchecked illicit crypto gains is rapidly drawing to a close. This move ultimately strengthens the integrity of the crypto ecosystem, fostering a more secure environment for all legitimate participants.

Not long after, a whale that had remained dormant for over 14 years woke up, transferred 10,000 BTC, and reportedly sold. Many more ‘Billionaire’ whales have also emerged. Despite this, the BTC price continues to remain calm with fewer signs of a massive pullback. This raises concerns over the upcoming rally as the price remains unaffected by the whale movements. 80,000 BTC Moved—Will They Be SOLD? During the earlier days of BTC, addresses held more than 10,000 BTC. There are 20 such dormant addresses, which collectively hold 1% of all BTC mined in 2010-2011. Interestingly, 8 out of 20 addresses have just woken up and have transferred more than 80,000 BTC collectively. Source: X The question is not whether the whales are preparing for a sell-off, but why they have moved now. Previously, when Bitcoin surged above the $100K milestone and went on to mark a new ATH above $111K, these whales remained passive. Now that the price has hit $110K yet again, these whales have become active. This suggests either the whales may not be confident of the upcoming price action, or they may be feeling that the markets may face a liquidity crunch as BTC marks a new ATH. Hence, they may be preparing to accumulate as much liquidity as they can. However, many believe this whale is an old miner from 2011, having originally controlled around 200,000 BTC. Meanwhile, the rumors are also that these are Satoshi-linked funds, but there is no evidence to support this. Historically, Q1 2025 has seen more BTC token transfers than Q1 2024, marking a 121% year-on-year increase, which signals a broader trend of awakening old coins. What Does it Mean Going Forward? The Bitcoin price may face high short-term volatility, such as large transactions that usually spook the markets.

Crypto trading became legal in 2018 when New Zealand recognized it as property for tax purposes. The nation opts for clever crypto approaches, as the interest in digital asset investments is growing rapidly. As of 2025, New Zealand is tightening its hold on security to enhance transparency and combat tax evasion in the region. While the country has not regulated specific crypto laws this year, it has indirectly impacted crypto with fintech laws. Table of contents Crypto regulations in New Zealand 2025 What is the New Zealand Government Saying About Crypto? Crypto License in New Zealand 2025 Crypto Tax in New Zealand 2025 Crypto Adoption in New Zealand 2025 Conclusion FAQs Crypto regulations in New Zealand 2025 April 1, 2026– Introduction of OECD in Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) CARF, through the Taxation Act 2025, will come into effect in 2025. It aims at enhancing transparency and combating tax evasion in the crypto space while establishing rules for crypto asset services providers (CASPs). Crypto transaction reporting obligations for CASPs will be mandatory under this law . March 31, 2025- Conduct of Financial Institutions (CoFI) Under this legislation, fair conduct principles for financial institutions, including crypto, are compulsory. While this legislation does not directly regulate crypto as a financial product, it does impact how financial institutions dealing with crypto assets conduct themselves. March 2025- Financial Markets Authority (FMA) Regulatory Sandbox FMA announced a regulatory sandbox for 2025, where fintech companies, including developing blockchain corporations, can test innovative products under supervision. It also fosters collaboration between the government and the crypto industry, promoting consumer protection and market integrity. March 29, 2025- Consumer and Product Data Act This law introduces a legislated consumer data right (CDR) in the financial sector. While this law does not directly regulate crypto, it can indirectly impact data rights and data sharing in the digital industry and blockchain developments. What is the New Zealand Government Saying About Crypto? The Financial Market Authority (FMA) is the key regulator of cryptocurrency and digital assets in New Zealand. Currently, the agency is focusing on licensing and tax regimes while releasing warnings against crypto scams in the region. The agency released a set of crypto scams in New Zealand while suggesting some tips for investments to avoid such situations. One of the biggest crypto risks in New Zealand, according to the FMA, is the inability to find out the entity offering services. FMA said that due to big overseas crypto exchanges, it is hard to find out who is offering, buying, selling, or exchanging crypto, putting the assets at risk of theft. It stated– “Because it is decentralised by nature, there’s no control by a single entity such as a government, bank, or financial institution – there are no restrictions on who can issue them.” Crypto License in New Zealand 2025 Licensing: While there are no specific crypto licenses in New Zealand , crypto asset service providers (CASPs) and wallet service providers must register with the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) as financial service providers (FSPs) to obtain a crypto license to continue operations. Compliance: CASPs, wallet service providers, and businesses involved with crypto must comply with anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorism financing (CFT), and the know-your-customer (KYC) obligations. Reporting: Entities providing digital asset services may be required to report their transaction and other information to FMC, especially if any suspicious activity is discovered. Crypto Tax in New Zealand 2025 Capital Gains Tax (CGT): CGT does not apply to crypto in New Zealand, as it considers crypto as property. Income Tax: Earning and disposing of crypto is subject to general income tax in New Zealand. The key advisor on government tax policies in New Zealand, the Inland Revenue Department (IRD), said in a statement – “If you acquire crypto assets to dispose of them, you need to pay income tax on any profit you make. For example, if you buy or mine crypto assets to sell or exchange them. If you make a loss when you sell your crypto asset, you may be able to claim this loss.” Income tax bracket Annual Income Rate (2024-2025) Tax Rate Annual Income Rate (2025-2026) Up to $14,000 10.5% Up to $15,600 Up to $14,001 – $15,600 12.82% – $15,601–$48,000 17.5% $15,601 – $53,500 $48,001 – $53,500 21.64% – $53,501–$70,000 30% $53,501 – $78,100 $70,001 – $78,100 30.99% – $78,101–$180,000 33% $78,101 – $180,000 Over $180,000 39% $180,001+ Crypto Adoption in New Zealand 2025 User Penetration Rate: Currently, the user penetration rate is projected to be 33.59% and is forecasted to increase to 34.78% by 2026. The number of crypto users is expected to reach 1.84 million by 2026. Crypto Revenue: In 2025, the crypto revenue is projected to reach US$174.1 million, which is anticipated to show an annual growth of 15.37%, resulting in a projected total amount of US$200.8 million by 2026. Crypto Holdings: No public information on the government’s crypto holdings in New Zealand is available; no indication or evidence that the government is investing or holding any digital assets. Conclusion Despite legal uncertainties, the crypto market in New Zealand is growing as the popularity of digital assets has spread worldwide. The government of New Zealand is currently taking a “wait and see” approach to cryptocurrency, not providing much clarity in the regulations. If the country provides legal transparency on digital assets, it may boost the adoption rate and expand the national economy.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a crucial barometer for investor sentiment, recently registered 67 on July 5th, a slight dip from the previous day but still firmly entrenched in the ‘Greed’ zone. For seasoned investors and curious newcomers alike, understanding this index is like having a compass in the often-turbulent seas of crypto. But what does this ‘Greed’ signal truly mean for your digital assets, and how can you leverage this insight to make smarter decisions? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Deep Dive into Market Sentiment At its core, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by Alternative, is designed to distill the complex emotions driving the cryptocurrency market into a single, digestible number. Ranging from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed), it offers a snapshot of whether market participants are feeling overly anxious or excessively exuberant. This index isn’t just a random number; it’s a sophisticated aggregation of various data points, aiming to capture the collective psychological state of crypto investors. Why is this important? Because emotions, particularly fear and greed, are powerful forces in financial markets. When fear dominates, investors tend to panic sell, often at a loss. Conversely, when greed takes over, it can lead to irrational exuberance, inflated prices, and eventually, market corrections. The index serves as a potential contrarian indicator: extreme fear might signal a buying opportunity, while extreme greed could suggest it’s time to exercise caution. The Six Pillars of the Index: What Drives the Numbers? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t a simple survey; it’s a weighted average of six distinct factors, each contributing to the overall score. Let’s break down these components to truly understand what influences the Crypto Market Sentiment : Volatility (25%): This factor measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility, especially sudden downward movements, often indicates fear in the market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This component analyzes the current trading volume and market momentum, comparing it with average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a rising market suggests strong positive momentum and potentially greed. Social Media (15%): The index scans various social media platforms, particularly Twitter, for crypto-related hashtags and analyzes the sentiment of posts. A high volume of positive, excited mentions can point towards increasing greed. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, this factor historically involved weekly polls asking investors about their market outlook. These surveys provided direct insights into investor confidence. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin Dominance refers to Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. An increasing Bitcoin dominance often indicates that investors are moving from altcoins to Bitcoin, which is seen as a safer haven during uncertain times (fear), or that Bitcoin is leading a bull run (greed, but more focused). Google Trends (10%): This factor analyzes search queries related to cryptocurrencies on Google Trends. A surge in searches for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘crypto crash’ might indicate fear, while terms like ‘how to buy crypto’ or ‘Bitcoin halving’ during a bull run could signal growing public interest and greed. The weighting of these factors highlights their perceived importance in gauging overall market sentiment. It’s a holistic approach, moving beyond just price action to include the underlying psychological currents. Navigating the ‘Greed Zone’: What Does a 67 Mean for Your Investments? With the index at 67, we are firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone. But what does this imply for you as an investor? Being in the Greed Zone suggests that investors are becoming overly optimistic, potentially leading to inflated prices due to Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO). Here’s what it typically signifies: Increased FOMO: Many investors might be rushing to buy, fearing they’ll miss out on further price increases. This can drive prices up unsustainably. Higher Risk: As prices climb on the back of speculative buying, the market becomes more vulnerable to sudden corrections. The risk of buying at a local top increases. Potential for Profit-Taking: Experienced traders often view the ‘Greed’ zone as a signal to consider taking some profits off the table, especially if they entered positions during periods of fear. It’s crucial to remember that the index is a sentiment tool, not a crystal ball. A high ‘Greed’ reading doesn’t guarantee an immediate crash, just as ‘Fear’ doesn’t guarantee an immediate rally. However, it serves as a powerful reminder to approach the market with a degree of caution and to re-evaluate your investment strategy. Challenges and Limitations: Why Market Volatility Isn’t the Only Factor While incredibly useful, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t without its limitations. Relying solely on this index for investment decisions can be perilous. For instance, while Market Volatility is a significant component, it’s just one piece of a much larger puzzle. Other factors to consider include: Aspect Description Relevance to Index Economic Indicators Inflation rates, interest rates, global economic stability. Indirectly impacts overall investor confidence, which can influence crypto sentiment. Regulatory News New laws, bans, or approvals for cryptocurrencies. Directly impacts market sentiment, sometimes overriding index signals. Technological Developments Upgrades to blockchain networks, new dApps, scaling solutions. Can drive long-term value and sentiment, not fully captured by short-term sentiment metrics. Whale Movements Large transactions by institutional investors or major holders. Can significantly influence price and sentiment, often before the index fully reflects it. The index is most effective when used as a complementary tool alongside technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and a thorough understanding of macroeconomic trends. It’s a sentiment gauge, not a definitive buy or sell signal. Unlocking Insights: How to Leverage the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for Better Decisions So, how can you effectively integrate the Crypto Fear & Greed Index into your investment strategy? Here are some actionable insights: Contrarian Thinking: The classic advice is to be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful. When the index is extremely low (0-20), it might be a good time to accumulate assets, assuming your fundamental analysis supports the investment. When it’s extremely high (80-100), consider reducing exposure or taking profits. Risk Management: A high ‘Greed’ score should prompt you to review your portfolio’s risk exposure. Are you over-allocated to volatile assets? This might be a good time to rebalance. Patience and Discipline: Don’t let the index dictate impulsive decisions. Use it as a prompt for deeper analysis. If the index is high, ask yourself: Is this asset truly undervalued, or am I just feeling FOMO? Trend Confirmation: Observe the trend of the index. Is it steadily rising into greed, or has it just spiked? A rapid change can be more indicative of a short-term emotional swing than a sustained trend. Remember, successful investing in crypto, or any market, is about making informed, rational decisions, not emotional ones. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index helps you identify when emotions are running high, giving you an edge to act more rationally than the crowd. Conclusion: Your Compass in the Crypto Storm The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , currently hovering at 67 in the ‘Greed’ zone, offers invaluable insight into the prevailing sentiment of the cryptocurrency market. By deconstructing its components—from market momentum and social media buzz to Bitcoin Dominance and Google Trends—we gain a deeper appreciation for the complex interplay of factors that shape investor psychology. While it’s a powerful tool for gauging market sentiment and acting as a potential contrarian indicator, it’s not a standalone solution. Instead, it serves as an essential compass, guiding you to exercise caution when exuberance peaks and to consider opportunities when fear reigns supreme. By understanding and strategically utilizing this index alongside other analytical tools, you can navigate the dynamic crypto landscape with greater confidence and make more informed investment choices.

In pursuit of an ‘open participation’ model, the company is working to make its token tradable on decentralized exchanges and P2P platforms. WLFI says tokenholders can vote on token rewards if the proposal is approved In a Friday X post, WLFI stated it was making history by initiating a proposal to enable $WLFI token trading on Independence Day . The firm frames the launch as a nod to the holiday’s spirit of liberty and innovation. It even commented, “Crypto is coming home — and there’s no better day to let freedom ring.” The platform is optimistic that if the proposal is approved, it will help expand token utility, strengthen community ownership and participation, and better align long-term incentives with the protocol’s growth and adoption. Moreover, once the proposal is greenlit, tokenholders will be able to vote on matters such as token emissions, ecosystem rewards, and treasury management. WLFI also confirmed that once the ability to trade starts, it will trigger the partial unlock of tokens held by early supporters. The rest of the token supply will remain locked pending a second vote by the community to establish the release framework. Tokens belonging to founders, team members, and advisors will not unlock at this stage and will follow a more extended vesting schedule to show their commitment to the protocol’s long-term vision. Lawmakers are still concerned about Trump’s conflicts of interest, with his WLFI ties Democratic lawmakers remain wary of WLFI due to concerns over Donald Trump’s potential conflicts of interest . Although Trump claims to have cut ties with the company, his family still holds a significant stake, and he recently disclosed earning approximately $57.4 million from his involvement with the platform. In June, Trump’s family reduced their stake in the company by 20% and has been cutting off its stake since December. However, lawmakers still feel uneasy about their remaining ties. Aside from WLFI, Trump has been involved in several other crypto projects, such as the launch of his memecoin and NFT sales, from which he’s amassed over $620 million. Bloomberg even reported that crypto makes up 9% of his net worth. Last month, Representative Adam Schiff introduced the Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure(COIN) Act. This bill would bar the president, immediate family members, and executive branch officials from being involved in issuing or promoting specific digital assets if passed. WLFI collaborated with Re7 Capital for its USD1 stablecoin vault WLFI recently partnered with London’s Re7 labs to launch its USD1 stablecoin vault on Euler and Lista. No financial terms of their agreement have yet to be revealed. Evgeny Gokhberg, founder of Re7 Capital, gave a statement on their partnership, “Working alongside World Liberty, Euler, and BNB Chain, we’re advancing a model for stablecoin adoption that meets the expectations of both crypto-native and institutional users.” He added that their collaboration shows their commitment to developing DeFi infrastructure and their priority to maintaining stability, transparency, and crypto efficiency in the industry. Additionally, the United Arab Emirates-based Aqua 1 Foundation acquired $100 million worth of World Liberty tokens, becoming the second Middle Eastern entity to invest in the platform. In May, MGX, a technology investment firm, also used World Liberty’s USD1 stablecoin to facilitate its $2 billion investment in Binance.

The latest update from CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index reveals a score of 24 as of July 5th, a clear signal that the market is currently experiencing Bitcoin Season . For many investors, this number is a crucial indicator of where capital is flowing and how different digital assets are performing. But what exactly does an index score of 24 signify for your portfolio and the broader crypto market trends ? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index : What Does 24 Mean? The Altcoin Season Index , meticulously tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), provides a snapshot of the market’s current state by evaluating the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. A score of 24, as recently reported, is a definitive indicator: we are not in Altcoin Season. For the market to be declared an ‘Altcoin Season,’ a staggering 75% or more of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin within that 90-day window. Conversely, a score like 24 places us firmly in ‘Bitcoin Season,’ where 25% or fewer of these altcoins have managed to surpass Bitcoin’s performance. This index, ranging from 1 to 100, serves as a vital barometer for understanding the prevailing capital flows and investor sentiment across the digital asset landscape. Navigating Bitcoin Season : Why Dominance Matters When the Altcoin Season Index points to Bitcoin Season , it signifies a period where Bitcoin (BTC) is not just holding its own, but actively outperforming the vast majority of alternative cryptocurrencies. This dominance is not merely a statistical quirk; it reflects deeper underlying dynamics within the crypto market trends . Often, Bitcoin Season emerges during times of market uncertainty, where investors tend to flock to what they perceive as the safer, more established asset in the volatile crypto space. Bitcoin’s larger market capitalization, greater liquidity, and increasing institutional adoption contribute to its role as a ‘digital gold,’ making it a preferred haven. This period also often sees a consolidation of capital, with funds rotating out of smaller, riskier altcoins and into Bitcoin, further solidifying its lead. Analyzing Current Crypto Market Trends : Beyond the Index Score While the Altcoin Season Index provides a clear numerical value, understanding the current crypto market trends requires looking beyond just the score. Bitcoin Season is a recurring phenomenon in the cyclical nature of the cryptocurrency market. It often precedes or follows periods of intense altcoin speculation. During such times, the market’s attention and liquidity are heavily concentrated on Bitcoin, which can lead to a ‘cooling off’ period for many altcoins. This doesn’t necessarily mean altcoins are ‘dead,’ but rather that their individual altcoin performance may be subdued relative to Bitcoin. Key factors influencing these trends include global macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and significant industry news. Investors often use Bitcoin’s performance as a bellwether for the overall health and direction of the crypto ecosystem. Impact on Your Altcoin Performance : Strategies for Investors For investors holding a diversified portfolio of digital assets, the current Bitcoin Season directly impacts your altcoin performance . Many altcoins may experience stagnation or even declines in their Bitcoin-denominated value, even if their USD value remains stable or slightly increases. This period can be challenging for those solely focused on rapid altcoin gains. However, it also presents unique opportunities for strategic cryptocurrency investing . Here are some considerations: Re-evaluate your portfolio: Is your risk exposure appropriate for a Bitcoin-dominant market? Consider rebalancing some positions towards Bitcoin if you believe its dominance will continue. Focus on fundamentals: This is an excellent time to research projects with strong technology, active development, clear use cases, and solid communities. Projects with genuine utility tend to fare better in bear or consolidation phases. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider regularly investing a fixed amount into promising altcoins. This strategy can help mitigate risk during volatile periods. Patience is key: Market cycles are a natural part of crypto. While Bitcoin may be leading now, history suggests that altcoin seasons eventually return. Strategic Cryptocurrency Investing in a Shifting Landscape Successfully navigating the current market demands a strategic approach to cryptocurrency investing . Understanding that the market operates in cycles—alternating between Bitcoin dominance and altcoin surges—is paramount. During Bitcoin Season, a conservative stance might be warranted for some, focusing on capital preservation. For others, it might be an opportune moment to accumulate undervalued altcoins at lower prices, anticipating their eventual resurgence when market sentiment shifts. Diversification remains a core principle, but the allocation within that diversification might need adjustment based on the prevailing market conditions indicated by metrics like the Altcoin Season Index . Always conduct thorough due diligence and never invest more than you can afford to lose. The Altcoin Season Index at 24 clearly signals that the cryptocurrency market is currently in a phase of Bitcoin dominance. While this may mean subdued altcoin performance in the short term, it offers valuable insights into prevailing crypto market trends . For those engaged in cryptocurrency investing , understanding these cycles and adapting strategies accordingly is crucial. Whether you’re rebalancing your portfolio, researching new projects, or simply holding through the current climate, staying informed about key metrics like the Altcoin Season Index empowers you to make more informed decisions in this dynamic digital landscape.

The post, which includes a three-day candlestick chart of XRP, points to a potential breakout from a falling wedge pattern that has been forming since late 2024. Jaydee’s chart is centered around this large wedge, bounded by two descending trendlines that have kept XRP in a consolidating range for months. The token now sits at the top of the wedge, trading at $2.23, and pressing against resistance after gradually moving sideways through May and June. Well-respected analysts have shared bullish expectations for July , and the recent price action, supported by a rising Relative Strength Index (RSI), has raised questions about whether XRP could soon break free of this extended downtrend. $XRP – Remember when I called the 12x all the way to my $3.37 TP level w/exact PRECISION?

(Patreon/Discord – Green Box)… pic.twitter.com/l28K1ZfhWD — JD (@jaydee_757) July 3, 2025 Confirmation Still Pending Jaydee is optimistic about XRP’s trajectory. The analyst stated, “If we can have a full 3-day candle close above for better confirmation… then I expect my next TP levels to hit,” he said. The breakout line on his chart aligns closely with the $2.23–$2.24 range, where the current three-day candle has wicked above the upper resistance line. However, the body of the candle has not yet clearly closed above it. The RSI, currently at 50.66, is also testing a descending trendline that has capped momentum for months. Jaydee also expects a breakout here, indicating that both price and momentum could be aligning for a significant shift. This combination of technical signals adds weight to the possibility of a trend reversal. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Outlook Hinges on Candle Close Jaydee previously called a 12x move in XRP, predicting a price target of $3.37, which, according to him, hit “with exact PRECISION.” His current post implies that another set of take-profit (TP) levels is in place, although they are not specified in the chart. If XRP can secure a candle close above this wedge, those targets are back in play. While Jaydee emphasizes that his TP levels are set and stresses a trading approach without emotional reaction, the chart also acknowledges that confirmation is key. Without a clear close above resistance, this could remain a false breakout or trap, especially in the context of broader market conditions. Patience is crucial in this situation, as the three-day candle must confirm the breakout with a solid close above the wedge. The price and RSI action suggest that XRP may be nearing a pivotal moment, and it’s only a matter of time. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This massive transfer, reported by Cointelegraph, underscored a fascinating truth about Bitcoin’s ecosystem: a significant portion of its circulating supply remains untouched for extended periods. In fact, over 30.4% of all Bitcoin has not moved in more than five years, highlighting a unique aspect of its ownership and market behavior. This remarkable statistic points to a powerful underlying trend: the prevalence of Bitcoin dormant supply . What Does “Bitcoin Dormant Supply” Truly Mean? Understanding Bitcoin dormant supply is crucial for anyone trying to grasp the deeper trends within the digital asset space. Simply put, ‘dormant supply’ refers to Bitcoin that has remained in the same wallet address for a specified period without any outgoing transactions. While the recent $8 billion transfer involved Bitcoin that had been untouched for 14 years, the broader statistic of over 30% pertains to coins that haven’t moved in at least five years. This period is significant because it often indicates a strong conviction from the holder, suggesting they are not interested in short-term trading or profit-taking. On-chain analytics firms meticulously track these movements, segmenting dormant supply into various age bands, such as 1-3 years, 3-5 years, and 5+ years. The longer the dormancy period, the stronger the signal of long-term holding. This phenomenon is particularly noteworthy for Bitcoin due to its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins. When a significant portion of this limited supply is locked away in dormant wallets, it effectively reduces the amount of Bitcoin available for active trading, contributing to its scarcity and potentially influencing its value proposition as a store of value. The Unwavering Conviction of Long-Term Bitcoin Holders The significant portion of Bitcoin that remains unmoved is largely attributed to long-term Bitcoin holders . These individuals and entities embody the ‘HODL’ ethos, a term born from a misspelling of ‘hold’ during a volatile market period, which has since become a mantra for holding onto cryptocurrency regardless of price fluctuations. These holders are not swayed by daily market swings or speculative fervor; their belief is rooted in Bitcoin’s fundamental value as a decentralized, censorship-resistant, and finite digital asset. Who are these steadfast holders? They include early adopters who mined or acquired Bitcoin when it was worth mere pennies, institutional investors who have recently added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, and individual investors who view Bitcoin as a long-term hedge against inflation or a generational wealth transfer mechanism. Their collective decision to hold, often through multiple bear markets and significant price corrections, showcases a profound confidence in Bitcoin’s future potential. This commitment from long-term Bitcoin holders forms a bedrock of stability for the entire crypto ecosystem, contrasting sharply with the often-volatile short-term trading landscape. How Does Dormant Supply Influence Bitcoin Market Dynamics? The existence of such a large Bitcoin dormant supply profoundly impacts Bitcoin market dynamics . When over 30% of the circulating supply is not actively traded, it creates a unique supply-side pressure. In essence, it means that the effective liquid supply available for buying and selling is considerably smaller than the total circulating supply. This reduced liquidity can amplify price movements, as fewer coins are available to absorb large buy orders, potentially leading to more significant upward price action during periods of high demand. Conversely, a sudden decision by a large number of these dormant holders to sell could introduce a substantial amount of supply into the market, potentially leading to downward price pressure. However, the historical trend suggests that these holders are remarkably resilient, often choosing to hold even during significant downturns. Their inactivity acts as a constant removal of supply from the active market, underpinning Bitcoin’s scarcity narrative. This phenomenon is a key factor differentiating Bitcoin’s market behavior from traditional assets, where a much larger percentage of assets are actively traded, making the influence of Bitcoin market dynamics from dormant supply a critical analytical point. Mastering the Crypto HODL Strategy: Benefits and Challenges For many, the observation of this dormant supply validates the crypto HODL strategy . This approach, which involves holding onto cryptocurrency for extended periods regardless of price fluctuations, has proven to be incredibly lucrative for early adopters and those with a long-term vision. But what are the tangible benefits and inherent challenges? Benefits of a HODL Strategy: Compounding Gains: By holding through market cycles, investors can benefit from the long-term appreciation of Bitcoin, allowing their initial investment to grow exponentially. Reduced Stress and Emotional Trading: HODLing removes the temptation to make impulsive trading decisions based on short-term volatility, which often leads to losses. Tax Efficiency: In many jurisdictions, holding assets for longer periods can qualify for more favorable long-term capital gains tax rates. Alignment with Bitcoin’s Vision: It aligns investors with Bitcoin’s core narrative as a long-term store of value, rather than a speculative asset. Challenges of a HODL Strategy: Market Volatility: Enduring significant price drops (e.g., 80% corrections) requires immense psychological fortitude. Opportunity Cost: Funds are tied up, meaning they cannot be used for other investments or short-term gains. Psychological Temptation: The urge to sell during euphoric bull runs or panic during severe bear markets can be overwhelming. Security Risks: Long-term holding necessitates impeccable digital asset security to prevent loss or theft. Examples abound, from individuals who bought Bitcoin for a few dollars and are now millionaires, to companies like MicroStrategy that have adopted Bitcoin as their primary treasury reserve asset, demonstrating a corporate-level crypto HODL strategy . Ensuring Digital Asset Security for Long-Term Holdings The sheer volume of Bitcoin dormant supply also raises critical questions about digital asset security . How have these vast sums of Bitcoin remained safe and untouched for so long? The answer lies in robust security practices, primarily the use of cold storage solutions. Unlike hot wallets, which are connected to the internet, cold storage devices keep private keys offline, making them virtually impervious to online hacks. Key Security Measures for Long-Term Bitcoin Holders: Hardware Wallets: Devices like Ledger or Trezor store private keys offline, requiring physical confirmation for transactions. Multi-Signature Wallets: These require multiple private keys (held by different individuals or in different locations) to authorize a transaction, adding layers of security. Air-Gapped Computers: Using a computer never connected to the internet for generating and storing private keys. Seed Phrase Management: Securely backing up and protecting the recovery seed phrase, often on physically robust materials and in multiple secure locations. Inheritance Planning: Crucial for ensuring that assets can be accessed by beneficiaries in the event of the holder’s incapacitation or death. The recent movement of 14-year-old Bitcoin highlights that even after more than a decade, the security measures employed by these holders proved effective. However, the challenge of maintaining such high levels of digital asset security over extended periods is immense, requiring constant vigilance against evolving threats like sophisticated phishing attempts or even physical theft of storage devices. Beyond the Five-Year Mark: The Future Implications What does this vast Bitcoin dormant supply mean for Bitcoin’s future? If these coins remain dormant, they effectively reduce Bitcoin’s true circulating supply, enhancing its scarcity and reinforcing its narrative as ‘digital gold.’ This continued dormancy could contribute to higher price floors and less volatility in the long run, as fewer coins are available for speculative trading. However, the potential for these coins to eventually move remains a significant factor. While a sudden, massive sell-off could create market shock, it’s more likely that any movement would be gradual or for specific purposes, such as rebalancing portfolios, transferring to institutional custody, or even for philanthropic endeavors. The fact that the recent $8 billion transfer was picked up by exchanges suggests some intent to liquidate, but it represents a tiny fraction of the overall dormant supply. The long-term behavior of these holders will continue to be a fascinating aspect of Bitcoin’s journey, shaping its trajectory and cementing its status as a revolutionary digital asset. The phenomenon of Bitcoin dormant supply is more than just a statistic; it’s a testament to the unwavering belief of long-term Bitcoin holders in its future. It profoundly shapes Bitcoin market dynamics , underscores the power of the crypto HODL strategy , and highlights the critical importance of robust digital asset security . As Bitcoin continues its journey, the silent strength of its long-term holders will remain a foundational pillar, influencing its trajectory and cementing its status as a unique and revolutionary digital asset in the global financial landscape.

At the current levels, Ethereum continues to look incredibly bearish, with sell-offs dominating the market at this level. While piling shorts are pointing to a possible relief rally, there is also the possibility that the price will crash back down from here. Crypto analyst Weslad maps out the ETH price trajectory using the ABCDE wave structure, showing a possible crash below $2,000. The Bullish Ethereum Scenario Weslad points to the 2021 Ethereum peak when the price reached $4,851 as the point when a large-scale symmetrical pennant had formed for the digital asset. Interestingly, this has continued for multiple years already, and continues to play out even in 2025, four years later. So far, the analyst believes that the altcoin has been in a long-term accumulation phase in a defined corrective range. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Not Remotely Close, Bitcoin Dominance Still Too High: Market Expert Says Another important development is the formation of an ABCDE wave pattern. This pattern often predicts peaks and troughs, and depending on where the asset is in the pattern, it could point to a recovery or a crash. Presently, the crypto analyst puts the Ethereum price as being somewhere in a D wave, which is still bullish for the price. “Currently, price action is developing near point D, approaching the upper boundary of the pennant, a crucial area that could define the next directional move,” the analyst said. If this D wave plays out as expected, then the Ethereum price is expected to actually surge from here. The top of this pattern would put it above $3,500 before the move is completed. On the upper end of this is the formation of an Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern. This pattern has seen the $2,855 acting as key resistance, beating the Ethereum price down multiple times this year. However, if a sustained break is achieved above this level, in conjunction with a breakout from Wave D, then it is possible that the price does rally to new all-time highs above $6,000. The Bearish Scenario While the formation of the ABCDE wave count points to some bullishness for the Ethereum price, there is still the possibility that the price could go in the opposite direction. For example, after the D wave is completed, comes the next wave in the sequence, which is the E wave, and this is a bearish wave. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Not Remotely Close, Bitcoin Dominance Still Too High: Market Expert Says As the crypto analyst explains, a temporary rejection at the neckline or pennant resistance would trigger an E wave retracement. In this case, the Ethereum price could see an over 30% crash, putting it back toward the $1,400-$1,800 level, where there is the most support. “Recent price behavior shows compressed volatility and increased buying interest on dips, reinforcing the possibility of an imminent directional breakout,” Weslad warned. “A decisive move outside this macro structure may mark the beginning of a new phase of long-term price expansion.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",Ethereum|ETH|ETH news|eth price|ethereum|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,TRADING|ETH|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-07-05 06:30:30

In the dynamic world of digital assets, few topics spark as much debate and fascination as a company’s decision to integrate Bitcoin (BTC) into its treasury. Once heralded as a visionary move, a recent commentary from Glassnode lead analyst James Check has cast a shadow of doubt over the long-term viability of the Bitcoin treasury strategy . Are we witnessing a pivotal moment where the shine of corporate BTC holdings is beginning to fade for new entrants? This article delves deep into these concerns, exploring the nuances of corporate Bitcoin adoption, the inherent crypto risk, and what it truly takes for a digital asset strategy to be sustainable. The Genesis of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: Why Companies Embraced BTC Holdings For several years, the narrative around companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets was overwhelmingly positive. Pioneers like MicroStrategy led the charge, viewing Bitcoin as a superior alternative to traditional fiat currencies, a hedge against inflation, and a strategic asset signaling innovation and forward-thinking leadership. The allure was multifaceted: Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin’s fixed supply offered a compelling alternative to depreciating fiat currencies. Innovation and Brand Image: Embracing Bitcoin allowed companies to position themselves at the forefront of technological advancement, appealing to a tech-savvy investor base and attracting talent interested in the future of finance. Balance Sheet Optimization: For some, it was a way to potentially generate significant returns on idle cash, outperforming traditional low-yield investments. Market Signal: A strong commitment to Bitcoin could be seen as a vote of confidence in the broader crypto ecosystem, potentially influencing stock prices and market perception. These motivations drove a wave of corporate Bitcoin purchases, transforming the balance sheets of publicly traded companies and setting a new precedent for treasury management in the digital age. However, as with any emerging trend, the initial enthusiasm often gives way to a more critical examination of long-term implications. Questioning Long-Term Viability: Is Your Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Still Relevant? James Check’s recent remarks on X (formerly Twitter) highlight a critical shift in perspective. He suggests that the traditional model of accumulating Bitcoin for corporate treasuries may already be losing its relevance, especially for newer participants looking to replicate past successes. His core argument is profound: ‘long-term accumulation depends more on the strength of a company’s core business and strategy than on symbolic BTC holdings.’ This statement challenges the very foundation of the ‘Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset’ philosophy. Here’s why the viability is being questioned: Diminishing Novelty for New Entrants: The initial shockwave of a company announcing BTC holdings has subsided. Newer firms attempting to mimic this strategy might not achieve the same ‘first-mover’ advantage or market excitement that early adopters did. Volatility as a Double-Edged Sword: While Bitcoin’s price appreciation can be spectacular, its volatility can equally decimate balance sheets. Quarterly earnings reports can be significantly impacted by BTC price swings, introducing an unpredictable element that traditional investors might shy away from. Opportunity Cost: Capital tied up in Bitcoin is capital not invested in core business expansion, research and development, or traditional, less volatile assets. For companies whose primary business isn’t crypto, this can be a significant drain on resources that could otherwise fuel organic growth. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving. Changes in taxation, accounting standards, or outright prohibitions could significantly impact the value and utility of corporate BTC holdings. Focus Shift from Core Business: When a company’s financial performance becomes heavily linked to its Bitcoin holdings, there’s a risk that management’s focus might inadvertently shift from operational excellence to crypto market speculation. This can dilute investor confidence in the company’s primary value proposition. The essence of Check’s argument is that Bitcoin should complement, not define, a company’s financial health. A strong core business provides the stability and revenue streams necessary to weather market fluctuations, making any digital asset holding a strategic enhancement rather than a speculative gamble. Navigating the Peril: Sound Crypto Risk Management for Your BTC Holdings Adding to the concerns, Fakhul Miah, GoMining Institutional Managing Director, previously warned about the dangers of newer firms attempting to replicate the BTC banking model without proper risk controls. His apprehension is well-founded: a collapse due to unchecked crypto exposure could severely damage Bitcoin’s broader reputation, potentially setting back institutional adoption. What exactly constitutes ‘proper risk controls’ in the context of corporate Bitcoin adoption ? It goes far beyond simply buying and holding. It involves a sophisticated understanding of the unique risks associated with digital assets: Market Risk: The Volatility Challenge Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate wildly. A robust risk management strategy must include: Clear Allocation Limits: Defining a maximum percentage of the treasury that can be allocated to Bitcoin to prevent overexposure. Stress Testing: Regularly simulating worst-case scenarios (e.g., a 50% or 80% drop in BTC price) to understand the potential impact on the company’s balance sheet and liquidity. Rebalancing Strategies: Establishing rules for when and how to adjust BTC holdings if they grow too large or fall too low as a percentage of the overall treasury. Operational Risk: Securing Digital Assets Unlike traditional assets, Bitcoin requires specialized custody and security measures: Secure Custody Solutions: Utilizing reputable institutional-grade custodians with robust security protocols (e.g., cold storage, multi-signature wallets, air-gapped systems). Internal Controls: Implementing strict internal policies for access, transaction approvals, and audit trails to prevent fraud or error. Cybersecurity Measures: Protecting digital infrastructure from hacking attempts, phishing, and other cyber threats. Regulatory Risk: The Evolving Landscape The lack of clear, consistent global regulation poses significant challenges: Legal and Compliance Expertise: Engaging legal and compliance professionals specialized in digital assets to navigate evolving laws, tax implications, and reporting requirements. Jurisdictional Awareness: Understanding how regulations in different countries might impact the company’s ability to hold, use, or sell Bitcoin. Reputational Risk: Public Perception A company’s foray into Bitcoin can be viewed positively or negatively. Poor management of BTC holdings, especially during market downturns, can damage investor confidence and brand image. Transparent communication and consistent strategy are key. Without these foundational controls, a company’s attempt to replicate a successful Bitcoin treasury strategy can quickly devolve into a high-stakes gamble, potentially leading to financial distress and undermining the broader acceptance of digital assets in traditional finance. Beyond Symbolic: Crafting a Robust Corporate Bitcoin Strategy for Long-Term Success Given the growing concerns, how can companies approach corporate Bitcoin holdings in a way that is truly sustainable and beneficial? The answer lies in moving beyond symbolic accumulation towards a deeply integrated, risk-aware strategy. 1. Strategic Alignment with Core Business Before acquiring any Bitcoin, a company must clearly articulate how this investment aligns with its core mission, business objectives, and risk appetite. Is it truly a long-term strategic asset, or is it merely speculative? For example, a payment processing company might see Bitcoin as a natural extension of its services, while a manufacturing firm might view it purely as a treasury diversification tool. 2. Comprehensive Due Diligence Treat Bitcoin acquisition with the same rigor as any major capital expenditure or M&A activity. This includes thorough research into market dynamics, regulatory implications, security requirements, and accounting treatments. 3. Robust Treasury Management Framework Develop clear, written policies for Bitcoin holdings, including: Investment Thesis: Why are we holding Bitcoin? Allocation Limits: Maximum percentage of total treasury assets. Custody Solutions: Detailed plan for secure storage. Valuation and Accounting: Clear methodologies for reporting. Exit Strategy: Conditions under which Bitcoin holdings would be reduced or sold. 4. Active Risk Mitigation Implement the crypto risk management controls discussed earlier. This is not a one-time setup but an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring and adaptation to market and regulatory changes. 5. Transparency and Communication Communicate your Bitcoin strategy clearly to investors, employees, and the public. Transparency builds trust and helps manage expectations, especially during periods of market volatility. Explain the rationale, the risks involved, and the long-term vision. 6. Explore Beyond Pure HODL While holding Bitcoin is a common strategy, companies might explore other avenues for digital asset integration, albeit with careful consideration of additional risks: Bitcoin for Payments: Accepting BTC for goods or services can expand customer reach and reduce transaction fees. Yield Strategies (with caution): Some companies explore lending out BTC or participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) for yield, but these come with significantly higher risks (smart contract risk, counterparty risk, impermanent loss). Indirect Exposure: Investing in Bitcoin ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) or companies with significant BTC holdings rather than direct ownership, which can simplify custody and regulatory compliance, though it still carries market risk. The key takeaway here is that a successful Bitcoin treasury strategy is not about blindly following trends but about making informed, strategic decisions that align with a company’s fundamental strengths and long-term vision. The Future Landscape: What’s Next for Corporate Bitcoin and Digital Asset Integration? The conversation around corporate Bitcoin holdings is evolving. We are likely to see a more nuanced approach from companies going forward. Instead of simply accumulating Bitcoin as a ‘symbolic’ gesture, future strategies may focus on: Utility-Driven Adoption: Companies will increasingly integrate Bitcoin and other digital assets where they offer clear operational or financial advantages, such as cross-border payments, supply chain transparency, or tokenized loyalty programs. Diversified Digital Asset Portfolios: Beyond Bitcoin, companies might explore stablecoins for operational liquidity, or other cryptocurrencies that align with specific business use cases (e.g., Ethereum for smart contract-based services). Sophisticated Treasury Management Tools: The development of more advanced software and services for managing digital assets will make it easier for corporate treasuries to handle crypto with the same rigor as traditional assets. Regulatory Clarity: As regulations mature, it will provide a clearer framework for companies to operate within, reducing uncertainty and potentially encouraging broader adoption. The journey of Bitcoin adoption by corporations is still in its early stages. The initial speculative phase is giving way to a more mature, strategic evaluation. This shift is healthy and necessary for the long-term integration of digital assets into the global economy. Conclusion: Navigating the New Frontier of Corporate Finance with Prudence James Check’s insights serve as a crucial reminder that the enthusiasm for digital assets must be tempered with pragmatic financial principles. While Bitcoin offers undeniable potential, its integration into corporate treasuries is not a panacea for all financial challenges. The long-term viability of a Bitcoin treasury strategy hinges not just on the price of BTC, but fundamentally on the robustness of a company’s core business, its strategic foresight, and its commitment to rigorous crypto risk management. For companies contemplating or currently holding Bitcoin, the message is clear: move beyond symbolic gestures. Embrace a comprehensive, disciplined approach that prioritizes financial stability, operational integrity, and a clear understanding of both the opportunities and the inherent risks. Only then can Bitcoin truly become a sustainable and valuable component of a forward-looking corporate treasury.

CertiK reported that this reflects a 52.1% decrease in value lost from the previous quarter. The quarter also saw 59 fewer incidents during this period. Ethereum Hit Hardest Again Phishing was the most damaging attack vector, as it saw $395 million being stolen across 52 incidents. Code vulnerabilities followed suit and recorded $235.8 million in losses across 47 incidents. In its latest report, CertiK said that Ethereum saw the highest number of incidents. The network recorded 70 hacks, scams, and exploits, resulting in $65.4 million in losses for the quarter. Additionally, funds worth $181 million were recovered, which brought the adjusted losses for the second quarter to $620.4 million. The average loss per incident was $4.3 million, while the median was around $104,000. Zooming out, the blockchain security firm also reported total losses of $2.47 billion across 344 incidents for the first half of 2025. Wallet compromises were the costliest during this period, as these breaches accounted for $1.71 billion in losses across 34 incidents. Next up was phishing, with $410.7 million stolen across 132 incidents, which made it the most frequent attack type so far this year. So far this year, Ethereum recorded 175 incidents in H1, resulting in $1.63 billion in losses. A total of $187.3 million was recovered in the first half of the year, pushing the adjusted total losses to $2.29 billion. Meanwhile, the average loss per incident for H1 was $7.13 million, with a median loss of $89,026. Two Major Hacks Skew Trend CertiK noted that while headline figures suggest worsening crypto security, two incidents alone accounted for around $1.78 billion of 2025’s losses – the Bybit hack and the Cetus Protocol breach. Hackers exploited Bybit’s cold wallet infrastructure in February 2025 by altering transaction logic and masking interfaces, which enabled them to steal over $1.5 billion in Ether. North Korea’s notorious state-sponsored hacking entity, the Lazarus Group, was responsible for it. Besides, Sui-based Cetus, on the other hand, suffered an exploit in an overflow check within the project’s liquidity calculation function, which resulted in $225 million in losses in May. Without these two incidents, total losses would be $690 million, which essentially indicates that the broader security trend may not be as severe as the raw figures imply.

Currently trading at $0.4710, the coin has recorded a 2.7% drop overnight and a 14.7% decline in the past 7 days. Its market cap stands at $3.59 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $82.73 million, up 2.87%, suggesting heightened market activity amid sell-offs. The sharp price correction is largely attributed to recent token unlock events, with 270 million Pi tokens released, causing a supply shock. Additionally, over 6 million Pi worth $2.8 million was moved to exchanges within 24 hours, increasing sell-side risk. Both RSI and MACD indicators suggest bearish momentum may persist in the short term. Interestingly, amid this volatility, the Pi mining rate has seen a modest 0.93% increase, rising from 0.0029887 to 0.0030165 Pi per hour, indicating a network still growing in user engagement. But does that signal a path to $1 in 2025? Let us understand the dynamics in this Pi price analysis. Pi Network Price Analysis On the daily chart, Pi Network continues to trade below the middle Bollinger Band and the 20-day SMA. The upper band at $0.6099 and the lower band at $0.4514 form a tight squeeze, typically signaling an incoming volatility spike. However, the price remains pinned near the lower band at $0.4708, suggesting bearish dominance. The RSI stands at 34.94, below the neutral 50 level, indicating the asset is approaching oversold territory but lacks bullish divergence. Despite the increasing 24-hour volume, the price has failed to bounce meaningfully, which is a classic sign of distribution rather than accumulation. In summary, unless a major fundamental catalyst like the Open Mainnet launch or a utility-driven adoption spike emerges, Pi’s outlook remains neutral-to-bearish. A sustained reclaim of $0.53 which is at mid-Bollinger would be the first bullish trigger, followed by a breakout toward $0.61 and then $0.70 before even entertaining the possibility of a $1 breakout.

Turkey Bans PancakeSwap The Turkish financial regulator, CMB, announced that it had taken legal action against PancakeSwap , a high-profile DEX that handled over $325 billion in trading volume in June. The CMB did not specify how it determined PancakeSwap was in breach of Turkish law. PancakeSwap has now become the first decentralized exchange banned in Turkey. The exchange failed to meet the licensing requirement set by CMB. Apart from PancakeSwap, CMB also banned Cryptoradar and Exchange Investr, along with more than 40 other websites. Why did Turkey Ban PancakeSwap? CMB has not yet released a criterion behind the enforcement, and PancakeSwap has not commented on the action. However, this step could be seen as a part of a broader strategy in Turkey, as the regulators are aiming to advance their goal of improving market stability and investor protection. Turkey is enhancing its regulatory framework to protect users from potential financial risks and illicit transactions. Under new regulations, it is tightening its security measures by increasing crypto market transparency through licensing and anti-money laundering (AML) rules. So the decision of the PancakeSwap ban follows the regulatory authority granted to the CMB last year, allowing it to block unlicensed foreign cryptocurrency service platforms targeting Turkish users. [post_titles_links postid=”478736″] Turkey Tightens Crypto Rules in 2025 On 28th June, Turkey published new, stricter rules for crypto in the Official Gazette, to maintain security and transparency in the transactions. Under Law No. 5549, the regulators introduced new transfer limits, mandatory waiting periods, and anti-money laundering (AML) policies in a bold move to tighten CMB oversight over crypto. Besides this, the country implemented a series of new regulations to mitigate risks in the crypto space. Final Thought It is crucial for all crypto service-providing platforms to seek proper approval from official regulators to continue operations in Turkey. This enforcement of banning websites is a precedent for other exchanges and platforms to comply with the Turkish regulatory regime. CMB and PancakeSwap have yet to deliver a comment regarding the enforcement.

The Turkish Capital Markets Board (CMB) banned PancakeSwap for “providing unauthorized crypto services” and failing to meet the licensing requirements it set for virtual asset service providers. The specific details of the breach weren’t elaborated, but it falls under the CMB’s authority to block unlicensed foreign platforms targeting Turkish users. How will the ban affect Turkish users of PancakeSwap and other blocked platforms? The ban restricts direct access for Turkish users to PancakeSwap and the other 45 blocked platforms, pushing them towards licensed, centralized exchanges or potentially into less secure methods like VPNs to bypass restrictions. This could reduce DeFi participation and stifle innovation within Turkey’s crypto community. Can PancakeSwap or other blocked platforms appeal the ban or obtain a license to operate in Turkey? The article doesn’t specify if PancakeSwap can appeal the ban directly. However, for any crypto service provider to operate legally in Turkey, they would need to comply with the CMB’s licensing requirements and new regulations, including AML/CFT and KYC rules.

33767162,[object Object],1751698828,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Oregon Vs Coinbase: AG Files Motion To Keep ‘Gensler-Era Copycat Lawsuit’ In State Court,https://bitcoinist.com/oregon-vs-coinbase-ag-files-motion-to-keep-gensler-era-copycat-lawsuit-in-state-court/,"Oregon’s Attorney General (AG) has filed a motion to keep the lawsuit against Coinbase in state court, following the crypto exchange’s efforts to move the litigation to federal court. Oregon Says Coinbase Case Must Stay In State Courts On July 2, Oregon’s Attorney General, Dan Rayfield, filed a motion to remand its lawsuit against Coinbase back to the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for Multnomah County. The motion follows the crypto exchange’s attempt to move the case to federal court. In early June, Coinbase filed a notice of removal, seeking to take the action from the Oregon courts to federal court, arguing that the case raises a federal question. The exchange argues that Oregon’s state law (OSL) claims “arise under” the federal law because the state’s courts use the federal Securities Act of 1993, and the federal Howey Test, for guidance to define what constitutes an “investment contract.” However, Oregon’s motion explains that “almost 50 years ago, the Supreme Court of Oregon, sitting en banc , broke stride with Howey in its interpretation of an ‘investment contract’ under the OSL, deciding the term should be ‘modified’ to encompass a broader range of investment schemes. Pratt v. Kross , 276, Or. 483, 497 (1976).” Since then, Oregon courts have followed the Pratt Test, which applies a broader definition of investment contract. The AG noted that “because Oregon does not strictly follow the Howey test, the State’s claims here do not turn on the Howey test.” The motion claims that the lawsuit isn’t a “regulatory land grab,” as Coinbase called it. Instead, it is a “quintessential state law action” that seeks redress on behalf of Oregonians under the state’s law. Therefore, it should be “adjudicated by the state court in which the Attorney General filed it.” Oregon’s ‘Gensler-Era’ Lawsuit On April 18, Oregon’s AG filed a complaint in Multnomah County Circuit Court against Coinbase, alleging the crypto exchange had violated the Oregon securities law by facilitating the sale of unregistered cryptocurrencies to the state’s residents. As reported by Bitcoinist, the lawsuit states that the exchange “has continuously and repeatedly violated the Oregon Securities Law, which ascribes liability to persons ´who [s]ell[] or successfully solicit[] the sale of a security … in violation of the Oregon Securities Law’ (ORS 59.115(1)(a)), as well as to persons who ‘participate[] or materially aid[] in the sale’ (ORS 59.115(3)).” Following the news, Coinbase’s CLO, Paul Grewal, affirmed that Rayfield is “literally picking up where the Gary Gensler SEC left off,” adding that the lawsuit is a “copycat case” attempting to “resurrect” the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) long-criticized regulatory approach under the previous administration. The SEC sued Coinbase in June 2023, affirming that the platform operated as an unregistered broker-dealer and illegally sold unregistered securities through its staking program. However, the lawsuit was dismissed in February 2025 following the establishment of the agency’s Crypto Task Force. Oregon’s lawsuit now claims that Coinbase sold high-risk investments without properly vetting to protect consumers, which has caused significant losses for Oregonians. Notably, the case covers significantly more tokens than the SEC originally named in its case, which listed 13 tokens. The lawsuit claims that the crypto exchange offered and sold 31 cryptocurrencies as investment contracts. In a Wednesday post , Grewal called out Rayfield for attempting to send his “Gensler-era copycat” lawsuit back to state courts, affirming that it goes against the US’s recent progress developing a clear and unified framework for the industry. In most places, it’s 2025. But the Oregon AG still thinks it’s 2023 with his Gensler-era @secgov copycat suit. Yesterday, he asked the federal court to send the case back to his home state court. This pursuit of a patchwork of state regulation – especially against the historic progress towards a unified federal framework – only helps politicians and harms consumers.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|coinbase|Coinbase lawsuit|crypto lawsuit|Oregon AG|Oregon Attorney General|Oregon vs Coinbase|SEC|SEC vs Coinbase|Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),EN,0,0,AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-07-05 07:00:28

In a post on the social media platform X, the billionaire says that Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” will increase the US national debt from about $230,000 per American household to $425,000 per American household over the next decade. The ballooning national debt will have severe ramifications, according to Dalio. “Now that the budget bill has passed Congress, we can see what the projections look like for deficits, government debt, and debt service expenses. In brief, the bill is expected to lead to spending of about $7 trillion a year with inflows of about $5 trillion a year, so the debt, which is now about 6x of the money taken in, 100% of GDP, and about $230,000 per American family, will rise over ten years to about 7.5x the money taken in, 130% of GDP and $425,000 per family. That will increase interest and principal payments on the debt from about $10 trillion ($1 trillion in interest, $9 trillion in principal) to about $18 trillion (of which $2 trillion is interest payments), which will lead to either a big squeezing out (and cutting off) of spending and/or unimaginable tax increases, or a lot of printing and devaluing of money and pushing interest rates to unattractively low levels.” Dalio believes the remedy to the looming fiscal crises is to cut spending and raise taxes to lower the annual deficit to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio. “This printing and devaluing is not good for those holding bonds as a storehold of wealth, and what’s bad for bonds and US credit markets is bad for everyone because the US Treasury market is the backbone of all capital markets, which are the backbones of our economic and social conditions. Unless this path is soon rectified to bring the budget deficit from roughly 7% of GDP to about 3% by making adjustments to spending, taxes, and interest rates, big, painful disruptions will likely occur.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The collaboration, announced by the bank, aims to evaluate how digital wallets and blockchain-based financial solutions can be adapted for Japan's mobile-first user base. Minna Bank, a fully digital bank affiliated with Fukuoka Financial Group, said in a statement that the research will focus on areas such as payment systems, on-chain banking infrastructure and user experience. The initiative comes at a time when banks are accelerating their efforts to modernize cross-border payments, deposits and settlement processes, with the market value of stablecoins exceeding $250 billion.

He expressed confidence in Ripple’s unique role as a company actively deploying blockchain to address real-world problems. Ripple’s Long-Term Commitment to Utility Garlinghouse emphasized the importance of long-term commitment in developing blockchain-based financial solutions. Acknowledging that “introducing XRP into those flows will take time,” he described Ripple’s progress as part of a broader effort that is ongoing but already advancing. His tone suggested the company is fully aware of the challenges ahead, yet resolute in its trajectory. He framed Ripple’s position as distinctive, stating, “When I zoom out and look at where Ripple sits in the blockchain and crypto ecosystem, we are incredibly fortunate to be the only company with real customers solving real problems.” WOW! RIPPLE CEO BRAD GARLINGHOUSE: „WHEN I ZOOM OUT AND LOOK OUT WHERE RIPPLE SITS IN THE BLOCKCHAIN & CRYPTO ECOSYSTEM WE ARE INCREDIBLY FORTUNATE TO BE THE ONLY COMPANY WITH REAL CUSTOMERS SOLVING REAL PROBLEMS!“ #XRP WILL SOLVE A MULTI-TRILLION-DOLLAR PROBLEM! pic.twitter.com/cbbuTcPP1T — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) July 3, 2025 This assertion reflects the years Ripple has spent developing partnerships , regulatory engagement strategies, and infrastructure to support the utility of XRP across cross-border payment systems. Execution Over Hype While Ripple’s competitors often focus on speculative use cases or theoretical applications of blockchain, Garlinghouse has made it clear that Ripple has prioritized implementation over experimentation. The company’s customer base, which includes financial institutions and payment providers, gives weight to his argument that Ripple’s products are already being used globally in practical scenarios. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He continued by underlining that the journey is still in its early phases. “We are at the early stages of that marathon,” he said, referencing the broader adoption curve that blockchain technology and digital assets must navigate to reach full-scale integration within the global financial system. Ripple has always prioritized utility and adoption over speculation and short-term price movements, and Garlinghouse added, “There’s no doubt that… we’re the only ones that have crossed that starting line.” Others in the space may be preparing, but Ripple has already begun. Looking Toward the Future Garlinghouse’s comments centered on Ripple’s positioning and the early but tangible results of years of development. The system Ripple works with allows XRP to solve the global payments problem , and his remarks offered a contrast to the more promotional rhetoric common in the industry, grounding Ripple’s vision in advancement and real-world utility rather than hype. For observers of the crypto space, his statement reinforced the idea that utility, backed by partnerships, regulatory engagement, and real-world application, will determine long-term winners in the blockchain sector. As Ripple continues to build, the emphasis remains on execution with XRP and delivering technology that works today.

While Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to hover on meme-fueled legacy alone, a powerful new player under $1 is stealing the spotlight: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is the 5th stage of presale already sold out more than 60%. The present amount of money raised by Mutuum Finance is already more than $11.7 million with more than 12700 holders. Dogecoin may still enjoy its status among the top cryptocurrencies by market cap, but when it comes to innovation and actual utility, Mutuum Finance is leaving DOGE in the dust. Dogecoin Holds Steady as Investors Wait for Next Big Move Currently trading at just under the $0.161 mark, Dogecoin (DOGE) is still trading at a steady range as it continues to soar to new heights based on its status as a meme coin. Albeit the absence of significant changes and news, DOGE has demonstrated its strength by recovering after touching recent bottoms at around $0.14 and gaining small bullish impetus. Dogecoin remains under the watchful eyes of analysts who are predicting that a push towards $0.20 might be on the cards should the general market be bullish this summer. Nevertheless, given that its worth largely depends on social media buzz and community hype, one cannot say how the Dogecoin project will evolve, unlike the projects with greater real-world utility attached. Mutuum Finance is one of these projects that are gaining popularity as far as early investors are concerned. Mutuum Finance Presale Achieves Milestone More than $11.7 million and more than 12,700 investors have been drawn to the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale. This kind of winds is the sign of increasing confidence of investors in short-term success of the project and its long-term vision. MUTM is priced at $0.03, which is the lowest-possible price before a 16% hike in the next presale stage. $50K Bug Bounty as Mutuum Finance Continues Development Momentum Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty with CertiK. It is inclusive in the sense that, it is distributed according to the four variable degrees of severity that are, critical, major, minor and low. It is also the form of communicating the fact that the project is interested in security and transparency. Proven Dual-Lending Formula Transformation of DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed as a hybrid lending platform that will serve the active as well as passive DeFi users. Users can earn passive income by lending their USDT via smart contracts pools which provide stable passive income in the project’s Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending mechanism. In addition, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model permits lenders and borrowers to be as engaged as they could ever be in reciprocating terms of a transaction and do not require a third party to act on their behalf. The paradigm is more prevalent for the clients of less secure assets. Leaderboard and $100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance values its first-time investors and has launched a $100,000 giveaway that will see 10 winners receive $10,000 MUTM. This is to celebrate the investors’ first trust in the project. As Dogecoin (DOGE) holds steady near $0.16 with little more than meme momentum backing its price, serious investors are eyeing more utility-driven opportunities under $1, like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Now in its 5th presale stage and over 60% sold out, Mutuum has already raised over $11.7 million from 12,700+ investors, signaling strong confidence in its innovative DeFi lending model. Backed by a $50K CertiK bug bounty, dual lending protocols, and a growing community, MUTM is quickly becoming the top pick for forward-thinking crypto buyers. Join the Mutuum Finance presale now and secure your position in what could be the best crypto under $1 going into 2025.

Analyst Predicts 80% Drop Soon,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-crash-coming-analyst-predicts-80-drop-soon/,"The post Bitcoin Price Crash Coming? Analyst Predicts 80% Drop Soon appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin may seem bullish right now , but a leading crypto analyst has issued a shocking warning: a crash of over 80% could be just around the corner. While Bitcoin has climbed 3.3% in the last 30 days and currently trades at $108,161, concerns are building beneath the surface. Crypto analyst EDO FARINA XRP , who commands a following of more than 167,000 on X, believes Bitcoin’s rally is dangerously overheated. In a recent post, he predicted that a sudden, sharp correction is not just possible—it’s imminent. And when it hits, he warns, it will be fast and severe. Bitcoin Market Is Overheating According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s recent surge isn’t backed by fundamentals. Since the U.S. political shift in November 2024 , Bitcoin has surged by nearly 60%. In Q2 2025 alone, it delivered a quarterly return of 29.9%, and so far in July, it has grown by nearly 1%. But the economic backdrop tells a different story. Inflation in the U.S. has eased to 2.4%, close to the Federal Reserve’s target. Still, GDP growth is slowing—projected to drop to 1.8% in 2025. The labor market is cooling too, with unemployment rising to 4.1% in June, while consumer spending is expected to weaken. The analyst suggests this kind of economic environment doesn’t support such an aggressive BTC rally. Missed the Bitcoin Boom? EDO FARINA argues that the best time to buy Bitcoin was years ago. In 2020, BTC returned a staggering 304.1%, followed by a solid 59.6% in 2021. Although 2022 saw a major correction with a 64.3% drop, the market bounced back strongly—posting gains of 115.4% in 2023 and 121.1% in 2024. According to the analyst, today’s price level is no longer ideal for those seeking “safe” long-term gains. Bitcoin Whales Are Allegedly Selling Another red flag is the behavior of Bitcoin whales. The analyst claims that large holders, especially those owning Satoshi-era coins, are moving their BTC to exchanges. Each time the price approaches the critical $110,000 level, it faces strong resistance. For instance, on May 22, BTC touched $111,662. But by the next day, the market dropped nearly 4%. On June 10, Bitcoin climbed to $110,266, only to fall by more than 8% over the next 12 days. A similar trend occurred on July 3, when BTC touched $110,681 and dropped by 1.44% the very next day. These repeated sell-offs around the $110K mark suggest that whales are actively cashing out, keeping Bitcoin from breaking out to a new high. [post_titles_links postid=”478664″] The Real Concern: Low Trading Volume According to Farina, what’s even more dangerous than whale selling is the low trading volume in the current market. Compared to previous bull runs, fewer retail investors are buying. The analyst argues that today’s price action is driven by a few large players, not widespread demand. This poses a serious risk. If whales decide to dump their holdings all at once, there may not be enough buying support to hold the price up. This lack of liquidity could trigger a cascade of sell-offs and lead to a massive crash. Could Bitcoin Crash Soon? Farina believes the crash will be triggered by a major, unexpected event—what’s often called a “black swan” in financial markets. Once it happens, the crash will be swift and brutal, catching most investors off-guard. He concludes that Bitcoin’s current high is artificially inflated and not supported by real market activity. Without strong and broad demand, the price could collapse quickly when the pressure hits. While Bitcoin’s price action appears bullish , the warning signs are hard to ignore. Whale movements, resistance at $110K, weak economic fundamentals, and low volume suggest that the rally might not be as healthy as it looks. Whether this ends in a soft pullback or a dramatic crash, investors may want to stay alert.

As of July 5, 2025, Bitcoin is trading around $107,493, down about 2.14% today according to CoinDesk data from July 4, 2025.

Some predictions for July 2025 suggest Bitcoin could reach a maximum price of $125,000, with an average around $115,000.

Bitcoin’s all-time high was $111,970 on May 22, 2025.

How high can Bitcoin’s price go in 2025? Some analysts project Bitcoin could average around $125,027 in 2025, potentially reaching highs of $168,000 to $175,000.

The price action reflects strong buying interest but also hesitation as bulls struggle to reclaim higher levels. Despite holding above key support, Solana must break decisively above resistance to confirm a bullish breakout and continue its upward trend. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms Rising Wedge Pattern – $2,200 Support Back In Focus? Market momentum has favored bulls in recent weeks, but Solana’s inability to breach the $160 zone raises questions about the strength of this trend. Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared insights highlighting that Solana is currently ranging within a rising channel pattern—a structure that, while seemingly bullish, can often precede a breakdown to lower demand zones if support fails. This makes the coming days especially important for SOL’s trajectory. As macro conditions improve and Bitcoin flirts with new all-time highs, Solana is expected to respond in kind. However, technical signals suggest caution. A break below the rising channel could target the $128.50 support area, while a successful breakout above $160 could open the door to retesting local highs. Traders and investors alike are closely watching Solana’s next move in this high-stakes consolidation phase. Solana Holds Key Support Amid Rising Channel Formation Solana is currently trading below the $150 level, reflecting a notable 20% decline from its local high set in May. Despite this setback, the asset continues to hold a strong support base, signaling that bullish sentiment has not entirely faded. The broader market remains in a consolidation phase, with Solana showing signs of indecision as it moves sideways within a tightening price range. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic, pointing out that a breakout above the key $150–$160 supply zone could spark renewed upside momentum. However, the current price structure suggests that Solana may not be ready yet to retest previous highs. According to Carl Runefelt, Solana is ranging within a rising channel—a pattern that can lead to sharp movements if broken. While rising channels can sustain bullish continuation, a breakdown below the lower trendline often results in accelerated downside moves. Runefelt warns that if Solana breaks below the channel, the next key support area lies around $128.50. This level has historically acted as a strong demand zone and could serve as the next target in the event of a bearish move. In the meantime, Solana’s consolidation reflects broader market uncertainty, with traders waiting for a decisive breakout or breakdown to guide positioning. A successful reclaim of the $150 level would improve sentiment significantly and could set the stage for a push toward the $170–$180 range. On the other hand, failure to hold above current levels may shift the narrative toward further downside risk.

The daily chart reveals that SOL has been unable to break decisively above the $155–$160 resistance zone, while strong support remains near the $140 level. Price action shows repeated rejections near the 100-day moving average (blue line), which now acts as dynamic resistance around $155.60. The 200-day moving average (red) sits further above $165.54, marking a long-term resistance area. Volume remains relatively low compared to early June spikes, suggesting market participants are waiting for a clear breakout direction. A push above $160 would likely trigger bullish momentum, potentially opening the door toward the $170 level. However, the rising channel identified by analysts suggests a possible downside risk if the lower trendline fails.

Until then, bulls must defend current levels and aim to reclaim the 100-day SMA to maintain the broader recovery structure. The coming sessions may offer clarity as consolidation nears its resolution.

(05th July, 2025)",https://coinpedia.org/news/why-crypto-market-is-down-today-05th-july-2025/,"The post Why Crypto Market is Down Today? (05th July, 2025) appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market today has experienced a broad-based downturn today, with the total industry market capitalization slipping to $3.33 trillion. Trading volume also shrank considerably by 16.50%, now standing at $93 billion, signaling cautious attitude from investors. Bitcoin remains the dominant force with a 64.6% market share, followed distantly by Ethereum at 9.1%. A combination of macro events and sudden whale activity has injected fresh volatility into the digital asset space. The Fear & Greed Index rests at a neutral 51, reflecting indecision among market participants. A significant development casting a shadow over today’s action is the $3.6 billion crypto options expiry. Of that total, Bitcoin accounts for $2.98 billion and Ethereum $610 million. The unwinding of these contracts has led to volatility and uncertain short-term moves, as traders reassess risk amid high open interest. Whale Activity and Option Expiry Unnerve Investors? Bitcoin’s price has slipped by 0.68% over the last 24 hours, currently hovering around $108,294.97. While the dip may seem modest, the root cause is raising alarm bells. As a dormant wallet containing 80,009 BTC, which was inactive for over 14 years, has suddenly moved approximately $8.7 billion worth of tokens. Such activity typically highlights security concerns and fears of large-scale dumping, which often prompts a wave of defensive selling. This movement coincided with today’s massive options expiry event, further intensifying downward pressure. Also read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Ethereum is not immune either. The second-largest crypto has declined 1.2%, now trading at $2,527.90. This pullback is largely linked to short-term profit-taking following a strong 4.09% weekly performance. Moreover, ETH faced stiff resistance near $2,600, which drove liquidations of over-leveraged long positions. Liquidation Shakeout Hits Market Liquidation events have further strained investor sentiment. Bitcoin’s leveraged long positions took a hit amid the dormant wallet scare, triggering cascading liquidations. The overall 24-hour trading volume for BTC has fallen by 14.9%, now at $42.47 billion. Ethereum’s fall is a case of technical rejection. The failed attempt to break above $2,600 led to profit booking and liquidation of weak hands. The combined pressure from options expiry and short-term resistance zones added fuel to the correction. XRP, meanwhile, is down 0.25% to $2.22 after failing to maintain its breakout above the $2.27–$2.30 range. The market also seemed underwhelmed by Ripple’s recent announcement about securing a banking license, which failed to generate strong bullish momentum.
