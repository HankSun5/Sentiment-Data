The price of ADA started the week on a bearish note and spent the majority of the week trending downwards. Particularly, the ADA price fell by about 9.5% to bottom out at $0.33260. However, the crypto has rebounded and has increased by about 6% from this low. This price rebound was accompanied by a large transaction volume, especially from large holders, also known as whales. According to data from IntoTheBlock (ITB), this transaction volume amounted to 17.33 billion ADA, worth about $6 billion. Major Uptick In Cardano Whale Activity The Large Transaction Volume metric from IntoTheBlock tracks details on transactions with a value of $100,000 or greater. Interestingly, this metric puts the worth of whale transactions at $24.18 billion in the past seven days, a notable increase from last week’s readings. A huge part of these transactions were recorded in the past three days, with $6 billion movements coming on October 11 and $5.8 billion on October 10. Related Reading: Ethereum TD Setup: Why The ETH Price Must Hold $2,250 The uptick in whale activity appears to be closely linked to ongoing developments within the Cardano ecosystem. According to a recent report from InputOutput, Cardano has remained a major hub for blockchain developers, especially following the recent node upgrades to v.9.2.0 and the subsequent v.9.2.1. InputOutput’s data reveals that by the end of September, there were 1,376 active projects being built on Cardano, underscoring its popularity among blockchain innovators. Additionally, during September, the number of minted native tokens grew by 80,000, while the total number of transactions on the network surged by 1.34 million. ADA Price To Reach $0.5 Or Drop Again? ADA’s price action has been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks, and sentiment among investors has been more negative than usual, especially on social media. Cardano’s creator, Charles Hoskinson, addressed this sentiment on social media platform X. Hoskinson clarified that the negative outlook doesn’t reflect any failure on Cardano’s part, emphasizing that the project continues to grow. He also took the opportunity to criticize other crypto ecosystems, remarking that Cardano remains one of the few cryptocurrencies still committed to being a true decentralized currency, unlike those aligning with corporate giants like BlackRock and Wall Street. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash: $1.83 Billion Makes Its Way To Exchanges, Is A Bloodbath Coming? Despite the pessimism, the ADA price has managed to hold a key support level at $0.33, which offers some relief to bullish investors. Additionally, on-chain metrics such as net network growth and positive momentum in the futures market suggest a more optimistic outlook. The recent uptick in whale activity could signal the beginning of a more sustained rise for the ADA price. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.354. The first target is a significant break above $0.40 before a return to $0.50.

Related Reading: Helium (HNT) Falters 15% As Crypto Market Tries To Bounce Back XRP Eyes $60 With SWIFT’s Volume Boost In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Levi Rietveld proposed a unique scenario where XRP’s price could potentially surge to $60, marking a staggering increase of approximately 11,220% from its current value of $0.53. Firstly, Rietveld referred to a 2017 paper indicating SWIFT’s daily payment processes. According to the paper, SWIFT typically manages about $5 trillion in daily transactions, accumulating to $1.25 quadrillion every year. Based on current market changes and more adoption of the network, the analyst suggested that the figure will likely rise in 2024. He disclosed that SWIFT’s daily transactions have possibly increased to $7 trillion, equating to $1.8 quadrillion annually. The analyst also noted that SWIFT’s payment message volumes are usually about 11.5 million daily, with an average payment size of around $45,000. Moreover, he reveals that the current average payment size has increased to $60,000 per transaction, highlighting the staggering amount of fees it takes to execute just one transaction. Taking these figures into consideration, Rietveld has hypothesized that if XRP can acquire just 10% of SWIFT’s overall market share, the cryptocurrency could see an “astronomical” increase in its price. Starting on a more conservative estimate, the analyst revealed that with a 5% market share which is about $239.4 billion in daily volume, XRP could see a 1,252.5X increase. This is equivalent to a 9,080.6% surge in XRP, pushing its value to new all time highs at $26.62. Rietveld further estimated that with a 10% market share, XRP’s price could rise to $52, and even surpass $200 with 20% of SWIFT’s volume. The analyst has called on crypto investors to begin accumulating XRP, stressing that his ambitious projections for the cryptocurrency are not far-fetched, given its advantages over SWIFT in terms of cost, speed, and reliability. Institutional Adoption To Drive XRP Price Even Higher While hypothesizing the extent of XRP’s price surge with a small percentage of SWIFT’s volume, Rietveld also disclosed that the cryptocurrency could see a massive price increase as adoption from institutional investors skyrockets. The analyst disclosed that the XRP market may undergo a significant supply shock when institutional investors begin accumulating the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Baby Doge Coin Rockets 200% In 30 Days – What’s On The Horizon? He revealed that over time, institutional investors will eventually need to buy XRP from the public supply, as the tokens locked in escrow would not be sufficient to meet demand. Considering XRP’s already limited supply, Rietveld has projected that the potential supply shock would trigger a massive price rally to about $200 in the next 10 years.

SUI’s fundamentals also paint a bullish picture for the crypto and indicate that it could be one of the best performers in this market cycle. Related Reading: Baby Doge Coin Rockets 200% In 30 Days – What’s On The Horizon? SUI Eyes Breakout With Traders Going Long SUI could be on the verge of a breakout, with traders betting that the crypto will rise higher. Coinglass data shows that the long/short ratio is currently at 1.3, with 56.65% of traders opening long positions on SUI compared to 43.35% of traders with short positions. Trading volume for SUI’s derivatives has surged by over 33%, indicating that these traders are very confident about the crypto rising higher. Meanwhile, open interest is also up by over 14%, further confirming the massive attention that SUI is currently gaining. These long traders already look to have the upper hand, seeing how the short terms have witnessed more liquidations. Further data from Coinglass shows that $5.14 million in short positions have been liquidated in the last 24 hours compared to $1.58 million in long positions. This is bullish for the SUI price as the breakout could easily be achieved as more short traders get shaken out of their positions. Moreover, the coin has been rallying for a while, and its fundamentals and technical analysis suggest that this upward trend could continue. SUI has already rallied over 100% in the last month, breaking into the top 20 crypto ranking in the process. Fundamentals that support a further price rally for the coin include the surging decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on the Sui network. DeFiLlama data shows that decentralized exchange (DEX) volume on the network has shot up over 50% this last week. The network’s Total Value Locked (TVL) is also rising, as it recently crossed the $1 billion mark. A Price Breakout To $2.50 Crypto expert Michael Van De Poppe predicted that the SUI price could rise to as high as $2.50 soon enough. He noted that the coin achieved a strong bounce at the $1.79 price level. In line with this, he expects the price to continue towards new highs, potentially reaching between $2.20 and $2.50. A rally to this price range is significant as it will mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the SUI price, whose current ATH is $2.18. Meanwhile, crypto analyst The Cryptomist indicated that the coin’s weekly close is likely to determine its next move. She claimed a break above $1.91 would lead to price discovery.

There’s really nothing to discuss here. pic.twitter.com/7cAVWVEK15 — Axel 💎🙌 Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) October 10, 2024 Data shows significant growth among whales, who held only 335,000 BTC in early May when Bitcoin traded between $60,000 and $65,000. While prices remained in that range, whales continued to accumulate, and now hold around 1.9 million BTC, indicating strong short-term confidence among high-net-worth investors. Netflow Metrics Of Large Holders Recent data shows that accumulation sprees haven’t cooled off, despite recent price corrections. For example, yesterday, BTC fell below $59K for the first time this month, leading to massive liquidations. Don’t believe that whales accumulated 1.5M BTC and wonder where they got it from? How about taking a look at the loss-making sales on exchanges? In the last 24 hours, 24.1K BTC were sold at a loss. pic.twitter.com/tAgeCI6qhe — Axel 💎🙌 Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) October 11, 2024 Yet, large holders, who account for 0.1% of the circulating supply, netted +629 BTC yesterday. Two days ago, this figure was even higher, with an influx of 2,480 BTC. Furthermore, CryptoQuant statistics indicate that Bitcoin’s exchange reserve has fallen from 2.576 million tokens at the start of October to 2.571 million tokens, reflecting ongoing accumulation. Price Prediction And Market Implications As of this writing, Bitcoin was pegged at $61,690 having lost 1.68% for the week. DMI had +DI standing at 18.3 with -DI placed at 23.3, which were a couple of points above but declining continuously. Related Reading: Baby Doge Coin Rockets 200% In 30 Days – What’s On The Horizon? It simply means that despite the relentless selling pressures, they are somewhat weak. As it currently stands at -40.74, Williams %R is on the neutral side. From this, Bitcoin might get stuck in this range until strong buying or selling pressure will come up. Experienced analyst Peter Brandt holds that Bitcoins will reach an all-time high of $150,000 for this cycle but warns that inability to break out of the current range will cause the price to shatter and will go way down, 75% at worst.

After the euphoria surrounding the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts in late September, the market is experiencing uncertainty and anxiety. While some investors remain optimistic, the recent price movements of XRP have led to a sense of caution. Top crypto analyst Amonyx has shared insights into the potential for an unexpected XRP rally. In his analysis, he suggests that the altcoin might surprise skeptics with gains surpassing 1,000%. According to Amonyx, this resistance level could be a launching pad for XRP if the price breaks above it. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Break Yearly Highs ‘Any Moment Now’ – Crypto Analyst With significant market fluctuations, investors are keeping a close eye on XRP’s ability to hold above key price points. The anticipation surrounding XRP’s future has created a mix of hope and skepticism as traders weigh the possibility of a breakout against the risks of a further decline. As XRP continues to navigate this critical juncture, all eyes will be on its performance to determine the next steps for this altcoin. XRP Analyst Sets Optimistic Targets XRP is at a turning point as analysts await a signal that could propel its price higher amidst market uncertainty. Top analyst and investor Amonyx recently shared a compelling technical analysis on X, offering an optimistic outlook for XRP’s future. His analysis features a chart illustrating a potential ascending bull pennant pattern that has been forming since June 2018. This pattern suggests a buildup of buying pressure, signaling that XRP may be poised for a breakout. If XRP successfully breaks above the resistance defined by this bullish pattern, Amonyx predicts a remarkable surge in price, potentially targeting levels as high as $70 and even $500. While these predictions are ambitious, they underscore the market’s inherent volatility and the potential for dramatic price shifts. Amonyx points out a critical factor influencing market sentiment: many investors believe XRP is unlikely to rise again. This prevailing skepticism may set the stage for a significant upward movement, as market psychology often plays a crucial role in price dynamics. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Testing $0.34 Support – On-Chain Data Suggests Price Consolidation In the coming weeks, all eyes will be on XRP as traders assess whether this anticipated breakout will materialize, potentially changing the narrative for the altcoin and its investors. Technical Analysis XRP is currently trading at $0.53, having recently lost both the 1D 200 moving average (MA) and the 200 exponential moving average (EMA). The price is struggling to close above the MA, which is $0.54. For bulls to regain momentum, XRP must surge past these levels to retest local highs around $0.66. However, if the price fails to secure a close above the MA and EMA, a deeper correction could be near. Analysts are closely monitoring this critical juncture, as a breakdown below $0.53 could lead to further declines, potentially targeting support levels around $0.48 or lower.

However, the crypto has to scale a major resistance level if the current bull run is to get back on track. $64,000 The Resistance Level To Watch: Analyst In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, an analyst with the pseudonym ShayanBTC has put forward an interesting prognosis for the Bitcoin price in the short term. According to the crypto expert, $64,000 and $55,000 are two crucial levels that every BTC investor should watch over the coming days. This analysis is based on the Realized Price Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) age bands. This on-chain metric is relevant for assessing Bitcoin market behavior, as it measures the holding pattern of different investor groups through a set of different realized prices. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Accumulate Almost $1 Billion In BTC As Exchange Reserves Falls Towards New Lows The UTXO age bands metric highlights the average price at which Bitcoin holders acquired their coins while considering how long they’ve held the assets. The most notable age bands in this metric are the 3-month to 6-month (short-term) cohort and the 6-month to 12-month (long-term) cohort. ShayanBTC highlighted in their post that the realized prices of Bitcoin holders in the short-term and long-term cohorts have served as critical support or resistance levels in the past. Historically, when the Bitcoin price struggles to breach the average purchase price of these cohorts, it implies a bearish trend for the flagship cryptocurrency. ShayanBTC added: Conversely, if Bitcoin can break above this realized price, it suggests growing bullish momentum, as new buyers are willing to hold even at higher levels. According to data from CryptoQuant, the Bitcoin price is currently hovering between the realized prices of these two cohorts. As of this writing, the realized price for short-term holders stands at $64,000, while the realized price for long-term holders stands at around $55,000. As it stands, the price of Bitcoin seems set to test the resistance level and 3-6 month holders’ realized price of $64,000. ShayanBTC noted that a successful breakthrough above this price level could indicate further bullish momentum and potential resumption of the bullish trend. On the flip side, if the Bitcoin price fails to breach this $64,000 level, it could signal fresh selling pressure from short-term holders. Ultimately, this could lead to a deep correction toward the $55,000 level. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at $63,249, reflecting a mere 1.1% increase in the past day. According to data from CoinGecko, the flagship cryptocurrency is up by more than 2% in the last seven days.

Meanwhile, the Spot Ethereum ETFs still retain a negative performance despite a reduction in net outflows. Related Reading: US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Become Second-Largest Holder Of BTC Behind Satoshi Spot Bitcoin ETFs Halt Three-Day Decline With $254 Million Inflow Following the $300 million net outflow recorded in the first week of October, the spot BTC ETF market opened last week on a positive note recording net inflows of $236.19 million on Monday, October 7. However, these investment funds soon experienced a three-day downturn resulting in cumulative outflows of $179.98 between October 8-10. On Friday, October 12, these Bitcoin ETFs registered aggregate inflows of $253.54 million, representing the highest daily capital investment over the past two weeks. The majority of these gains came from Fidelity’s FBTC which attracted inflows of $117.10 million. Ark & 21 Shares ARKB also saw inflows of $97.58 million, while Bitwise’s BITB garnered $38.81 million from investors. Meanwhile, VanEck’s HODL and Invesco’s BTCO also recorded significant inflows of $14.26 million and $7.88 million. All other Bitcoin spot ETFs including BlackRock’s IBIT experienced zero inflows, except Grayscale’s GBTC which produced a net outflow of $22.09 million. Following the recent weekly gains, the total net assets of the spot Bitcoin market increased to $58.66 billion, representing 4.71% of the BTC market cap. BlackRock’s IBIT accounts for about 40% of these assets holding 369,640.1 BTC, valued at $23.30 billion. Grayscale’s GBTC initially ranked as the largest Bitcoin spot ETF holding 600,000 BTC tokens. However, massive levels of outflows valued at $20.19 billion allow the fund to sit second with 220,177.5 BTC valued at $13.85 billion.

While this value represents a $25.47 million reduction from the figures reported in October’s first week, it marks the 10th week of negative returns in the 12 trading weeks for the Spot Ether ETFs. Interestingly, these funds only recorded a single day of daily inflow ($3.06 million) in the past week. The total net outflows of spot Ethereum ETFs are currently valued at $558.88 million. Meanwhile, the total value traded in this market stands at $143.54 million. At the time of writing Ethereum trades at $2,459 with a 0.78% gain in the last day, while Bitcoin remains valued at $62,725 following a 0.22% price rise in the same period.

According to Martinez, who referenced data from on-chain analytics platform Santiment, XRP whales have made substantial purchases totaling around 40 million XRP within the last 48 hours. Related Reading: Baby Doge Coin Rockets 200% In 30 Days – What’s On The Horizon? This significant accumulation trend coincides with a rise in large transactions to and from cryptocurrency exchanges, as highlighted by whale transaction tracker Whale Alerts during the same period. Whales Buy Millions Of XRP In a recent post on social media platform X, Martinez shared a Santiment data chart that illustrates the total holdings of XRP addresses containing between 1 million and 10 million XRP tokens. He highlighted that these specific cohorts of traders have collectively acquired approximately 40 million XRP over the past 48 hours, amounting to an investment of around $22 million. While this figure might appear modest in comparison to the more substantial movements typically seen from XRP whales, it marks a significant development as it represents the first notable inflow into these wallets since the beginning of the month. The chart shared by Martinez reveals a concerning trend. The total holdings of these whale wallets have been in a steep decline since the start of October. On October 1, the cumulative holdings for this group were recorded at approximately 3.93 billion XRP. However, in a matter of days, these wallets experienced a substantial loss of around 130 million XRP, driving their total holdings down to a three-month low of 3.8 billion XRP by October 8. However, recent accumulation by the whale addresses has seen their collective holdings increase to 3.85 billion in the past 24 hours. According to data from Whale Alerts, there have been multiple instances of large XRP transactions entering and leaving crypto exchanges in the past 24 hours. The largest transaction occurred with the transfer of 104 million XRP tokens worth $55 million from an unknown wallet into a new unknown wallet. Another notable transaction was the transfer of 52 million XRP tokens worth $27.8 million from an unknown wallet into crypto exchange Bybit. A while later, 30 million XRP tokens were transferred from Bybit into another private wallet. Is XRP Headed To $0.5 Or $0.6? Current price action shows XRP consolidating between an upper range of $0.54 and a lower range of $0.52 within the past seven days. This lack of clear direction suggests low volatility and a lack of interest among crypto traders, as evidenced by a trading volume decline of approximately 30% in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Whales Hoard $90 Million In Bitcoin: A Sign Of What’s To Come? However, the recent increase in whale holdings could signal a renewed interest among large investors in XRP, hinting at a potential shift in market sentiment as the new week begins. Historically, increases in whale accumulation have often been accompanied by a steady rise in the XRP price. If this trend continues, it could replicate the accumulation seen in September, which propelled XRP to a peak of $0.668.
