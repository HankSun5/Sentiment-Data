The price of ADA started the week on a bearish note and spent the majority of the week trending downwards. Particularly, the ADA price fell by about 9.5% to bottom out at $0.33260. However, the crypto has rebounded and has increased by about 6% from this low. This price rebound was accompanied by a large transaction volume, especially from large holders, also known as whales. According to data from IntoTheBlock (ITB), this transaction volume amounted to 17.33 billion ADA, worth about $6 billion. Major Uptick In Cardano Whale Activity The Large Transaction Volume metric from IntoTheBlock tracks details on transactions with a value of $100,000 or greater. Interestingly, this metric puts the worth of whale transactions at $24.18 billion in the past seven days, a notable increase from last week’s readings. A huge part of these transactions were recorded in the past three days, with $6 billion movements coming on October 11 and $5.8 billion on October 10. Related Reading: Ethereum TD Setup: Why The ETH Price Must Hold $2,250 The uptick in whale activity appears to be closely linked to ongoing developments within the Cardano ecosystem. According to a recent report from InputOutput, Cardano has remained a major hub for blockchain developers, especially following the recent node upgrades to v.9.2.0 and the subsequent v.9.2.1. InputOutput’s data reveals that by the end of September, there were 1,376 active projects being built on Cardano, underscoring its popularity among blockchain innovators. Additionally, during September, the number of minted native tokens grew by 80,000, while the total number of transactions on the network surged by 1.34 million. ADA Price To Reach $0.5 Or Drop Again? ADA’s price action has been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks, and sentiment among investors has been more negative than usual, especially on social media. Cardano’s creator, Charles Hoskinson, addressed this sentiment on social media platform X. Hoskinson clarified that the negative outlook doesn’t reflect any failure on Cardano’s part, emphasizing that the project continues to grow. He also took the opportunity to criticize other crypto ecosystems, remarking that Cardano remains one of the few cryptocurrencies still committed to being a true decentralized currency, unlike those aligning with corporate giants like BlackRock and Wall Street. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash: $1.83 Billion Makes Its Way To Exchanges, Is A Bloodbath Coming? Despite the pessimism, the ADA price has managed to hold a key support level at $0.33, which offers some relief to bullish investors. Additionally, on-chain metrics such as net network growth and positive momentum in the futures market suggest a more optimistic outlook. The recent uptick in whale activity could signal the beginning of a more sustained rise for the ADA price. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.354. The first target is a significant break above $0.40 before a return to $0.50.

Related Reading: Helium (HNT) Falters 15% As Crypto Market Tries To Bounce Back XRP Eyes $60 With SWIFT’s Volume Boost In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Levi Rietveld proposed a unique scenario where XRP’s price could potentially surge to $60, marking a staggering increase of approximately 11,220% from its current value of $0.53. Firstly, Rietveld referred to a 2017 paper indicating SWIFT’s daily payment processes. According to the paper, SWIFT typically manages about $5 trillion in daily transactions, accumulating to $1.25 quadrillion every year. Based on current market changes and more adoption of the network, the analyst suggested that the figure will likely rise in 2024. He disclosed that SWIFT’s daily transactions have possibly increased to $7 trillion, equating to $1.8 quadrillion annually. The analyst also noted that SWIFT’s payment message volumes are usually about 11.5 million daily, with an average payment size of around $45,000. Moreover, he reveals that the current average payment size has increased to $60,000 per transaction, highlighting the staggering amount of fees it takes to execute just one transaction. Taking these figures into consideration, Rietveld has hypothesized that if XRP can acquire just 10% of SWIFT’s overall market share, the cryptocurrency could see an “astronomical” increase in its price. Starting on a more conservative estimate, the analyst revealed that with a 5% market share which is about $239.4 billion in daily volume, XRP could see a 1,252.5X increase. This is equivalent to a 9,080.6% surge in XRP, pushing its value to new all time highs at $26.62. Rietveld further estimated that with a 10% market share, XRP’s price could rise to $52, and even surpass $200 with 20% of SWIFT’s volume. The analyst has called on crypto investors to begin accumulating XRP, stressing that his ambitious projections for the cryptocurrency are not far-fetched, given its advantages over SWIFT in terms of cost, speed, and reliability. Institutional Adoption To Drive XRP Price Even Higher While hypothesizing the extent of XRP’s price surge with a small percentage of SWIFT’s volume, Rietveld also disclosed that the cryptocurrency could see a massive price increase as adoption from institutional investors skyrockets. The analyst disclosed that the XRP market may undergo a significant supply shock when institutional investors begin accumulating the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Baby Doge Coin Rockets 200% In 30 Days – What’s On The Horizon? He revealed that over time, institutional investors will eventually need to buy XRP from the public supply, as the tokens locked in escrow would not be sufficient to meet demand. Considering XRP’s already limited supply, Rietveld has projected that the potential supply shock would trigger a massive price rally to about $200 in the next 10 years.

SUI’s fundamentals also paint a bullish picture for the crypto and indicate that it could be one of the best performers in this market cycle. Related Reading: Baby Doge Coin Rockets 200% In 30 Days – What’s On The Horizon? SUI Eyes Breakout With Traders Going Long SUI could be on the verge of a breakout, with traders betting that the crypto will rise higher. Coinglass data shows that the long/short ratio is currently at 1.3, with 56.65% of traders opening long positions on SUI compared to 43.35% of traders with short positions. Trading volume for SUI’s derivatives has surged by over 33%, indicating that these traders are very confident about the crypto rising higher. Meanwhile, open interest is also up by over 14%, further confirming the massive attention that SUI is currently gaining. These long traders already look to have the upper hand, seeing how the short terms have witnessed more liquidations. Further data from Coinglass shows that $5.14 million in short positions have been liquidated in the last 24 hours compared to $1.58 million in long positions. This is bullish for the SUI price as the breakout could easily be achieved as more short traders get shaken out of their positions. Moreover, the coin has been rallying for a while, and its fundamentals and technical analysis suggest that this upward trend could continue. SUI has already rallied over 100% in the last month, breaking into the top 20 crypto ranking in the process. Fundamentals that support a further price rally for the coin include the surging decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on the Sui network. DeFiLlama data shows that decentralized exchange (DEX) volume on the network has shot up over 50% this last week. The network’s Total Value Locked (TVL) is also rising, as it recently crossed the $1 billion mark. A Price Breakout To $2.50 Crypto expert Michael Van De Poppe predicted that the SUI price could rise to as high as $2.50 soon enough. He noted that the coin achieved a strong bounce at the $1.79 price level. In line with this, he expects the price to continue towards new highs, potentially reaching between $2.20 and $2.50. A rally to this price range is significant as it will mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the SUI price, whose current ATH is $2.18. Meanwhile, crypto analyst The Cryptomist indicated that the coin’s weekly close is likely to determine its next move. She claimed a break above $1.91 would lead to price discovery.

However, these tokens came from weaker hands that sold at a loss. 1.5M BTC has been accumulated by whales (with >1K BTC on balance) over the last 6 months.

While prices remained in that range, whales continued to accumulate, and now hold around 1.9 million BTC, indicating strong short-term confidence among high-net-worth investors. Netflow Metrics Of Large Holders Recent data shows that accumulation sprees haven’t cooled off, despite recent price corrections. For example, yesterday, BTC fell below $59K for the first time this month, leading to massive liquidations. Don’t believe that whales accumulated 1.5M BTC and wonder where they got it from? How about taking a look at the loss-making sales on exchanges?

Two days ago, this figure was even higher, with an influx of 2,480 BTC. Furthermore, CryptoQuant statistics indicate that Bitcoin’s exchange reserve has fallen from 2.576 million tokens at the start of October to 2.571 million tokens, reflecting ongoing accumulation.

It simply means that despite the relentless selling pressures, they are somewhat weak. As it currently stands at -40.74, Williams %R is on the neutral side. From this, Bitcoin might get stuck in this range until strong buying or selling pressure will come up. Experienced analyst Peter Brandt holds that Bitcoins will reach an all-time high of $150,000 for this cycle but warns that inability to break out of the current range will cause the price to shatter and will go way down, 75% at worst.
