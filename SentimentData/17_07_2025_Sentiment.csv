On July 15, crypto exchange Bitget executed a massive burn of 30 million BGB tokens, an event that sent ripples of optimism through the market. This substantial token destruction, valued at approximately $130 million, was reported by LookOnChain via X, highlighting Bitget’s ongoing commitment to its native token. What Does the Bitget BGB Burn Mean for Investors? The news of the 30 million Bitget BGB burn on July 15 is more than just a headline; it’s a clear signal of strategic intent from one of the leading global crypto exchanges. For investors, a token burn fundamentally aims to reduce the total supply of a cryptocurrency, thereby increasing its scarcity. In theory, reduced supply, coupled with consistent or increasing demand, can lead to an appreciation in the token’s value. The BGB token, currently trading at $4.67 and showing a healthy 3.8% increase over 24 hours post-announcement, certainly reflects this positive market sentiment. This isn’t an isolated incident for Bitget. Over the past eight months, the exchange has systematically burned an astounding 860 million BGB tokens. This consistent, long-term strategy underscores Bitget’s dedication to creating a deflationary mechanism for BGB, potentially benefiting long-term holders. Such actions are often interpreted by the market as a strong vote of confidence from the exchange itself in its token’s future. Why do exchanges burn tokens? Deflationary Pressure: Reducing supply can make the remaining tokens more valuable. Value Appreciation: Scarcity can drive up demand and price. Commitment & Trust: Demonstrates the exchange’s dedication to the token’s ecosystem and its community. Profit Sharing: Often, a portion of exchange profits is used to buy back and burn tokens, aligning the exchange’s success with token holders. Understanding the BGB Token’s Role in the Bitget Ecosystem The BGB token is not merely a digital asset; it is the utility token powering the entire Bitget ecosystem. Launched to enhance the user experience and provide significant benefits within the exchange, BGB plays a pivotal role in Bitget’s growth strategy. Holders of BGB gain access to a multitude of perks, making it an attractive asset for active traders and long-term investors on the platform. Let’s delve into some of the core utilities that make the BGB token indispensable within Bitget: Utility Feature Description Benefit to Holder Trading Fee Discounts Use BGB to pay for spot and futures trading fees. Significant cost savings on transactions. Launchpad Access Participate in exclusive token sales on Bitget Launchpad. Early access to promising new projects. Launchpool & Earn Stake BGB to earn new tokens or high APY on existing assets. Passive income generation and asset growth. Voting Rights Participate in community governance for new listings and proposals. Influence over the platform’s future direction. Futures Copy Trading Benefits Access exclusive features and higher profit sharing ratios for traders. Enhanced profitability and unique trading tools. Withdrawal Fee Discounts Enjoy reduced fees when withdrawing assets from the platform. Lower operational costs. These utilities create a strong demand for BGB, as users seek to maximize their benefits on the Bitget platform. The token burn mechanism further strengthens this demand by reducing supply, creating a virtuous cycle that supports the token’s value proposition. Exploring the Crypto Exchange Bitget’s Growth and Strategy Bitget has rapidly ascended the ranks to become a formidable player in the global cryptocurrency landscape. As a comprehensive crypto exchange Bitget offers a wide array of services, including spot trading, futures trading, copy trading, and an innovative launchpad. Its commitment to user-centric features, robust security measures, and continuous innovation has attracted millions of users worldwide. The exchange’s strategic approach is multifaceted, focusing on expanding its product offerings, enhancing liquidity, and fostering a vibrant community. The consistent token burn strategy for BGB is a testament to this long-term vision. It’s not just about reducing supply; it’s about signaling confidence in the platform’s future earnings and its ability to sustain such deflationary measures. This approach is similar to traditional stock buybacks, where companies repurchase their shares to reduce outstanding stock and boost shareholder value. Bitget’s proactive stance in the market, including its aggressive marketing campaigns and partnerships, further solidifies its position. The token burns are an integral part of this broader strategy, aiming to create a sustainable and attractive investment for its users and the wider crypto community. The Impact of Strategic Token Burn on Value and Trust The concept of a token burn is a powerful tool in the crypto economy, designed to create scarcity and, by extension, enhance value. When an exchange like Bitget removes a significant amount of its native tokens from circulation, it directly impacts the supply-demand dynamics. With fewer tokens available, each remaining token theoretically becomes more valuable, assuming demand remains constant or increases. Beyond the direct economic impact, token burns also play a crucial psychological role. They demonstrate a strong commitment from the project team to the long-term health and prosperity of their token. This builds trust among investors, assuring them that the team is not simply focused on short-term gains but is invested in creating sustainable value. For Bitget, the repeated and substantial BGB burns, totaling 860 million over eight months, are a clear indication of their dedication to the BGB token’s future. Challenges and Considerations: Market Volatility: While burns can boost value, the broader crypto market remains volatile, and external factors can still influence price. Sustainable Burn Mechanisms: The long-term impact depends on the sustainability of the burn mechanism, often linked to exchange profitability. Transparency: Transparent reporting of burns (like LookOnChain’s report) is crucial for maintaining investor confidence. Ultimately, a strategic token burn is a statement of intent, a powerful mechanism that, when executed consistently and transparently, can significantly contribute to a token’s perceived and actual value. Navigating the Bitget Ecosystem: Future Prospects and Actionable Insights The continuous development and strategic moves within the Bitget ecosystem paint a promising picture for the future of the BGB token. Bitget is not resting on its laurels; it consistently introduces new features, expands its global reach, and invests in technological advancements to enhance its platform. These efforts, combined with the robust token burn strategy, position BGB for potential long-term growth. For individuals looking to engage with the Bitget platform or invest in BGB, here are some actionable insights: Research Thoroughly: Understand the BGB token’s utilities and Bitget’s roadmap. Knowledge is power in the crypto space. Consider BGB’s Utilities: If you’re an active trader on Bitget, holding BGB can significantly reduce your costs and unlock exclusive features. Monitor Burn Events: Keep an eye on future token burn announcements as they can often precede positive price movements. Diversify Your Portfolio: While BGB shows promise, always maintain a diversified investment portfolio to mitigate risks. Stay Informed: Follow official Bitget channels and reputable crypto news sources for the latest updates on the exchange and the BGB token. The future of BGB is intrinsically linked to the success and expansion of the Bitget exchange. As Bitget continues to innovate and attract more users, the demand for BGB and its utility will likely grow, potentially reinforcing the positive impact of its token burn strategy. Conclusion: Bitget’s Bold Commitment to BGB Value The recent 30 million BGB token burn on July 15, following a pattern of 860 million BGB burned over the past eight months, clearly demonstrates Bitget’s unwavering commitment to enhancing the value and utility of its native token. This strategic token burn is a powerful signal to the market, showcasing the exchange’s dedication to creating a deflationary asset and fostering long-term trust within its community. As the BGB token continues to serve as the backbone of the thriving Bitget ecosystem, providing a wide array of benefits to its holders, its future looks increasingly bright. Investors and users alike will undoubtedly be watching closely as Bitget continues to execute its vision for a robust and valuable digital asset.

Recently, a significant development emerged from Washington D.C. that has caught the attention of investors, innovators, and enthusiasts alike: House Republicans crypto initiative has taken a crucial step forward. This procedural vote signals a potential turning point for US crypto regulation , paving the way for more structured governance in the digital asset space. Let’s dive into what this means for the future of finance and technology. A Pivotal Moment for US Crypto Regulation: What Just Happened? In a move that has sent ripples through the digital asset community, U.S. House Republicans successfully passed a procedural motion. This isn’t just a minor bureaucratic hurdle; it’s a critical legislative maneuver that allows two specific crypto bills to advance further through the complex congressional process. As reported by Infinity Hedge via Telegram, this action indicates a growing momentum within the legislative branch to address the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. You might be wondering, what exactly is a ‘procedural motion’? In simple terms, it’s a vote that dictates the rules for how a bill will be debated and voted on in the future. It’s like setting the agenda for a crucial meeting. For the cryptocurrency industry, this means: Faster Pace: The bills can now move more quickly through committee and potentially to a full House vote. Increased Focus: It brings specific legislative proposals regarding digital assets into sharper focus for lawmakers and the public. Bipartisan Potential: While initiated by Republicans, advancing bills often requires some level of bipartisan engagement to ultimately become law. This development is a clear indicator that lawmakers are increasingly recognizing the importance of establishing a robust framework for US crypto regulation , moving beyond mere discussions to tangible legislative action. What Does Advancing Digital Asset Legislation Really Mean for the Market? The advancement of these bills represents a significant stride in the ongoing effort to define and regulate the cryptocurrency landscape. When we talk about digital asset legislation , we’re discussing laws that could impact everything from how cryptocurrencies are classified (e.g., as securities or commodities) to how stablecoins are issued and regulated, and even consumer protection measures for crypto investors. The absence of clear rules has long been cited as a major barrier to mainstream adoption and institutional investment in the U.S. This procedural step, while not a final vote on the bills themselves, signifies that Congress is serious about providing that much-needed clarity. It could lead to: Aspect Potential Impact of Legislation Investor Confidence Increased protection and reduced risk perception, potentially attracting more traditional investors. Innovation & Growth Clear rules could foster a more predictable environment for blockchain startups and existing crypto businesses. Market Stability Specific rules for stablecoins and other assets could reduce volatility and systemic risk. Global Competitiveness Positions the U.S. as a leader in the digital economy, rather than falling behind other nations with clearer frameworks. The specifics of the two bills are crucial, but the general direction suggests an attempt to create a more defined and potentially more secure environment for digital assets within the existing financial system. Decoding the Path Ahead for Crypto Bills: What are the Hurdles? While the advancement of these crypto bills is a positive sign, it’s important to remember that the legislative journey is long and complex. A procedural motion is just one step in a multi-stage process. The next significant hurdles include: Committee Review: The bills will undergo detailed scrutiny and potential amendments in relevant House committees. Full House Vote: If they pass committee, they will then be put to a vote by the entire House of Representatives. Success here is not guaranteed, as bipartisan support will be critical. Senate Consideration: Even if passed by the House, the bills must then go through a similar process in the Senate, where they may face different priorities and amendments. Presidential Assent: Finally, for any bill to become law, it must be signed by the President. Each of these stages presents opportunities for the bills to be altered, delayed, or even rejected. The political climate, differing views between parties, and lobbying efforts from various stakeholders will all play a role in shaping their ultimate fate. This is where the intricacies of US crypto regulation truly come into play, as various agencies and lawmakers weigh in on how best to approach this innovative, yet often disruptive, technology. The Impact on Blockchain Policy and Innovation: A Double-Edged Sword? The move by House Republicans crypto supporters to advance these bills has profound implications for broader blockchain policy and the future of technological innovation in the U.S. On one hand, clear regulatory frameworks can provide the certainty that businesses need to invest heavily in blockchain technology, knowing the rules of the game. This can spur innovation, attract talent, and lead to the development of new applications beyond just cryptocurrencies, such as supply chain management, digital identity, and more efficient financial services. However, there’s also a delicate balance to strike. Overly restrictive or poorly designed legislation could stifle innovation, pushing companies and talent to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions. The challenge for lawmakers is to craft legislation that protects consumers and ensures financial stability without stifling the very innovation that makes blockchain technology so promising. Key considerations for the future of blockchain policy include: Regulatory Clarity: Defining what constitutes a security, commodity, or currency in the digital realm. Consumer Protection: Safeguarding investors from fraud and market manipulation. Financial Stability: Addressing potential systemic risks posed by large-scale digital asset adoption, particularly stablecoins. Taxation: Clarifying how digital assets are taxed. Interoperability: Ensuring that U.S. regulations can work effectively with international standards. The outcome of these legislative efforts will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of blockchain development in the United States for years to come. House Republicans Crypto Initiative: A Step Towards Clarity? The recent procedural vote underscores the increasing bipartisan, though primarily Republican-led, push for clear crypto legislation. Many House Republicans crypto advocates argue that the current regulatory landscape is fragmented and uncertain, hindering America’s competitiveness in the global digital economy. They believe that providing a clear legal framework will not only protect investors but also encourage innovation and prevent businesses from moving offshore. While the specific content of the bills is still under review and subject to change, the overarching goal appears to be to establish a more coherent regulatory environment. This includes efforts to clarify the roles of various regulatory bodies, such as the SEC and CFTC, in overseeing different types of digital assets. For the industry, this could mean an end to the ‘regulation by enforcement’ approach that has often characterized U.S. oversight of crypto. What This Means for You: Actionable Insights For anyone involved in or interested in the crypto space, this legislative advancement has several implications: Stay Informed: Follow the progress of these bills closely. Understanding the nuances of emerging digital asset legislation will be crucial for making informed decisions. Engage & Advocate: If you’re part of the crypto industry, consider engaging with industry associations and advocacy groups that are working to shape these policies. Your voice can make a difference. Prepare for Change: Businesses operating in the crypto space should begin to assess how potential new regulations might impact their operations, compliance requirements, and business models. Evaluate Your Portfolio: Investors should consider how regulatory clarity (or continued uncertainty) might affect the long-term prospects of various digital assets. The Unfolding Saga of US Crypto Regulation The recent procedural motion by U.S. House Republicans marks a significant, albeit early, step in the journey towards comprehensive US crypto regulation . The advancement of these crypto bills reflects a growing recognition within Congress of the need for clear rules governing digital assets. While the path ahead is fraught with legislative hurdles and political debates, this development offers a hopeful sign for those seeking clarity and stability in the rapidly evolving world of blockchain and cryptocurrency. The coming months will be critical in determining whether these efforts lead to a transformative era of innovation and investor protection, or if the challenges prove too great to overcome. The digital asset community will be watching closely.

How Much Is In The Country’s Bitcoin Reserve Really? The saga began when Bitcoin Magazine Chairman David Bailey offered a $10,000 bounty to the journalist who could uncover the exact amount of Bitcoin currently held by the U.S. government in a July 16 X post.

Bullish.” Senator Cynthia Lummis Speaks Out Amid Crypto Concerns U.S. President Donald Trump formally launched the country’s Bitcoin Reserve and U.S. Digital Assets Stockpile back in a March 2025 executive order . “This move harnesses the power of digital assets for national prosperity, rather than letting them languish in limbo,” the executive order states. Just a few minutes ago, President Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it… — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 7, 2025 At the time, White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks estimated that the U.S. government held around 200,000 Bitcoin, although no formal audit on the cryptocurrency had been completed. Following the news, crypto-friendly Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) openly expressed her shock over the claims. “I’m alarmed by reports that the U.S. has sold off over 80% of its Bitcoin reserves—leaving just ~29,000 coins,” Lummis wrote. “If true, this is a total strategic blunder and sets the United States back years in the Bitcoin race.” The White House has yet to publicly comment on the matter.

Imagine waking up to news that a major player has offloaded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of a leading digital asset. This isn’t just a hypothetical scenario; it’s precisely what transpired, leading to considerable discussion and analysis among investors and market watchers alike. This substantial Trend Research ETH sale has undeniably captured the attention of the entire crypto community, prompting questions about its implications for market stability and future price action. Decoding the Massive Ethereum (ETH) Offload: What Exactly Happened? In a move that underscores the dynamic nature of the crypto market , Trend Research executed a series of large-scale transactions involving Ethereum (ETH). According to on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, which reported the activity on X (formerly Twitter), the firm divested a staggering 69,946 ETH over the past 24 hours. This massive sell-off translated to approximately $218.3 million at the time of the transactions. The sale wasn’t a single event but included a notable recent transaction of 21,000 ETH, valued at roughly $67 million. Such large-volume movements by a single entity are often referred to as “whale activity” due to their potential to influence market dynamics. Despite this significant divestment, Trend Research still retains a substantial portion of its digital assets , holding onto 115,187 ETH, which is currently valued at an impressive $376.35 million. This indicates that while they’ve taken considerable profits or rebalanced their portfolio, they remain a significant holder of Ethereum. To put these figures into perspective, let’s look at the breakdown: Transaction Detail Ethereum (ETH) Amount USD Value (Approx.) Total ETH Sold (Past 24 hours) 69,946 ETH $218.3 Million Recent Single Sale 21,000 ETH $67 Million Remaining ETH Holdings 115,187 ETH $376.35 Million Why Did a Crypto Whale Like Trend Research Make This Move? The motivations behind such a significant sale by a major entity like Trend Research are often multi-faceted and can range from strategic portfolio rebalancing to a shift in market outlook. While the exact reasons remain speculative without direct confirmation from the firm, several possibilities come to mind when observing such a substantial crypto whale move: Profit Taking: Ethereum has seen significant price appreciation over various periods. Selling a portion of holdings could simply be a classic profit-taking strategy, cashing in on gains to secure returns for investors or internal operations. Portfolio Rebalancing: Large firms often manage diverse portfolios. A sale of ETH might indicate a reallocation of capital into other digital assets, traditional investments, or even into operational liquidity for new ventures. Market Outlook: While not necessarily a bearish signal, a large sale could suggest a cautious short-to-medium term outlook on Ethereum’s price trajectory. It might be a hedge against potential volatility or a belief that other assets offer better immediate growth prospects. Operational Needs: Like any large entity, Trend Research might have significant operational expenses, investment commitments, or upcoming projects that require substantial capital, for which liquidating a portion of their digital assets would be a practical solution. Understanding these potential drivers is crucial for interpreting the broader implications of such sales on market sentiment . What is the Impact on Ethereum (ETH) and Broader Market Sentiment? The immediate effect of a large sale like this is often a ripple of concern or speculation throughout the market. When a major holder sells, it increases the supply on exchanges, which can put downward pressure on prices in the short term. However, the market’s reaction also depends on overall liquidity and demand. If there are enough buyers to absorb the sell pressure, the impact might be minimal or quickly absorbed. Key impacts include: Price Volatility: Large sales can trigger short-term price dips, especially if the market is already sensitive or lacking strong buying interest. Traders might react by selling, exacerbating the downward trend. Investor Confidence: Such moves can sometimes dent investor confidence, leading to questions about the asset’s future performance or whether other large holders might follow suit. This directly influences market sentiment . Liquidity Test: These large sales act as a test of the market’s liquidity. The fact that $218 million worth of ETH was sold indicates the deep liquidity of the Ethereum market, which is a positive sign for its maturity. Focus on On-Chain Data: Events like the Trend Research ETH sale highlight the increasing importance of on-chain analytics. Platforms like Lookonchain provide transparency into whale movements, allowing investors to make more informed decisions. Despite the sale, the fact that Trend Research still holds over $376 million in ETH suggests a long-term conviction in the asset, even if they are actively managing their exposure. This remaining significant holding can somewhat mitigate the negative perception of the sale. Navigating the Waters: Actionable Insights for Your Digital Asset Strategy For individual investors and those interested in the crypto market , understanding these large institutional movements offers valuable insights. While it’s tempting to panic or mimic whale actions, a more nuanced approach is often beneficial. Here are some actionable insights: Don’t Blindly Follow: Large entities have different risk appetites, investment horizons, and financial obligations than individual investors. Their reasons for selling might not align with your personal financial goals. Monitor On-Chain Data, But Interpret Wisely: Tools that track crypto whale activity are valuable for understanding market flows. However, always combine this data with fundamental analysis of the asset (e.g., Ethereum’s network upgrades, adoption, dApp ecosystem) and broader macroeconomic factors. Focus on Long-Term Fundamentals: For assets like Ethereum (ETH) , sustained growth often comes from technological advancements, network utility, and increasing adoption. Short-term whale movements, while impactful, might not derail a strong long-term thesis. Manage Risk: Ensure your portfolio is diversified and that you’re not overexposed to any single asset. Use stop-loss orders or take profits incrementally to protect your capital from sudden market shifts. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of news, analysis, and on-chain metrics. Knowledge is your best defense against impulsive decisions driven by market FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) or FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). This event serves as a powerful reminder that the digital asset management landscape is constantly evolving, requiring vigilance and strategic thinking from all participants. The Future of Trend Research’s Digital Assets: What Comes Next? With a remaining holding of over $376 million in Ethereum (ETH), Trend Research clearly maintains a substantial stake in the asset. This suggests that their recent sale might be more of a strategic maneuver rather than a complete exit from their digital assets position. Future movements from this entity will continue to be closely watched by the market. Possible scenarios include: Further Sales: Depending on market conditions and their internal strategies, they might continue to gradually reduce their ETH holdings. Re-Accumulation: Conversely, if they believe the market has bottomed or a new bullish trend is emerging, they might start re-accumulating ETH at lower prices. Long-Term Hold: Their remaining large sum could simply be a long-term strategic investment, with no immediate plans for further significant sales. The actions of such a significant crypto whale like Trend Research offer a fascinating case study in institutional behavior within the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Their decisions, while individual, contribute to the collective narrative and dynamics of the crypto market . Conclusion: The Enduring Significance of Whale Movements in the Crypto Market The recent Trend Research ETH sale of over $218 million serves as a powerful illustration of the immense capital flows that characterize the modern digital asset management landscape. While the sheer volume of Ethereum (ETH) involved is noteworthy, it’s the ripple effect on market sentiment and the broader implications for the crypto market that truly capture attention.

As the original crypto continues to chart a course to new price highs, demand for projects across the entire market concurrently increases. That’s why leading altcoins and the best meme coins —including TRON, Sui Network, Solana, Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin—have also recorded new peaks in recent months, bolstering the belief that both market segments retain strong upside potential. With optimism building ahead of the next anticipated bull cycle, investors are focusing on select altcoins that could surpass their historical price ceilings. Ripple (XRP): Leading Cross-Border Payments Crypto Shows Massive Price Potential Ripple’s XRP token continues to cement its role as a bridge between conventional banking systems and blockchain-powered remittance solutions. Thanks to its near-instant global transfers at extremely low fees, XRP has attracted strong institutional attention, even earning recognition from the United Nations as a viable platform for sending funds worldwide without third-party intermediaries. After a prolonged legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple scored a decisive court victory in 2023, with the judge ruling that retail sales of XRP were not securities transactions. The SEC formally ended the case in 2025, concluding a lengthy four-year dispute. This legal resolution reinforced XRP’s position within the industry, establishing an important regulatory precedent for the broader altcoin space. As a result, investor confidence soared, pushing XRP’s price up by an impressive 439% in one year, far exceeding Bitcoin’s 87% gains during the same period. Currently encountering resistance around the $3 mark, XRP is poised to potentially break through, solidifying its reputation as one of the most resilient billion-dollar market cap altcoins. However, should markets take an adverse turn, or a sell-off ensue, XRP could lose some of its recent gains, but it will likely find strong support at $2, enabling an easy rebound once the market flips bullish. Earlier this year, technical charts revealed a bullish flag pattern, indicating a possible surge towards $3.50 this summer, surpassing its prior all-time high of $3.40 recorded in January 2018. Solana ($SOL): Can This “Ethereum Killer” Set a New Record Before Fall? Solana ($SOL) has firmly established itself in decentralised finance, delivering lightning-fast transaction speeds, minimal fees, and powerful smart contract capabilities. Its market capitalisation has surpassed $89.5 billion, while the chain itself has over $9.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama. Speculation is mounting over potential approval of a spot ETF for Solana, akin to the green light recently granted to Bitcoin and Ethereum, which could attract substantial institutional inflows and solidify Solana’s status as a legitimate Ethereum competitor. Adding to its momentum, former U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of integrating Solana into a proposed U.S. Crypto Reserve, suggesting the government could hold confiscated Solana coins seized in law enforcement actions. Price-wise, Solana rebounded from an April low of $100 after peaking at $250 in February and is now trading around $153. With its RSI climbing from 63, further gains may be on the horizon as the bullish momentum remains. While geopolitical risks have constrained its short-term growth, this period of consolidation is reinforcing $SOL’s market foundation. Resistance levels are set at $200 and $250, but a decisive breakout could drive Solana past its all-time high of $293.31, potentially reaching around $300 by fall. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme Coin Powerhouse Eyes New Peaks Pepe ($PEPE) has rapidly ascended the meme coin ranks in its two years of existence, establishing itself among the top three thanks to strong cultural relevance and market performance. Based on Matt Furie’s legendary frog character, $PEPE has yielded extraordinary returns for early backers and now boasts a market cap above $5.4 billion. Launched in April 2023, Pepe spurred the emergence of numerous imitator tokens, though none have replicated its traction. Its popularity surged even further when Elon Musk briefly switched his X (formerly Twitter) profile picture to a Pepe-themed image. Currently valued near $0.00001286, $PEPE has climbed 7.4% in the last 24 hours and 26% over the past week, although it remains around 54% below its peak of $0.00002803 set in late 2024. In Q1 this year, a falling wedge pattern forms across Pepe’s lines of support and resistance—a formation typically signalling an impending upward breakout. With its RSI now at 68, bullish momentum remains strong, though it is approaching 70, where assets tend to become overbought, usually pre-empting selloffs. If macroeconomic and geopolitical stability persists, Pepe could embark on another major rally before the close of summer. Snorter ($SNORT): Low-Price Entry to a Promising New Crypto Spotting emerging crypto projects before mainstream adoption often yields the highest returns. While established altcoins continue to dominate, upcoming tokens are unlocking novel opportunities for growth. One such contender is Snorter ($SNORT) , a hybrid meme token and advanced trading bot built on Solana, with cross-chain expansion planned for the future. Integrated directly into Telegram, Snorter delivers live market analytics within chat groups. Charging fees as low as 0.85%, Snorter offers a competitive edge over rivals like BonkBot, Maestro, and Trojan. Its comprehensive toolkit features MEV-protected swaps, copy trading capabilities, rug pull prevention, and limit order sniping, positioning it as a full-suite trading platform. Investor enthusiasm has surged, with the presale raising more than $1.9 million to date. Its staking programme offers up to 203% APY, rewarding early supporters generously. Investors can buy it now via the official website at the fixed low price of $0.0983, although this rises fractionally throughout the course of the presale, with the next leg expected in under 24 hours. Whether you’re an experienced trader or exploring meme coins for the first time, Snorter seeks to provide a seamless platform to navigate today’s fast-paced crypto landscape.

On Monday, Bitcoin set a new record, reaching $122,838 and marking its highest price ever. Analysts note further upward movement could follow if this momentum sustains, potentially ushering in widespread global adoption. This powerful rally has sparked intense optimism among crypto investors, with speculation rising that an even stronger bull market than the famed 2021 run could be forming, pushing numerous major altcoins to uncharted valuation levels. Outlined below are cryptocurrencies that ChatGPT predicts will have significant near-term growth prospects. XRP (Ripple): ChatGPT Predicts This Cross-Border Payment Giant Could Easily Double ChatGPT’s analysis indicates that Ripple’s XRP could hit $20 by late 2025, reflecting a near sevenfold surge from its current price of around $2.96. This bullish forecast stems from increasing institutional integration, clearer regulatory frameworks, and speculation around a potential XRP spot ETF, which could unlock large-scale retail and institutional investments. Furthermore, XRP maintains strong recognition as a fast, affordable, and compliant option for global payments. In 2024, the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) praised XRP for enabling instant cross-border transfers without traditional intermediaries. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! UN Endorses @Ripple and @StellarOrg as Cornerstones of New Global Payments Network! #XRP and #XLM will run the new financial system! pic.twitter.com/ufewexCKmR — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 13, 2024 A landmark ruling in 2023 determined that XRP’s retail sales did not qualify as securities transactions, weakening the SEC’s long-held stance on XRP and the wider crypto industry beyond Bitcoin that they were trading as unlicensed securities. In March, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the official conclusion of the prolonged legal dispute, removing a major barrier and lifting investor sentiment for XRP and the broader altcoin market. Looking forward, XRP faces key resistance at $3. Should it convincingly surpass this threshold, ChatGPT’s more conservative target of $10 by year-end appears attainable. However, a catalyst is needed to achieve the ambitious $20 milestone. This will depend on regulatory progress in the U.S., where the industry have long asked lawmakers for clarity. The perception of Trump prior to his reassuming the presidency was that he’s the “crypto president” but he has yet to deliver on essential substance. Additionally, political stability across regions like the Middle East is spooking investors. XRP has been among the top-performing major cryptocurrencies, rising 429% in the past year, compared to Bitcoin’s 87% increase. Dogecoin ($DOGE): The Original Meme Coin Set for a Strong Rebound Dogecoin ($DOGE) , the original meme token, continues to maintain a solid market cap of roughly $30.2 billion. Initially created in 2013 as a parody, it has evolved into a legitimate digital asset with wide usage and a loyal international community. Frequently mirroring Bitcoin’s movements, Dogecoin combines meme-driven volatility with notable staying power. At present, DOGE is trading near $0.201 after rising 3% on the day and 16% on the week. Its RSI stands at 65 and is trending upwards, indicating growing buying interest as Bitcoin’s rally continues. Technical indicators show a pronounced falling wedge pattern from November to April, indicating strong potential for an imminent upward breakout. ChatGPT predicts DOGE could reach $1.50 during an extended bullish phase, equating to a potential 7.5X gain. On the adoption front, Dogecoin continues to receive endorsements from major corporations and celebrities alike. Tesla accepts DOGE for select merchandise, while platforms like Revolut and PayPal have integrated it as a payment method, enhancing its mainstream utility. Shiba Inu (SHIB): ChatGPT AI Predicts 7x Gains by Year-End Shiba Inu (SHIB) , launched in August 2020, has emerged as the second biggest meme coin and a serious high-utility contender to Dogecoin with a market value exceeding $8.1 billion. Currently priced at $0.00001384, SHIB has risen 4.3% over the last 24 hours and 14.1% in the past week. It is now approaching a breakout from two significant technical patterns: a descending wedge between November and March, and a bullish flag identified in mid-May. The next key resistance lies at $0.000022, with potential to climb towards $0.00003. Should this momentum persist, OpenAI’s ChatGP forecasts SHIB could hit $0.0001 before year-end – representing a more than sevenfold rise from current prices. This outlook is supported by SHIB’s evolution into a utility-focused ecosystem. Built on Ethereum, SHIB has improved scalability with its Layer-2 network, Shibarium, enabling quicker transactions, lower fees, expanded dApp integration, and enhanced privacy features. TOKEN6900: Could This New Meme Coin Deliver 1000x Returns? While ChatGPT predicts some dazzling returns on well-established altcoins this year, the vast market caps of the projects above often limit their explosive growth potential. For traders pursuing dramatic returns, lesser-known meme coins may offer sharper upside. One such project is TOKEN6900 (T6900) , an ERC-20 meme token that launched its presale just a week ago. Hey Siri, define aura pic.twitter.com/NVYT1pZmed — Token6900 (@Token_6900) July 8, 2025 So far, TOKEN6900 has raised over $585,215 from early backers, signalling strong investor enthusiasm and prospects for a powerful launch rally. Unlike many meme coins that attempt to pivot towards utility, TOKEN6900 embraces its identity as a purely hype-driven asset, leveraging irony, aggressive marketing, and FOMO to fuel growth. Its website boldly proclaims: “It’s Not Built On Fundamentals. It’s Built On Delusion, Irony, And The Collective Hallucination Of Terminally Online Traders.” Inspired by SPX6900, a meme token celebrating absurdist dot-com aesthetics, TOKEN6900 has a total supply of 930,993,091 tokens – exactly one more than SPX6900’s, emphasising its competitive branding approach. This strategy appears effective, as shown by its presale performance. Although it lacks inherent utility, TOKEN6900 offers staking options for additional yield alongside speculative price gains. Interested buyers can purchase T6900 on its official website at a current presale price of $0.0066. With the next price increase scheduled within 48 hours, those seeking the lowest entry point may wish to act quickly.

Per the state-run news agency TASS , the Duma has adopted a law on the “gradual introduction” of the digital ruble, beginning next year. Digital Ruble Bill Passes Duma Lawmakers voted in favor of the bill in its second and third readings. The bill will now pass to the Russian upper house, the Federation Council, for approval. The State Duma building in Moscow, Russia. (Source: State Duma/Facebook) The bill will then pass on to President Vladimir Putin, who will officially sign the bill into law. These two steps are mere formalities, however, with the law slated to come into force on September 1, 2026. This is the Central Bank’s new date for a nationwide rollout, following its last-gasp decision to postpone its summer 2025 CBDC launch plans. The law was spearheaded by a group of lawmakers and senators. The group was headed by Anatoly Aksakov, the Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets. Aksakov is the chief architect of all of Russia’s crypto and CBDC legislation passed to date. The draft law effectively enshrines the Central Bank’s CBDC timeline for banks and other financial providers into law. From September 1, 2026, all firms with an annual revenue of 120 million rubles ($1.5 million) or above must provide their customers with access to digital ruble services. Medium-sized firms (those with revenues of up to 30 million rubles or $383,000) will have an extra year to comply. Smaller firms and financial industry startups, meanwhile, will have to comply by September 1, 2028. The rules will also apply to foreign banks and firms that have branches in Russia. Several Chinese banks and a handful of European and American banks continue to operate in Russia. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned that Brazil, China and India will face secondary sanctions from the US if Russia doesn’t negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine https://t.co/fhhSFOOlin — Bloomberg (@business) July 15, 2025 QR Code Clauses The bill also mandates the use of digital ruble QR codes in payments for goods and services. The law will allow individuals to pay companies or individual traders CBDC tokens for goods and services using app-based QR codes. Many vendors will also be obliged to allow their customers to pay in digital RUB if requested. This, too, will involve a gradual rollout. Bigger companies will be obliged to provide CBDC payment options from the outset. But some smaller firms will be allowed to opt out of the system altogether. The bill also addresses lingering questions about the feasibility of rolling out the digital ruble in parts of the country that have poor mobile network coverage and internet access. In many rural areas, coverage remains spotty. While China’s digital yuan pilot has seen the People’s Bank of China and its partners resolve such problems with hard or offline CBDC wallets , the Russian Central Bank is yet to reveal details of any such trial. As such, the bill dictates that vendors without internet access or mobile network coverage will not be obliged to accept digital ruble payments. Vendors with annual revenue under 5 million rubles ($63,900) per year will also be exempted. China said that there are no winners in a trade war after US President Trump threatened to hit buyers of Russian exports with sanctions unless Russia agrees to a peace deal in 50 days.

In its first stage, 600 citizens and 22 firms from 11 cities began using the CBDC. These companies ranged from major banks to small beauty salons . The Moscow Metro has also begun trialing CBDC payments. However, commercial banks have repeatedly questioned the need for a Russian CBDC. The latest challenge has come from German Gref, the head of the megabank Sberbank. German Gref, the head of Sberbank. (Source: Duma.gov.ru [CC BY 4.0]) Earlier this month, Gref said he could not see how the digital ruble could lead to a large-scale transformation of the Russian economy. CNews quoted Gref as saying: “I don’t understand why an individual needs the option to use a CBDC. And neither do banks. And businesses, too. I still don’t really understand why this is necessary.” However, Gref did suggest that there was a “possible future” for the digital ruble in cross-border settlements, provided overseas trading partners wanted to use it. The Central Bank claims that the CBDC will allow citizens and companies to make faster, more transparent, and more secure transactions. The Ministry of Finance, meanwhile, says it wants to use the CBDC to issue benefits and pay government contracts. It claims that this will help eliminate benefits fraud and corruption.

Following a recent price spike above the $3 mark, its first in five months, industry experts warn that many investors risk repeating costly errors from previous bull markets. The recent upswing in XRP’s price follows a series of bullish catalysts, including the launch of futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the resolution of Ripple’s legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and expanding institutional involvement in digital assets. Although XRP has pulled back slightly to around $2.95 , analysts believe the momentum could be far from over. In a recent episode of the Good Morning Crypto podcast, host Abdullah “Abs” Nassif emphasized that the market is only entering the early stages of its next growth cycle. He highlighted increasing support from traditional finance institutions and the expected rise in capital inflows through tokenized assets and stablecoins as significant indicators of what lies ahead. Long-Term Strategy: Avoid Premature Selling One recurring warning shared by podcast guests is the temptation to exit too soon. A featured crypto educator advised holders to avoid selling at the first sign of a price surge. Instead, he recommended that investors consider leveraging their assets or placing them in secure cold wallets and trusts. According to him, short-term selling often results in tokens returning to the control of institutional investors, those best positioned to hold long-term. He further noted that long-term holding can play a role in larger systemic shifts, encouraging individuals to act with foresight rather than react to temporary price movements. Co-host Johnny Crypto added weight to the discussion by recalling a personal experience from the late 1990s. Having sold his Amazon stock prematurely, he missed out on what would have been approximately $52 million in gains. This time, he said, he plans to retain a substantial portion of his XRP holdings regardless of future price activity. Rather than selling entirely, he is exploring financial strategies such as borrowing against the asset or placing it in a trust to maintain long-term exposure. The Case for XRP’s Continued Growth The panel pointed to several structural trends that could contribute to a substantial rise in XRP’s value over the medium to long term. One key factor is the anticipated approval of more than ten XRP-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by October 2025, which could increase accessibility and investor participation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, the stablecoin market is expected to expand significantly, from its current valuation of around $200 billion to approximately $3.7 trillion. Another critical projection comes from Citibank, which estimates that tokenized real-world assets will exceed $19 trillion in value by 2030. Collectively, these developments could channel large-scale capital inflows into the digital asset ecosystem, benefiting XRP’s market position. These trends suggest that over $23 trillion could eventually enter the digital asset space, potentially benefiting XRP and other top-tier cryptocurrencies. Legal Clarity May Spark Next Surge Further developments in the Ripple vs. SEC case may act as an additional growth trigger. Ripple has already announced its willingness to end ongoing appeals . With a confidential SEC meeting scheduled for July 17, some commentators believe an official settlement announcement is likely, which could increase investor confidence and drive another wave of market interest. According to Nassif, the next major technical breakout for XRP could occur once the token consistently closes above $3.25. He maintains that targets in the $10 range are plausible within the next bull cycle. His key message to investors is clear: avoid acting out of short-term excitement and instead position yourself for long-term advantage. The central advice from experts is to remain patient, avoid panic selling, and explore strategic ways to maintain exposure to XRP.

48376314,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=178900,1752708633,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/48376314.jpeg,El Salvador Bitcoin: Unleashing New Horizons in Digital Asset Policy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/el-salvador-bitcoin-talks/,"BitcoinWorld El Salvador Bitcoin: Unleashing New Horizons in Digital Asset Policy The world of digital assets is constantly evolving, with nations increasingly exploring the transformative potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. A recent, highly significant development has sent ripples through the global crypto community: a meeting between El Salvador’s visionary President, Nayib Bukele, and Pakistan’s State Minister for Blockchain and Crypto, Bilal Bin Saqib. This high-level dialogue signals a growing international interest in leveraging digital currencies for national development and hints at a future where El Salvador Bitcoin initiatives could inspire wider adoption. The Historic Meeting: What Does It Mean for Pakistan Crypto? The encounter, reported by Watcher Guru via X, brought together two key figures from nations with vastly different approaches to the digital asset space. President Bukele, globally recognized for making Bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador, met with Minister Saqib, who represents Pakistan’s efforts to explore blockchain and crypto within its economy. This meeting is more than a mere handshake; it represents a burgeoning interest from emerging economies in understanding and potentially adopting innovative financial technologies. For Pakistan Crypto enthusiasts and policymakers, this meeting offers a unique opportunity. Pakistan has historically maintained a cautious, often restrictive, stance on cryptocurrencies. While the State Bank of Pakistan has issued warnings against decentralized digital currencies, there have also been discussions within government circles about developing a national cryptocurrency or regulating the existing market. The presence of a dedicated State Minister for Blockchain and Crypto underscores a recognition of the technology’s potential, even amidst regulatory ambiguities. Key areas of potential discussion during such a high-profile meeting could include: Regulatory Frameworks: How El Salvador navigated the legal complexities of adopting Bitcoin as legal tender. Economic Integration: Strategies for integrating digital assets into the national economy, including remittances and financial inclusion. Technological Infrastructure: Building the necessary digital infrastructure to support widespread crypto use. Education and Awareness: Public campaigns to foster understanding and adoption of new financial tools. This dialogue could pave the way for Pakistan to learn from El Salvador’s pioneering, albeit challenging, experience, potentially influencing its future digital asset strategy. Nayib Bukele’s Vision: A Blueprint for National Crypto Strategy At the heart of this meeting is Nayib Bukele , a leader who has fundamentally reshaped El Salvador’s economic narrative by betting big on Bitcoin. In September 2021, El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, a move that garnered both praise and criticism globally. Bukele’s administration has since launched several initiatives aimed at integrating Bitcoin into daily life, including the Chivo Wallet, Bitcoin mining powered by geothermal energy (Volcano Energy), and the ambitious “Bitcoin City” project financed by “Volcano Bonds.” Bukele’s vision is rooted in several core beliefs: Financial Inclusion: Providing banking services to the unbanked population through Bitcoin. Remittance Cost Reduction: Significantly cutting down fees on remittances, a vital source of income for many Salvadoran families. Economic Sovereignty: Reducing reliance on traditional financial institutions and the U.S. dollar. Attracting Investment and Tourism: Positioning El Salvador as a hub for crypto innovation and attracting foreign capital. While El Salvador’s journey with Bitcoin has faced hurdles, including price volatility and skepticism from international bodies like the IMF, it has undeniably placed the small Central American nation on the global stage as a trailblazer in digital finance. For other developing nations, Bukele’s bold strategy serves as a compelling case study, highlighting both the immense potential and the inherent risks of such a profound economic shift. Driving Global Crypto Adoption: Lessons and Opportunities The meeting between Bukele and Saqib is a clear indicator of a broader trend towards Global Crypto Adoption . It signifies that discussions about digital assets are moving beyond niche tech circles and into the highest echelons of national governance. Countries are increasingly recognizing that ignoring the crypto revolution is no longer an option; instead, they must engage with it, understand it, and determine how it fits into their national economic goals. The potential for global crypto adoption extends across various sectors: Cross-Border Payments: Facilitating faster, cheaper international transactions. Supply Chain Management: Enhancing transparency and efficiency using blockchain technology. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Opening up new avenues for financial services without intermediaries. Digital Identity: Secure and verifiable digital identities leveraging blockchain. El Salvador’s experience, while unique, offers valuable lessons. It demonstrates that political will and a clear vision can drive rapid technological integration. However, it also underscores the importance of public education, robust infrastructure, and a balanced regulatory approach to ensure stability and consumer protection. As more nations explore this path, collaboration and shared learning become paramount to fostering responsible and sustainable global crypto adoption. Shaping Digital Asset Policy: Challenges and Collaborative Paths One of the most critical aspects of this evolving landscape is the development of sound Digital Asset Policy . The lack of clear, harmonized regulations is often cited as a major barrier to mainstream crypto adoption and innovation. Meetings like the one between Bukele and Saqib provide a platform for nations to discuss best practices, regulatory challenges, and potential frameworks that can foster growth while mitigating risks. Developing effective digital asset policy involves navigating several complex considerations: Consumer Protection: Safeguarding users from fraud, scams, and market manipulation. Financial Stability: Ensuring that the integration of digital assets does not destabilize traditional financial systems. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF): Implementing robust measures to prevent illicit activities. Innovation vs. Regulation: Striking a balance that encourages technological advancement without stifling it with overly restrictive rules. Taxation: Establishing clear guidelines for taxing crypto transactions and holdings. International collaboration is vital in shaping these policies. By sharing insights on regulatory successes and failures, countries can collectively work towards a more coherent global framework for digital assets. This collaborative approach can help prevent regulatory arbitrage, promote cross-border innovation, and build a more secure and efficient global digital economy. A Landmark Dialogue for the Digital Future The meeting between President Nayib Bukele and Minister Bilal Bin Saqib is a significant moment in the ongoing narrative of global digital transformation. It highlights El Salvador’s continued role as a pioneer in the Bitcoin space and underscores Pakistan’s growing recognition of blockchain and cryptocurrencies as vital components of future economic development. While the immediate outcomes of this specific meeting remain to be seen, its symbolic importance is immense. This dialogue signifies a shift from mere curiosity to active engagement among nations regarding digital assets. It suggests a future where international cooperation on crypto and blockchain policies becomes more common, leading to more robust frameworks, increased adoption, and ultimately, a more integrated and innovative global financial system. The road ahead for digital asset integration is complex, but with leaders willing to engage in such high-level discussions, the potential for a truly transformative digital future appears increasingly within reach.

The lawsuit, filed with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg last month, argues that Spain violated Ver’s legal protections when it approved a U.S. request to extradite him to Los Angeles. Roger Ver Fights $48M U.S. Tax Extradition in Spain, Calls Case a “Denial of Justice” In court documents reviewed by Bloomberg , Ver’s legal team described the Spanish extradition order as a “clear denial of justice” and a breach of international extradition protocols. Spanish authorities arrested Ver last year on the island of Mallorca after a U.S. indictment was unsealed, charging him with mail fraud, tax evasion, and filing false tax returns. He was later released on bail while legal proceedings continued. U.S. prosecutors allege that Ver failed to pay over $48 million in taxes related to his 2017 sale of tens of thousands of bitcoins , worth approximately $240 million. 'Bitcoin Jesus' Roger Ver’s lawyers call for dismissal of tax evasion charges, claiming the IRS’s exit tax violates the Constitution. #BitcoinJesus #RogerVer https://t.co/Lnez1FgsMQ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 4, 2024 Though Ver renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2014 and acquired citizenship in St. Kitts and Nevis, prosecutors argue he remained liable for U.S. taxes due to his continued ownership of U.S.-incorporated businesses, including MemoryDealers.com and Agilestar.com. The case also centers on the so-called “exit tax,” a requirement that wealthy Americans who expatriate pay capital gains tax on their global assets. In his legal filing, Ver’s Spanish attorney, Jaime Campaner Munoz, accused Spanish authorities of failing to consider the “legal uncertainty and insecurity” surrounding U.S. tax policy on crypto assets during the relevant period. He also argued that extraditing Ver would illegitimately curtail his right to liberty. A spokesperson for the European Court of Human Rights confirmed receipt of the complaint, which is currently under review. Neither Spain’s government nor the U.S. Department of Justice has commented on the ongoing case. Ver’s legal team in the United States has challenged the indictment, describing the charges as flawed and politically charged. David Schoen , Ver’s U.S. attorney, said in an interview that the case “should have never been indicted criminally,” pointing out that the crypto industry was still “completely in flux” in 2017 regarding token valuations and tax implications. According to Schoen, Ver had sought advice from U.S. tax professionals before selling his bitcoin and acted based on that guidance. “He did not commit any crime,” Schoen insisted. “There was no intent to defraud. He followed the advice of professionals. That’s not a crime.” Roger Ver’s Legal Fight Sparks Political Drama and Crypto Community Clash The crypto entrepreneur’s legal battle has drawn widespread attention in both political and blockchain circles. In a January video posted to his X account, Ver appealed directly to President Donald Trump, asking for help. “For decades, I’ve been terrorized by rogue U.S. government agents who hate American freedom. This is my story,” he said. The plea sparked online backlash. Elon Musk posted on X , writing, “Roger Ver gave up his U.S. citizenship. No pardon for Ver. Membership has its privileges.” Despite that, Ver reportedly paid $600,000 to Trump ally Roger Stone earlier this year to lobby Congress and influence the legal environment surrounding his charges. ₿ Roger Ver has reportedly paid $600,000 to longtime Trump associate Roger Stone to lobby him. #BitcoinJesus #RogerVer #DonaldTrump https://t.co/PrZ5ZEY1Is — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 25, 2025 According to congressional filings, Stone’s lobbying efforts sought to challenge the law under which Ver was charged. However, Schoen has since confirmed that Ver is no longer pursuing a pardon. The case has stirred heated reactions within the crypto community. Ross Ulbricht, the recently pardoned founder of the Silk Road darknet marketplace , expressed his support for Ver, citing Ver’s prior advocacy on his behalf . “Roger Ver was there for me when I was down and needed help. Now Roger needs our support,” Ulbricht posted on X . “No one should spend the rest of their life in prison over taxes. Let him pay the tax (if any) and be done with it.” @RealRossU , pardoned founder of the Silk Road marketplace, is publicly advocating for clemency for @rogerkver , known as ""Bitcoin Jesus."" #RogerVer #Bitcoin https://t.co/nFhN9IIBdn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 21, 2025 But not everyone shares that sentiment. Dan Held, a prominent crypto figure and former Kraken executive, called Ver “toxic” and accused him of doing long-term damage to Bitcoin’s development. “He misaligned expectations around Bitcoin so much that it led to a civil war.” Roger attacked my livelihood by trying to get me fired, called up others to hurt my relationships, and attacked my reputation. He misaligned expectations around Bitcoin so much that it led to a civil war. He deserves everything that he's about to get.

The trader, identified by the wallet address “0x2258…”, is betting heavily that ETH won’t climb anytime soon—and so far, the gamble is paying off. Related Reading: Avalanche Shatters Record With 20M Transactions—Is Real-World Use Finally Here? Based on blockchain data monitored via Hyperdash, the whale shorted 20,474 ETH at an entry point of $3,060. As ETH has been trading at levels lower than $3,000 at the time of writing, the whale is already enjoying an unrealized profit of approximately $1.14 million, or returns of 30%. Ethereum Under Pressure Below $3,500 The liquidation value of the position is at $3,505 — near where ETH traded previously in January 2025. That point is now serving as very powerful resistance. If the price exceeds that level, the position stands to be completely liquidated. Whale 0x2258, who’s already made over $15M, is shorting $ETH with 18x leverage, holding a position of 20,474 $ETH($62.5M). This whale has previously profited big by trading against James Wynn.https://t.co/BALllYbUXbhttps://t.co/NhOE1YD4QN pic.twitter.com/7k5ZE81Noa — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 15, 2025 Despite that narrow buffer, the trader seems confident. The use of 18x leverage suggests a high-conviction call that ETH will drop further or, at the very least, won’t bounce past that resistance level in the short term. This kind of heavy shorting is raising eyebrows in a market that’s still undecided on whether Ethereum can regain bullish momentum alongside Bitcoin. Track Record Of Outsmarting James Wynn This isn’t the first time “0x2258…” has stepped in with bold trades. The wallet has gained a reputation for taking positions that go directly against crypto influencer James Wynn—often with profitable results. Back in May, Wynn went long on ETH and Bitcoin. Almost immediately, 0x2258 shorted both. When Wynn closed his positions, 0x2258 did the same and walked away with $1.36 million. The next day, as Wynn flipped bearish, 0x2258 went long and bagged another $2.54 million. The back-and-forth continued. By May 26, the whale had locked in $5.6 million in profits in just three days. Since then, the strategy has snowballed into more than $15 million in realized gains, most of it from flipping against Wynn’s positions. Related Reading: If You’re Wealthy, 1 Bitcoin Should Already Be In Your Wallet, Expert Says Big Bet Reflects Uncertainty In ETH’s Path While Bitcoin continues to break through key resistance zones, Ethereum seems stuck in a tougher fight. Traders like 0x2258 appear to believe that ETH lacks the strength right now to push past the $3,500 level. Still, shorting with this level of leverage is a double-edged sword. If ETH bounces sharply, traders like 0x2258 could get caught in a squeeze, forced to buy back in at a loss—driving the price up even faster. So far, though, the whale is winning again. Whether it ends in another multi-million-dollar gain or a hard reset depends on what ETH does next. For now, the market is waiting to see what happens next.

48377627,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74573,1752710434,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,SEC Commissioner Reveals Reason For XRP ETF Delay,https://timestabloid.com/sec-commissioner-reveals-reason-for-xrp-etf-delay/,"United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw has addressed ongoing concerns from the crypto investment community regarding the repeated delays in the approval of spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In a recent interview, Commissioner Crenshaw emphasized that the delays are procedural and do not reflect a definitive stance against the launch of such products. Understanding the Cause of Delays In a conversation on The David Lin Report, Commissioner Crenshaw explained the underlying reasons for the SEC’s slow pace in reviewing spot XRP ETF applications. She acknowledged the growing dissatisfaction among investors but clarified that the delays result from the SEC’s structured and methodical evaluation process. According to Crenshaw, the agency operates within a bureaucratic framework that mandates careful analysis rather than rapid decision-making. She noted that she had anticipated the frustration and had previously advised market participants that the approval process would likely take time. Crenshaw reiterated that the SEC must adhere to procedural requirements, which naturally extend the timeline for reviewing exchange-traded product applications, including those tied to cryptocurrencies like XRP. Despite the delays, Commissioner Crenshaw confirmed that the SEC continues to actively assess numerous applications for crypto-related ETFs. These include a broad range of filings, not limited to XRP-based products. She stated that the commission is methodically working through a large volume of applications and that this process is consistent with how the agency has traditionally approached new financial instruments. Crenshaw stated that the fact that a filing has not yet been approved should not be interpreted as an outright rejection. She further explained the importance of a comprehensive review before granting regulatory clearance. No Final Decision Yet on Spot XRP ETFs Importantly, Commissioner Crenshaw clarified that the ongoing delays should not be interpreted as a denial of future XRP ETF products. She emphasized that the SEC has not made a final decision on whether to approve or deny these applications. The delays are part of the agency’s formal evaluation protocol, which aims to ensure that all aspects of a proposed product meet regulatory standards before approval. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Crenshaw added that although the pace may appear slow, the SEC’s review process is designed to safeguard market integrity and investor interests. She encouraged stakeholders to remain patient as the agency continues its evaluations. Timeline for Potential ETF Approval Currently, more than ten firms, among them Franklin Templeton and Bitwise , are pursuing the launch of spot XRP ETFs in the United States. The SEC has already postponed decisions on these filings twice, missing the first two regulatory deadlines. The third deadline for some applications is set for August, while the final deadline for review and approval falls in October 2025. Market analysts, including Bloomberg ETF experts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, have projected that approval may occur before the final October deadline. Although spot XRP ETFs remain under review, the SEC has previously granted clearance to futures-based XRP products, such as the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF, indicating some level of openness to XRP-related investment instruments. Commissioner Crenshaw’s recent remarks aim to reassure market participants that the SEC’s approach to XRP ETF applications is guided by established procedures, not resistance. While the delays have raised concerns among investors, the agency remains engaged in a detailed review process. With multiple deadlines approaching, the coming months will likely provide further clarity on the future of spot XRP ETFs in the United States.

Let’s start with Ethena , the spotlight hit when Arthur Hayes dropped $1.5 million into ENA shortly after it jumped 20% on Upbit. That bold move hints he’s betting big on altcoins gaining momentum again. Meanwhile, FET is turning heads on the charts. Traders are watching closely as a classic harmonic pattern forms, paired with a strong weekly rise that could set up a major breakout. And while the market heats up, BlockDAG (BDAG) is stepping beyond the usual crypto crowd. Its new partnership with the Seattle Seawolves is grabbing attention, aiming to blend blockchain with sports through NFTs, digital collectibles, and special fan perks. On top of that, the project’s presale has already pulled in $340 million and sold over 24 billion coins, paving the way for a high-energy launch. Arthur Hayes Drops $1.5M On ENA After 20% Surge Arthur Hayes just made waves in the crypto world by buying $1.5 million into Ethena (ENA) right after the coin surged 20% following its listing on Upbit. He picked up around 4.2 million ENA coins through big-name platforms like Binance, Wintermute, and Galaxy Digital, showing strong faith in a coming altcoin rally. The price of ENA jumped from $0.22 to a peak of $0.37 before settling around $0.3371, reflecting growing excitement in the market. Hayes called the Upbit listing a key moment for Ethena, tying it into his bigger belief in the future of altcoins and the growing synthetic dollar space, which is gaining serious traction among buyers. FET Gains 10% As Bullish Pattern Takes Shape FET is back in the spotlight this week after posting a solid 10% gain. What’s catching traders’ eyes is a clear harmonic pattern forming on the daily chart, specifically, a Bearish Bat setup. It’s now entering the final CD leg, which often points to a potential push higher, possibly toward the $1.50 to $1.65 range. After dipping to around $0.55, FET has made a strong recovery and is now testing key resistance at the 200-day moving average near $0.78. Analysts say if the price breaks above this level, it could confirm the bullish pattern. But if it slips below $0.64, that might weaken the outlook and signal caution ahead. BlockDAG Scores Big With Seattle Seawolves Deal Surging Past $340M BlockDAG is making waves beyond the crypto crowd, thanks to a new partnership with the Seattle Seawolves, one of Major League Rugby’s top teams. This move brings blockchain right into the hands of sports fans through NFTs, digital collectibles, and behind-the-scenes content. It’s a strong step in showing how crypto can offer real-world value and stronger fan connections, not just trading hype. The numbers back up the buzz. BlockDAG’s presale has already raised over $340 million, with over 24 billion BDAG coins sold across 29 presale batches. Since its early days, the coin’s price has jumped 2,660%, climbing from just $0.001 to $0.0276. Despite that major run-up, there’s still a limited-time offer available. The price is temporarily set at $0.0016 until the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. That deadline has sparked a wave of new buying as more people take notice. Analysts believe BlockDAG has room to grow, with long-term price targets as high as $10. Its growing presence in mainstream sports, strong presale success, and focus on real-world use cases make it one of the more talked-about crypto projects this year. With demand heating up and the clock ticking toward launch, many see this as a chance that might not last long, especially as both fans and traders jump in. Final Thoughts Arthur Hayes’ big $1.5 million move into Ethena is still turning heads, boosting confidence in altcoins, and alerting buyers to more price action. At the same time, FET continues to draw attention, with its bullish chart pattern suggesting more upside could be on the way if key levels hold. But it’s BlockDAG that’s really capturing the spotlight. Its partnership with the Seattle Seawolves is pushing crypto into the mainstream, showing real-world value beyond just trading. With over $340 million raised, 24 billion coins sold, and a limited-time price of $0.0016 ahead of its August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release, the hype around BlockDAG is building fast. Its growing visibility, strong momentum, and unique approach make it one of the top bullish projects to keep a close eye on.

The tech and retail titan emitted 68.25 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent over the year, according to its annual sustainability report, which was released Wednesday, well above its 2023 output. The spike results from an explosion in data center construction to support the growing demand for artificial intelligence technologies. These sites consume vast amounts of energy and raw materials, including enormous amounts of steel and concrete, two of the materials that are also most carbon-intensive to produce. The new data underscore a growing tightening at Amazon. The company had publicly pledged to achieve net-zero carbon by 2040 as part of its Climate Pledge, a much-heralded effort that set a bar for corporate climate action. But five years later, Amazon’s emissions had grown by a third. AI’s soaring power demands push Amazon’s emissions higher The Amazon report also admitted that, considering the company’s electricity purchases, its emissions will increase by 1 percent in 2024. It was the first time it had observed growth in that category since it began tracking it in 2019. The energy antenna focuses more on the power-greedy aspect of AI workloads, explaining to a large extent the boost in electricity consumption. The large AI models are trained across enormous computing resources, creating extravagant electricity consumption at data centers. In the report, Amazon acknowledged that it is crucial for collective efforts to reduce energy peaks and expand access to green, carbon-free energy to continue supporting the advanced technologies their customers rely on. And for all the money Amazon has thrown at renewable energy, including wind and solar projects around the globe, the company is finding it increasingly hard to keep up with the headlong growth of AI. The rest of big tech, including Amazon, Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Meta, and Microsoft, have increasingly turned to AI to discover their next great leap forward. However, the environmental costs are getting a second look. The companies’ growing AI data centers require more electricity, and the electricity demand has spiked. In some parts of the country, that need has been filled by power plants that run on natural gas and coal, sources that many companies had largely shunned to gravitate toward greener ones. AI is revolutionizing the energy sector, but it is not always for the better. In places where clean energy infrastructure has failed to keep pace with surging demand, especially driven by tech-powered growth, progress toward sustainability is beginning to reverse. Meanwhile, Amazon and other giants are signing contracts to secure carbon-free nuclear power for future operations. Both batches of deals should come online in a couple of years, but the divide between demand for energy and supply of the clean stuff is only growing. Amazon struggles to balance innovation with sustainability Amazon says it is still committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2040, noting its efforts to decarbonize its delivery fleet and grow its purchases of renewable energy and its investments in nascent technologies such as carbon capture. However, Amazon’s current path, particularly its effort to drive the AI boom, means its climate promises are in jeopardy. But as the company invests in its AI infrastructure, there are increasing calls from many quarters for more transparency, faster renewable adoption, and clearer accountability for tracking and curbing emissions. For now, Amazon’s 2024 vision is of a tech superpower pushing the future of AI, and pushing back even farther — at least for now — from the green promises it made just five years ago.

They call it an existential threat to the country’s democracy. Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden said there is a strong case for making crypto donations illegal in the UK. He was responding to Labor MP Liam Byrne, who had asked if the government was reviewing a crypto ban in political funding, which was ordered during the Beitbridge inquiry into xenophobia. During Parliament’s summer recess, McFadden emphasized the need for the UK to update its political finance laws to preserve public trust continuously. He said it was important to know who the donation was received from, whether it was correctly registered, and to understand the entire path of money in and out to assure the donation was safe. The concern is that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum can move across borders without being attached to names, banks, or identities. That is the tricky part for officials when trying to track the trail of money and verify that it is the source of the donation. To one set of people, crypto is a clear-eyed modern method of raising money; to another, it is a potential opening into the shadowy and potentially illicit world of campaign finance. Reform UK Bitcoin move sparks outrage It is just two months since Reform UK , led by Nigel Farage, said the party would begin taking donations in Bitcoin. The move made Reform UK the first UK political party to take donations in cryptocurrency publicly. Although many have hailed it as a metric innovation, the regulators and watchdogs are worried about that. A UK-registered anti-corruption charity warned in a recent report that accepting cryptocurrency donations could open up British politics to the dangers of foreign interference and the proceeds of crime. The report said digital assets like crypto could be used in “future political interference schemes,” especially if combined with lax oversight. McFadden and Byrne urged the government to ensure that institutions regulating political financing are strong. They called for greater resources and power for the National Crime Agency and the Electoral Commission, which monitors and investigates donations to political parties. Governments tighten rules on crypto funding It’s not just Britain that is worried. Elsewhere in the world, other countries are considering regulating or banning cryptocurrency donations to politics . Like many democracies, Ireland aimed to shield its democracy from “foreign interference,” fake news, and clandestine campaign financing. It’s different in the United States, state by state. A handful of states, including Oregon, Michigan, and North Carolina, have outlawed donations made in cryptocurrency altogether. They raised questions around traceability and transparency. Some states, like California, had bans in place but rolled back those restrictions so money from crypto could again flow into campaigns, as happened when the new year arrived. However, in countries with weak oversight, the risks are even greater. For example, El Salvador, which made Bitcoin legal tender, permits political donations in cryptocurrency. Civic groups have cautioned that external forces can easily manipulate the democratic process anonymously.

The top cryptocurrency has been struggling as major holders take profit at BTC’s current level. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Index Spikes Above 30, But Bitcoin Dominance Remains High, What Next? At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price trades around $118,800 with a 2% gain over the last 24 hours and a 9% gain over the past week, according to data from CoinGecko. Conversely, Ethereum, XRP, and Dogecoin have seen gains north of 16% on similar timeframes. BTC's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Bitcoin Price At Critical Levels, More Gains On The Horizon Following a major upside push from below $100,000, the Bitcoin price broke a persistent downtrend and managed to hit a fresh all-time high close to its current levels. As mentioned, a report from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode claimed an increase in profit taking from short-term holders. As these players exited the market, taking over $3.5 billion in profits in just 24 hours, the Bitcoin price lose steam and began moving sideways. While Bitcoin has been on a violent bull run, there are still fears of a major pullback from the $118,000 area to the support zone at around $110,000. However, a report from CryptoQuant, with data from top analyst Crypto Dan, suggests that the Bitcoin bull run still has some room for another leg up. As seen in the chart below, the current BTC market is nowhere near the overheated levels recorded in March and December of 2024. BTC's Realized Cap Age Bands as measured by UTXOs far from previous bear market levels. Source: Crypto Dan via CryptoQuant The CryptoQuant post stated the following, sharing an insight from Crypto Dan: (…) unlike in March and December 2024, on-chain data indicating market overheating shows that the market still hasn’t reached an overheated state. Despite the price rising even higher, the fact that overheating has significantly decreased compared to previous short-term peaks suggests that Bitcoin could continue to break all-time highs and rise significantly in the second half of 2025, leaving strong potential for growth. Bitcoin Bull Run Far From Over? In this context, and if bulls are able to sustain the momentum, Bitcoin is likely heading for higher. As NewsBTC covered earlier, a prediction from a top analyst claims that the levels of BTC adoption are unprecedented.

Uniswap (UNI) price forecasts point to a steady rise, with buyers testing the $9.20 resistance after holding support near $8.00. Meanwhile, Aptos (APT) price today remains strong above $5.00, setting a new support at $4.96 backed by solid trading volume. BlockDAG (BDAG) is moving beyond price shifts alone. It’s creating real value by teaming up with the Seattle Seawolves rugby and Orcas cricket teams. These deals bring ticketing, rewards, and NFTs on the blockchain. By focusing on sports fans in North America, BlockDAG aims to take blockchain use beyond niche groups. This sports partnership has pushed presale beyond $340 million. But BlockDAG currently offers coins at a special $0.0016 price until the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. This makes BlockDAG a top option for those looking at clear plans and real adoption. UNI Targets $9.20 Following $7.00 Rally Uniswap (UNI) is gaining strength after weeks of slow recovery. Price forecasts highlight a possible climb toward $10 if buyers keep their momentum. UNI has held steady above $8.00 support, with the $9.20 resistance level now in focus for the next move. Recent price action shows strong demand, with UNI rising from $7.00 to above $9.00 before a slight pullback. Hourly charts reveal higher highs and higher lows, meaning buyers are still active. Futures open interest is also growing, indicating more traders are positioning for price changes. However, if the price falls while open interest remains high, it could trigger forced selling. Watching these key price levels will be important to see if the upward trend continues or pauses. Aptos (APT) Maintains Support Level At $4.96 Aptos (APT) price today climbed 4.5% in 24 hours, with heavy buying at 01:00 UTC when volume reached 1.64 million units, 29% above average. Prices jumped from $4.97 to $5.06 in one hour, setting $4.96 as a new support level. The rally then pushed to a peak of $5.20 by 04:00 UTC. This rise aligns with broader crypto market gains of 3.6%. Recently, APT has traded near $5.13, about 3.2% higher. Support at $5.09 held well with strong volume confirming buyer interest. The trading range showed 6% volatility between $4.91 and $5.20, but recent action suggests price stability around $5.13 after intense buying. BlockDAG Focuses On Real Adoption Through High-Profile Seattle Seawolves Team BlockDAG is working closely with the Seattle Seawolves rugby team and the Orcas cricket team to bring blockchain technology to sports fans. These partnerships provide fans with new digital experiences such as ticketing on the blockchain, exclusive rewards, and collectible NFTs. By teaming up with well-known sports teams in North America, BlockDAG aims to reach a wider, loyal audience and increase its visibility beyond the usual blockchain circles. These deals aren’t just for show, they give fans real benefits, making blockchain practical and easy to use. This approach helps grow BlockDAG’s network by increasing user activity and improving security. More users mean a stronger and more useful platform. These partnerships clearly show BlockDAG’s goal to bring blockchain technology into everyday life, where regular people can understand and enjoy it. The BlockDAG presale has already raised $340 million in just a few months, and the push is stronger after this partnership. Right now, buyers can take advantage of a special price of $0.0016 per coin until the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. This presents a potential return of 3,025% compared to the original launch price of $0.05. Currently, Batch 29 coins are priced at $0.0276 but are frozen for now. This limited-time offer at $0.0016 offers a great chance for those looking for coins with clear real-world use and growth potential. BlockDAG’s plans and partnerships suggest it is one of the best projects to watch for practical adoption and long-term progress. Summing Up! Uniswap (UNI) price prediction targets $9.20, maintaining strong support at $8.00. This points to steady buyer interest and demand. Aptos (APT) price today stays firm above $5.00, with $4.96 confirmed as a support level and trading near $5.13 on solid volume. BlockDAG stands apart by focusing on real-world use.

These new mobile phones included the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The smartwatch is also a Pixel version , incorporated with a fourth-generation model. The announcement came after Samsung’s recent disclosure of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, a slender, new standard foldable mobile phone with a market valuation of $2,000. The availability of these mobile phones in the market is set for July 25. Google discloses new unique features for its Pixel 10 smartphone series Following the growing advancements of technology, Google is now eyeing to produce Pixel 10 products this year after releasing Pixel 9 on August 13, 2024. Notably, the 2 types of Pixels will look nearly the same, but the newest Pixel version will have more advanced processors, better hardware, among other minor enhancements. Another significant upgrade in producing the Pixel 10 series is that the Tensor G5 processor, the tech firm’s customized processor for its Pixel mobile phones with a fifth-generation model, will drive the whole series. Interestingly, the American multinational corporation and technology company has shifted its dependence on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company to create this chip after years of heavy dependence on Samsung to produce chips for its production. In addition, the tech company has vowed not to imitate Samsung’s Z Fold 7 make but instead will use an entirely new design that will use the Gemini AI application. In the era of foldable mobile phones, just as Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Google will also launch the Pixel 10 Pro Fold series, which will be more budget-friendly than Samsung’s. Meanwhile, Google’s new smartphone will utilize Android 16 features and demonstrate a more enticing user experience, which Google mentioned earlier during its annual developer conference in May. Google has an event in Mountain View, California called “Made by Google.” Last year it was conducted on August 13. It comes before Apple’s September iPhone event. The event focused on demonstrating the company’s new products to its users. Despite all these efforts, Google’s market valuation of its mobile phones is below that of Samsung and Apple’s in the US. Even so, the tech firm’s phones have passionate fans due to their impressive features, such as the high-quality camera and their updates on Android applications. Its enhanced features have also given its users reasons to stay loyal. Google incorporates several unique features in its production to surpass its rivals With its latest update on its mobile phones, Google took a significant step before Apple, its competitor, demonstrated its renovated iPhone package . In its blog post, Google highlighted its plans to unveil Material 3 Expressive, its new features created to showcase modern, applicable, and distinct design. The company will use it for its apps, such as Gmail, and in its Android system. It is worth noting that this is not the first feature Google has used to make its products unique. Several features have been implemented, such as incorporating bouncier animations, different shapes, strong contrasts, and bigger fonts in its production.

The multi-day event gives leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives an opportunity to vote on three critical bills that are expected to bolster the entire crypto sector. These three bills under consideration include the CLARITY Act, the GENIUS Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. WATCH: Chairman @RepFrenchHill speaks at @RulesReps on the three bills as part of ""Crypto Week:"" CLARITY Act GENIUS Act Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act pic.twitter.com/VoHiAoaUt1 — Financial Services GOP (@FinancialCmte) July 14, 2025 The CLARITY Act sets the rules for when an asset is considered a security . This would also clarify whether an asset is overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or considered a commodity. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) was introduced in February. The bill passed the Senate on June 17 and sets rules for the type of entities that may issue stablecoins . The GENIUS Act establishes that “issuers must maintain reserves backing the stablecoin on a one-to-one basis” in US dollars or other similarly liquid assets. It also extends the Bank Secrecy Act to stablecoin issuers. Finally, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act aims to prevent the US Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) . Why Crypto Week Is Historic For The U.S. While legislative efforts remain underway at the time of writing, industry experts believe that Crypto Week represents a historic moment in U.S. history. Reeve Collins, CEO and pending executive chairman of digital asset management firm ReserveOne, told Cryptonews that the U.S. has finally begun to replace uncertainty with clarity in the digital asset space. “For years, innovators and investors have navigated a fragmented regulatory environment, often worried about arbitrary enforcement,” Collins said. “Now, with landmark bills like the CLARITY Act moving through Congress, we’re on the verge of giving the industry clear rules of the road instead of red tape.” Collins added that Crypto Week is not just about crypto, but rather about the U.S. indicating to the world that it’s ready to lead in an innovation-friendly financial future. For instance, Collins believes that the three bills being discussed this week would open the door for traditional banks and fintechs to participate confidently in the digital asset sector. “This would unlock trillions in value, and position the U.S. as a global hub for digital assets.” The Importance of the GENIUS Act Denelle Dixon, executive director of the Stellar Development Foundation, further told Cryptonews that the GENIUS Act is particularly important for ensuring access to the global financial system via blockchain technology. “This bill recognizes the evolution of our financial system and the important role that stablecoins play,” Dixon said. “It creates a federal licensing regime for stablecoins that will support the dollar’s strength, fosters international coordination that puts the United States in a strong, influential position at the table, and strengthens dollar-denominated, cross-border stablecoin flows.” Most importantly, Dixon explained that the passing of the GENIUS Act would protect consumers by ensuring that stablecoins are fully backed and truly stable. “This is critical as stablecoins are projected to grow to a two trillion dollar sector before the end of the decade,” she said. Will The GENIUS and CLARITY Acts Pass? Currently, the U.S. House of Representatives has voted 215-211 to pass a procedural motion that will allow the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts, along with the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, to proceed to final votes. While noteworthy, some industry experts remain skeptical that the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts will pass this week. Rebecca Liao, co-founder and CEO of Web3 infrastructure provider Saga, told Cryptonews that she believes it’s unlikely the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts will pass this week because of congressional procedures. “I’d still love to see significant headway being made moving these bills through the channels,” Liao said. She added that these bills are important for the regulatory certainty the crypto industry needs. Echoing this, Margaret Rosenfeld, chief legal officer at Everstake, told Cryptonews that passing any of the three bills under consideration would represent a watershed moment. “It would give companies like ours the legal certainty to innovate here in the US and would reassure consumers that there are rules in place to protect them,” she said. “After years of regulatory ambiguity and enforcement-driven policymaking, having clear statutory frameworks would set the stage for mainstream adoption and stronger public trust.” Challenges To Consider Although Crypto Week demonstrates crypto-friendly legislation in the U.S., a number of challenges remain. In addition to congressional procedures, Rosenfeld mentioned that the biggest challenge that may impact the passing of these bills is related to politics. “Even with bipartisan support for clearer rules, there is still deep skepticism in parts of Congress that crypto bills are too industry-friendly. We’ve already seen procedural holdups and ideological divides emerge this week,” she said. In addition, Rosenfeld noted that timing presents a challenge. “There are only a few days left in the session before Congress breaks for recess, so delays could push votes into the fall.” Future Impact of Crypto Week Yet, regardless of what is voted through this week, Crypto Week has already built unprecedented momentum, especially in the U.S. Rosenfeld believes that this week’s events will likely result in the U.S. Senate considering the market structure legislation next . “We’ll also likely see more detailed rulemaking discussions in the fall. If the stablecoin bill passes, the focus will quickly shift to implementation—establishing licensing, reserve requirements, and disclosure standards,” she added.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising protocol focused on real-world asset lending, is drawing increased attention from crypto analysts and DeFi investors alike. At its current price of $0.03 MUTM is flying fast during presale stage. Mutuum Finance is in presale stage 5 of which 70% has been sold out as investors pile in. The token is at its lowest possible price of $0.03. A 16.7% jump will follow as phase 6 sets in. Over $12.4 million has been raised to date, and over 13400 investors have entered the presale. While Ethereum continues to dominate headlines, Mutuum Finance could 30x in Q4 2025. Ethereum Outlook: Eyes on $4,000 Amid Growing Institutional Interest Ethereum is currently trading around $2,982 and has recently rebounded into the $3,000 range after dipping as low as $2,934, with a high of approximately $3,074 recorded intraday. The digital asset’s rally is gaining traction thanks to expanding institutional involvement, Ethereum ETFs have attracted over $4.3 billion in net inflows by mid‑2025, including a record $1.13 billion in June alone. That interest, coupled with advancements in staking infrastructure and Layer 2 scaling solutions, is fueling projections that Ethereum could test the $4,000 level by year-end. While technical catalysts are evident, the market remains attentive to ETF approval developments and macroeconomic signals. As Ethereum captures more of the spotlight, Mutuum Finance remains a quietly emerging DeFi protocol worth watching. Mutuum Finance Presale Exceeds $12.4M as Investor Demand Grows Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as one of the most promising DeFi tokens in 2025. With over $12.4 million raised and over 13400 investors already in, the presale is gaining real traction. During phase five, the token is priced at $0.03. The next stage will see the price increase to $0.035, and with an already set official launch price of $0.06, early investors are already on a 100% profit. MUTM could skyrocket 9900% to $3 in the next bull run. Revolutionizing Finance Through Decentralized Lending Mutuum Finance offers a non-custodial liquidity protocol where users own complete control of assets throughout decentralized lending. The project follows a double-model approach that incorporates Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending in an attempt to achieve greater flexibility and efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system utilizes smart contracts to establish automatic lending with no human interference and rather, the smart contracts respond to the market by giving dynamic interest rates. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates middlemen and gives direct access between the borrowers and the lenders. The model is highly preferred by users for volatile assets like meme coins. Mutuum Finance Strengthens Security with $50K Bounty & Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is hosting a $100,000 giveaway . 10 people will each receive $10,000 MUTM tokens. The project has also launched a new leaderboard where top 50 token holders will be rewarded with bonus tokens for maintaining their ranks. To improve security, Mutuum Finance has initiated a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. Every vulnerability will be rewarded, with the bounty focusing on four key levels: critical, major, minor, and level four will be low. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $12.4 million from more than 13,400 investors, racing through Stage 5 of its presale as demand intensifies. Priced at $0.03, the token is positioned for a 2x gain at launch, with forecasts suggesting a run to $3 by Q4 2025, a potential 30x return from current levels. Backed by a $100,000 giveaway, a $50,000 security bounty, and fast-approaching exchange listings, momentum is building fast. Secure your spot in the presale now before the next price jump and get in early on one of DeFi’s most promising launches.

With new AI features and metaverse updates, SHIB is gaining renewed attention. At the same time, the AAVE market analysis shows strong progress, with Aave crossing $50 billion in deposits and breaking through important price zones. While these projects gain traction, BlockDAG (BDAG) is offering a different kind of opportunity. Its NO VESTING PASS allows all buyers within a 10-day window to unlock 100% of their purchased BDAG coins at launch. Combined with its current $0.0016 entry rate, this move has drawn high activity and is helping BlockDAG stand out as one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the market right now. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Ecosystem Moves Ahead with AI and Metaverse Features The Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem is showing growth as the total crypto market cap reaches $3.81 trillion, fueled by Bitcoin’s latest rally. SHIB regained an $8 billion market cap, rising nearly 17% in a week, while BONE, LEASH, and TREAT also saw steady gains. Teased updates under the “Jul-AI” label suggest AI-based tools are coming soon, and the metaverse experience has improved performance. These upgrades point to a stronger phase for the Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem, helped by rising on-chain activity and continued community focus on what’s coming next. AAVE Market Analysis Shows Strength Above $50 Billion Deposits The latest AAVE market analysis shows that Aave has now passed $50 billion in total deposits. This marks a major point in the growth of decentralized finance. Aave operates across 34 blockchains and has support from both fintech partners and traditional financial firms. Tools like Aave Arc and the planned V4 release are adding real-world asset features. The AAVE coin has now cleared key levels at $303.38 and $317.90 and trades close to $326. Based on AAVE market analysis, the next resistance zone is around $340 to $345. Market behavior points to steady support for Aave’s services and overall utility. Unlock All BDAG Instantly: BlockDAG’s 10-Day NO VESTING Pass Opens Early Access BlockDAG has launched a special NO VESTING PASS, giving buyers a 10-day window to unlock 100% of their BDAG at launch. Most presales require long waiting periods before coins can be accessed, often lasting months or even a year. This pass changes that pattern, offering full access from the start for any BDAG bought during this short time. Only purchases made during this 10-day period qualify. Referral bonuses and promotional rewards will still follow the usual release timeline. The NO VESTING PASS adds a level of flexibility rarely seen in early-stage crypto projects, helping users take full control of their purchase from day one. This limited offer runs alongside BlockDAG’s ongoing presale, which has now raised nearly $340 million toward its $600 million goal. Nearly 24 billion BDAG have already been sold. The price began at $0.001 in the first batch and has grown to $0.0276 by batch 29, showing a 2,660% increase. Still, BDAG is available at $0.0016 until the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. This rare pricing model has attracted strong demand and added to BlockDAG’s visibility as one of the most popular cryptocurrency projects in the market today. While pricing and presale data show strong activity, there is growing discussion around BDAG’s potential. Some analysts believe the price could eventually reach $5. The combination of the NO VESTING PASS, special entry price, and market attention has made this a key moment for those tracking the project. By offering early access and keeping terms clear, BlockDAG is gaining interest from people across the space. Insight Into the Broader Market The Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem is building momentum with AI tools and metaverse updates. These changes could help it gain more attention and compete for a place among the most popular cryptocurrency platforms. At the same time, AAVE market analysis shows the platform holding steady in the DeFi world. With growing real-world asset use and more institutional activity, AAVE remains a name to follow. BlockDAG offers something different. The NO VESTING PASS allows all coins bought in its short 10-day offer to be fully unlocked at launch. Alongside its fast-selling presale and a rising user base, it has quickly become the most popular cryptocurrency this week. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release getting closer, many are watching what happens next as this phase continues to unfold.

In a post on X, Kaleo wrote: “God candle to $4K+ this week… honestly though I wouldn’t be surprised if we see something like this play out after today’s news. Don’t let them shake you out if it happens anon. up only soon.” In Kaleo’s chart, the Ether–USDT pair is sketched inside an ascending wedge whose upper boundary has capped every rally for more than three months. That resistance line now sits near $3,000, while the lower boundary originates near $1,450 in early April and accelerates through $2,600 by late June. Ethereum Breakout Fuels $4,000 Hopes The pattern briefly failed in mid-June, when price sliced through support and bottomed near $2,100—an episode Kaleo tags “Breakdown.” Three week later the market closed decisively back above that very line, an event he annotates “Reclaim,” converting former support turned resistance back into a springboard. Related Reading: Ethereum Shorts Reach Record Levels, How To Stay Positioned For A Breakout Candles since the reclaim have marched steadily higher, compressing volatility against the wedge’s apex until earlier this week when price punched through the ceiling at roughly $3,030. At the moment the screenshot was taken the pair traded near $3,041, and a hand-drawn white projection—labelled “Send”—plots a near-vertical advance that crests just above $4,000. The projection takes its height from the widest section of the wedge: the distance between the early-May trough and the mid-May swing high measures a little over $1,000; adding that amplitude to the breakout point delivers a classical measured-move objective in the low-$4,000s, matching Kaleo’s target.

Intermediate friction zones appear near $3,344–the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement also known as the “golden pocket– but the projection assumes these levels will offer little resistance should a “god candle” materialise. Kaleo’s prediction comes on the heels of a broader risk‑on backdrop: Bitcoin is accelerating towards its record high near $123,000 from last week as investors embrace a steadier macro environment. For Ether specifically, enthusiasm has been amplified by an SEC filing revealing that Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund accumulated a 9.1 percent stake in Bitmine Immersion Technologies, the Tom Lee‑chaired public company that has stockpiled more than 163,000 ETH—roughly half a billion dollars’ worth—as part of an aggressive Ethereum‑treasury strategy. The twin tailwinds of macro‑driven liquidity and high‑profile venture endorsement reinforce Kaleo’s thesis that a “god candle” toward the $4,000 mark could ignite before the week draws to a close. At press time, ETH traded at $3,225.

This initiative is a core component of HTX DAO’s ongoing strategy to implement its deflationary mechanism, aiming to enhance the long-term value of $HTX while fostering more stable value expectations for token holders and the broader community. Token Burn to Enhance $HTX Value On-chain data confirms the destruction of 11,796,322,511,974.72 $HTX tokens, valued at over $22.17 million. For complete transparency, the burn details are publicly accessible on the blockchain: https://tronscan.org/#/transaction/89e700e02885d0cd5b0d1bc00035a35cad83febb9b8f0e334322312b1444e301 HTX DAO commits to quarterly burns, with 50% of its platform revenue dedicated to this process; the next burn is scheduled for October 15, 2025. Since Q1 2024, HTX DAO has cumulatively burned approximately 72.76 trillion $HTX tokens, representing a remarkable $136 million in value. The consistent scale of these token burns showcases HTX DAO’s effective implementation of its deflationary mechanism and strong confidence in its ecosystem. The ongoing reduction in circulating supply enables HTX DAO to build a more robust, scarcity-based token economic model that will deliver sustained value to $HTX holders. Community-Driven Project Listing Channel Launched Beyond its token burn efforts, HTX DAO is actively advancing decentralized governance. On July 4, HTX DAO introduced a new listing recommendation channel , empowering users to nominate quality projects through three methods: 1. Creating a dedicated post on the HTX DAO forum; 2. Participating in community discussions within the HTX App ; 3. Posting on the X with the hashtag #HTXVoteToList. Following initial screening and a vote by $HTX holders, shortlisted projects will be submitted to HTX for final listing consideration. Results from the first round of this community-driven initiative will be revealed on July 29. As an added incentive, participants in both the recommendation and voting phases will stand a chance to share a prize pool of nearly 10 billion $HTX tokens. This mechanism not only empowers community users with a stronger voice, but also marks a pivotal step for HTX DAO towards trading governance. It lays a solid foundation for the grand vision of building a “Free Financial Port”. HTX DAO reiterates its commitment to decentralization, aiming to enhance community engagement in governance, decision-making, and asset management. By optimizing its deflationary mechanism and strengthening community governance, HTX DAO seeks to establish a user-driven, sustainable, and fully decentralized financial ecosystem for global users. About HTX DAO As a multi-chain deployed decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), HTX DAO demonstrates an innovative governance approach. Unlike traditional corporate structures, it adopts a decentralized governance structure composed of a diversified group, jointly committed to the success of this organization. This unique ecosystem advocates openness and encourages all DAO participants to propose ideas that can promote the development of HTX DAO.

On July 15, the asset dropped to a low of $116,000 in response to news that inflation rose to 2.7% in June, amid continued concerns over tariffs from the Trump administration. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $118,439, reflecting a 1.8% gain over the past 24 hours, which suggests that some investor confidence has returned to the market despite recent volatility. This short-term rebound occurs amid increasing on-chain and market activity, which analysts are closely tracking. One such contributor, Trader Oasis, recently published an analysis on CryptoQuant outlining various indicators tied to Bitcoin’s current movement. Related Reading: Bitcoin Returns Under $117,000: Is Social Media FOMO To Blame? Bitcoin Open Interest, Price Divergence, and Institutional Signals The analyst explored a range of technical and behavioral metrics, including open interest, Coinbase premium index, and funding rates, that are influencing BTC’s recent price behavior and hinting at what may lie ahead. Trader Oasis began by noting that Bitcoin’s breach of the $107,000 resistance signaled the beginning of a potential distribution phase. He pointed out that a divergence between price and open interest acted as a preliminary bullish signal, preceding the asset’s climb. The current state, where both price and open interest are rising in tandem, is seen by some as a sign of strengthening momentum in the market. He also evaluated data from the Coinbase Premium Index, which remains above zero, typically seen as an indication of institutional demand. However, Oasis observed that the indicator’s flat behavior, even as price rises, could imply large entities are securing profits. He further suggested that a breakout above the descending trend line could trigger a stronger upward move, but a fall below zero might represent a new entry signal. Regarding funding rates, he noted that the current rise reflects renewed market confidence, although it is still below previous extreme levels. This, in his view, implies that while enthusiasm exists, excessive leverage is not yet present. Profit-Taking Rises as Binance Dominates Realized Flows A separate analysis by another CryptoQuant contributor, Crazzyblockk, looked at the realized profit and loss (PnL) across centralized exchanges. According to the data, Bitcoin investors realized $9.29 billion in profits in a single day, marking a record high for such flows. This surge in realized PnL reflects widespread profit-taking in the wake of Bitcoin’s recent price rally, especially among short-term holders. Related Reading: Dormant Bitcoin Wallet Moves $1.2B in BTC: Is A Major Sell-Off Coming? On Binance specifically, the realized PnL remains below its all-time highs but has seen a rising share compared to other exchanges. Data shows that on some days, Binance’s share of realized profits has reached up to 60%, reinforcing its growing importance in shaping market behavior. Crazzyblockk concluded that this concentrated profit-taking, led by Binance users, could indicate a shift in market dynamics, noting: Binance’s increasing dominance in realized PnL flows reinforces its critical role in market sentiment and liquidity. For traders and analysts, it is crucial to closely monitor Binance’s on-chain activity alongside other exchanges to stay ahead of potential volatility.

The joint venture will enable the companies to expand their reach into the UAE, highlighting the growing demand for secure and compliant asset infrastructure in the region. Ripple With Another Move In The UAE Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, which launched at the end of last year, has secured its first major custody partner in the Arab Emirates, Ctrl Alt, with its network now encompassing clients from Europe, Africa, the Asia-Pacific region, and Latin America. The Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa at Ripple, Reece Merrick, commemorated the partnership: “The Dubai Land Department’s Real Estate Tokenization Project is a prime example of the forward-thinking, innovative initiatives that are positioning Dubai at the heart of the global digital asset industry. This is the first time a government real estate registration authority in the Middle East has tokenized property title deeds on a public blockchain. That the DLD has chosen XRPL for this is exciting and reinforces the blockchain’s credentials of choice for financial use cases.” Ctrl Alt recently acquired its Virtual Assets Service Provider (VASP) license from Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), authorizing it to carry out issuer-related services. This will enable them to run a legally compliant platform for the production, administration, and distribution of Asset-Referenced Virtual Assets (ARVA) and tokenized real-world assets. “As the designated tokenization provider for the DLD Project, Ctrl Alt brings deep expertise in financial engineering and digital asset infrastructure, so it makes sense for us to partner with Ripple to use their custody technology to support this initiative. This will allow us to leverage proven and trusted technology that meets the highest security and operational standards.” – Matt Ong, CEO and Founder, Ctrl Alt. Dubai continues to pave the way towards a more open, unambiguous, and efficacious real estate market with its Real Estate Tokenization Project. Minting property deeds on the blockchain enables fractional ownership, expands investor participation, and enhances the efficiency of operations. An Integration and Adoption Boom The border-crossing cryptocurrency’s spree of acceptance doesn’t seem to be showing signs of slowing down. Earlier this year, the company behind it secured a license from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to offer crypto payments in the UAE. Following that, Ripple procured the brokerage firm Hidden Road in a $1.25 billion deal, making it the first in the crypto world to own and operate a multi-asset prime broker. RLUSD has also been in the spotlight, having been integrated into the Swiss bank AMINA and with the oldest US bank, BNY Mellon, becoming its custodian.

On Wednesday, token holders overwhelmingly approved a proposal to unlock WLFI for trading, with 99.94% voting in favor. The move marks a turning point for the Trump-linked project, which was launched last year as a decentralized finance platform offering both a governance token and a stablecoin. The proposal, first introduced on July 9, outlined plans to transition World Liberty from a closed ecosystem to one with broader market participation. Big news from the WLFI community The community has officially voted — and the results were overwhelming. $WLFI will be tradable The people have spoken Now it’s time to execute. Standby for the full launch plan — coming soon. — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) July 16, 2025 Trading Begins for Early World Liberty Financial Holders, Full Unlock Still Pending “This would mark a major milestone in the development of the World Liberty Financial ecosystem,” the team wrote. It added that this would open the door for wider community access and protocol development. WLFI tokens were initially sold in two tranches, priced at $0.015 and $0.05. However, buyers were not allowed to trade them at the time. Instead, they received voting rights on protocol decisions and access to Trump-related events. For instance, in May, top TRUMP memecoin holders were invited to a gala dinner with the president. Among the guests was Tron founder Justin Sun . With trading enabled, price discovery and speculation will now begin. Although only early investor tokens will be unlocked initially, a second vote will determine when the remaining supply of the 100b WLFI tokens can be released. Trump’s Inner Circle Anchors World Liberty’s Leadership and Ownership The team noted that founder, advisor and team allocations will follow a longer vesting schedule. This is meant to signal long-term alignment with the project’s success. Meanwhile, Trump’s three sons serve as official advisors to World Liberty. They are joined by real estate executive and longtime Trump ally Steve Witkoff, who now serves as the US special envoy to the Middle East. Additionally, Witkoff’s sons, Zach and Alex, are co-founders of the project. A company linked to Trump, DT Marks DEFI LLC, is expected to receive 22.5b WLFI tokens. Additionally, Trump personally held 15.75b WLFI as of the end of last year. According to Bloomberg, the Trump family has earned roughly $390m from WLFI sales, contributing to a total $620m in crypto-linked wealth . Lawmakers Question Conflicts as Trump Crypto Profits Soar Democratic lawmakers have voiced concerns over Trump’s growing involvement in crypto. This includes his ventures in Bitcoin mining and stablecoin development. As a result, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Maxine Waters have called on the US SEC to investigate possible conflicts of interest. Meanwhile, the White House has stated that Trump’s assets are held in a trust managed by his children and has denied any conflict of interest. However, the terms of this trust have not been disclosed. Importantly, Trump remains the sole beneficiary. This means he could access proceeds from crypto ventures at any time or once he leaves office. Despite the controversy, supporters see WLFI’s trading debut as a financial opportunity and a show of political loyalty. “We invested to get rich,” one holder posted on the project website. Another simply wrote, “To make America great again.” Most token holders remain anonymous, shielded behind crypto wallet addresses.

Analyst Sees Fresh $2 Billion Liquidity Triggering Next Leg Up,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-set-to-soar-analyst-sees-fresh-2-billion-liquidity-triggering-next-leg-up/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is currently stabilizing within the $116,000 to $120,000 range. However, fresh liquidity totalling $2 billion in stablecoins could help propel the flagship cryptocurrency to new all-time highs (ATHs). Bitcoin To Benefit From Fresh Liquidity According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Amr Taha, more than $2 billion worth of stablecoins – primarily Tether (USDT) – were deposited into major derivatives trading platforms earlier today. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profit-Taking Spikes Without Price Drop – Strong Demand Or Delayed Reaction? Taha believes that this surge in inflows signals increased appetite for leveraged positions among seasoned traders, many of whom are anticipating a potential breakout in BTC’s price. Notably, this fresh batch of USDT was minted by Tether Treasury, suggesting institutional demand is driving the activity. Historically, large-scale stablecoin inflows have preceded bullish market momentum, as traders often use them to open long positions on Bitcoin and altcoin futures and perpetual contracts. Rapid stablecoin deposits into derivatives exchanges often act as a leading indicator for major price rallies. Meanwhile, fellow CryptoQuant contributor TraderOasis pointed to rising Open Interest, noting that it is increasing alongside BTC’s price – a classic signal of strong bullish sentiment. To explain, rising open interest in tandem with a rising Bitcoin price typically signals increasing market participation and bullish sentiment, as more traders are opening positions expecting further upside. However, it can also indicate a buildup of leverage, which may lead to heightened volatility or a sharp correction if sentiment shifts. The analyst also highlighted the Coinbase Premium Index, which remains above zero – a sign that US-based buyers are paying a premium over global spot prices. They added that the indicator is currently within a ‘Breaker’ structure, sharing the following chart for context. TraderOasis noted that while BTC price is rising, the Coinbase Premium Index indicator has remained relatively flat. The analyst explained: This suggests to me that major players are taking profits. If the descending trend structure I marked with an arrow is broken, the price is likely to rise much more strongly. On the other hand, if the indicator drops below the ‘0’ level, I may consider it a buying signal, as we are still in a macro bullish market. Short-Term Pullback For BTC? While the $2 billion stablecoin injection is likely to act as a bullish catalyst for BTC and the broader crypto market, some exchange data suggests a potential short-term pullback before the next leg up. Related Reading: No Mania Yet: Bitcoin ATH Lacks Hype, Suggesting Further Upside Potential For instance, BTC deposits to exchanges spiked after the digital asset hit a recent high around $123,000 – a pattern that often precedes local tops and is typically followed by a price correction. That said, despite recent profit-taking, BTC has not experienced a major price drop, pointing to robust underlying demand. At press time, BTC trades at $119,171, up 2.4% in the past 24 hours.

The price is now consolidating gains and might continue to rise above the $3.10 support zone. XRP price started a fresh increase above the $3.020 zone. The price is now trading above $2.950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.950 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $2.880 zone. XRP Price Eyes More Upsides XRP price started a fresh increase after it settled above the $2.840 level, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to climb above the $2.950 resistance level. The bulls remained in action and the price gained pace for a move above $3.00 barrier. Finally, the price tested the $3.10 zone. A high was formed at $3.10 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a move below the $3.050 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.660 swing low to the $3.10 high. The price is now trading above $2.950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $3.020 level. The first major resistance is near the $3.050 level. A clear move above the $3.050 resistance might send the price toward the $3.10 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.120 resistance or even $3.150 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near the $3.20 zone. Downside Break? If XRP fails to clear the $3.00 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.950 level and the trend line zone. The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.660 swing low to the $3.10 high. The next major support is near the $2.880 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.880 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.840 support. The next major support sits near the $2.750 zone.

Some coins are showing clear signs of strength. Toncoin is one of them. The TON price chart shows strong upside, now near $7.50 with a solid base at $6.80. Hedera is also in the spotlight, with its HBAR price target pointing to a possible 45% jump, backed by improving DeFi numbers and a technical double bottom pattern. Still, BlockDAG (BDAG) is drawing attention for a different reason. It has teamed up with Seattle’s top teams, the Seawolves and Orcas, creating new ways to blend crypto and real-world engagement. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release active and a current entry price of $0.0016, BDAG offers those entering now a possible 3,025% return. TON Charts Stay Firm With $8.20 in Sight The TON price chart shows Toncoin climbing 6.41% in a day, bringing it near $7.50. It’s gained 13.45% over the past week and has held above $6.80 many times, giving confidence to those watching for a continued uptrend. Volume keeps growing, showing more traders are following the move. RSI stays below the overbought level, which means there could still be room for gains. If key resistance breaks, the TON price chart suggests a run toward $8.20 may come next. These signs keep attention focused on Toncoin as a leading mover right now. HBAR Could Rally as Price Target Stays Strong HBAR is moving quickly, now up 80% since its June low and reaching $0.2285. That’s the highest it’s been since March. The HBAR price target now looks stronger thanks to big jumps in DeFi use. Total value locked went from $151 million to $215 million. Stablecoin supply also rose sharply from $40 million to $151 million. A clear double bottom pattern is forming, with the neckline near $0.2288. This pattern supports the HBAR price target of $0.3327, a possible 45% rise. HBAR has also moved above its 50 and 100-day EMAs, and both RSI and MACD suggest the trend could continue in the near term. Seattle Sports Deals Push BlockDAG Forward as Launch Nears Sports and crypto are coming together in new ways, and BlockDAG is moving fast with headline partnerships. As the Official Blockchain Partner of the Seattle Seawolves, who have won Major League Rugby twice, BlockDAG is offering fans co-branded content, behind-the-scenes access, and NFT-linked fan tokens that bring a new kind of sports connection. BlockDAG has also teamed up with the Seattle Orcas, a rising team in Major League Cricket. This deal gives cricket fans Web3 experiences with player-led digital content, rare collectibles, and tools for blockchain-powered fan access. These partnerships line up with BlockDAG’s current GLOBAL LAUNCH release. The price is set at $0.0016 until August 11, offering early buyers a chance to gain 3,025% based on the confirmed $0.05 launch price. These new sports ties put BlockDAG in a different category compared to other presale cryptos. The project has already raised $340 million and sold more than 23.9 billion coins. This shows that many people are joining the growing BlockDAG community. For those asking about the best crypto to buy today, the mix of sports partnerships, strong traction, and high potential returns makes BlockDAG hard to ignore. What’s Moving in the Market Now The TON price chart shows strength as Toncoin stays above support levels. If the trend keeps up, the token could push toward $8.20 in the near term. At the same time, the HBAR price target is gaining attention. Hedera’s strong DeFi growth and clear technical setup point to a possible 45% rally. Both coins are being tracked closely by traders looking for breakout moves. Still, the talk around the best crypto to buy today leads back to BlockDAG. With $340 million raised, 23.9 billion coins sold, and a limited $0.0016 price tied to a 3,025% gain, its mix of real-world partnerships and Web3 tools puts it in a strong position ahead of the GLOBAL LAUNCH release deadline.

Total XRP CME Futures Volume Has Crossed $1.6 Billion According to data from CME Active Trader , an official X handle of the CME Group focused on trading, the combined XRP and Micro XRP futures volume set a new record on Friday. The CME Group is the largest derivatives marketplace in the world, operating multiple platforms such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The company offers regulated futures and options trading products across a wide range of asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin futures trading was added to the platform back in 2017, with offerings for Ethereum becoming available in 2021. XRP futures finally launched in May of this year. Futures trading is available in two forms for the asset: XRP and Micro XRP. The former features contracts sized at 50,000 tokens each, while the latter offers a smaller size of 2,500 tokens per contract. On the milestone-setting July 11th, more than 9,100 CME futures contracts for the asset were traded, equivalent to over 82 million coins or $235 million. “The record underscores the rapidly growing demand in our new XRP futures suite,” noted CME Active Trader in the X post. Since the launch, total notional traded has amounted to $1.6 billion. The CME Group is widely considered to be the preferred derivatives platform for institutional traders , thanks to its regulated offerings. As such, the spike in the futures trading volume on the exchange can be an indication of rising demand among institutions. Futures trading on CME reflects just one side of the sector. Here’s how the combined futures metrics related to the asset currently look for all platforms, according to Glassnode data: While trading activity related to the token may have jumped high on Friday, the latest trend is that of a decline, as futures volume across exchanges has dropped by more than 40% over the last 24 hours. That said, daily volume still stands at $8.4 billion for the cryptocurrency, which is larger than the other major altcoins save for Solana at $9.1 billion. Bitcoin has the highest volume at $78.6 billion, but its ratio relative to its market cap (0.033) is worse than XRP’s (0.048). Funding rates are positive across the market at the moment, suggesting a degree of long-term dominance. Dogecoin and Tron seem to be receiving the most bullish bets, with the metric sitting at 0.0143% and 0.0121%, respectively. XRP follows the two with a funding rate of 0.0113%. Thus, while trading activity may have plunged during the past day, sentiment around the asset remains positive. Token Price XRP has witnessed a sharp surge of over 24% in the last week, which has brought its price to $2.95.",XRP|XRP CME Futures|XRP futures|XRP Record|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-07-17 05:00:53

The asset had slipped to lows near $116,000 following inflation data. However, BTC has rebounded since, reaching $119,248 earlier today and trading at $119,187 at the time of writing, roughly 3.1% below its all-time high of $123,000 set earlier this week. While broader macroeconomic concerns are shaping price sentiment, new on-chain metrics from the mining sector are drawing attention. A CryptoQuant analyst has watched miner activity closely, as some key indicators suggest that miners may be preparing to sell. This development could influence short-term price action, though the broader outlook for Bitcoin remains largely unchanged, according to the analyst. Bitcoin Miner Behavior Points to Short-Term Pressures CryptoQuant contributor Avocado Onchain highlighted in a recent post that the Miner Position Index (MPI) has jumped to 2.7. This index compares the amount of Bitcoin being moved by miners to exchanges with the historical one-year average. A high MPI reading generally implies increased selling intent, as miners move assets to trading platforms. Avocado noted that the current reading may indicate mild selling pressure, which could contribute to a near-term correction or sideways trading pattern. However, he also emphasized that the current MPI value is still far from the elevated levels typically observed at market cycle peaks. The analyst suggested that this activity may be part of a recurring intra-cycle trend in which brief corrections are followed by further upward movement. He advised that it remains uncertain whether this miner activity marks a one-off event or signals a larger selling wave. Either scenario may affect short-term volatility, but not necessarily the broader trajectory. Network Flows Support the Data Trend In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant contributor Arab Chain examined the implications of increased miner activity. According to their findings, network data reveals a noticeable uptick in miner-related movements, levels last seen in November 2024. Arab Chain explained that while miner activity on the blockchain is rising, this alone doesn’t confirm sales unless Bitcoin is transferred to exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin OG Whale Moves 40,000 BTC To Galaxy, Triggering Market Shock To further validate the outlook, Arab Chain analyzed platform inflow data. They observed a correlation between BTC transfers to exchanges and Bitcoin’s recent climb above $116,000. This movement may indicate that miners view current prices as favorable for selling, possibly to cover operational costs or secure liquidity. The data also hints at miners anticipating a potential correction, which could drive more transfers and further market fluctuations. They concluded that the extent of any correction would largely depend on whether this wave of miner activity persists.

With its low presale price and clear DeFi-first roadmap, many now see Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as one of the most undervalued opportunities in the current market cycle. Avalanche (AVAX) important development Avalanche (AVAX)’s gaming ecosystem officially launched on July 14, 2025, with titles like Off the Grid and Shrapnel leading the charge. Powered by Avalanche (AVAX)’s subnets, the ecosystem offers low-latency, gas-free transactions and NFT-driven player ownership, processing 20M+ daily transactions. The Avalanche9000 upgrade enables customizable Layer-1 blockchains, enhancing scalability and interoperability for games. Partnerships with studios like Gunzilla and GREE, alongside integrations with Xsolla and Loco’s 50M+ user base, drive adoption. AVAX surged 15.75% to $21.53, reflecting market excitement. The ecosystem’s focus on seamless gameplay and Web3 features, like in-game asset marketplaces, positions Avalanche (AVAX) as a gaming blockchain leader. Technicals suggest a $24 target if momentum holds, with 1.4M+ transactions on PulsarGame’s subnet underscoring early success. This launch marks a pivotal step for Avalanche (AVAX) in redefining Web3 gaming with high-performance infrastructure. Real lending, real revenue, real demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just another trend-following altcoin. It’s building a next-generation DeFi protocol designed to support a dual lending model—one that will allow users to participate in Pool-to-Contract (P2C) lending with blue-chip assets and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending with higher-yield, high-volatility tokens like meme coins. Once launched, both systems will operate on non-custodial smart contracts, designed to generate revenue for the protocol and establish real utility behind the MUTM token. In the upcoming P2C model, users will be able to deposit assets like ETH, AVAX, or DAI into decentralized lending pools and earn stable, passive returns. For instance, depositing 5 ETH into a future P2C pool offering a 7.1% APY could potentially yield around $1,065 annually (depending on the ETH price at that time)—all while maintaining exposure to ETH’s price. Borrowers, on the other hand, will use supported crypto assets as overcollateralized collateral, enabling them to access liquidity (e.g., USDT) without needing to sell their holdings. What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart further is its planned mtToken mechanism. These yield-bearing tokens will be minted 1:1 when users deposit crypto into P2C pools. Over time, mtTokens will increase in value as lending interest accrues. Additionally, these tokens will be stakeable in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s smart contracts, where users can earn extra MUTM rewards. These rewards are designed to be powered by protocol revenue through strategic MUTM buybacks, creating a smart-loop system that ties protocol activity directly to token demand. Peer-to-Peer lending without shared risk While many existing platforms lump all borrowers into a single liquidity pool, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending engine that will offer a more personalized and risk-isolated approach. Once live, this feature will allow users to customize loan agreements without exposing their funds to broader market volatility. For example, a future lender could choose to offer 3,000 USDT to a borrower who provides PEPE tokens as collateral. The lender will set the terms—say, 12% interest, a 20-day repayment window, and a 68% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. When both parties agree, the smart contract will execute on-chain, and the loan will remain isolated from any shared liquidity pools. If a deal fails, there will be no contagion—no ripple effect across other users’ funds. This P2P model is being designed to attract risk-tolerant lenders in search of higher returns and borrowers who want greater flexibility than what’s typically available in traditional DeFi protocols. To protect both parties, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to implement a “Stability Factor” that will determine automatic liquidation points. If the value of the collateral falls below a safe threshold, third-party liquidators will step in to liquidate the loan, ensuring that lenders are repaid and the protocol’s stability remains intact. For additional transparency and user confidence, the entire platform has been reviewed through CertiK’s auditing framework, with a Token Scan score of 95.00 and a Skynet score of 77.50. These ratings provide peace of mind for both institutional and retail participants, especially in a market that increasingly values audit reliability. Beta platform, Layer-2 expansion, and presale urgency Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to launch its Beta version, which will mark the beginning of a broader roadmap that includes Layer-2 scaling, a decentralized stablecoin, and full DeFi ecosystem integration. The stablecoin will be minted only when users borrow against overcollateralized crypto assets, and will be burned once the loan is repaid or liquidated. Interest rates will be governed algorithmically by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s system to ensure the $1 peg remains intact, even during volatility. To boost adoption and reward early supporters, the team has also introduced a $100,000 MUTM giveaway , with 10 winners each receiving $10,000 worth of tokens. Combined with growing community engagement and over 12,000 followers on X, momentum around the protocol is accelerating as each presale milestone passes. As Avalanche (AVAX) shifts focus toward blockchain gaming, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as the go-to DeFi protocol for real returns and stable growth. Analysts are already forecasting a price between $0.24 and $0.30 by Q1 2026. And with the token still sitting at $0.03, many investors are already making the shift—swapping hype for utility, and speculation for smart yield. The next AVAX breakout might not come from gaming. It might come from DeFi, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leading the charge.

While Ethereum (ETH) focuses on scalability and Layer-2 expansion, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is matching the pace with real-world DeFi solutions, combining smart lending mechanics, audited protocols, and passive income tools designed to reward both conservative and aggressive investors. From staking rewards driven by platform revenue to lending markets that support everything from ETH to meme coins, Mutuum’s approach is geared for longevity, and now riding a wave of attention that shows no signs of slowing down. Ethereum (ETH) climbs past $3,000 Ethereum (ETH) vaulted past $3,000, hitting $3,052.91 recently, with an 18% weekly gain, fueled by whale accumulation and institutional fervor. Over 2,500 ETH were staked, and $6.1B poured into US spot ETFs, with BlackRock’s ETHA amassing 2M ETH. The Pectra upgrade’s testnet success, enhancing Layer-2 efficiency and slashing fees, has driven DeFi TVL to $64B. A bullish pennant breakout signals a $3,300 target, though RSI at 73 hints at a $2,850 dip risk. ETH’s climb reshuffles altcoin dynamics, funneling capital into DeFi leaders like LINK (+6% to $15.40) and COMP (+5%), as Ethereum (ETH)’s ecosystem thrives. Layer-1 rivals like BNB (+2%) gain modestly, but meme coins like DOGE and SHIB stagnate as investors chase utility. US trade friction may rattle markets, but ETH’s momentum could lift altcoins unless a correction hits. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) With Ethereum (ETH) leading the charge into Layer-2 solutions, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also preparing for scalability. Its roadmap includes Layer-2 integration to lower gas fees and improve throughput, a decentralized stablecoin pegged to $1 and only minted via overcollateralized loans, and the launch of its Beta platform to drive mass adoption. Security is another pillar of Mutuum’s growth. The project has completed a thorough audit with CertiK, receiving a Token Scan score of 95.00 and a Skynet rating of 77.50. These numbers show a clear commitment to transparency and smart contract integrity—especially crucial for any platform handling on-chain lending and collateral management. Investor momentum is further fueled by the $100,000 MUTM giveaway , where ten lucky holders will each receive $10,000 in tokens. This campaign, along with Mutuum’s fast-growing community (12K+ followers on X), has helped make MUTM one of the most talked-about presale tokens in DeFi this month. An analyst who correctly forecasted Ethereum (ETH)’s 2021 rally now expects Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to 10x by mid-2026, with targets set at $0.30. With only a few presale phases remaining and an official listing planned at $0.06, the upside is clear for those who secure an entry before Phase 5 ends. mtTokens, real yield, and the DeFi advantage What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart from trend-driven altcoins is its vision to generate value through real platform activity, not hype. The protocol is being developed around a dual lending structure: Pool-to-Contract (P2C) lending for stable, automated yield on blue-chip tokens like ETH and MATIC, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending for higher-yield, customizable loans on tokens like DOGE and PEPE. For long-term ETH holders, Mutuum is preparing to offer an efficient way to earn passive income without giving up price exposure. After launch, depositing ETH into a P2C pool will allow users to earn a variable APY based on platform utilization and borrower demand. In return, users will receive mtTokens—ERC-20 tokens that automatically accrue interest. These mtTokens will also be stakeable, unlocking MUTM token rewards that come from real protocol revenue and are distributed through smart contract-controlled buyback mechanisms. This model is designed to cycle value directly back to the most active participants. Risk-tolerant investors will be able to leverage the upcoming P2P model to seek higher returns by lending to borrowers who provide niche or volatile tokens as collateral. For instance, a lender could arrange a 20-day loan on 1,500 USDC, accepting PEPE tokens as collateral with 13% interest and a 70% loan-to-value ratio. Unlike pooled lending, these P2P deals will be fully isolated, meaning individual risk doesn’t affect the broader ecosystem—a structure that opens up high-upside potential for those looking to build their own terms. Supporting this flexible lending architecture will be a Stability Factor-based liquidation system, designed to trigger automatic liquidations when borrower collateral falls below safe thresholds. In these cases, third-party liquidators will step in to repay the lender and secure the collateral, keeping the system solvent and reinforcing long-term protocol reliability. As the DeFi market accelerates and Ethereum (ETH) continues its climb, the smart money is rotating into tokens with structure, transparency, and actual revenue models. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the next step forward—and the $0.03 window won’t be open much longer.

On Wednesday, Moynihan said that the bank is working to launch a stablecoin; however, the timeline is unclear. “We feel both the industry and ourselves will have responses. We’ve done a lot of work,” Moynihan told Reuters . He added that investors can expect the lender to move forward with it soon. The second-largest U.S. bank initially touted its dollar-pegged stablecoin launch in February, stressing how regulatory developments could shape its adoption. “It’s pretty clear there’s going to be a stablecoin,” Moynihan confirmed at the time, provided legal frameworks allowed it. BofA Aims to Rollout Stablecoin When Client Demand is High Additionally, CEO Moynihan noted that BofA is trying to understand customer demand in the space, which isn’t high currently. “[The bank] would roll out a stablecoin at an appropriate time, likely in partnership with other players,” he added. Further, the progress has been slower than anticipated by some investors, as banks are still awaiting legal clarity. On Wednesday, Trump announced that 11 of the 12 House representatives have agreed to support the GENIUS ACT bill. The legislation allows for the establishment of a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The move comes after the House voted 196–222 against advancing the bill on Tuesday and temporarily stalling progress on a wider crypto legislative package.

Apart from Citi stablecoin , the bank is also exploring reserve management for stablecoins and developing crypto custody services. “We are looking at the issuance of a Citi stablecoin. This is a good opportunity for us,” said Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup. Besides, Morgan Stanley is following stablecoin developments closely, CFO Sharon Yeshaya noted. She said that the bank is looking into stablecoin use cases and how clients would benefit from it. “But, it really is a little early to tell, especially for the businesses we run versus businesses that you might see from competitors, on how a stablecoin would play in,” she added.

DOGE is now consolidating and might aim for a move above $0.2120. DOGE price started a fresh increase above the $0.1880 and $0.20 levels. The price is trading above the $0.20 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.2060 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start a fresh rally if it clears the $0.2120 and $0.2180 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Eyes More Gains Dogecoin price started a fresh increase from the $0.1880 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE was able to climb above the $0.1950 and $0.200 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above the $0.2120 resistance. Finally, the price traded close to the $0.2220 resistance. A high was formed at $0.2205 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1885 swing low to the $0.2205 high. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.2020 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Besides, there is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.2060 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.2120 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.2150 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.2220 level. A close above the $0.2220 resistance might send the price toward the $0.2320 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.250 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.2650. Downside Correction In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.2120 level, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.2060 level or the trend line zone. The next major support is near the $0.2040 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1885 swing low to the $0.2205 high. The main support sits at $0.20. If there is a downside break below the $0.20 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.1950 level or even $0.1880 in the near term.

It all began in 2017 when the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) introduced a formal regulatory framework for virtual currency exchanges and crypto-to-fiat service providers. This bold move not only legitimized cryptocurrency activity but also laid the groundwork for widespread adoption nationwide. Fast forward to 2025, and the Philippines now ranks 20th globally in crypto wealth—an impressive feat driven by a tech-savvy population, robust remittance flows, and forward-thinking regulation. Here’s how the country’s crypto journey has evolved and what the current landscape looks like.

The Philippine government aspires to become a regional leader in technology with cryptocurrency and blockchain development. Recently, the Philippines Department of Finance expressed its commitment to creating a regulatory framework for crypto assets to combat cross-border tax evasion . Major proactive crypto approaches taken by the government are: Recognizing potential and regulating crypto. The Central Bank of the Philippines (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas- BSP) partnered with the SEC to oversee crypto. Created a framework for Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) to protect citizens from scams.

The Philippines aims to be a regional crypto leader, recognizing and regulating digital assets through the BSP and SEC to combat tax evasion and promote blockchain development. Is crypto taxed in the Philippines, and how? Yes, crypto is taxed. Capital gains are up to 15%, income from mining/staking is standard income tax, and VAT (12%) applies to goods exchanged for crypto. Penalties for non-compliance exist. What are the licensing requirements for crypto companies in the Philippines? CASPs need SEC registration, a minimum ₱100 million capital, physical incorporation in the Philippines, strict AML procedures, and detailed documentation submission before activities. How high is crypto adoption in the Philippines in 2025? The Philippines ranks 20th globally in crypto wealth, with a projected penetration rate of 10.49% in 2025, expected to reach 12.79 million users and ₱1.1 billion in revenue by 2026.",Cryptocurrency Regulation,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-17 05:15:00

Price targets $0.00004676–$0.00005876 next as bullish momentum and market interest continue to grow. BONK Breaks Resistance, Extends Rally Bonk (BONK) rose to $0.000039 at press time, its highest level in several months. The price is up 24% in the past 24 hours and over 75% since this time last week. Daily trading volume has crossed $3 billion, reflecting renewed market activity. Interestingly, the price move followed a clean breakout above a long-term descending trendline and horizontal resistance near $0.00003. The breakout structure remains intact after a successful retest of support, with price now pressing toward the next area of supply around $0.000037. Technical Setup Points to $0.00004676–$0.00005876 Range Crypto analyst Professor Moriarty noted the chart shift earlier in the week. “After several attempts, it finally broke through resistance and held above it,” he posted. $BONK is up 49% since my last post After several attempts, it finally broke through resistance and held above it Now it’s facing the next key zone. If it keeps the bullish momentum and breaks it with confidence, the road to new highs will be wide open https://t.co/P12lJS8aqJ pic.twitter.com/KxoqBZxVe5 — Professor Moriarty (@Moriarty_web3) July 16, 2025 BONK is now approaching a price zone that previously capped upside in late 2024. While clearing this region in volume, the subsequent targets to monitor are at $0.00004676 and $0.00005876. These levels converge with previous swing highs and may act as short-term objectives should the current trend persist. Broader Market Tailwinds Support Move BONK’s breakout comes as broader crypto sentiment improves. Open interest is rising across major exchanges, and risk appetite has returned to the meme coin sector. Notably, the token was recently added to Grayscale’s institutional tracking list, which some market watchers see as a step toward broader legitimacy. For now, BONK trades just below a key resistance band. A near break above 0.000037 would be a sign of continuation. A failure to clear this area may deliver a short-term consolidation or test of support at around the $0.000029 level.

Crypto Regulations in Japan June 25, 2025 – 55th Financial System Council (FSC) Meeting The key discussion was to reclassify certain digital assets under FIEA, especially those with investment-like features. Additionally, tokens are classified in the same category as securities. It introduced mandatory disclosure for token issuers, insider trading, market conduct regulations, and clarity in legal frameworks for crypto ETFs, including spot bitcoin products. March 2025- Proposal for Reformation in Crypto Brokerage and Stabecoin Laws Japanese Cabinet Minister approved a proposal to reform the laws, allowing cryptocurrency companies to operate as an ‘intermediary business.’ The new bill provides flexibility to stablecoin issuers to back their tokens with various types of assets. Crypto brokerage will no longer be subject to financial regulations or anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. Timeline of Major Crypto Regulations in Japan Date Law/ Regulation Key Provisions December 20, 2024 Crypto Tax Reformation Shifting from a progressive rate of 55% to a flat 20% tax June 1, 2023 Crypto Travel Rule Mandatory sender/ receiver info for crypto transfer May 1, 2020 PSA &FIEA Amendments New AML, cybersecurity, and security token regulation June 7, 2019 AML/ Custody Rules Stricter KYC, record keeping, and annual compliance report April 1, 2017 PSA Enforcement Regulating crypto with the Financial Services Agency (FSA) registration 2016 PSA and Fund Settlement Law Amendment Cryptocurrency is recognized as legal tender What is the Japanese Government’s Stance on Cryptocurrency in 2025? Currently, the government is proactively developing its regulatory framework to enhance security and facilitate the crypto market. Key focuses are: Japan’s Finance Minister, Katsunobu Kato, announced that Japan will review crypto tax by the end of June 2025; possibilities of a new tax regime indicated. The Democratic Party’s Web3 Project Team has put forward a proposal for crypto classification under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act ( FIEA ). The government aims to increase the cashless economy to 40% by 2025 with blockchain development . Japan aims to become a crypto leader with a focus on legal registration of crypto exchanges and platforms, market integrity, investor protection, and anti-money laundering. Crypto Tax in Japan 2025 Is crypto taxed in Japan? Yes, cryptocurrency is taxed as ‘miscellaneous income’ with a progressive income tax rate. There is no capital gains tax enacted yet in Japan. What falls under miscellaneous income? Selling crypto for fiat currency Exchange crypto for crypto Buying goods and services with crypto Gifting and payment in crypto Earning staking rewards from liquidity pools Receiving coins from forks Mining, Airdrops, DeFi, and Referral bonus On March 6, Japan proposed a crypto tax cut from a progressive rate of up to 55% to a flat 20% on crypto tax gains. However, the bill has not been passed yet to implement the tax reduction. FSA is expected to review this reclassification; if approved, it will likely take effect from 2026. Tax type Tax rate Note Income tax 5% to 45% Depends on the individual’s total income Additional inhabitant tax 10% Resulting in 15% to 55% tax rate Capital gains tax (CGT) Not specified yet Crypto as a financial product Reclassification of CGT 20% for stock profits Not enacted yet Crypt License in Japan Under the Payment Services Act (PSA), the Financial Services Agency (FSA) is the key body regulating mandatory crypto licenses. How to get a crypto license in Japan? Crypto exchanges and platforms are required to register with the FSA to provide crypto asset exchange services (CAES). Crypto companies need to establish a local entity, typically a Kabushiki Kaisha, a joint stock company. A minimum capital of over 10 million yen is required; other fees depend on the license and business model. A physical office in Japan is mandatory with a Japanese bank account. Experts are required to follow strict AM and CFT regulations. Crypto Adoption in Japan Penetration Rate: Japan has experienced a positive increase in crypto adoption rate, with current penetration projected to be 14.70% in 2025 and is expected to reach even higher, up to 15.26% by 2026. The number of crypto users in Japan is expected to increase up to 18.69 million by 2026. Crypto Revenue: Current revenue in the crypto market is expected to reach US$2.0 billion in 2025, with an anticipated growth rate of 3.44% resulting in a total amount of US$2.0 billion by 2026. Crypto Holdings: It is not publicly known whether the Japanese government holds any crypto assets; rather focuses on increasing the adoption rate with a modern regulatory framework. Conclusion In Japan, the government’s crypto holdings is not publicly known; however, public companies like Metaplanet are known to be one of the biggest crypto holders in Japan. The country has several new proposals in hand that are waiting for review and will likely take effect from 2026. As of 2025, Japan’s regulatory framework has reflected positive results with solid earnings and enhanced protection measures for investors. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

According to the analysis , Binance, OKX, Bybit, and Bitget are the top four exchanges in Q2 2025 in terms of spot and derivatives markets. As Bitcoin skyrocketed in recent days and made history with the value of $122,000, the crypto exchanges’ activity increased. Top Four Cryptocurrency Exchanges in Q2 2025 Binance: Binance held a trading volume share of 35.39%, making a strong position in the global competition. Despite the slight decrease from Q1 2025, which was approximately 36.57%, Binance’s share trading volume remained the largest market during Q2 of the year. OKX: The OKX’s market share increased by 1.08%, marking 14.34% in Q2 2025. The increased percentage suggests that OKX attracted more trading activity, probably due to strong product offerings, deeper liquidity in derivatives, and other promotional activities. Bybit: In Q2 2025, Bybit dipped from 13.06% to 12.26% but still retained its position in the top crypto exchanges for the year. Despite enduring the largest crypto hack of $1.5 billion in February 2025, the exchange replenished its reserves within 72 hours and took decisive measures to reinforce users’ trust. Bitget: Bidet added over 2 million new users in Q2 2025, contributing to a higher platform activity of 11.45%. Driven by its product innovation, such as AI-powered tools, the platform expanded its global reach, marking a slight increase of 0.14% from Q1 2025. What Contributed to the Trading Volume of Crypto Exchanges in Q2 2025? With new laws, clarity in regulations, and high demand for crypto assets, the crypto exchange market reached $21.6 trillion with its top 10 crypto exchanges in Q2 2025. The value of Bitcoin , Ethereum , Solana, and other crypto assets has surged, likely contributing to the trading volume of exchanges. However, despite all contributions, the overall trading volume across the top exchanges declined in Q2. The downfall is likely an outcome of the hesitant retailer participation, slow regulatory progress, geopolitical tensions, and legal uncertainties.",News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING|MARKET|BNB|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-17 05:22:08

ARK also recently offloaded Coinbase shares, along with smaller sales of Robinhood and Block stock. Meanwhile, a look at government Bitcoin holdings reveals that Bulgaria may have missed out on a $25 billion windfall after selling 213,519 BTC that was seized in 2017. Critics say the early sale showed very poor foresight, and contrasts very sharply with countries like the US, China, and the UK, which all hold large Bitcoin reserves. ARK Invest Dumps Bitcoin ETF Shares Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest made its largest share sale of the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) since the fund's mid-June stock split. It offloaded 225,742 ARKB shares from its ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) on Tuesday. The transaction brought in approximately $8.7 million based on ARKB’s closing price of $38.70. Although this marks the biggest single-day ARKB sale by volume, it still trails the firm’s previous record in dollar terms, which is a $12 million sale in April that involved 159,496 shares. This move happened shortly after ARKB completed a 3-for-1 stock split , which effectively tripled the number of shares and reduced the price per share from roughly $90 to around $30. Despite the split, the fund’s market value remained unchanged, and ARKB recently traded near record highs, peaking at $39.3 on July 6. When adjusted for the stock split, that price equates to an all-time high of approximately $117.9 per share. Stock split announcement In addition to reducing its exposure to ARKB, ARK Invest also sold 34,207 shares of Coinbase (COIN) on Tuesday, bringing in $13.3 million. This sale took place after a series of recent profit-taking actions involving Coinbase, including $2 million worth of shares sold last Thursday and another $2 million sold the following day from its ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK). The firm also reduced its holdings in Robinhood and Block last week by selling 58,504 Robinhood shares for $5.6 million and 24,780 Block shares for $1.7 million. ARK's Circle sales on June 23 (Source: ARK Invest) While ARK has been very active in selling off several high-profile holdings, it paused further reductions in its Circle (CRCL) position after divesting 415,844 shares worth about $110 million on June 23. These strategic moves suggest ARK is rebalancing its portfolios and taking advantage of strong market performance in its crypto-related holdings. Selling Bitcoin Early Cost Bulgaria Billions ARK Invest is not alone in its profit taking spree. In 2017, Bulgaria made headlines by seizing 213,519 Bitcoin, which was valued at around $3.5 billion at the time. This was enough to cover a very large portion of the country’s national debt. The government reportedly sold the Bitcoin the next year, but there is still some speculation that it may hold some of the digital assets despite official denials. Today, that same Bitcoin stash would be worth more than $25.24 billion, which is more than Bulgaria’s current public debt of $24 billion, according to World Economics data. Bulgaria Bitcoin holdings (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) While some may see the early liquidation as a missed opportunity, experts offer a more nuanced perspective. Alex Obchakevich , founder of Obchakevich Research, explained that Bitcoin’s volatility made it difficult to treat as a stable reserve asset. He argued that the risks of a sharp decline in value likely outweighed the potential upside at the time. A more balanced strategy, he said, would have involved holding 10–15% of the Bitcoin, slowly liquidating the rest, and using derivatives for hedging. Others, however, were more critical of the government’s move. Robert Znidar , director at Iconomi, attributed the decision to a lack of understanding of Bitcoin’s philosophy and long-term utility. He believes that given today’s increased institutional acceptance of crypto, such a decision would likely not be repeated. Similarly, Bulgarian native and co-CEO of Web3 market maker Enflux, Valentin Mihov , reflected on how governments at the time misunderstood crypto’s strategic potential. He acknowledged that concerns around custody, regulation, and EU fiscal policy played a big role in the decision, but suggested a partial hold would have been a lot wiser. A 10–20% strategic reserve, he said, could have positioned Bulgaria as a forward-thinking leader in sovereign Bitcoin adoption. The situation draws a sharp contrast with other governments, many of which hold large amounts of Bitcoin. According to recent data, countries collectively hold around 463,000 BTC, about 2.3% of the total supply. Governments holding Bitcoin (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) The United States leads with over 198,000 BTC, followed closely by China with 190,000. Other top holders include the United Kingdom with 61,245 BTC, Ukraine with 46,351, and North Korea with 13,562, much of which was reportedly acquired through state-sponsored cyberattacks.

That question haunts every late investor who missed early gems like PEPE or BONK. In a week where XRP futures just set a massive new record on CME with volumes crossing $1.6 billion, institutional confidence is creeping back into crypto. Regulated growth is heating up. Despite this broader market stabilization, two altcoins have been bucking bearish sentiment with sharp moves: Turbo and AI Companions. Turbo has been climbing the charts with meme coin momentum and fresh AI integration, while AI Companions have shown a sharp increase in trading volume and investor attention. However, for those seeking something untouched, raw, and still off the public radar, only one new contender is currently wide open: MoonBull . MoonBull whitelist is officially live, offering early access to one of 2025’s most hyped 100x cryptos. This is a first-come, first-served opportunity – once the list fills, it will be closed for good. Don’t sleep on it. MoonBull Whitelist Is Live and It’s the Only 100x Crypto With First-Mover Advantage MoonBull ($MOBU) is turning heads as the freshest Ethereum meme coin built for true degens. But it’s not just the theme or timing that matters – it’s the whitelist. Currently, only a limited number of spots are available. Those who jump in get the lowest entry price, secret staking rewards, exclusive bonus allocations, and early insight into MoonBull’s roadmap. The MoonBull whitelist isn’t a gimmick. It’s a gate. It offers first access before the crowd floods in. While anyone can eventually enter Stage 1 when it goes public, only whitelisted members receive private launch notifications in advance. That means getting in before the noise, before the price shoots up, and before the masses even know the timer has started. Why the MoonBull Whitelist Might Be Your Final Golden Ticket In crypto, timing isn’t just important – it’s everything. The MoonBull whitelist hands out rare front-row access for a launch that’s strictly first-come, first-served. Once spots fill, that door slams shut. No second chances. No late-night leaks. All updates drop straight to whitelist inboxes before the public even knows what hit them. Getting whitelisted means locking in the rock-bottom price. It means collecting juicy bonus tokens before any listings go live. It means unlocking elite staking rewards that most won’t even hear about. Most of all, it means entering a VIP launch tier where only the earliest, savviest degens are seated. In a market overflowing with noise and delay, Moon Bull cuts straight to business. There’s no fluff. No fake promises. Just an exclusive, early-access opportunity built to reward speed and belief. For anyone who’s missed the last round of 100x cryptos, this might be the last window before the rocket takes off. Turbo Token: Firing on All Cylinders With Meme Energy and AI Fuel Turbo is up 75% this year, 55% in the past month, and another 55% just this week. Earlier today, it surged 35%, blowing through resistance levels and catching the eye of meme coin hunters. Part of that spike came from a massive partnership announcement with PAAL AI. This collab unlocked new in-community tools for Turbo holders, including meme generators, market bots, and AI-based analysis in real-time. What sets Turbo apart is its hybrid nature. It started as a digital art experiment but evolved into a high-utility meme project powered by AI. Traders are drawn not just to the charts, but to the experience Turbo builds. With RSI and MACD flashing green and Fibonacci patterns pointing sky-high, Turbo’s chart is giving technical bulls something to cheer about. Altcoin season rumors are intensifying, and Turbo is well-positioned for continued upward momentum. As BTC floats above $123K and ETH regains strength above $3K, Turbo is soaking in the spillover liquidity. However, it’s essential to note that Turbo has already made several significant moves. It’s an in-progress rocket. Traders seeking the next untapped 100x crypto moonshot may want to shift their attention toward MoonBull. AI Companions: AIC Volume Spikes, But Price Recovery Still Underway AI Companions (AIC) saw its trading volume skyrocket 446% in just 24 hours, reaching $7.3 million. That’s a strong signal of renewed interest. The current price sits at $0.1089, up nearly 195% from its all-time low of $0.03751. However, it’s still nearly 80% down from its all-time high of $0.5446. The market cap of AI Companions hovers at $110 million, ranking it #454 on CoinGecko. This mid-tier placement means there’s still room to grow, but the coin is already well into its maturity curve. AI Companions was built to offer interactive AI agents across DeFi platforms, targeting both developers and community managers. That utility has drawn a loyal user base, and the token has held fairly steady despite dips. Compared to other trending projects, AIC is on the path to recovery. It’s no longer a micro-cap flyer, but it hasn’t yet crossed into blue-chip safety either. While it holds promise for stable gains, those who missed earlier 100x cryptos may not find the insane multiplier potential here. MoonBull, with its live whitelist and untouched market cap, offers that clean-slate entry that speculative investors crave. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, MoonBull stands out as the only true under-the-radar contender among today’s hottest altcoins. While Turbo is already revving its engine and AI Companions is working its way out of the dip, MoonBull is still chilling behind the gate, but that gate’s about to swing wide open. The MoonBull whitelist isn’t just another form – it’s a one-way ticket to get in before the FOMO frenzy kicks off. Every minute counts. The limited whitelist spots are disappearing quickly, and those who secure them now will enter at the floor level before MoonBull gains mainstream attention. With elite staking perks, bonus token drops, and private roadmap insights, this meme coin might just become the biggest 100x crypto of 2025. For traders tired of being late to the party, this is the chance to flip the script. Don’t miss out while others are still sleeping on it. If MoonBull lives up to its early buzz, and all signs say it might, those who got whitelisted will be the ones laughing all the way to the meme bank. Claim your whitelist spot now, before it’s gone. For More Information: Website: https://www.moonbull.io/ Telegram: https://t.me/MoonBullCoin Twitter: https://x.com/MoonBullX FAQs What is MoonBull and why is it trending now? MoonBull is an Ethereum-based meme coin with a live whitelist giving early access to staking rewards, bonus tokens, and secret roadmap info. It’s trending as one of the top 100x cryptos for 2025. How does Turbo compare to MoonBull? Turbo has already surged multiple times, supported by AI integrations. MoonBull, on the other hand, offers a fresh entry with high upside potential as it hasn’t launched yet. Why are AI Companions gaining attention? AI Companions saw a massive spike in trading volume. Its AI tools and utility model are gaining traction again, even though it remains below past highs. How do I get into the MoonBull whitelist? Submit your email via the official MoonBull whitelist form. Approved users will receive early launch notifications and access to exclusive rewards. Are meme coins still worth investing in? Yes, meme coins continue to attract capital due to their community-driven nature, branding strength, and rapid momentum. Projects like MoonBull combine that with real DeFi mechanics.

48391947,https://coinpedia.org/?p=483194,1752730270,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,"Ruvi AI (RUVI) Might Beat Avalanche (AVAX) This Year, Audited And Still Cheap Creates The Perfect Entry For Whales",https://coinpedia.org/press-release/ruvi-ai-ruvi-might-beat-avalanche-avax-this-year/,"The post Ruvi AI (RUVI) Might Beat Avalanche (AVAX) This Year, Audited And Still Cheap Creates The Perfect Entry For Whales appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News When it comes to top-performing blockchain projects, Avalanche (AVAX) has been a dominant force. Recognized for its high-speed transaction capabilities and decentralized application ecosystem, Avalanche has maintained a stronghold in the market. However, analysts are now shifting their focus to Ruvi AI (RUVI) , an audited, utility-driven token with enormous ROI potential and a significantly low cost of entry. With its innovative integration of blockchain and AI, coupled with stellar early-stage achievements, Ruvi AI is positioning itself as a major contender to outperform Avalanche in 2025. Transparency and Security at the Core Ruvi AI has taken significant steps to ensure investor confidence, prioritizing security and transparency from the outset. A third-party audit conducted by CyberScope , a leading blockchain security firm, has validated Ruvi AI’s smart contracts , confirming their scalability and resistance to vulnerabilities. This kind of assurance is critical for investors wary of the risks often associated with emerging cryptocurrencies. Additionally, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange , a globally recognized trading platform. This ensures post-presale liquidity , a vital element for maintaining investor confidence as Ruvi AI transitions to public exchanges. With these pillars of security and transparency firmly in place, Ruvi AI stands out as a reliable option compared to many speculative projects. Presale Milestones That Outshine the Competition Ruvi AI’s remarkable early-stage performance says a lot about its potential. The key achievements so far include: Over $2.3 million raised , reflecting strong market trust in the project. 190 million tokens sold , showcasing impressive adoption. A growing community of 2,300 holders , signaling positive momentum and widespread support. At the current Phase 2 price of $0.015 per token , Ruvi AI offers a highly affordable entry point. By the end of the presale, the token’s price is guaranteed to rise to $0.07 , resulting in an almost 5x ROI before it even reaches public trading. Post-listing, experts predict Ruvi AI could hit $1 per token , delivering an extraordinary 66x ROI for today’s investors. This structured growth trajectory, anchored by tangible milestones, makes Ruvi AI a particularly enticing choice for whales and strategic investors hedging big bets on blockchain technologies. Real-World Use Cases Backed by AI and Blockchain Unlike Avalanche’s focus on decentralized applications, Ruvi AI diversifies its appeal through utility-driven applications . By integrating blockchain technology with artificial intelligence , Ruvi AI aims to revolutionize industries like marketing, entertainment, and finance. Marketing Enhanced by AI Ruvi AI provides cutting-edge marketing tools powered by artificial intelligence. These tools optimize audience targeting, streamline advertising budgets, and maximize campaign ROI. For businesses looking for precise and impactful marketing solutions, Ruvi AI offers a competitive edge. Supporting the Content Creator Economy Content creators globally face significant challenges, from delayed revenue payments to poor audience analytics. Ruvi AI resolves these problems with blockchain-secured instant payouts and AI-based audience analytics , allowing creators to engage their audiences more effectively and boost monetization opportunities. Transforming Financial Transactions Financial systems are plagued with inefficiencies like high international transfer fees and slow transaction times. Ruvi AI addresses these with low-cost, fraud-resistant cross-border payment solutions , streamlining global payments and reducing costs for consumers and enterprises alike. These real-world applications are crucial in creating sustained token demand, ensuring Ruvi AI’s growth is not just hype but underpinned by substantive, widespread value. Amplify Returns with Exclusive VIP Investment Tiers Ruvi AI encourages early investment with VIP tiers that offer significant bonuses. These tiers create lucrative opportunities for investors looking to maximize their ROI. VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These structured investment tiers provide a compelling argument for early whale investors to capitalize on Ruvi AI’s upward momentum at discounted rates. Ruvi AI’s Edge Over Avalanche in 2025 While Avalanche remains a key player in decentralized finance, Ruvi AI’s audited security , early-stage affordability , and utility-focused applications make it a standout choice for investors looking for substantial growth. With a guaranteed 66x ROI potential and its seamless entry into various industries, Ruvi AI is primed to capture significant market share in the months ahead. For investors seeking a project at the intersection of innovation and profit potential , Ruvi AI offers an unparalleled opportunity.

While attention has largely focused on Bitcoin and stablecoin issuers, crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) pointed to XRP as another major token that stands to benefit significantly if the legislation becomes law. In a post on X, SMQKE shared a document excerpt discussing how a regulatory shift, particularly through the GENIUS Act , could affect XRP. The image discusses how a settlement of the legal dispute between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which aligns with the GENIUS Act’s stablecoin framework, may accelerate XRP’s reintegration into U.S. financial markets, while attracting institutional investors and supporting its price. Remember, the GENIUS Act will rapidly accelerate XRP’s reintegration into U.S financial markets which will support its price by attracting institutional investors. Documented. pic.twitter.com/dMsoL8GC8X — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 16, 2025 A Bill Designed to Bring Regulatory Certainty The GENIUS Act, which has already passed in the Senate , proposes a federal framework for stablecoins and seeks to create a clear regulatory environment for digital asset compliance. It is one part of a legislative package that includes the Digital Asset Market Structure Clarity Act and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, all of which passed a key procedural vote following days of internal GOP disagreement. These bills were initially voted down , but have now succeeded by a narrow 217–212 after President Trump intervened directly. He pledged his support in exchange for including provisions from the Anti-CBDC bill in the larger defense authorization package. With this deal in place, the House is now expected to hold final votes on each bill, beginning with the GENIUS Act. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Path to Institutional Adoption The document shared by SMQKE notes that aligning the end of the lawsuit with the provisions of the GENIUS Act could reduce barriers to XRP’s access to U.S. financial infrastructure and restore confidence among large investors. Ripple and the SEC initially chose to settle the legal battle, but the court blocked this move because it sought to modify the final ruling. However, Ripple has chosen to move forward and has dropped its appeal , expecting the SEC to do the same and put an end to years of legal turmoil. This move has cemented XRP’s status, as Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty confirmed that the ruling determining that XRP is not a security remains unchanged . According to SMQKE, this clarity combined with clear rules in the GENIUS Act could “accelerate XRP’s reintegration into U.S financial markets which will support its price by attracting institutional investors.” As lawmakers prepare to take final votes, the implications for XRP may be more immediate than many expected.

This marks the largest single-day inflow in the category’s short but rapidly growing history, pushing total cumulative net inflows to $6.48b. It’s a turning point for Ether ETFs, which initially faced investor hesitation following their approval last year. BlackRock’s ETHA led the pack with a staggering $499.25m in net inflows in one day, bringing its cumulative total to $7.11b. The ETF now holds $7.73b in net assets, with a market share of 1.90% of all Ethereum. Fidelity’s FETH followed with $113.31m in inflows, while Grayscale’s ETHE added $33.04m despite lingering effects from early redemptions. Source: SoSoValue Ethereum Tops $3,200, Outpaces Bitcoin and Solana in Daily Gains The surge came as Ethereum crossed the key $3,200 threshold, rising more than 6.8% on the day to trade near $3,347. It outpaced both Bitcoin and Solana , reflecting growing institutional interest in the asset. Daily volumes soared, and total value traded across ETH spot ETFs reached $2.59 billion. Open interest in ETH futures has also reached a new peak of $45b, up 60% since late June. This surge in derivatives activity points to increased institutional positioning and heightened expectations of further price momentum. ETH Gains Attributed to Staking Yields, Deflation and Long-Term Utility Bitget Wallet CMO Jamie Elkaleh said Ethereum’s current momentum signals more than short-term bullishness. “Ethereum is emerging as the yield-generating infrastructure play,” he said, citing staking yields of 4% to 6% and deflationary supply mechanics post-EIP-1559. “BlackRock’s accumulation of ETH is not just about price upside—it’s a strategic position in what many see as the backbone of future onchain finance,” he added. ETH ETFs are now seen as a bridge between crypto-native strategies and traditional finance. BlackRock’s accumulation, for instance, is widely viewed as a long-term bet on Ethereum’s growing role in powering decentralized finance, NFTs and Web3 infrastructure. Investor Confidence Returns as Redemption Pressure Fades These record inflows are especially notable considering that many ETFs struggled with outflows during their early months, largely due to Grayscale trust redemptions. The July reversal suggests renewed investor confidence, now that redemption-driven selling has waned. Despite the bullish narrative, risks persist. Regulatory ambiguity around whether ETH qualifies as a security continues to hang over the market. Meanwhile, competition from high-speed alternatives like Solana and Layer 2 scaling solutions could splinter Ethereum’s dominance. Still, Ethereum’s appeal lies in its dual identity, as both a yield-bearing financial instrument and the backbone of onchain innovation.

Once passed, this new law will introduce the first official rules for stablecoins in the United States. It will focus on making stablecoins safer, more transparent, and widely accepted in the financial system. USD1 Stablecoin Set to Benefit from GENIUS Act Analyst Dr. Altcoin explained how this could benefit USD1, a stablecoin created by World Liberty Financial. USD1 is backed one-to-one with the US dollar and supported by assets like cash and US Treasuries. It has already been listed on major centralized exchanges , including MEXC, where it is paired with Pi, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies. The GENIUS Act includes strict requirements. It bans unbacked algorithmic stablecoins, demands one-to-one reserve backing, monthly public reserve updates, and yearly audits. It also limits big tech companies from launching their own stablecoins unless they follow all the rules. Additionally, the bill allows for freezing or burning tokens for national security reasons. Pi Network Gains Stability with USD1 Pairing For the Pi Network, this is a great opportunity. The new PI/USD1 trading pair means Pi users now have access to a more stable, regulated, and trustworthy trading environment. This helps with accurate price discovery, better liquidity, and makes Pi more attractive to institutional investors. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Bills Clear Procedural Hurdles in House After Tuesday’s Failure , As USD1 gains popularity and gets listed on more exchanges, Pi Network could see increased attention and use.

With strong support and a growing ecosystem, Pi Network and USD1 may be at the center of the next wave of crypto adoption . Pi Network has dropped 23% over the past month and is now trading at around $0.4399. The price has been moving sideways, staying in the $0.40 to $0.50 range as selling pressure continues to build due to unlocked token supply. For Pi to see a strong upward move, it needs to break above the $0.80 level. Until then, any small bounce from the current zone is likely to face resistance and lead to more price pressure. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Unlike CME, most other issuers are jumping at the chance to bring the speculative tokens closer to investors. For instance, asset managers like VanEck and 21Shares are pushing forward with plans to introduce spot ETPs pegged to meme tokens such as Dogecoin and TRUMP. CME launched crypto derivative products tied to Solana and XRP CME’s global head of cryptocurrency products, Gio Vicioso, remarked, “We’re launching these products based on underlying coins and tokens that have a use case, so I don’t anticipate that we will be doing anything in the meme coin space, as the use case for such products is really not there.” In the last few months, the exchange launched crypto derivative products tied to only major cryptocurrencies, Solana, XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. So far, they are doing well. CME’s Solana Futures started trading on March 17 and have seen close to $5 billion in total trading volume, with daily volumes fluctuating between $75 million and $100 million. Shortly after the launch, even Vicioso claimed the futures had received strong early support, emphasizing the firm’s intent to equip investors with instruments to build cryptocurrency portfolios. The firm’s XRP futures launched in May are also close to reaching $2 billion in cumulative trading, hitting a peak daily volume of $235 million last Friday. The products have only been accessible from Sunday 6 p.m. ET to Friday 5 p.m. ET, pausing daily for one hour of routine maintenance. However, the CME is thinking of giving traders 24/7 access. Vicioso stated that it’s important they bridge the downtime from Friday evening to Sunday evening, given the rising demand from traders. The Nasdaq and NYSE are already making progress in modernizing infrastructure for 24/7 trading, in response to increased activity in crypto and other volatile asset categories. Crypto exchanges were quick to list Trump’s meme coin While the CME distances itself from meme coins, many crypto exchanges have taken a more welcoming stance, some more eagerly than others. According to Reuters, major crypto exchanges were much quicker to list the Trump Coin than other meme coins, despite their pledges to adequately evaluate “risky” tokens before issuing them. Some exchanges approved the asset while the majority of tokens were still held by Trump and his associates—a scenario typically viewed as high risk, since insider sell-offs could crash the price and harm other investors. Just 48 hours after launch, TRUMP had been picked up by eight of the world’s largest crypto exchanges. Coinbase followed by adding the token on its roadmap on January 18, and finally listing it on January 21. Upbit was the last of the top 10 to list it, on February 13. Analysts claim, however, that they listed the token much faster than some of the largest meme coins. The same 10 exchanges, Binance, Gate.io, Bitget, MEXC, OKX, Coinbase, Bybit, Upbit, Crypto.com, and HTX, took an average of 129 days to list the four other top meme coins by market cap as of May 29: Pepe, Bonk, Fartcoin, and dogwifhat. In contrast, it took them four days on average to list $TRUMP. Though exchanges Bitget, MEXC, OKX, Coinbase, and Upbit insist they all went through the proper evaluation procedures before listing the token. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

XRP Price Rallies, Ethereum Price Eyes Major Breakout",https://coinpedia.org/news/altcoin-season-alert-xrp-price-rallies-ethereum-price-eyes-major-breakout/,"The post Altcoin Season ALERT! XRP Price Rallies, Ethereum Price Eyes Major Breakout appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After a quiet June, the crypto market is showing fresh signs of life Altcoin season. Top cryptocurrencies, including SEI, SUI, Ethereum, and XRP Price, are making notable moves. According to analysts, this altcoin rally might be led by solid Layer-1 blockchains , marking a shift away from the memecoin-driven hype. Ethereum Price Breaks Out with Bullish Signals Ethereum price today is leading the altcoin revival, surging 9% to cross $3,330. The breakout above the critical $2,800 resistance level was spotlighted by analyst Michaël van de Poppe , who views it as a strong signal of returning altcoin strength, with Ethereum at the forefront. Currently, ETH is just 9.7% away from breaking out of a massive 4-year-long accumulation triangle, a technical formation that could trigger a parabolic rally. Adding fuel to the bullish momentum, SharpLink Gaming , a publicly traded company, recently purchased 9,424.69 ETH worth $32 million, highlighting growing institutional interest in Ethereum over Bitcoin. Source : CryptosBatman X Post A potential cup-and-handle formation is also appearing on ETH charts, similar to one seen in late 2023 that preceded a 100% price surge. If Ethereum breaks the $3,100 neckline, analyst cryptosBatman expects a rise toward the $3,800 to $4,000 zone. Whales and ETH ETF Shifts Add More Fuel Supporting the bullish case is unusual whale behavior. A major short position with 18x leverage is currently sitting on a $3.5 million loss. If ETH pushes above $3,500, it could trigger a short squeeze liquidation, adding more fuel to the breakout. Meanwhile, institutional attention is growing as Ethereum slowly chips away at Bitcoin’s long-held ETF dominance, attracting serious investor interest. XRP Price Rallies on Legal Hopes and Whale Moves XRP is also seeing renewed momentum, climbing over 7% in the last 24 hours. Analysts say this could be linked to the broader altcoin shift and growing speculation around the final resolution of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC . Although no official ruling has come in yet, investors are hopeful that a settlement or final clarity will open the door for U.S. exchange relistings and institutional adoption. Adding to the optimism, on-chain data shows a spike in large XRP transactions, a sign that whales may be repositioning ahead of a major move. Whales have bought 2.20 billion $XRP in the last two weeks! pic.twitter.com/qpZ2xK7G7J — Ali (@ali_charts) July 16, 2025 BTC Dominance Wanes, Paving the Way for Ethereum and XRP Price Surge Bitcoin’s breakout above $111,000 to $120,000 echoes previous cycles where altcoins followed shortly after. Analysts point to past bull runs, like in 2017 and 2020, where BTC’s gains paved the way for Ethereum and XRP rallies. With BTC dominance showing early signs of decline, history may be repeating as altcoins prepare for their next big move. Overall, if ETH breaks $3,500 resistance level and XRP keeps rising, a bigger rally could follow, but traders should still watch for solid volume and confirmation before going all in. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ethereum price surged over 9% today, breaking above a critical resistance of $2,800. Analysts believe this breakout signals the return of altcoin strength, backed by bullish technical patterns and institutional buying like SharpLink Gaming’s $32 million ETH purchase. Is altcoin season starting in 2025? Analysts say yes. Altcoin season might be beginning as BTC dominance weakens and Layer-1s like Ethereum, SEI, SUI, and XRP show strong price action. A shift from memecoins to utility-driven projects is fueling this rally. Are whales accumulating Ethereum and XRP right now? On-chain data shows large ETH and XRP transactions, suggesting that whales are repositioning ahead of a major move. One ETH short whale is sitting on a $3.5M loss, which could trigger a squeeze. How is Ethereum’s ETF interest growing compared to Bitcoin? Ethereum is slowly chipping away at Bitcoin’s ETF dominance. The growing ETH spot ETF demand highlights increasing institutional interest beyond Bitcoin. What Layer-1 coins are leading the current rally? SEI, SUI, and Ethereum are currently leading the charge among Layer-1 blockchains, shifting attention away from memecoins to scalable, infrastructure-level projects. Why is XRP up today? XRP has jumped more than 7% in the last 24 hours. The surge is likely due to optimism over the potential resolution of Ripple’s lawsuit with the SEC, increased whale transactions, and the overall strength of the altcoin market.",News|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|ETH|ALTCOIN|XRP|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-17 05:53:58
48392987,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=178958,1752731713,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/48392987.jpeg,U.S. Stock Markets Triumph: A Boost for Investor Sentiment and Economic Indicators,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-stock-markets-rise-2/,"BitcoinWorld U.S. Stock Markets Triumph: A Boost for Investor Sentiment and Economic Indicators In a significant development for global finance, the major U.S. Stock Markets concluded trading with notable gains, signaling a wave of optimism that could ripple across various asset classes, including the dynamic world of digital currencies. For those keenly observing the ebb and flow of financial landscapes, understanding the drivers behind these traditional market movements is crucial, as they often provide valuable context for anticipating shifts in Cryptocurrency Trends . Today’s positive close is more than just a number; it’s a barometer of growing confidence that could indirectly fuel broader investment appetite. What Drove the Stellar Market Performance ? The past trading session saw all three major U.S. indices climb, showcasing a robust collective performance. This upward trajectory reflects a complex interplay of factors, from positive corporate earnings reports to promising economic data and shifting expectations regarding monetary policy. When these foundational markets exhibit strength, it often suggests underlying economic stability, which can have a cascading effect on investor confidence across the board. Let’s take a closer look at the numbers: Index Closing Change S&P 500 +0.32% Nasdaq Composite +0.10% Dow Jones Industrial Average +0.53% The Dow Jones Industrial Average, representing 30 large U.S. companies, led the charge, indicating strength in established sectors. The S&P 500, a broader measure of large-cap U.S. equities, also posted solid gains, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite saw a modest but positive increase. This broad-based rally suggests that the positive momentum wasn’t confined to a single sector but was rather a reflection of improving sentiment across the board. How Does This Impact Investor Sentiment ? The closing bell ringing in positive territory for U.S. Stock Markets has a profound effect on Investor Sentiment . When markets are on an upward trend, it fosters a sense of optimism and reduces risk aversion. Investors feel more confident in deploying capital, not just into traditional stocks but potentially into more volatile assets like cryptocurrencies as well. This increased confidence can lead to a ‘risk-on’ environment where market participants are more willing to seek higher returns, even if it means taking on more risk. Key aspects of improved investor sentiment include: Increased Confidence: A rising tide lifts all boats, making investors feel more secure about their portfolios and the broader economy. Reduced Fear: Positive market news can quell anxieties about recessions or economic downturns, encouraging sustained investment. Wealth Effect: As portfolios grow in value, consumers and investors may feel wealthier, potentially leading to increased spending and further investment. This psychological boost is critical because market movements are not just driven by fundamentals but also by the collective mood of investors. A positive feedback loop can form, where rising prices lead to more optimism, which in turn leads to more buying. What Are These Positive Economic Indicators Signaling? The strong showing in U.S. Stock Markets often reflects underlying positive Economic Indicators . These indicators are crucial pieces of data that provide insights into the health and direction of the economy. A buoyant stock market can be a leading indicator of future economic growth, as it anticipates corporate earnings and overall economic prosperity. Some of the economic signals that might be contributing to this positive market performance include: Inflation Data: Signs of cooling inflation can alleviate pressure on central banks to raise interest rates aggressively, making equities more attractive. Employment Figures: Strong job growth and low unemployment rates indicate a healthy consumer base with spending power. Corporate Earnings: Companies reporting better-than-expected profits can boost stock prices and overall market confidence. Consumer Spending: Robust retail sales and consumer confidence surveys suggest a resilient economy. These indicators collectively paint a picture of an economy that is navigating challenges effectively, providing a solid foundation for continued market strength. Understanding these broader economic currents is vital for any investor, including those in the crypto space, as they often set the stage for market-wide movements. How Do Cryptocurrency Trends React to Stock Market Health? While often seen as distinct, the world of Cryptocurrency Trends is increasingly influenced by the performance of traditional financial markets, especially the U.S. Stock Markets . For a long time, Bitcoin and other digital assets were considered uncorrelated or even inversely correlated to traditional assets. However, in recent years, particularly since the pandemic, a stronger correlation has emerged. Here’s how stock market health can influence crypto: Risk-On/Risk-Off Dynamics: When traditional markets are performing well, and investor sentiment is high (a ‘risk-on’ environment), investors may be more inclined to allocate capital to higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a downturn in stocks can trigger a ‘risk-off’ move, leading to outflows from crypto. Liquidity Flows: Positive stock market performance can free up capital or create a perception of wealth, leading some investors to diversify into crypto. Macroeconomic Context: Both stock and crypto markets react to the same overarching macroeconomic factors—inflation, interest rates, geopolitical events, and regulatory changes. It’s not a direct one-to-one relationship, and crypto markets have their own unique drivers (technological advancements, adoption rates, regulatory clarity). However, ignoring the broader financial ecosystem, particularly the health of major stock markets, would be a mistake for any serious crypto investor. The current positive momentum in stocks could provide a supportive backdrop, but crypto’s inherent volatility and unique characteristics mean it will always march to its own beat to some extent. What’s Next for Investors? Actionable Insights The recent positive close in U.S. Stock Markets is certainly welcome news, but it’s important for investors to maintain a balanced perspective. While the current Market Performance suggests strength and positive Investor Sentiment , markets are inherently dynamic and subject to change. Understanding these shifts, and how they relate to broader Economic Indicators , is key to navigating both traditional and digital asset landscapes. For those interested in Cryptocurrency Trends , here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on both traditional market news and specific crypto developments. The interconnectedness is growing. Diversify Wisely: While crypto offers unique opportunities, a diversified portfolio that considers various asset classes can help mitigate risk. Assess Risk Tolerance: Understand that even in a ‘risk-on’ environment, cryptocurrencies remain highly volatile. Invest only what you can afford to lose. Look Beyond the Headlines: Dig into the underlying reasons for market movements. Is it sustainable growth, or a short-term rally? A Resilient Outlook The impressive close for U.S. Stock Markets serves as a powerful reminder of the resilience and dynamic nature of global finance. This positive shift in Market Performance not only bolsters Investor Sentiment but also provides valuable insights into the current state of key Economic Indicators . While the immediate impact on Cryptocurrency Trends may not always be direct, the overall positive economic backdrop can foster an environment conducive to broader investment and growth across all asset classes. As we move forward, a keen understanding of these interconnections will be invaluable for navigating the complexities of the financial world.

This effort follows Tuesday’s failed attempt to advance the proposed legislation to a floor debate during the “Crypto week.” Related Reading: SUI Eyes 140% Move As Price Reclaims $4 – New ATH Imminent? US House Passes Motion To Reconsider On Wednesday, the US House of Representatives voted on a motion to reconsider three major crypto legislations that failed to pass their procedural vote on Tuesday. As reported by NewsBTC, Congress’s lower chamber blocked the motion in a 196-223 vote, with 13 Republicans siding with the Democrats. Following the failed vote, Lawmakers had reportedly planned to hold a vote to reconsider the motion for later in the day, but it was ultimately scheduled for Wednesday morning. On Tuesday night, US President Donald Trump personally met with 11 of the 12 Republican representatives needed to pass the bills, securing their support. The lawmakers met for the second time this week to decide the fate of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act of 2025, and the anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) bill. The motion to reconsider the trio of bills cleared the House in a 215-211 vote, with all Republican representatives voting in favor this time. Now, the US House prepares to hold a new procedural vote later today and decide whether to send the three landmark bills to a final vote. Representative Andy Harris shared on X that “House Freedom Caucus Members will be voting in favor of the rule today after reaching an agreement with President Trump last night.” Under the agreement, the House Committee on Rules will meet today to include “clear, strong, anti–Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) provisions to the CLARITY legislation” to ensure Americans are “protected from government overreach into their financial privacy.” Crypto Legislation Faces New Challenges Despite the crucial approval of a motion to reconsider, the bills now face a new roadblock. Politico reporter Meredith Lee Hill revealed that “there’s another crypto mess unfolding on the House floor.” In a series of X posts, the journalist affirmed that the potential merger of two of the three crypto legislations could pose a problem for the upcoming vote. Seemingly, the House Grand Old Party (GOP) leaders are trying to combine the House’s market structure and anti-CBDC bills after passing the floor. However, Republicans from the House Financial Services Committee are hesitating at that plan, as it “will doom Clarity.” House Agriculture Committee Republican representatives also consider that combining the two bills could kill the CLARITY Act, arguing that “even the threat of doing this emergency rules meeting may have already done so.” Journalist Eleanor Terret added that combining the bills could make CLARITY harder to pass because “they risk losing Dem votes over the anti-CBDC language.” A GOP Senate staffer reportedly told Terret that they are “just hoping the House can move something, anything, so crypto legislation can survive to the next step. We have options to move forward, but no one wants another failed vote that kills momentum.” Related Reading: Top Crypto Exchanges Made $172 Million From TRUMP Memecoin Listing – Report Meanwhile, the GENIUS Act would remain a standalone bill, despite previous attempts to merge it with the market structure bill. Since it already passed the Senate, the bill only needs to pass the final House vote to head to President Trump’s desk. Despite the legislative uncertainty, the crypto market continues to recover from yesterday’s drop, with Bitcoin (BTC) holding the $119,000 area as support.

According to Wedson, although prominent traders have begun to slightly reduce their short-term positions, strong confidence in the market remains. Wedson highlighted data on the “Leading Trader Long/Short Ratio,” examining the trading direction of the 20% with the highest margin balances. This ratio has recently declined slightly from 2.1. This suggests that some high-level investors are taking profits or mitigating risk following Bitcoin's recent surge. Related News: BREAKING: The Obstacles Blocking Cryptocurrency Bills in the US Have Finally Been Overcome However, the ratio is still hovering above 2.5 on the daily chart, suggesting that large-capital traders are mostly holding long positions. The analyst noted that many “whales,” particularly in Ethereum and other altcoins, have increased their long positions, adding that some investors are closing their Bitcoin positions and moving towards altcoins. This shift is creating high market volatility and numerous “traps” throughout the day. Wedson also placed special emphasis on Polkadot (DOT): “DOT is poised to exit its accumulation phase soon.

This impressive movement underscores the growing strength and resilience of the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization. According to Bitcoin World Market Monitoring, ETH has reached a unit price of $3,400, with specific data from the Binance USDT market showing it trading at an even higher $3,410.90. This remarkable performance has captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, prompting questions about the factors fueling this ascent and what it means for the broader cryptocurrency market . What’s Driving the Latest ETH Price Surge? The recent jump in ETH price is not an isolated event but rather the culmination of several contributing factors. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone looking to make sense of the current market dynamics. Here are some key elements at play: Network Upgrades and Developments: Ongoing enhancements to the Ethereum network, such as the upcoming Dencun upgrade and the continuous improvements towards scalability and efficiency, instill confidence among investors. These upgrades promise lower transaction fees and faster processing times, making the network more attractive for users and developers. Growing Institutional Interest: More traditional financial institutions are exploring and adopting Ethereum-based solutions. This increased institutional engagement brings significant capital and legitimacy to the ecosystem, pushing prices higher. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Expansion: Ethereum remains the backbone of the DeFi ecosystem. The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols continues to grow, driving demand for ETH as the primary asset for gas fees and collateral within these applications. NFT Market Resurgence: While not at their peak, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) continue to find niche markets and new applications, many of which are built on Ethereum. Renewed interest in digital collectibles and art contributes to network activity and ETH demand. Broader Market Sentiment: A general bullish sentiment across the entire cryptocurrency market , often led by Bitcoin’s performance, tends to positively influence altcoins like Ethereum. When Bitcoin shows strength, other major cryptocurrencies typically follow suit. Understanding the Ethereum Ecosystem’s Impact Beyond its price, Ethereum stands as a foundational technology in the digital economy. It’s not merely a digital currency but a decentralized platform that enables smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). This utility is what truly differentiates Ethereum and provides long-term value. The ecosystem supports a vast array of innovations, from lending platforms and stablecoins to gaming and supply chain management. This broad utility creates continuous demand for ETH, as it is required to pay for transactions and computations on the network. Consider the versatility of Ethereum compared to other digital assets: Feature Ethereum (ETH) Bitcoin (BTC) Primary Function Smart contracts, dApps, digital currency Digital gold, store of value Network Fees (Gas) Paid in ETH Paid in BTC Ecosystem DeFi, NFTs, Gaming, Enterprise Solutions Payment network, Lightning Network Consensus Mechanism (post-Merge) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Proof-of-Work (PoW) This table highlights how Ethereum’s design as a programmable blockchain gives it a unique position and significant influence over the future of decentralized technology. Navigating the Volatile Cryptocurrency Market While the recent surge in ETH price is exciting, it’s important to remember that the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile. Prices can fluctuate dramatically in short periods, influenced by global economic news, regulatory developments, technological breakthroughs, and even social media sentiment. How can investors navigate these unpredictable waters? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based on hype alone. Understand the technology, the project’s fundamentals, and its long-term potential. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio to spread risk across different assets. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory changes, and project developments. Reliable sources like Bitcoin World Market Monitoring can provide timely updates. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide if you are investing for the long haul (HODLing) or looking for short-term trading opportunities. Each strategy requires a different approach to risk and capital management. Understanding these principles is crucial for anyone participating in the dynamic world of digital assets. Is This the Start of a Major ETH Rally ? The question on many investors’ minds is whether this current momentum signifies the beginning of a sustained ETH rally . While no one can predict the future with certainty, several indicators suggest positive sentiment for Ethereum. Analysts often look at trading volumes, support and resistance levels, and broader market trends to gauge potential future movements. The consistent development on the Ethereum network, coupled with increasing adoption by businesses and individuals, builds a strong case for its long-term value proposition. However, potential challenges remain, including regulatory uncertainties and competition from other layer-1 blockchains. A true rally would likely involve sustained trading volumes, continued institutional inflows, and a clear path forward for network scalability and adoption. Investors should watch for these signs to assess the longevity of the current upward trend. Actionable Insights for Crypto Trading For those engaged in crypto trading , the current market conditions present both opportunities and risks. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Set Clear Goals: Before entering any trade, define your profit targets and stop-loss levels. This helps manage risk and prevents emotional decision-making. Utilize Exchange Tools: Platforms like Binance offer various tools, including limit orders, stop-loss orders, and trailing stops, which can help automate your trading strategy and protect your capital. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps mitigate the impact of market volatility by averaging out your purchase price over time. Stay Updated on News: Major announcements, partnerships, or regulatory changes can significantly impact price. Being informed allows you to react promptly. Beware of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): Chasing pumps can lead to poor decisions. Always stick to your research and strategy, rather than succumbing to market hype.

Key Takeaways: B2C2 plans to raise up to $200 million, allowing SBI Holdings to reduce its 90% stake. SBI Holdings has driven B2C2’s global growth, expanding its presence across London, the U.S., and Japan. B2C2 has acquired Paris-based Woorton and registered as a VASP in Luxembourg. Part of the funding will enable SBI Holdings to reduce its majority stake in the company. SBI Financial Services, a subsidiary of SBI Holdings, acquired its 90% ownership in B2C2 in December 2020, following an initial $30 million investment earlier that year. SBI Holdings Drives B2C2’s Global Expansion Under FCA Regulation SBI Holdings has played a key role in the growth of B2C2, which has expanded its presence with offices across London, the U.S., and Japan, and operates under FCA regulation. In its full-year financial results published in May , SBI credited the revitalization of the crypto market following the inauguration of former President Trump as a significant factor driving B2C2’s expansion. Earlier reports suggested SBI was contemplating selling part of its stake in B2C2 in a deal valued around $100 million, though the company denied those claims at the time. The planned capital raise underscores B2C2’s ambitions to strengthen its market position amid an increasingly competitive crypto landscape. London-based crypto market maker B2C2 is looking to raise up to $200 million, partly to allow SBI Holdings to reduce its 90% stake. SBI first invested in B2C2 in July 2020 and took a 90% stake that December. https://t.co/7X03uQH7Jq — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 17, 2025 In February last year, B2C2 secured a virtual asset service provider (VASP) registration , expanding its operations to Luxembourg ahead of new rules being implemented in Europe. At the time, the firm stated that it had officially become the twelfth VASP to be registered on the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier’s (CSSF) public register in Luxembourg. B2C2 operates across the Americas, Asia-Pacific and EMEA regions. In 2023, the market maker acquired Paris-based rival firm Woorton in a bid to expand its European presence. Crypto Venture Capital Surges in Q2 2025 Venture capital investment in the crypto sector rebounded strongly in Q2 2025, with companies raising a total of $10.03 billion, the highest quarterly figure since Q1 2022. June was the standout month, pulling in $5.14 billion, signaling renewed investor appetite after months of stagnation. Top fundraises included Strive Funds’ $750 million raise in May, focused on Bitcoin-related strategies, and TwentyOneCapital’s $585 million in April. Other notable companies securing capital were Securitize, Kalshi, Auradine, ZenMEV, and Digital Asset, highlighting growing interest across diverse crypto projects. Coinbase Ventures dominated investment activity with 25 deals in Q2, followed by Pantera Capital, Animoca Brands, Andreessen Horowitz, and Galaxy. Dealmaking was widespread across blockchain infrastructure and DeFi sectors, while categories like CeFi, NFTs, and GameFi saw moderate funding. Seed-stage deals made up the largest portion of fundraising rounds, indicating strong early-stage interest, followed by strategic rounds and mergers and acquisitions. Series A and incubation rounds accounted for smaller shares, reflecting a diverse funding landscape as the crypto ecosystem continues to mature.

On the trade front, Trump said he would send a single letter to over 150 countries, outlining the tariff rates they would face and describing most as “not big countries” with limited U.S. trade ties. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) hovered around $118,000 on Thursday, moving sideways after retreating from record highs earlier in the week, as investors weighed developments on key cryptocurrency regulation bills. Gold prices fell to around $3,340 per ounce on Thursday, giving back gains from the previous session. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.22% to 39,439, while the broader Topix Index fell 0.1% to 2,816 during Thursday morning trading, as traders remained cautious after US President Trump reiterated his intention to impose a 25% tariff on Japan. The Japanese yen fell to around 148 per dollar on Thursday, as investors reacted to disappointing trade figures that fueled concerns about a potential technical recession. Japan's trade surplus significantly narrowed to JPY 153.1 billion in June 2025, a substantial drop from JPY 221.3 billion a year prior and well under the forecasted JPY 353.9 billion. Exports fell for the second consecutive month, declining 0.5% year-on-year to JPY 9,162.6 billion. Conversely, imports edged up 0.2% to JPY 9,009.5 billion, defying predictions for a 1.6% drop and marking their first increase in three months. Investors are now turning their attention to the upcoming Upper House election on July 20, amid growing speculation that the government may unveil new fiscal stimulus measures.

China’s cabinet on Wednesday pledged to contain ""irrational"" competition in the electric vehicle sector, vowing stronger cost investigations and price monitoring, according to state broadcaster CCTV. Trump has softened his stance on China to secure a summit with Xi Jinping and a trade deal, shifting focus from tough rhetoric to quick purchase agreements amid ongoing trade concerns. Investors now await the People’s Bank of China’s latest loan prime rate decision later this week, with expectations for no change. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 0.14% were little changed in Thursday morning trade, after ending slightly lower in the prior session.

Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.77% to above 8,595 on Thursday, reversing losses from the previous session, supported by a positive lead from Wall Street overnight. The Australian dollar weakened to below $0.650 on Thursday, pulling back gains from the previous session, as weaker-than-expected labor data reinforced expectations of an RBA rate cut in August. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that the unemployment rate rose to an over three-year high of 4.3% in June, ending its five-month hold and exceeding forecasts of 4.1%, while employment increased by just 2K, well below the expected 20K gain. Consumer inflation expectations in Australia eased to 4.7% in July 2025 from June’s two-year peak of 5.0%, suggesting a more balanced outlook for inflation risks amid continued labor market strength. In the U.S., on Wednesday, all three major indexes ended in green after President Trump stated he wasn’t planning to dismiss Fed Chair Jerome Powell, easing concerns stirred by earlier reports that he was considering taking action. U.S. stock futures declined notably on Thursday despite overnight Wall Street gains, as sentiment wavered after President Trump’s assurance that he has no plans to remove Fed Chair Powell: Dow -0.16% ; S&P 500 -0.13% ; Nasdaq -0.10% .

While blockchain technology offers transparency, it also exposes financial activities to an unprecedented degree. This is where innovations like Privacy Pools step in, offering a crucial layer of confidentiality. The crypto community is buzzing with the news that Privacy Pools, the innovative on-chain privacy solution, is now officially supporting Sky’s USDS stablecoin. This development marks a significant stride towards enhancing financial privacy in the decentralized ecosystem, especially for those utilizing stablecoins. Privacy Pools: Pioneering On-Chain Privacy, What Is It? At its core, Privacy Pools is designed to bring much-needed anonymity to blockchain transactions. Think of it as a digital mixing service, but with a crucial distinction: it leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to allow users to prove they own funds without revealing the specific source of those funds. This technology is a game-changer for on-chain privacy , enabling users to break the traceable link between their deposited and withdrawn funds. The project has garnered considerable attention, not least because it is backed by none other than Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin , whose endorsement signals the project’s technical robustness and ethical alignment with core blockchain principles. The mechanism works by allowing users to deposit funds into a common ‘pool.’ When they withdraw, the system uses ZKPs to verify that the withdrawn funds correspond to a legitimate deposit, without revealing which specific deposit it was. This creates an anonymity set, making it incredibly difficult to trace transactions back to their origin. For individuals and entities alike, this means: Enhanced Fungibility: Every unit of a cryptocurrency becomes indistinguishable from another, just like physical cash. Protection Against Surveillance: It helps prevent unwanted tracking of spending habits or financial associations. Increased Security: By obscuring transaction patterns, it adds a layer of security against targeted attacks. The Strategic Move: Integrating USDS Stablecoin The integration of Sky’s USDS stablecoin into Privacy Pools is a monumental step. Stablecoins, designed to maintain a stable value, are the backbone of many decentralized finance (DeFi) activities. They are used for trading, lending, borrowing, and payments, making their transaction histories particularly sensitive. Until now, stablecoin transactions on public blockchains have been entirely transparent, revealing balances, spending patterns, and even who interacts with whom. This level of transparency, while inherent to blockchain, poses significant privacy risks for users. By bringing USDS into the Privacy Pools ecosystem, users can now conduct transactions with this stablecoin with a much higher degree of privacy. This means: Private Payments: Businesses and individuals can make and receive payments without revealing their entire transaction history. Confidential DeFi Engagements: Participation in lending protocols, liquidity provision, or yield farming can be done with greater anonymity. Reduced Data Leakage: Protects users from having their financial activities scrutinized by third parties, whether for marketing, regulatory, or malicious purposes. This move is not just about one stablecoin; it sets a precedent for how other stablecoins might integrate privacy features, fundamentally changing the landscape of private digital transactions. What Does This Mean for Cryptocurrency Privacy as a Whole? The support for USDS by Privacy Pools is a significant indicator of the growing demand and technological feasibility for enhanced cryptocurrency privacy across the board. For too long, the trade-off between blockchain transparency and user privacy has been a contentious issue. Solutions like Privacy Pools are bridging this gap, demonstrating that it is possible to maintain the integrity and verifiability of blockchain while offering users the confidentiality they desire. This development sends a strong signal to the broader crypto industry: privacy is no longer a niche concern but a fundamental requirement for mainstream adoption. As more assets become compatible with privacy-enhancing protocols, the entire ecosystem benefits from increased fungibility and reduced vulnerability to financial surveillance. It empowers users with greater control over their financial data, aligning with the core ethos of decentralization and individual sovereignty. Vitalik Buterin’s Vision: The Backing Behind Privacy Innovation The involvement and endorsement of Vitalik Buterin cannot be overstated. As a co-founder of Ethereum and a leading voice in the blockchain space, Buterin has consistently advocated for privacy as a critical component for the long-term success and ethical development of decentralized systems. His support for Privacy Pools underscores the project’s legitimacy and its alignment with the foundational principles of a truly decentralized and user-centric internet. Buterin’s insights often shape the direction of the blockchain industry, and his emphasis on privacy highlights its importance for preventing censorship, ensuring economic freedom, and fostering a more equitable digital future. His backing provides a powerful stamp of approval, attracting talent, resources, and further attention to the critical work being done by Privacy Pools. It’s a clear signal that privacy solutions are not just theoretical concepts but practical necessities for the evolving digital economy. Addressing Challenges and Looking Ahead: The Future of Private Digital Transactions While the integration of USDS is a major win, the path to widespread on-chain privacy is not without its challenges. Regulatory scrutiny remains a significant hurdle, as governments worldwide grapple with how to balance privacy with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) concerns. Projects like Privacy Pools must navigate these complex legal landscapes, ensuring compliance while still delivering robust privacy features. However, the project’s stated plans to expand into multi-asset Privacy Pools indicate a clear vision for the future. This expansion would allow a broader range of cryptocurrencies and tokens to benefit from the same privacy guarantees currently extended to USDS. Imagine a future where any digital asset can be transacted with a strong layer of confidentiality, making the entire blockchain ecosystem more resilient and user-friendly. This forward-looking approach suggests a commitment to making privacy a default feature, rather than an add-on, for digital assets. For users, this development means exploring options for more private stablecoin transactions. It’s an invitation to engage with protocols that prioritize user confidentiality and contribute to a more private digital economy. Conclusion: A New Era for Private Digital Assets The integration of Sky’s USDS stablecoin into Privacy Pools represents a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency privacy . Backed by the visionary Vitalik Buterin , this move not only enhances the utility of USDS but also sets a powerful precedent for the entire stablecoin market and the broader quest for on-chain privacy . As Privacy Pools continues its expansion into multi-asset support, we are witnessing the dawn of a new era where financial confidentiality on the blockchain becomes more accessible and robust. This development is a testament to the ongoing innovation within the crypto space, continually striving to balance transparency with the fundamental human right to privacy.
