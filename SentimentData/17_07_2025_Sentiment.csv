On July 15, crypto exchange Bitget executed a massive burn of 30 million BGB tokens, an event that sent ripples of optimism through the market. This substantial token destruction, valued at approximately $130 million, was reported by LookOnChain via X, highlighting Bitget’s ongoing commitment to its native token. What Does the Bitget BGB Burn Mean for Investors? The news of the 30 million Bitget BGB burn on July 15 is more than just a headline; it’s a clear signal of strategic intent from one of the leading global crypto exchanges. For investors, a token burn fundamentally aims to reduce the total supply of a cryptocurrency, thereby increasing its scarcity. In theory, reduced supply, coupled with consistent or increasing demand, can lead to an appreciation in the token’s value. The BGB token, currently trading at $4.67 and showing a healthy 3.8% increase over 24 hours post-announcement, certainly reflects this positive market sentiment. This isn’t an isolated incident for Bitget. Over the past eight months, the exchange has systematically burned an astounding 860 million BGB tokens. This consistent, long-term strategy underscores Bitget’s dedication to creating a deflationary mechanism for BGB, potentially benefiting long-term holders. Such actions are often interpreted by the market as a strong vote of confidence from the exchange itself in its token’s future. Why do exchanges burn tokens? Deflationary Pressure: Reducing supply can make the remaining tokens more valuable. Value Appreciation: Scarcity can drive up demand and price. Commitment & Trust: Demonstrates the exchange’s dedication to the token’s ecosystem and its community. Profit Sharing: Often, a portion of exchange profits is used to buy back and burn tokens, aligning the exchange’s success with token holders. Understanding the BGB Token’s Role in the Bitget Ecosystem The BGB token is not merely a digital asset; it is the utility token powering the entire Bitget ecosystem. Launched to enhance the user experience and provide significant benefits within the exchange, BGB plays a pivotal role in Bitget’s growth strategy. Holders of BGB gain access to a multitude of perks, making it an attractive asset for active traders and long-term investors on the platform. Let’s delve into some of the core utilities that make the BGB token indispensable within Bitget: Utility Feature Description Benefit to Holder Trading Fee Discounts Use BGB to pay for spot and futures trading fees. Significant cost savings on transactions. Launchpad Access Participate in exclusive token sales on Bitget Launchpad. Early access to promising new projects. Launchpool & Earn Stake BGB to earn new tokens or high APY on existing assets. Passive income generation and asset growth. Voting Rights Participate in community governance for new listings and proposals. Influence over the platform’s future direction. Futures Copy Trading Benefits Access exclusive features and higher profit sharing ratios for traders. Enhanced profitability and unique trading tools. Withdrawal Fee Discounts Enjoy reduced fees when withdrawing assets from the platform. Lower operational costs. These utilities create a strong demand for BGB, as users seek to maximize their benefits on the Bitget platform. The token burn mechanism further strengthens this demand by reducing supply, creating a virtuous cycle that supports the token’s value proposition. Exploring the Crypto Exchange Bitget’s Growth and Strategy Bitget has rapidly ascended the ranks to become a formidable player in the global cryptocurrency landscape. As a comprehensive crypto exchange Bitget offers a wide array of services, including spot trading, futures trading, copy trading, and an innovative launchpad. Its commitment to user-centric features, robust security measures, and continuous innovation has attracted millions of users worldwide. The exchange’s strategic approach is multifaceted, focusing on expanding its product offerings, enhancing liquidity, and fostering a vibrant community. The consistent token burn strategy for BGB is a testament to this long-term vision. It’s not just about reducing supply; it’s about signaling confidence in the platform’s future earnings and its ability to sustain such deflationary measures. This approach is similar to traditional stock buybacks, where companies repurchase their shares to reduce outstanding stock and boost shareholder value. Bitget’s proactive stance in the market, including its aggressive marketing campaigns and partnerships, further solidifies its position. The token burns are an integral part of this broader strategy, aiming to create a sustainable and attractive investment for its users and the wider crypto community. The Impact of Strategic Token Burn on Value and Trust The concept of a token burn is a powerful tool in the crypto economy, designed to create scarcity and, by extension, enhance value. When an exchange like Bitget removes a significant amount of its native tokens from circulation, it directly impacts the supply-demand dynamics. With fewer tokens available, each remaining token theoretically becomes more valuable, assuming demand remains constant or increases. Beyond the direct economic impact, token burns also play a crucial psychological role. They demonstrate a strong commitment from the project team to the long-term health and prosperity of their token. This builds trust among investors, assuring them that the team is not simply focused on short-term gains but is invested in creating sustainable value. For Bitget, the repeated and substantial BGB burns, totaling 860 million over eight months, are a clear indication of their dedication to the BGB token’s future. Challenges and Considerations: Market Volatility: While burns can boost value, the broader crypto market remains volatile, and external factors can still influence price. Sustainable Burn Mechanisms: The long-term impact depends on the sustainability of the burn mechanism, often linked to exchange profitability. Transparency: Transparent reporting of burns (like LookOnChain’s report) is crucial for maintaining investor confidence. Ultimately, a strategic token burn is a statement of intent, a powerful mechanism that, when executed consistently and transparently, can significantly contribute to a token’s perceived and actual value. Navigating the Bitget Ecosystem: Future Prospects and Actionable Insights The continuous development and strategic moves within the Bitget ecosystem paint a promising picture for the future of the BGB token. Bitget is not resting on its laurels; it consistently introduces new features, expands its global reach, and invests in technological advancements to enhance its platform. These efforts, combined with the robust token burn strategy, position BGB for potential long-term growth. For individuals looking to engage with the Bitget platform or invest in BGB, here are some actionable insights: Research Thoroughly: Understand the BGB token’s utilities and Bitget’s roadmap. Knowledge is power in the crypto space. Consider BGB’s Utilities: If you’re an active trader on Bitget, holding BGB can significantly reduce your costs and unlock exclusive features. Monitor Burn Events: Keep an eye on future token burn announcements as they can often precede positive price movements. Diversify Your Portfolio: While BGB shows promise, always maintain a diversified investment portfolio to mitigate risks. Stay Informed: Follow official Bitget channels and reputable crypto news sources for the latest updates on the exchange and the BGB token. The future of BGB is intrinsically linked to the success and expansion of the Bitget exchange. As Bitget continues to innovate and attract more users, the demand for BGB and its utility will likely grow, potentially reinforcing the positive impact of its token burn strategy. Conclusion: Bitget’s Bold Commitment to BGB Value The recent 30 million BGB token burn on July 15, following a pattern of 860 million BGB burned over the past eight months, clearly demonstrates Bitget’s unwavering commitment to enhancing the value and utility of its native token. This strategic token burn is a powerful signal to the market, showcasing the exchange’s dedication to creating a deflationary asset and fostering long-term trust within its community. As the BGB token continues to serve as the backbone of the thriving Bitget ecosystem, providing a wide array of benefits to its holders, its future looks increasingly bright. Investors and users alike will undoubtedly be watching closely as Bitget continues to execute its vision for a robust and valuable digital asset.

Recently, a significant development emerged from Washington D.C. that has caught the attention of investors, innovators, and enthusiasts alike: House Republicans crypto initiative has taken a crucial step forward. This procedural vote signals a potential turning point for US crypto regulation , paving the way for more structured governance in the digital asset space. Let’s dive into what this means for the future of finance and technology. A Pivotal Moment for US Crypto Regulation: What Just Happened? In a move that has sent ripples through the digital asset community, U.S. House Republicans successfully passed a procedural motion. This isn’t just a minor bureaucratic hurdle; it’s a critical legislative maneuver that allows two specific crypto bills to advance further through the complex congressional process. As reported by Infinity Hedge via Telegram, this action indicates a growing momentum within the legislative branch to address the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. You might be wondering, what exactly is a ‘procedural motion’? In simple terms, it’s a vote that dictates the rules for how a bill will be debated and voted on in the future. It’s like setting the agenda for a crucial meeting. For the cryptocurrency industry, this means: Faster Pace: The bills can now move more quickly through committee and potentially to a full House vote. Increased Focus: It brings specific legislative proposals regarding digital assets into sharper focus for lawmakers and the public. Bipartisan Potential: While initiated by Republicans, advancing bills often requires some level of bipartisan engagement to ultimately become law. This development is a clear indicator that lawmakers are increasingly recognizing the importance of establishing a robust framework for US crypto regulation , moving beyond mere discussions to tangible legislative action. What Does Advancing Digital Asset Legislation Really Mean for the Market? The advancement of these bills represents a significant stride in the ongoing effort to define and regulate the cryptocurrency landscape. When we talk about digital asset legislation , we’re discussing laws that could impact everything from how cryptocurrencies are classified (e.g., as securities or commodities) to how stablecoins are issued and regulated, and even consumer protection measures for crypto investors. The absence of clear rules has long been cited as a major barrier to mainstream adoption and institutional investment in the U.S. This procedural step, while not a final vote on the bills themselves, signifies that Congress is serious about providing that much-needed clarity. It could lead to: Aspect Potential Impact of Legislation Investor Confidence Increased protection and reduced risk perception, potentially attracting more traditional investors. Innovation & Growth Clear rules could foster a more predictable environment for blockchain startups and existing crypto businesses. Market Stability Specific rules for stablecoins and other assets could reduce volatility and systemic risk. Global Competitiveness Positions the U.S. as a leader in the digital economy, rather than falling behind other nations with clearer frameworks. The specifics of the two bills are crucial, but the general direction suggests an attempt to create a more defined and potentially more secure environment for digital assets within the existing financial system. Decoding the Path Ahead for Crypto Bills: What are the Hurdles? While the advancement of these crypto bills is a positive sign, it’s important to remember that the legislative journey is long and complex. A procedural motion is just one step in a multi-stage process. The next significant hurdles include: Committee Review: The bills will undergo detailed scrutiny and potential amendments in relevant House committees. Full House Vote: If they pass committee, they will then be put to a vote by the entire House of Representatives. Success here is not guaranteed, as bipartisan support will be critical. Senate Consideration: Even if passed by the House, the bills must then go through a similar process in the Senate, where they may face different priorities and amendments. Presidential Assent: Finally, for any bill to become law, it must be signed by the President. Each of these stages presents opportunities for the bills to be altered, delayed, or even rejected. The political climate, differing views between parties, and lobbying efforts from various stakeholders will all play a role in shaping their ultimate fate. This is where the intricacies of US crypto regulation truly come into play, as various agencies and lawmakers weigh in on how best to approach this innovative, yet often disruptive, technology. The Impact on Blockchain Policy and Innovation: A Double-Edged Sword? The move by House Republicans crypto supporters to advance these bills has profound implications for broader blockchain policy and the future of technological innovation in the U.S. On one hand, clear regulatory frameworks can provide the certainty that businesses need to invest heavily in blockchain technology, knowing the rules of the game. This can spur innovation, attract talent, and lead to the development of new applications beyond just cryptocurrencies, such as supply chain management, digital identity, and more efficient financial services. However, there’s also a delicate balance to strike. Overly restrictive or poorly designed legislation could stifle innovation, pushing companies and talent to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions. The challenge for lawmakers is to craft legislation that protects consumers and ensures financial stability without stifling the very innovation that makes blockchain technology so promising. Key considerations for the future of blockchain policy include: Regulatory Clarity: Defining what constitutes a security, commodity, or currency in the digital realm. Consumer Protection: Safeguarding investors from fraud and market manipulation. Financial Stability: Addressing potential systemic risks posed by large-scale digital asset adoption, particularly stablecoins. Taxation: Clarifying how digital assets are taxed. Interoperability: Ensuring that U.S. regulations can work effectively with international standards. The outcome of these legislative efforts will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of blockchain development in the United States for years to come. House Republicans Crypto Initiative: A Step Towards Clarity? The recent procedural vote underscores the increasing bipartisan, though primarily Republican-led, push for clear crypto legislation. Many House Republicans crypto advocates argue that the current regulatory landscape is fragmented and uncertain, hindering America’s competitiveness in the global digital economy. They believe that providing a clear legal framework will not only protect investors but also encourage innovation and prevent businesses from moving offshore. While the specific content of the bills is still under review and subject to change, the overarching goal appears to be to establish a more coherent regulatory environment. This includes efforts to clarify the roles of various regulatory bodies, such as the SEC and CFTC, in overseeing different types of digital assets. For the industry, this could mean an end to the ‘regulation by enforcement’ approach that has often characterized U.S. oversight of crypto. What This Means for You: Actionable Insights For anyone involved in or interested in the crypto space, this legislative advancement has several implications: Stay Informed: Follow the progress of these bills closely. Understanding the nuances of emerging digital asset legislation will be crucial for making informed decisions. Engage & Advocate: If you’re part of the crypto industry, consider engaging with industry associations and advocacy groups that are working to shape these policies. Your voice can make a difference. Prepare for Change: Businesses operating in the crypto space should begin to assess how potential new regulations might impact their operations, compliance requirements, and business models. Evaluate Your Portfolio: Investors should consider how regulatory clarity (or continued uncertainty) might affect the long-term prospects of various digital assets. The Unfolding Saga of US Crypto Regulation The recent procedural motion by U.S. House Republicans marks a significant, albeit early, step in the journey towards comprehensive US crypto regulation . The advancement of these crypto bills reflects a growing recognition within Congress of the need for clear rules governing digital assets. While the path ahead is fraught with legislative hurdles and political debates, this development offers a hopeful sign for those seeking clarity and stability in the rapidly evolving world of blockchain and cryptocurrency. The coming months will be critical in determining whether these efforts lead to a transformative era of innovation and investor protection, or if the challenges prove too great to overcome. The digital asset community will be watching closely.

How Much Is In The Country’s Bitcoin Reserve Really? The saga began when Bitcoin Magazine Chairman David Bailey offered a $10,000 bounty to the journalist who could uncover the exact amount of Bitcoin currently held by the U.S. government in a July 16 X post.

Bullish.” Senator Cynthia Lummis Speaks Out Amid Crypto Concerns U.S. President Donald Trump formally launched the country’s Bitcoin Reserve and U.S. Digital Assets Stockpile back in a March 2025 executive order . “This move harnesses the power of digital assets for national prosperity, rather than letting them languish in limbo,” the executive order states. Just a few minutes ago, President Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it… — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 7, 2025 At the time, White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks estimated that the U.S. government held around 200,000 Bitcoin, although no formal audit on the cryptocurrency had been completed. Following the news, crypto-friendly Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) openly expressed her shock over the claims. “I’m alarmed by reports that the U.S. has sold off over 80% of its Bitcoin reserves—leaving just ~29,000 coins,” Lummis wrote. “If true, this is a total strategic blunder and sets the United States back years in the Bitcoin race.” The White House has yet to publicly comment on the matter.

Imagine waking up to news that a major player has offloaded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of a leading digital asset. This isn’t just a hypothetical scenario; it’s precisely what transpired, leading to considerable discussion and analysis among investors and market watchers alike. This substantial Trend Research ETH sale has undeniably captured the attention of the entire crypto community, prompting questions about its implications for market stability and future price action. Decoding the Massive Ethereum (ETH) Offload: What Exactly Happened? In a move that underscores the dynamic nature of the crypto market , Trend Research executed a series of large-scale transactions involving Ethereum (ETH). According to on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, which reported the activity on X (formerly Twitter), the firm divested a staggering 69,946 ETH over the past 24 hours. This massive sell-off translated to approximately $218.3 million at the time of the transactions. The sale wasn’t a single event but included a notable recent transaction of 21,000 ETH, valued at roughly $67 million. Such large-volume movements by a single entity are often referred to as “whale activity” due to their potential to influence market dynamics. Despite this significant divestment, Trend Research still retains a substantial portion of its digital assets , holding onto 115,187 ETH, which is currently valued at an impressive $376.35 million. This indicates that while they’ve taken considerable profits or rebalanced their portfolio, they remain a significant holder of Ethereum. To put these figures into perspective, let’s look at the breakdown: Transaction Detail Ethereum (ETH) Amount USD Value (Approx.) Total ETH Sold (Past 24 hours) 69,946 ETH $218.3 Million Recent Single Sale 21,000 ETH $67 Million Remaining ETH Holdings 115,187 ETH $376.35 Million Why Did a Crypto Whale Like Trend Research Make This Move? The motivations behind such a significant sale by a major entity like Trend Research are often multi-faceted and can range from strategic portfolio rebalancing to a shift in market outlook. While the exact reasons remain speculative without direct confirmation from the firm, several possibilities come to mind when observing such a substantial crypto whale move: Profit Taking: Ethereum has seen significant price appreciation over various periods. Selling a portion of holdings could simply be a classic profit-taking strategy, cashing in on gains to secure returns for investors or internal operations. Portfolio Rebalancing: Large firms often manage diverse portfolios. A sale of ETH might indicate a reallocation of capital into other digital assets, traditional investments, or even into operational liquidity for new ventures. Market Outlook: While not necessarily a bearish signal, a large sale could suggest a cautious short-to-medium term outlook on Ethereum’s price trajectory. It might be a hedge against potential volatility or a belief that other assets offer better immediate growth prospects. Operational Needs: Like any large entity, Trend Research might have significant operational expenses, investment commitments, or upcoming projects that require substantial capital, for which liquidating a portion of their digital assets would be a practical solution. Understanding these potential drivers is crucial for interpreting the broader implications of such sales on market sentiment . What is the Impact on Ethereum (ETH) and Broader Market Sentiment? The immediate effect of a large sale like this is often a ripple of concern or speculation throughout the market. When a major holder sells, it increases the supply on exchanges, which can put downward pressure on prices in the short term. However, the market’s reaction also depends on overall liquidity and demand. If there are enough buyers to absorb the sell pressure, the impact might be minimal or quickly absorbed. Key impacts include: Price Volatility: Large sales can trigger short-term price dips, especially if the market is already sensitive or lacking strong buying interest. Traders might react by selling, exacerbating the downward trend. Investor Confidence: Such moves can sometimes dent investor confidence, leading to questions about the asset’s future performance or whether other large holders might follow suit. This directly influences market sentiment . Liquidity Test: These large sales act as a test of the market’s liquidity. The fact that $218 million worth of ETH was sold indicates the deep liquidity of the Ethereum market, which is a positive sign for its maturity. Focus on On-Chain Data: Events like the Trend Research ETH sale highlight the increasing importance of on-chain analytics. Platforms like Lookonchain provide transparency into whale movements, allowing investors to make more informed decisions. Despite the sale, the fact that Trend Research still holds over $376 million in ETH suggests a long-term conviction in the asset, even if they are actively managing their exposure. This remaining significant holding can somewhat mitigate the negative perception of the sale. Navigating the Waters: Actionable Insights for Your Digital Asset Strategy For individual investors and those interested in the crypto market , understanding these large institutional movements offers valuable insights. While it’s tempting to panic or mimic whale actions, a more nuanced approach is often beneficial. Here are some actionable insights: Don’t Blindly Follow: Large entities have different risk appetites, investment horizons, and financial obligations than individual investors. Their reasons for selling might not align with your personal financial goals. Monitor On-Chain Data, But Interpret Wisely: Tools that track crypto whale activity are valuable for understanding market flows. However, always combine this data with fundamental analysis of the asset (e.g., Ethereum’s network upgrades, adoption, dApp ecosystem) and broader macroeconomic factors. Focus on Long-Term Fundamentals: For assets like Ethereum (ETH) , sustained growth often comes from technological advancements, network utility, and increasing adoption. Short-term whale movements, while impactful, might not derail a strong long-term thesis. Manage Risk: Ensure your portfolio is diversified and that you’re not overexposed to any single asset. Use stop-loss orders or take profits incrementally to protect your capital from sudden market shifts. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of news, analysis, and on-chain metrics. Knowledge is your best defense against impulsive decisions driven by market FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) or FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). This event serves as a powerful reminder that the digital asset management landscape is constantly evolving, requiring vigilance and strategic thinking from all participants. The Future of Trend Research’s Digital Assets: What Comes Next? With a remaining holding of over $376 million in Ethereum (ETH), Trend Research clearly maintains a substantial stake in the asset. This suggests that their recent sale might be more of a strategic maneuver rather than a complete exit from their digital assets position. Future movements from this entity will continue to be closely watched by the market. Possible scenarios include: Further Sales: Depending on market conditions and their internal strategies, they might continue to gradually reduce their ETH holdings. Re-Accumulation: Conversely, if they believe the market has bottomed or a new bullish trend is emerging, they might start re-accumulating ETH at lower prices. Long-Term Hold: Their remaining large sum could simply be a long-term strategic investment, with no immediate plans for further significant sales. The actions of such a significant crypto whale like Trend Research offer a fascinating case study in institutional behavior within the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Their decisions, while individual, contribute to the collective narrative and dynamics of the crypto market . Conclusion: The Enduring Significance of Whale Movements in the Crypto Market The recent Trend Research ETH sale of over $218 million serves as a powerful illustration of the immense capital flows that characterize the modern digital asset management landscape. While the sheer volume of Ethereum (ETH) involved is noteworthy, it’s the ripple effect on market sentiment and the broader implications for the crypto market that truly capture attention.

As the original crypto continues to chart a course to new price highs, demand for projects across the entire market concurrently increases. That’s why leading altcoins and the best meme coins —including TRON, Sui Network, Solana, Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin—have also recorded new peaks in recent months, bolstering the belief that both market segments retain strong upside potential. With optimism building ahead of the next anticipated bull cycle, investors are focusing on select altcoins that could surpass their historical price ceilings. Ripple (XRP): Leading Cross-Border Payments Crypto Shows Massive Price Potential Ripple’s XRP token continues to cement its role as a bridge between conventional banking systems and blockchain-powered remittance solutions. Thanks to its near-instant global transfers at extremely low fees, XRP has attracted strong institutional attention, even earning recognition from the United Nations as a viable platform for sending funds worldwide without third-party intermediaries. After a prolonged legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple scored a decisive court victory in 2023, with the judge ruling that retail sales of XRP were not securities transactions. The SEC formally ended the case in 2025, concluding a lengthy four-year dispute. This legal resolution reinforced XRP’s position within the industry, establishing an important regulatory precedent for the broader altcoin space. As a result, investor confidence soared, pushing XRP’s price up by an impressive 439% in one year, far exceeding Bitcoin’s 87% gains during the same period. Currently encountering resistance around the $3 mark, XRP is poised to potentially break through, solidifying its reputation as one of the most resilient billion-dollar market cap altcoins. However, should markets take an adverse turn, or a sell-off ensue, XRP could lose some of its recent gains, but it will likely find strong support at $2, enabling an easy rebound once the market flips bullish. Earlier this year, technical charts revealed a bullish flag pattern, indicating a possible surge towards $3.50 this summer, surpassing its prior all-time high of $3.40 recorded in January 2018. Solana ($SOL): Can This “Ethereum Killer” Set a New Record Before Fall? Solana ($SOL) has firmly established itself in decentralised finance, delivering lightning-fast transaction speeds, minimal fees, and powerful smart contract capabilities. Its market capitalisation has surpassed $89.5 billion, while the chain itself has over $9.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama. Speculation is mounting over potential approval of a spot ETF for Solana, akin to the green light recently granted to Bitcoin and Ethereum, which could attract substantial institutional inflows and solidify Solana’s status as a legitimate Ethereum competitor. Adding to its momentum, former U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of integrating Solana into a proposed U.S. Crypto Reserve, suggesting the government could hold confiscated Solana coins seized in law enforcement actions. Price-wise, Solana rebounded from an April low of $100 after peaking at $250 in February and is now trading around $153. With its RSI climbing from 63, further gains may be on the horizon as the bullish momentum remains. While geopolitical risks have constrained its short-term growth, this period of consolidation is reinforcing $SOL’s market foundation. Resistance levels are set at $200 and $250, but a decisive breakout could drive Solana past its all-time high of $293.31, potentially reaching around $300 by fall. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme Coin Powerhouse Eyes New Peaks Pepe ($PEPE) has rapidly ascended the meme coin ranks in its two years of existence, establishing itself among the top three thanks to strong cultural relevance and market performance. Based on Matt Furie’s legendary frog character, $PEPE has yielded extraordinary returns for early backers and now boasts a market cap above $5.4 billion. Launched in April 2023, Pepe spurred the emergence of numerous imitator tokens, though none have replicated its traction. Its popularity surged even further when Elon Musk briefly switched his X (formerly Twitter) profile picture to a Pepe-themed image. Currently valued near $0.00001286, $PEPE has climbed 7.4% in the last 24 hours and 26% over the past week, although it remains around 54% below its peak of $0.00002803 set in late 2024. In Q1 this year, a falling wedge pattern forms across Pepe’s lines of support and resistance—a formation typically signalling an impending upward breakout. With its RSI now at 68, bullish momentum remains strong, though it is approaching 70, where assets tend to become overbought, usually pre-empting selloffs. If macroeconomic and geopolitical stability persists, Pepe could embark on another major rally before the close of summer. Snorter ($SNORT): Low-Price Entry to a Promising New Crypto Spotting emerging crypto projects before mainstream adoption often yields the highest returns. While established altcoins continue to dominate, upcoming tokens are unlocking novel opportunities for growth. One such contender is Snorter ($SNORT) , a hybrid meme token and advanced trading bot built on Solana, with cross-chain expansion planned for the future. Integrated directly into Telegram, Snorter delivers live market analytics within chat groups. Charging fees as low as 0.85%, Snorter offers a competitive edge over rivals like BonkBot, Maestro, and Trojan. Its comprehensive toolkit features MEV-protected swaps, copy trading capabilities, rug pull prevention, and limit order sniping, positioning it as a full-suite trading platform. Investor enthusiasm has surged, with the presale raising more than $1.9 million to date. Its staking programme offers up to 203% APY, rewarding early supporters generously. Investors can buy it now via the official website at the fixed low price of $0.0983, although this rises fractionally throughout the course of the presale, with the next leg expected in under 24 hours. Whether you’re an experienced trader or exploring meme coins for the first time, Snorter seeks to provide a seamless platform to navigate today’s fast-paced crypto landscape.

On Monday, Bitcoin set a new record, reaching $122,838 and marking its highest price ever. Analysts note further upward movement could follow if this momentum sustains, potentially ushering in widespread global adoption. This powerful rally has sparked intense optimism among crypto investors, with speculation rising that an even stronger bull market than the famed 2021 run could be forming, pushing numerous major altcoins to uncharted valuation levels. Outlined below are cryptocurrencies that ChatGPT predicts will have significant near-term growth prospects. XRP (Ripple): ChatGPT Predicts This Cross-Border Payment Giant Could Easily Double ChatGPT’s analysis indicates that Ripple’s XRP could hit $20 by late 2025, reflecting a near sevenfold surge from its current price of around $2.96. This bullish forecast stems from increasing institutional integration, clearer regulatory frameworks, and speculation around a potential XRP spot ETF, which could unlock large-scale retail and institutional investments. Furthermore, XRP maintains strong recognition as a fast, affordable, and compliant option for global payments. In 2024, the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) praised XRP for enabling instant cross-border transfers without traditional intermediaries. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! UN Endorses @Ripple and @StellarOrg as Cornerstones of New Global Payments Network! #XRP and #XLM will run the new financial system! pic.twitter.com/ufewexCKmR — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 13, 2024 A landmark ruling in 2023 determined that XRP’s retail sales did not qualify as securities transactions, weakening the SEC’s long-held stance on XRP and the wider crypto industry beyond Bitcoin that they were trading as unlicensed securities. In March, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the official conclusion of the prolonged legal dispute, removing a major barrier and lifting investor sentiment for XRP and the broader altcoin market. Looking forward, XRP faces key resistance at $3. Should it convincingly surpass this threshold, ChatGPT’s more conservative target of $10 by year-end appears attainable. However, a catalyst is needed to achieve the ambitious $20 milestone. This will depend on regulatory progress in the U.S., where the industry have long asked lawmakers for clarity. The perception of Trump prior to his reassuming the presidency was that he’s the “crypto president” but he has yet to deliver on essential substance. Additionally, political stability across regions like the Middle East is spooking investors. XRP has been among the top-performing major cryptocurrencies, rising 429% in the past year, compared to Bitcoin’s 87% increase. Dogecoin ($DOGE): The Original Meme Coin Set for a Strong Rebound Dogecoin ($DOGE) , the original meme token, continues to maintain a solid market cap of roughly $30.2 billion. Initially created in 2013 as a parody, it has evolved into a legitimate digital asset with wide usage and a loyal international community. Frequently mirroring Bitcoin’s movements, Dogecoin combines meme-driven volatility with notable staying power. At present, DOGE is trading near $0.201 after rising 3% on the day and 16% on the week. Its RSI stands at 65 and is trending upwards, indicating growing buying interest as Bitcoin’s rally continues. Technical indicators show a pronounced falling wedge pattern from November to April, indicating strong potential for an imminent upward breakout. ChatGPT predicts DOGE could reach $1.50 during an extended bullish phase, equating to a potential 7.5X gain. On the adoption front, Dogecoin continues to receive endorsements from major corporations and celebrities alike. Tesla accepts DOGE for select merchandise, while platforms like Revolut and PayPal have integrated it as a payment method, enhancing its mainstream utility. Shiba Inu (SHIB): ChatGPT AI Predicts 7x Gains by Year-End Shiba Inu (SHIB) , launched in August 2020, has emerged as the second biggest meme coin and a serious high-utility contender to Dogecoin with a market value exceeding $8.1 billion. Currently priced at $0.00001384, SHIB has risen 4.3% over the last 24 hours and 14.1% in the past week. It is now approaching a breakout from two significant technical patterns: a descending wedge between November and March, and a bullish flag identified in mid-May. The next key resistance lies at $0.000022, with potential to climb towards $0.00003. Should this momentum persist, OpenAI’s ChatGP forecasts SHIB could hit $0.0001 before year-end – representing a more than sevenfold rise from current prices. This outlook is supported by SHIB’s evolution into a utility-focused ecosystem. Built on Ethereum, SHIB has improved scalability with its Layer-2 network, Shibarium, enabling quicker transactions, lower fees, expanded dApp integration, and enhanced privacy features. TOKEN6900: Could This New Meme Coin Deliver 1000x Returns? While ChatGPT predicts some dazzling returns on well-established altcoins this year, the vast market caps of the projects above often limit their explosive growth potential. For traders pursuing dramatic returns, lesser-known meme coins may offer sharper upside. One such project is TOKEN6900 (T6900) , an ERC-20 meme token that launched its presale just a week ago. Hey Siri, define aura pic.twitter.com/NVYT1pZmed — Token6900 (@Token_6900) July 8, 2025 So far, TOKEN6900 has raised over $585,215 from early backers, signalling strong investor enthusiasm and prospects for a powerful launch rally. Unlike many meme coins that attempt to pivot towards utility, TOKEN6900 embraces its identity as a purely hype-driven asset, leveraging irony, aggressive marketing, and FOMO to fuel growth. Its website boldly proclaims: “It’s Not Built On Fundamentals. It’s Built On Delusion, Irony, And The Collective Hallucination Of Terminally Online Traders.” Inspired by SPX6900, a meme token celebrating absurdist dot-com aesthetics, TOKEN6900 has a total supply of 930,993,091 tokens – exactly one more than SPX6900’s, emphasising its competitive branding approach. This strategy appears effective, as shown by its presale performance. Although it lacks inherent utility, TOKEN6900 offers staking options for additional yield alongside speculative price gains. Interested buyers can purchase T6900 on its official website at a current presale price of $0.0066. With the next price increase scheduled within 48 hours, those seeking the lowest entry point may wish to act quickly.

Per the state-run news agency TASS , the Duma has adopted a law on the “gradual introduction” of the digital ruble, beginning next year. Digital Ruble Bill Passes Duma Lawmakers voted in favor of the bill in its second and third readings. The bill will now pass to the Russian upper house, the Federation Council, for approval. The State Duma building in Moscow, Russia. (Source: State Duma/Facebook) The bill will then pass on to President Vladimir Putin, who will officially sign the bill into law. These two steps are mere formalities, however, with the law slated to come into force on September 1, 2026. This is the Central Bank’s new date for a nationwide rollout, following its last-gasp decision to postpone its summer 2025 CBDC launch plans. The law was spearheaded by a group of lawmakers and senators. The group was headed by Anatoly Aksakov, the Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets. Aksakov is the chief architect of all of Russia’s crypto and CBDC legislation passed to date. The draft law effectively enshrines the Central Bank’s CBDC timeline for banks and other financial providers into law. From September 1, 2026, all firms with an annual revenue of 120 million rubles ($1.5 million) or above must provide their customers with access to digital ruble services. Medium-sized firms (those with revenues of up to 30 million rubles or $383,000) will have an extra year to comply. Smaller firms and financial industry startups, meanwhile, will have to comply by September 1, 2028. The rules will also apply to foreign banks and firms that have branches in Russia. Several Chinese banks and a handful of European and American banks continue to operate in Russia. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned that Brazil, China and India will face secondary sanctions from the US if Russia doesn’t negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine https://t.co/fhhSFOOlin — Bloomberg (@business) July 15, 2025 QR Code Clauses The bill also mandates the use of digital ruble QR codes in payments for goods and services. The law will allow individuals to pay companies or individual traders CBDC tokens for goods and services using app-based QR codes. Many vendors will also be obliged to allow their customers to pay in digital RUB if requested. This, too, will involve a gradual rollout. Bigger companies will be obliged to provide CBDC payment options from the outset. But some smaller firms will be allowed to opt out of the system altogether. The bill also addresses lingering questions about the feasibility of rolling out the digital ruble in parts of the country that have poor mobile network coverage and internet access. In many rural areas, coverage remains spotty. While China’s digital yuan pilot has seen the People’s Bank of China and its partners resolve such problems with hard or offline CBDC wallets , the Russian Central Bank is yet to reveal details of any such trial. As such, the bill dictates that vendors without internet access or mobile network coverage will not be obliged to accept digital ruble payments. Vendors with annual revenue under 5 million rubles ($63,900) per year will also be exempted. China said that there are no winners in a trade war after US President Trump threatened to hit buyers of Russian exports with sanctions unless Russia agrees to a peace deal in 50 days.

In its first stage, 600 citizens and 22 firms from 11 cities began using the CBDC. These companies ranged from major banks to small beauty salons . The Moscow Metro has also begun trialing CBDC payments. However, commercial banks have repeatedly questioned the need for a Russian CBDC. The latest challenge has come from German Gref, the head of the megabank Sberbank. German Gref, the head of Sberbank. (Source: Duma.gov.ru [CC BY 4.0]) Earlier this month, Gref said he could not see how the digital ruble could lead to a large-scale transformation of the Russian economy. CNews quoted Gref as saying: “I don’t understand why an individual needs the option to use a CBDC. And neither do banks. And businesses, too. I still don’t really understand why this is necessary.” However, Gref did suggest that there was a “possible future” for the digital ruble in cross-border settlements, provided overseas trading partners wanted to use it. The Central Bank claims that the CBDC will allow citizens and companies to make faster, more transparent, and more secure transactions. The Ministry of Finance, meanwhile, says it wants to use the CBDC to issue benefits and pay government contracts. It claims that this will help eliminate benefits fraud and corruption.

48376310,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74561,1752708613,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s One Costly Mistake XRP Holders Must Avoid In This Bull Run,https://timestabloid.com/heres-one-costly-mistake-xrp-holders-must-avoid-in-this-bull-run/,"As XRP continues to show signs of a potential long-term rally, experienced investors and analysts are urging caution and strategy. Following a recent price spike above the $3 mark, its first in five months, industry experts warn that many investors risk repeating costly errors from previous bull markets. The recent upswing in XRP’s price follows a series of bullish catalysts, including the launch of futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the resolution of Ripple’s legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and expanding institutional involvement in digital assets. Although XRP has pulled back slightly to around $2.95 , analysts believe the momentum could be far from over. In a recent episode of the Good Morning Crypto podcast, host Abdullah “Abs” Nassif emphasized that the market is only entering the early stages of its next growth cycle. He highlighted increasing support from traditional finance institutions and the expected rise in capital inflows through tokenized assets and stablecoins as significant indicators of what lies ahead. Long-Term Strategy: Avoid Premature Selling One recurring warning shared by podcast guests is the temptation to exit too soon. A featured crypto educator advised holders to avoid selling at the first sign of a price surge. Instead, he recommended that investors consider leveraging their assets or placing them in secure cold wallets and trusts. According to him, short-term selling often results in tokens returning to the control of institutional investors, those best positioned to hold long-term. He further noted that long-term holding can play a role in larger systemic shifts, encouraging individuals to act with foresight rather than react to temporary price movements. Co-host Johnny Crypto added weight to the discussion by recalling a personal experience from the late 1990s. Having sold his Amazon stock prematurely, he missed out on what would have been approximately $52 million in gains. This time, he said, he plans to retain a substantial portion of his XRP holdings regardless of future price activity. Rather than selling entirely, he is exploring financial strategies such as borrowing against the asset or placing it in a trust to maintain long-term exposure. The Case for XRP’s Continued Growth The panel pointed to several structural trends that could contribute to a substantial rise in XRP’s value over the medium to long term. One key factor is the anticipated approval of more than ten XRP-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by October 2025, which could increase accessibility and investor participation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, the stablecoin market is expected to expand significantly, from its current valuation of around $200 billion to approximately $3.7 trillion. Another critical projection comes from Citibank, which estimates that tokenized real-world assets will exceed $19 trillion in value by 2030. Collectively, these developments could channel large-scale capital inflows into the digital asset ecosystem, benefiting XRP’s market position. These trends suggest that over $23 trillion could eventually enter the digital asset space, potentially benefiting XRP and other top-tier cryptocurrencies. Legal Clarity May Spark Next Surge Further developments in the Ripple vs. SEC case may act as an additional growth trigger. Ripple has already announced its willingness to end ongoing appeals . With a confidential SEC meeting scheduled for July 17, some commentators believe an official settlement announcement is likely, which could increase investor confidence and drive another wave of market interest. According to Nassif, the next major technical breakout for XRP could occur once the token consistently closes above $3.25. He maintains that targets in the $10 range are plausible within the next bull cycle. His key message to investors is clear: avoid acting out of short-term excitement and instead position yourself for long-term advantage. The central advice from experts is to remain patient, avoid panic selling, and explore strategic ways to maintain exposure to XRP.

48376314,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=178900,1752708633,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/48376314.jpeg,El Salvador Bitcoin: Unleashing New Horizons in Digital Asset Policy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/el-salvador-bitcoin-talks/,"BitcoinWorld El Salvador Bitcoin: Unleashing New Horizons in Digital Asset Policy The world of digital assets is constantly evolving, with nations increasingly exploring the transformative potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. A recent, highly significant development has sent ripples through the global crypto community: a meeting between El Salvador’s visionary President, Nayib Bukele, and Pakistan’s State Minister for Blockchain and Crypto, Bilal Bin Saqib. This high-level dialogue signals a growing international interest in leveraging digital currencies for national development and hints at a future where El Salvador Bitcoin initiatives could inspire wider adoption. The Historic Meeting: What Does It Mean for Pakistan Crypto? The encounter, reported by Watcher Guru via X, brought together two key figures from nations with vastly different approaches to the digital asset space. President Bukele, globally recognized for making Bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador, met with Minister Saqib, who represents Pakistan’s efforts to explore blockchain and crypto within its economy. This meeting is more than a mere handshake; it represents a burgeoning interest from emerging economies in understanding and potentially adopting innovative financial technologies. For Pakistan Crypto enthusiasts and policymakers, this meeting offers a unique opportunity. Pakistan has historically maintained a cautious, often restrictive, stance on cryptocurrencies. While the State Bank of Pakistan has issued warnings against decentralized digital currencies, there have also been discussions within government circles about developing a national cryptocurrency or regulating the existing market. The presence of a dedicated State Minister for Blockchain and Crypto underscores a recognition of the technology’s potential, even amidst regulatory ambiguities. Key areas of potential discussion during such a high-profile meeting could include: Regulatory Frameworks: How El Salvador navigated the legal complexities of adopting Bitcoin as legal tender. Economic Integration: Strategies for integrating digital assets into the national economy, including remittances and financial inclusion. Technological Infrastructure: Building the necessary digital infrastructure to support widespread crypto use. Education and Awareness: Public campaigns to foster understanding and adoption of new financial tools. This dialogue could pave the way for Pakistan to learn from El Salvador’s pioneering, albeit challenging, experience, potentially influencing its future digital asset strategy. Nayib Bukele’s Vision: A Blueprint for National Crypto Strategy At the heart of this meeting is Nayib Bukele , a leader who has fundamentally reshaped El Salvador’s economic narrative by betting big on Bitcoin. In September 2021, El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, a move that garnered both praise and criticism globally. Bukele’s administration has since launched several initiatives aimed at integrating Bitcoin into daily life, including the Chivo Wallet, Bitcoin mining powered by geothermal energy (Volcano Energy), and the ambitious “Bitcoin City” project financed by “Volcano Bonds.” Bukele’s vision is rooted in several core beliefs: Financial Inclusion: Providing banking services to the unbanked population through Bitcoin. Remittance Cost Reduction: Significantly cutting down fees on remittances, a vital source of income for many Salvadoran families. Economic Sovereignty: Reducing reliance on traditional financial institutions and the U.S. dollar. Attracting Investment and Tourism: Positioning El Salvador as a hub for crypto innovation and attracting foreign capital. While El Salvador’s journey with Bitcoin has faced hurdles, including price volatility and skepticism from international bodies like the IMF, it has undeniably placed the small Central American nation on the global stage as a trailblazer in digital finance. For other developing nations, Bukele’s bold strategy serves as a compelling case study, highlighting both the immense potential and the inherent risks of such a profound economic shift. Driving Global Crypto Adoption: Lessons and Opportunities The meeting between Bukele and Saqib is a clear indicator of a broader trend towards Global Crypto Adoption . It signifies that discussions about digital assets are moving beyond niche tech circles and into the highest echelons of national governance. Countries are increasingly recognizing that ignoring the crypto revolution is no longer an option; instead, they must engage with it, understand it, and determine how it fits into their national economic goals. The potential for global crypto adoption extends across various sectors: Cross-Border Payments: Facilitating faster, cheaper international transactions. Supply Chain Management: Enhancing transparency and efficiency using blockchain technology. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Opening up new avenues for financial services without intermediaries. Digital Identity: Secure and verifiable digital identities leveraging blockchain. El Salvador’s experience, while unique, offers valuable lessons. It demonstrates that political will and a clear vision can drive rapid technological integration. However, it also underscores the importance of public education, robust infrastructure, and a balanced regulatory approach to ensure stability and consumer protection. As more nations explore this path, collaboration and shared learning become paramount to fostering responsible and sustainable global crypto adoption. Shaping Digital Asset Policy: Challenges and Collaborative Paths One of the most critical aspects of this evolving landscape is the development of sound Digital Asset Policy . The lack of clear, harmonized regulations is often cited as a major barrier to mainstream crypto adoption and innovation. Meetings like the one between Bukele and Saqib provide a platform for nations to discuss best practices, regulatory challenges, and potential frameworks that can foster growth while mitigating risks. Developing effective digital asset policy involves navigating several complex considerations: Consumer Protection: Safeguarding users from fraud, scams, and market manipulation. Financial Stability: Ensuring that the integration of digital assets does not destabilize traditional financial systems. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF): Implementing robust measures to prevent illicit activities. Innovation vs. Regulation: Striking a balance that encourages technological advancement without stifling it with overly restrictive rules. Taxation: Establishing clear guidelines for taxing crypto transactions and holdings. International collaboration is vital in shaping these policies. By sharing insights on regulatory successes and failures, countries can collectively work towards a more coherent global framework for digital assets. This collaborative approach can help prevent regulatory arbitrage, promote cross-border innovation, and build a more secure and efficient global digital economy. A Landmark Dialogue for the Digital Future The meeting between President Nayib Bukele and Minister Bilal Bin Saqib is a significant moment in the ongoing narrative of global digital transformation. It highlights El Salvador’s continued role as a pioneer in the Bitcoin space and underscores Pakistan’s growing recognition of blockchain and cryptocurrencies as vital components of future economic development. While the immediate outcomes of this specific meeting remain to be seen, its symbolic importance is immense. This dialogue signifies a shift from mere curiosity to active engagement among nations regarding digital assets. It suggests a future where international cooperation on crypto and blockchain policies becomes more common, leading to more robust frameworks, increased adoption, and ultimately, a more integrated and innovative global financial system. The road ahead for digital asset integration is complex, but with leaders willing to engage in such high-level discussions, the potential for a truly transformative digital future appears increasingly within reach.

The lawsuit, filed with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg last month, argues that Spain violated Ver’s legal protections when it approved a U.S. request to extradite him to Los Angeles. Roger Ver Fights $48M U.S. Tax Extradition in Spain, Calls Case a “Denial of Justice” In court documents reviewed by Bloomberg , Ver’s legal team described the Spanish extradition order as a “clear denial of justice” and a breach of international extradition protocols. Spanish authorities arrested Ver last year on the island of Mallorca after a U.S. indictment was unsealed, charging him with mail fraud, tax evasion, and filing false tax returns. He was later released on bail while legal proceedings continued. U.S. prosecutors allege that Ver failed to pay over $48 million in taxes related to his 2017 sale of tens of thousands of bitcoins , worth approximately $240 million. 'Bitcoin Jesus' Roger Ver’s lawyers call for dismissal of tax evasion charges, claiming the IRS’s exit tax violates the Constitution. #BitcoinJesus #RogerVer https://t.co/Lnez1FgsMQ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 4, 2024 Though Ver renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2014 and acquired citizenship in St. Kitts and Nevis, prosecutors argue he remained liable for U.S. taxes due to his continued ownership of U.S.-incorporated businesses, including MemoryDealers.com and Agilestar.com. The case also centers on the so-called “exit tax,” a requirement that wealthy Americans who expatriate pay capital gains tax on their global assets. In his legal filing, Ver’s Spanish attorney, Jaime Campaner Munoz, accused Spanish authorities of failing to consider the “legal uncertainty and insecurity” surrounding U.S. tax policy on crypto assets during the relevant period. He also argued that extraditing Ver would illegitimately curtail his right to liberty. A spokesperson for the European Court of Human Rights confirmed receipt of the complaint, which is currently under review. Neither Spain’s government nor the U.S. Department of Justice has commented on the ongoing case. Ver’s legal team in the United States has challenged the indictment, describing the charges as flawed and politically charged. David Schoen , Ver’s U.S. attorney, said in an interview that the case “should have never been indicted criminally,” pointing out that the crypto industry was still “completely in flux” in 2017 regarding token valuations and tax implications. According to Schoen, Ver had sought advice from U.S. tax professionals before selling his bitcoin and acted based on that guidance. “He did not commit any crime,” Schoen insisted. “There was no intent to defraud. He followed the advice of professionals. That’s not a crime.” Roger Ver’s Legal Fight Sparks Political Drama and Crypto Community Clash The crypto entrepreneur’s legal battle has drawn widespread attention in both political and blockchain circles. In a January video posted to his X account, Ver appealed directly to President Donald Trump, asking for help. “For decades, I’ve been terrorized by rogue U.S. government agents who hate American freedom. This is my story,” he said. The plea sparked online backlash. Elon Musk posted on X , writing, “Roger Ver gave up his U.S. citizenship. No pardon for Ver. Membership has its privileges.” Despite that, Ver reportedly paid $600,000 to Trump ally Roger Stone earlier this year to lobby Congress and influence the legal environment surrounding his charges. ₿ Roger Ver has reportedly paid $600,000 to longtime Trump associate Roger Stone to lobby him. #BitcoinJesus #RogerVer #DonaldTrump https://t.co/PrZ5ZEY1Is — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 25, 2025 According to congressional filings, Stone’s lobbying efforts sought to challenge the law under which Ver was charged. However, Schoen has since confirmed that Ver is no longer pursuing a pardon. The case has stirred heated reactions within the crypto community. Ross Ulbricht, the recently pardoned founder of the Silk Road darknet marketplace , expressed his support for Ver, citing Ver’s prior advocacy on his behalf . “Roger Ver was there for me when I was down and needed help. Now Roger needs our support,” Ulbricht posted on X . “No one should spend the rest of their life in prison over taxes. Let him pay the tax (if any) and be done with it.” @RealRossU , pardoned founder of the Silk Road marketplace, is publicly advocating for clemency for @rogerkver , known as ""Bitcoin Jesus."" #RogerVer #Bitcoin https://t.co/nFhN9IIBdn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 21, 2025 But not everyone shares that sentiment. Dan Held, a prominent crypto figure and former Kraken executive, called Ver “toxic” and accused him of doing long-term damage to Bitcoin’s development. “He misaligned expectations around Bitcoin so much that it led to a civil war.” Roger attacked my livelihood by trying to get me fired, called up others to hurt my relationships, and attacked my reputation. He misaligned expectations around Bitcoin so much that it led to a civil war. He deserves everything that he's about to get.

The trader, identified by the wallet address “0x2258…”, is betting heavily that ETH won’t climb anytime soon—and so far, the gamble is paying off. Related Reading: Avalanche Shatters Record With 20M Transactions—Is Real-World Use Finally Here? Based on blockchain data monitored via Hyperdash, the whale shorted 20,474 ETH at an entry point of $3,060. As ETH has been trading at levels lower than $3,000 at the time of writing, the whale is already enjoying an unrealized profit of approximately $1.14 million, or returns of 30%. Ethereum Under Pressure Below $3,500 The liquidation value of the position is at $3,505 — near where ETH traded previously in January 2025. That point is now serving as very powerful resistance. If the price exceeds that level, the position stands to be completely liquidated. Whale 0x2258, who’s already made over $15M, is shorting $ETH with 18x leverage, holding a position of 20,474 $ETH($62.5M). This whale has previously profited big by trading against James Wynn.https://t.co/BALllYbUXbhttps://t.co/NhOE1YD4QN pic.twitter.com/7k5ZE81Noa — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 15, 2025 Despite that narrow buffer, the trader seems confident. The use of 18x leverage suggests a high-conviction call that ETH will drop further or, at the very least, won’t bounce past that resistance level in the short term. This kind of heavy shorting is raising eyebrows in a market that’s still undecided on whether Ethereum can regain bullish momentum alongside Bitcoin. Track Record Of Outsmarting James Wynn This isn’t the first time “0x2258…” has stepped in with bold trades. The wallet has gained a reputation for taking positions that go directly against crypto influencer James Wynn—often with profitable results. Back in May, Wynn went long on ETH and Bitcoin. Almost immediately, 0x2258 shorted both. When Wynn closed his positions, 0x2258 did the same and walked away with $1.36 million. The next day, as Wynn flipped bearish, 0x2258 went long and bagged another $2.54 million. The back-and-forth continued. By May 26, the whale had locked in $5.6 million in profits in just three days. Since then, the strategy has snowballed into more than $15 million in realized gains, most of it from flipping against Wynn’s positions. Related Reading: If You’re Wealthy, 1 Bitcoin Should Already Be In Your Wallet, Expert Says Big Bet Reflects Uncertainty In ETH’s Path While Bitcoin continues to break through key resistance zones, Ethereum seems stuck in a tougher fight. Traders like 0x2258 appear to believe that ETH lacks the strength right now to push past the $3,500 level. Still, shorting with this level of leverage is a double-edged sword. If ETH bounces sharply, traders like 0x2258 could get caught in a squeeze, forced to buy back in at a loss—driving the price up even faster. So far, though, the whale is winning again. Whether it ends in another multi-million-dollar gain or a hard reset depends on what ETH does next. For now, the market is waiting to see what happens next.

48377627,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74573,1752710434,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,SEC Commissioner Reveals Reason For XRP ETF Delay,https://timestabloid.com/sec-commissioner-reveals-reason-for-xrp-etf-delay/,"United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw has addressed ongoing concerns from the crypto investment community regarding the repeated delays in the approval of spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In a recent interview, Commissioner Crenshaw emphasized that the delays are procedural and do not reflect a definitive stance against the launch of such products. Understanding the Cause of Delays In a conversation on The David Lin Report, Commissioner Crenshaw explained the underlying reasons for the SEC’s slow pace in reviewing spot XRP ETF applications. She acknowledged the growing dissatisfaction among investors but clarified that the delays result from the SEC’s structured and methodical evaluation process. According to Crenshaw, the agency operates within a bureaucratic framework that mandates careful analysis rather than rapid decision-making. She noted that she had anticipated the frustration and had previously advised market participants that the approval process would likely take time. Crenshaw reiterated that the SEC must adhere to procedural requirements, which naturally extend the timeline for reviewing exchange-traded product applications, including those tied to cryptocurrencies like XRP. Despite the delays, Commissioner Crenshaw confirmed that the SEC continues to actively assess numerous applications for crypto-related ETFs. These include a broad range of filings, not limited to XRP-based products. She stated that the commission is methodically working through a large volume of applications and that this process is consistent with how the agency has traditionally approached new financial instruments. Crenshaw stated that the fact that a filing has not yet been approved should not be interpreted as an outright rejection. She further explained the importance of a comprehensive review before granting regulatory clearance. No Final Decision Yet on Spot XRP ETFs Importantly, Commissioner Crenshaw clarified that the ongoing delays should not be interpreted as a denial of future XRP ETF products. She emphasized that the SEC has not made a final decision on whether to approve or deny these applications. The delays are part of the agency’s formal evaluation protocol, which aims to ensure that all aspects of a proposed product meet regulatory standards before approval. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Crenshaw added that although the pace may appear slow, the SEC’s review process is designed to safeguard market integrity and investor interests. She encouraged stakeholders to remain patient as the agency continues its evaluations. Timeline for Potential ETF Approval Currently, more than ten firms, among them Franklin Templeton and Bitwise , are pursuing the launch of spot XRP ETFs in the United States. The SEC has already postponed decisions on these filings twice, missing the first two regulatory deadlines. The third deadline for some applications is set for August, while the final deadline for review and approval falls in October 2025. Market analysts, including Bloomberg ETF experts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, have projected that approval may occur before the final October deadline. Although spot XRP ETFs remain under review, the SEC has previously granted clearance to futures-based XRP products, such as the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF, indicating some level of openness to XRP-related investment instruments. Commissioner Crenshaw’s recent remarks aim to reassure market participants that the SEC’s approach to XRP ETF applications is guided by established procedures, not resistance. While the delays have raised concerns among investors, the agency remains engaged in a detailed review process. With multiple deadlines approaching, the coming months will likely provide further clarity on the future of spot XRP ETFs in the United States.

Let’s start with Ethena , the spotlight hit when Arthur Hayes dropped $1.5 million into ENA shortly after it jumped 20% on Upbit. That bold move hints he’s betting big on altcoins gaining momentum again. Meanwhile, FET is turning heads on the charts. Traders are watching closely as a classic harmonic pattern forms, paired with a strong weekly rise that could set up a major breakout. And while the market heats up, BlockDAG (BDAG) is stepping beyond the usual crypto crowd. Its new partnership with the Seattle Seawolves is grabbing attention, aiming to blend blockchain with sports through NFTs, digital collectibles, and special fan perks. On top of that, the project’s presale has already pulled in $340 million and sold over 24 billion coins, paving the way for a high-energy launch. Arthur Hayes Drops $1.5M On ENA After 20% Surge Arthur Hayes just made waves in the crypto world by buying $1.5 million into Ethena (ENA) right after the coin surged 20% following its listing on Upbit. He picked up around 4.2 million ENA coins through big-name platforms like Binance, Wintermute, and Galaxy Digital, showing strong faith in a coming altcoin rally. The price of ENA jumped from $0.22 to a peak of $0.37 before settling around $0.3371, reflecting growing excitement in the market. Hayes called the Upbit listing a key moment for Ethena, tying it into his bigger belief in the future of altcoins and the growing synthetic dollar space, which is gaining serious traction among buyers. FET Gains 10% As Bullish Pattern Takes Shape FET is back in the spotlight this week after posting a solid 10% gain. What’s catching traders’ eyes is a clear harmonic pattern forming on the daily chart, specifically, a Bearish Bat setup. It’s now entering the final CD leg, which often points to a potential push higher, possibly toward the $1.50 to $1.65 range. After dipping to around $0.55, FET has made a strong recovery and is now testing key resistance at the 200-day moving average near $0.78. Analysts say if the price breaks above this level, it could confirm the bullish pattern. But if it slips below $0.64, that might weaken the outlook and signal caution ahead. BlockDAG Scores Big With Seattle Seawolves Deal Surging Past $340M BlockDAG is making waves beyond the crypto crowd, thanks to a new partnership with the Seattle Seawolves, one of Major League Rugby’s top teams. This move brings blockchain right into the hands of sports fans through NFTs, digital collectibles, and behind-the-scenes content. It’s a strong step in showing how crypto can offer real-world value and stronger fan connections, not just trading hype. The numbers back up the buzz. BlockDAG’s presale has already raised over $340 million, with over 24 billion BDAG coins sold across 29 presale batches. Since its early days, the coin’s price has jumped 2,660%, climbing from just $0.001 to $0.0276. Despite that major run-up, there’s still a limited-time offer available. The price is temporarily set at $0.0016 until the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. That deadline has sparked a wave of new buying as more people take notice. Analysts believe BlockDAG has room to grow, with long-term price targets as high as $10. Its growing presence in mainstream sports, strong presale success, and focus on real-world use cases make it one of the more talked-about crypto projects this year. With demand heating up and the clock ticking toward launch, many see this as a chance that might not last long, especially as both fans and traders jump in. Final Thoughts Arthur Hayes’ big $1.5 million move into Ethena is still turning heads, boosting confidence in altcoins, and alerting buyers to more price action. At the same time, FET continues to draw attention, with its bullish chart pattern suggesting more upside could be on the way if key levels hold. But it’s BlockDAG that’s really capturing the spotlight. Its partnership with the Seattle Seawolves is pushing crypto into the mainstream, showing real-world value beyond just trading. With over $340 million raised, 24 billion coins sold, and a limited-time price of $0.0016 ahead of its August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release, the hype around BlockDAG is building fast. Its growing visibility, strong momentum, and unique approach make it one of the top bullish projects to keep a close eye on.

The tech and retail titan emitted 68.25 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent over the year, according to its annual sustainability report, which was released Wednesday, well above its 2023 output. The spike results from an explosion in data center construction to support the growing demand for artificial intelligence technologies. These sites consume vast amounts of energy and raw materials, including enormous amounts of steel and concrete, two of the materials that are also most carbon-intensive to produce. The new data underscore a growing tightening at Amazon. The company had publicly pledged to achieve net-zero carbon by 2040 as part of its Climate Pledge, a much-heralded effort that set a bar for corporate climate action. But five years later, Amazon’s emissions had grown by a third. AI’s soaring power demands push Amazon’s emissions higher The Amazon report also admitted that, considering the company’s electricity purchases, its emissions will increase by 1 percent in 2024. It was the first time it had observed growth in that category since it began tracking it in 2019. The energy antenna focuses more on the power-greedy aspect of AI workloads, explaining to a large extent the boost in electricity consumption. The large AI models are trained across enormous computing resources, creating extravagant electricity consumption at data centers. In the report, Amazon acknowledged that it is crucial for collective efforts to reduce energy peaks and expand access to green, carbon-free energy to continue supporting the advanced technologies their customers rely on. And for all the money Amazon has thrown at renewable energy, including wind and solar projects around the globe, the company is finding it increasingly hard to keep up with the headlong growth of AI. The rest of big tech, including Amazon, Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Meta, and Microsoft, have increasingly turned to AI to discover their next great leap forward. However, the environmental costs are getting a second look. The companies’ growing AI data centers require more electricity, and the electricity demand has spiked. In some parts of the country, that need has been filled by power plants that run on natural gas and coal, sources that many companies had largely shunned to gravitate toward greener ones. AI is revolutionizing the energy sector, but it is not always for the better. In places where clean energy infrastructure has failed to keep pace with surging demand, especially driven by tech-powered growth, progress toward sustainability is beginning to reverse. Meanwhile, Amazon and other giants are signing contracts to secure carbon-free nuclear power for future operations. Both batches of deals should come online in a couple of years, but the divide between demand for energy and supply of the clean stuff is only growing. Amazon struggles to balance innovation with sustainability Amazon says it is still committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2040, noting its efforts to decarbonize its delivery fleet and grow its purchases of renewable energy and its investments in nascent technologies such as carbon capture. However, Amazon’s current path, particularly its effort to drive the AI boom, means its climate promises are in jeopardy. But as the company invests in its AI infrastructure, there are increasing calls from many quarters for more transparency, faster renewable adoption, and clearer accountability for tracking and curbing emissions. For now, Amazon’s 2024 vision is of a tech superpower pushing the future of AI, and pushing back even farther — at least for now — from the green promises it made just five years ago.

They call it an existential threat to the country’s democracy. Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden said there is a strong case for making crypto donations illegal in the UK. He was responding to Labor MP Liam Byrne, who had asked if the government was reviewing a crypto ban in political funding, which was ordered during the Beitbridge inquiry into xenophobia. During Parliament’s summer recess, McFadden emphasized the need for the UK to update its political finance laws to preserve public trust continuously. He said it was important to know who the donation was received from, whether it was correctly registered, and to understand the entire path of money in and out to assure the donation was safe. The concern is that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum can move across borders without being attached to names, banks, or identities. That is the tricky part for officials when trying to track the trail of money and verify that it is the source of the donation. To one set of people, crypto is a clear-eyed modern method of raising money; to another, it is a potential opening into the shadowy and potentially illicit world of campaign finance. Reform UK Bitcoin move sparks outrage It is just two months since Reform UK , led by Nigel Farage, said the party would begin taking donations in Bitcoin. The move made Reform UK the first UK political party to take donations in cryptocurrency publicly. Although many have hailed it as a metric innovation, the regulators and watchdogs are worried about that. A UK-registered anti-corruption charity warned in a recent report that accepting cryptocurrency donations could open up British politics to the dangers of foreign interference and the proceeds of crime. The report said digital assets like crypto could be used in “future political interference schemes,” especially if combined with lax oversight. McFadden and Byrne urged the government to ensure that institutions regulating political financing are strong. They called for greater resources and power for the National Crime Agency and the Electoral Commission, which monitors and investigates donations to political parties. Governments tighten rules on crypto funding It’s not just Britain that is worried. Elsewhere in the world, other countries are considering regulating or banning cryptocurrency donations to politics . Like many democracies, Ireland aimed to shield its democracy from “foreign interference,” fake news, and clandestine campaign financing. It’s different in the United States, state by state. A handful of states, including Oregon, Michigan, and North Carolina, have outlawed donations made in cryptocurrency altogether. They raised questions around traceability and transparency. Some states, like California, had bans in place but rolled back those restrictions so money from crypto could again flow into campaigns, as happened when the new year arrived. However, in countries with weak oversight, the risks are even greater. For example, El Salvador, which made Bitcoin legal tender, permits political donations in cryptocurrency. Civic groups have cautioned that external forces can easily manipulate the democratic process anonymously.

The top cryptocurrency has been struggling as major holders take profit at BTC’s current level. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Index Spikes Above 30, But Bitcoin Dominance Remains High, What Next? At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price trades around $118,800 with a 2% gain over the last 24 hours and a 9% gain over the past week, according to data from CoinGecko. Conversely, Ethereum, XRP, and Dogecoin have seen gains north of 16% on similar timeframes. BTC's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Bitcoin Price At Critical Levels, More Gains On The Horizon Following a major upside push from below $100,000, the Bitcoin price broke a persistent downtrend and managed to hit a fresh all-time high close to its current levels. As mentioned, a report from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode claimed an increase in profit taking from short-term holders. As these players exited the market, taking over $3.5 billion in profits in just 24 hours, the Bitcoin price lose steam and began moving sideways. While Bitcoin has been on a violent bull run, there are still fears of a major pullback from the $118,000 area to the support zone at around $110,000. However, a report from CryptoQuant, with data from top analyst Crypto Dan, suggests that the Bitcoin bull run still has some room for another leg up. As seen in the chart below, the current BTC market is nowhere near the overheated levels recorded in March and December of 2024. BTC's Realized Cap Age Bands as measured by UTXOs far from previous bear market levels. Source: Crypto Dan via CryptoQuant The CryptoQuant post stated the following, sharing an insight from Crypto Dan: (…) unlike in March and December 2024, on-chain data indicating market overheating shows that the market still hasn’t reached an overheated state. Despite the price rising even higher, the fact that overheating has significantly decreased compared to previous short-term peaks suggests that Bitcoin could continue to break all-time highs and rise significantly in the second half of 2025, leaving strong potential for growth. Bitcoin Bull Run Far From Over? In this context, and if bulls are able to sustain the momentum, Bitcoin is likely heading for higher. As NewsBTC covered earlier, a prediction from a top analyst claims that the levels of BTC adoption are unprecedented.

Uniswap (UNI) price forecasts point to a steady rise, with buyers testing the $9.20 resistance after holding support near $8.00. Meanwhile, Aptos (APT) price today remains strong above $5.00, setting a new support at $4.96 backed by solid trading volume. BlockDAG (BDAG) is moving beyond price shifts alone. It’s creating real value by teaming up with the Seattle Seawolves rugby and Orcas cricket teams. These deals bring ticketing, rewards, and NFTs on the blockchain. By focusing on sports fans in North America, BlockDAG aims to take blockchain use beyond niche groups. This sports partnership has pushed presale beyond $340 million. But BlockDAG currently offers coins at a special $0.0016 price until the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. This makes BlockDAG a top option for those looking at clear plans and real adoption. UNI Targets $9.20 Following $7.00 Rally Uniswap (UNI) is gaining strength after weeks of slow recovery. Price forecasts highlight a possible climb toward $10 if buyers keep their momentum. UNI has held steady above $8.00 support, with the $9.20 resistance level now in focus for the next move. Recent price action shows strong demand, with UNI rising from $7.00 to above $9.00 before a slight pullback. Hourly charts reveal higher highs and higher lows, meaning buyers are still active. Futures open interest is also growing, indicating more traders are positioning for price changes. However, if the price falls while open interest remains high, it could trigger forced selling. Watching these key price levels will be important to see if the upward trend continues or pauses. Aptos (APT) Maintains Support Level At $4.96 Aptos (APT) price today climbed 4.5% in 24 hours, with heavy buying at 01:00 UTC when volume reached 1.64 million units, 29% above average. Prices jumped from $4.97 to $5.06 in one hour, setting $4.96 as a new support level. The rally then pushed to a peak of $5.20 by 04:00 UTC. This rise aligns with broader crypto market gains of 3.6%. Recently, APT has traded near $5.13, about 3.2% higher. Support at $5.09 held well with strong volume confirming buyer interest. The trading range showed 6% volatility between $4.91 and $5.20, but recent action suggests price stability around $5.13 after intense buying. BlockDAG Focuses On Real Adoption Through High-Profile Seattle Seawolves Team BlockDAG is working closely with the Seattle Seawolves rugby team and the Orcas cricket team to bring blockchain technology to sports fans. These partnerships provide fans with new digital experiences such as ticketing on the blockchain, exclusive rewards, and collectible NFTs. By teaming up with well-known sports teams in North America, BlockDAG aims to reach a wider, loyal audience and increase its visibility beyond the usual blockchain circles. These deals aren’t just for show, they give fans real benefits, making blockchain practical and easy to use. This approach helps grow BlockDAG’s network by increasing user activity and improving security. More users mean a stronger and more useful platform. These partnerships clearly show BlockDAG’s goal to bring blockchain technology into everyday life, where regular people can understand and enjoy it. The BlockDAG presale has already raised $340 million in just a few months, and the push is stronger after this partnership. Right now, buyers can take advantage of a special price of $0.0016 per coin until the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. This presents a potential return of 3,025% compared to the original launch price of $0.05. Currently, Batch 29 coins are priced at $0.0276 but are frozen for now. This limited-time offer at $0.0016 offers a great chance for those looking for coins with clear real-world use and growth potential. BlockDAG’s plans and partnerships suggest it is one of the best projects to watch for practical adoption and long-term progress. Summing Up! Uniswap (UNI) price prediction targets $9.20, maintaining strong support at $8.00. This points to steady buyer interest and demand. Aptos (APT) price today stays firm above $5.00, with $4.96 confirmed as a support level and trading near $5.13 on solid volume. BlockDAG stands apart by focusing on real-world use.

These new mobile phones included the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The smartwatch is also a Pixel version , incorporated with a fourth-generation model. The announcement came after Samsung’s recent disclosure of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, a slender, new standard foldable mobile phone with a market valuation of $2,000. The availability of these mobile phones in the market is set for July 25. Google discloses new unique features for its Pixel 10 smartphone series Following the growing advancements of technology, Google is now eyeing to produce Pixel 10 products this year after releasing Pixel 9 on August 13, 2024. Notably, the 2 types of Pixels will look nearly the same, but the newest Pixel version will have more advanced processors, better hardware, among other minor enhancements. Another significant upgrade in producing the Pixel 10 series is that the Tensor G5 processor, the tech firm’s customized processor for its Pixel mobile phones with a fifth-generation model, will drive the whole series. Interestingly, the American multinational corporation and technology company has shifted its dependence on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company to create this chip after years of heavy dependence on Samsung to produce chips for its production. In addition, the tech company has vowed not to imitate Samsung’s Z Fold 7 make but instead will use an entirely new design that will use the Gemini AI application. In the era of foldable mobile phones, just as Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Google will also launch the Pixel 10 Pro Fold series, which will be more budget-friendly than Samsung’s. Meanwhile, Google’s new smartphone will utilize Android 16 features and demonstrate a more enticing user experience, which Google mentioned earlier during its annual developer conference in May. Google has an event in Mountain View, California called “Made by Google.” Last year it was conducted on August 13. It comes before Apple’s September iPhone event. The event focused on demonstrating the company’s new products to its users. Despite all these efforts, Google’s market valuation of its mobile phones is below that of Samsung and Apple’s in the US. Even so, the tech firm’s phones have passionate fans due to their impressive features, such as the high-quality camera and their updates on Android applications. Its enhanced features have also given its users reasons to stay loyal. Google incorporates several unique features in its production to surpass its rivals With its latest update on its mobile phones, Google took a significant step before Apple, its competitor, demonstrated its renovated iPhone package . In its blog post, Google highlighted its plans to unveil Material 3 Expressive, its new features created to showcase modern, applicable, and distinct design. The company will use it for its apps, such as Gmail, and in its Android system. It is worth noting that this is not the first feature Google has used to make its products unique. Several features have been implemented, such as incorporating bouncier animations, different shapes, strong contrasts, and bigger fonts in its production.

The multi-day event gives leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives an opportunity to vote on three critical bills that are expected to bolster the entire crypto sector. These three bills under consideration include the CLARITY Act, the GENIUS Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. WATCH: Chairman @RepFrenchHill speaks at @RulesReps on the three bills as part of ""Crypto Week:"" CLARITY Act GENIUS Act Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act pic.twitter.com/VoHiAoaUt1 — Financial Services GOP (@FinancialCmte) July 14, 2025 The CLARITY Act sets the rules for when an asset is considered a security . This would also clarify whether an asset is overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or considered a commodity. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) was introduced in February. The bill passed the Senate on June 17 and sets rules for the type of entities that may issue stablecoins . The GENIUS Act establishes that “issuers must maintain reserves backing the stablecoin on a one-to-one basis” in US dollars or other similarly liquid assets. It also extends the Bank Secrecy Act to stablecoin issuers. Finally, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act aims to prevent the US Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) . Why Crypto Week Is Historic For The U.S. While legislative efforts remain underway at the time of writing, industry experts believe that Crypto Week represents a historic moment in U.S. history. Reeve Collins, CEO and pending executive chairman of digital asset management firm ReserveOne, told Cryptonews that the U.S. has finally begun to replace uncertainty with clarity in the digital asset space. “For years, innovators and investors have navigated a fragmented regulatory environment, often worried about arbitrary enforcement,” Collins said. “Now, with landmark bills like the CLARITY Act moving through Congress, we’re on the verge of giving the industry clear rules of the road instead of red tape.” Collins added that Crypto Week is not just about crypto, but rather about the U.S. indicating to the world that it’s ready to lead in an innovation-friendly financial future. For instance, Collins believes that the three bills being discussed this week would open the door for traditional banks and fintechs to participate confidently in the digital asset sector. “This would unlock trillions in value, and position the U.S. as a global hub for digital assets.” The Importance of the GENIUS Act Denelle Dixon, executive director of the Stellar Development Foundation, further told Cryptonews that the GENIUS Act is particularly important for ensuring access to the global financial system via blockchain technology. “This bill recognizes the evolution of our financial system and the important role that stablecoins play,” Dixon said. “It creates a federal licensing regime for stablecoins that will support the dollar’s strength, fosters international coordination that puts the United States in a strong, influential position at the table, and strengthens dollar-denominated, cross-border stablecoin flows.” Most importantly, Dixon explained that the passing of the GENIUS Act would protect consumers by ensuring that stablecoins are fully backed and truly stable. “This is critical as stablecoins are projected to grow to a two trillion dollar sector before the end of the decade,” she said. Will The GENIUS and CLARITY Acts Pass? Currently, the U.S. House of Representatives has voted 215-211 to pass a procedural motion that will allow the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts, along with the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, to proceed to final votes. While noteworthy, some industry experts remain skeptical that the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts will pass this week. Rebecca Liao, co-founder and CEO of Web3 infrastructure provider Saga, told Cryptonews that she believes it’s unlikely the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts will pass this week because of congressional procedures. “I’d still love to see significant headway being made moving these bills through the channels,” Liao said. She added that these bills are important for the regulatory certainty the crypto industry needs. Echoing this, Margaret Rosenfeld, chief legal officer at Everstake, told Cryptonews that passing any of the three bills under consideration would represent a watershed moment. “It would give companies like ours the legal certainty to innovate here in the US and would reassure consumers that there are rules in place to protect them,” she said. “After years of regulatory ambiguity and enforcement-driven policymaking, having clear statutory frameworks would set the stage for mainstream adoption and stronger public trust.” Challenges To Consider Although Crypto Week demonstrates crypto-friendly legislation in the U.S., a number of challenges remain. In addition to congressional procedures, Rosenfeld mentioned that the biggest challenge that may impact the passing of these bills is related to politics. “Even with bipartisan support for clearer rules, there is still deep skepticism in parts of Congress that crypto bills are too industry-friendly. We’ve already seen procedural holdups and ideological divides emerge this week,” she said. In addition, Rosenfeld noted that timing presents a challenge. “There are only a few days left in the session before Congress breaks for recess, so delays could push votes into the fall.” Future Impact of Crypto Week Yet, regardless of what is voted through this week, Crypto Week has already built unprecedented momentum, especially in the U.S. Rosenfeld believes that this week’s events will likely result in the U.S. Senate considering the market structure legislation next . “We’ll also likely see more detailed rulemaking discussions in the fall. If the stablecoin bill passes, the focus will quickly shift to implementation—establishing licensing, reserve requirements, and disclosure standards,” she added.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising protocol focused on real-world asset lending, is drawing increased attention from crypto analysts and DeFi investors alike. At its current price of $0.03 MUTM is flying fast during presale stage. Mutuum Finance is in presale stage 5 of which 70% has been sold out as investors pile in. The token is at its lowest possible price of $0.03. A 16.7% jump will follow as phase 6 sets in. Over $12.4 million has been raised to date, and over 13400 investors have entered the presale. While Ethereum continues to dominate headlines, Mutuum Finance could 30x in Q4 2025. Ethereum Outlook: Eyes on $4,000 Amid Growing Institutional Interest Ethereum is currently trading around $2,982 and has recently rebounded into the $3,000 range after dipping as low as $2,934, with a high of approximately $3,074 recorded intraday. The digital asset’s rally is gaining traction thanks to expanding institutional involvement, Ethereum ETFs have attracted over $4.3 billion in net inflows by mid‑2025, including a record $1.13 billion in June alone. That interest, coupled with advancements in staking infrastructure and Layer 2 scaling solutions, is fueling projections that Ethereum could test the $4,000 level by year-end. While technical catalysts are evident, the market remains attentive to ETF approval developments and macroeconomic signals. As Ethereum captures more of the spotlight, Mutuum Finance remains a quietly emerging DeFi protocol worth watching. Mutuum Finance Presale Exceeds $12.4M as Investor Demand Grows Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as one of the most promising DeFi tokens in 2025. With over $12.4 million raised and over 13400 investors already in, the presale is gaining real traction. During phase five, the token is priced at $0.03. The next stage will see the price increase to $0.035, and with an already set official launch price of $0.06, early investors are already on a 100% profit. MUTM could skyrocket 9900% to $3 in the next bull run. Revolutionizing Finance Through Decentralized Lending Mutuum Finance offers a non-custodial liquidity protocol where users own complete control of assets throughout decentralized lending. The project follows a double-model approach that incorporates Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending in an attempt to achieve greater flexibility and efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system utilizes smart contracts to establish automatic lending with no human interference and rather, the smart contracts respond to the market by giving dynamic interest rates. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates middlemen and gives direct access between the borrowers and the lenders. The model is highly preferred by users for volatile assets like meme coins. Mutuum Finance Strengthens Security with $50K Bounty & Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is hosting a $100,000 giveaway . 10 people will each receive $10,000 MUTM tokens. The project has also launched a new leaderboard where top 50 token holders will be rewarded with bonus tokens for maintaining their ranks. To improve security, Mutuum Finance has initiated a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. Every vulnerability will be rewarded, with the bounty focusing on four key levels: critical, major, minor, and level four will be low. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $12.4 million from more than 13,400 investors, racing through Stage 5 of its presale as demand intensifies. Priced at $0.03, the token is positioned for a 2x gain at launch, with forecasts suggesting a run to $3 by Q4 2025, a potential 30x return from current levels. Backed by a $100,000 giveaway, a $50,000 security bounty, and fast-approaching exchange listings, momentum is building fast. Secure your spot in the presale now before the next price jump and get in early on one of DeFi’s most promising launches.

With new AI features and metaverse updates, SHIB is gaining renewed attention. At the same time, the AAVE market analysis shows strong progress, with Aave crossing $50 billion in deposits and breaking through important price zones. While these projects gain traction, BlockDAG (BDAG) is offering a different kind of opportunity. Its NO VESTING PASS allows all buyers within a 10-day window to unlock 100% of their purchased BDAG coins at launch. Combined with its current $0.0016 entry rate, this move has drawn high activity and is helping BlockDAG stand out as one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the market right now. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Ecosystem Moves Ahead with AI and Metaverse Features The Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem is showing growth as the total crypto market cap reaches $3.81 trillion, fueled by Bitcoin’s latest rally. SHIB regained an $8 billion market cap, rising nearly 17% in a week, while BONE, LEASH, and TREAT also saw steady gains. Teased updates under the “Jul-AI” label suggest AI-based tools are coming soon, and the metaverse experience has improved performance. These upgrades point to a stronger phase for the Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem, helped by rising on-chain activity and continued community focus on what’s coming next. AAVE Market Analysis Shows Strength Above $50 Billion Deposits The latest AAVE market analysis shows that Aave has now passed $50 billion in total deposits. This marks a major point in the growth of decentralized finance. Aave operates across 34 blockchains and has support from both fintech partners and traditional financial firms. Tools like Aave Arc and the planned V4 release are adding real-world asset features. The AAVE coin has now cleared key levels at $303.38 and $317.90 and trades close to $326. Based on AAVE market analysis, the next resistance zone is around $340 to $345. Market behavior points to steady support for Aave’s services and overall utility. Unlock All BDAG Instantly: BlockDAG’s 10-Day NO VESTING Pass Opens Early Access BlockDAG has launched a special NO VESTING PASS, giving buyers a 10-day window to unlock 100% of their BDAG at launch. Most presales require long waiting periods before coins can be accessed, often lasting months or even a year. This pass changes that pattern, offering full access from the start for any BDAG bought during this short time. Only purchases made during this 10-day period qualify. Referral bonuses and promotional rewards will still follow the usual release timeline. The NO VESTING PASS adds a level of flexibility rarely seen in early-stage crypto projects, helping users take full control of their purchase from day one. This limited offer runs alongside BlockDAG’s ongoing presale, which has now raised nearly $340 million toward its $600 million goal. Nearly 24 billion BDAG have already been sold. The price began at $0.001 in the first batch and has grown to $0.0276 by batch 29, showing a 2,660% increase. Still, BDAG is available at $0.0016 until the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. This rare pricing model has attracted strong demand and added to BlockDAG’s visibility as one of the most popular cryptocurrency projects in the market today. While pricing and presale data show strong activity, there is growing discussion around BDAG’s potential. Some analysts believe the price could eventually reach $5. The combination of the NO VESTING PASS, special entry price, and market attention has made this a key moment for those tracking the project. By offering early access and keeping terms clear, BlockDAG is gaining interest from people across the space. Insight Into the Broader Market The Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem is building momentum with AI tools and metaverse updates. These changes could help it gain more attention and compete for a place among the most popular cryptocurrency platforms. At the same time, AAVE market analysis shows the platform holding steady in the DeFi world. With growing real-world asset use and more institutional activity, AAVE remains a name to follow. BlockDAG offers something different. The NO VESTING PASS allows all coins bought in its short 10-day offer to be fully unlocked at launch. Alongside its fast-selling presale and a rising user base, it has quickly become the most popular cryptocurrency this week. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release getting closer, many are watching what happens next as this phase continues to unfold.

In a post on X, Kaleo wrote: “God candle to $4K+ this week… honestly though I wouldn’t be surprised if we see something like this play out after today’s news. Don’t let them shake you out if it happens anon. up only soon.” In Kaleo’s chart, the Ether–USDT pair is sketched inside an ascending wedge whose upper boundary has capped every rally for more than three months. That resistance line now sits near $3,000, while the lower boundary originates near $1,450 in early April and accelerates through $2,600 by late June. Ethereum Breakout Fuels $4,000 Hopes The pattern briefly failed in mid-June, when price sliced through support and bottomed near $2,100—an episode Kaleo tags “Breakdown.” Three week later the market closed decisively back above that very line, an event he annotates “Reclaim,” converting former support turned resistance back into a springboard. Related Reading: Ethereum Shorts Reach Record Levels, How To Stay Positioned For A Breakout Candles since the reclaim have marched steadily higher, compressing volatility against the wedge’s apex until earlier this week when price punched through the ceiling at roughly $3,030. At the moment the screenshot was taken the pair traded near $3,041, and a hand-drawn white projection—labelled “Send”—plots a near-vertical advance that crests just above $4,000. The projection takes its height from the widest section of the wedge: the distance between the early-May trough and the mid-May swing high measures a little over $1,000; adding that amplitude to the breakout point delivers a classical measured-move objective in the low-$4,000s, matching Kaleo’s target.

Intermediate friction zones appear near $3,344–the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement also known as the “golden pocket– but the projection assumes these levels will offer little resistance should a “god candle” materialise. Kaleo’s prediction comes on the heels of a broader risk‑on backdrop: Bitcoin is accelerating towards its record high near $123,000 from last week as investors embrace a steadier macro environment. For Ether specifically, enthusiasm has been amplified by an SEC filing revealing that Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund accumulated a 9.1 percent stake in Bitmine Immersion Technologies, the Tom Lee‑chaired public company that has stockpiled more than 163,000 ETH—roughly half a billion dollars’ worth—as part of an aggressive Ethereum‑treasury strategy. The twin tailwinds of macro‑driven liquidity and high‑profile venture endorsement reinforce Kaleo’s thesis that a “god candle” toward the $4,000 mark could ignite before the week draws to a close. At press time, ETH traded at $3,225.

This initiative is a core component of HTX DAO’s ongoing strategy to implement its deflationary mechanism, aiming to enhance the long-term value of $HTX while fostering more stable value expectations for token holders and the broader community. Token Burn to Enhance $HTX Value On-chain data confirms the destruction of 11,796,322,511,974.72 $HTX tokens, valued at over $22.17 million. For complete transparency, the burn details are publicly accessible on the blockchain: https://tronscan.org/#/transaction/89e700e02885d0cd5b0d1bc00035a35cad83febb9b8f0e334322312b1444e301 HTX DAO commits to quarterly burns, with 50% of its platform revenue dedicated to this process; the next burn is scheduled for October 15, 2025. Since Q1 2024, HTX DAO has cumulatively burned approximately 72.76 trillion $HTX tokens, representing a remarkable $136 million in value. The consistent scale of these token burns showcases HTX DAO’s effective implementation of its deflationary mechanism and strong confidence in its ecosystem. The ongoing reduction in circulating supply enables HTX DAO to build a more robust, scarcity-based token economic model that will deliver sustained value to $HTX holders. Community-Driven Project Listing Channel Launched Beyond its token burn efforts, HTX DAO is actively advancing decentralized governance. On July 4, HTX DAO introduced a new listing recommendation channel , empowering users to nominate quality projects through three methods: 1. Creating a dedicated post on the HTX DAO forum; 2. Participating in community discussions within the HTX App ; 3. Posting on the X with the hashtag #HTXVoteToList. Following initial screening and a vote by $HTX holders, shortlisted projects will be submitted to HTX for final listing consideration. Results from the first round of this community-driven initiative will be revealed on July 29. As an added incentive, participants in both the recommendation and voting phases will stand a chance to share a prize pool of nearly 10 billion $HTX tokens. This mechanism not only empowers community users with a stronger voice, but also marks a pivotal step for HTX DAO towards trading governance. It lays a solid foundation for the grand vision of building a “Free Financial Port”. HTX DAO reiterates its commitment to decentralization, aiming to enhance community engagement in governance, decision-making, and asset management. By optimizing its deflationary mechanism and strengthening community governance, HTX DAO seeks to establish a user-driven, sustainable, and fully decentralized financial ecosystem for global users. About HTX DAO As a multi-chain deployed decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), HTX DAO demonstrates an innovative governance approach. Unlike traditional corporate structures, it adopts a decentralized governance structure composed of a diversified group, jointly committed to the success of this organization. This unique ecosystem advocates openness and encourages all DAO participants to propose ideas that can promote the development of HTX DAO.

On July 15, the asset dropped to a low of $116,000 in response to news that inflation rose to 2.7% in June, amid continued concerns over tariffs from the Trump administration. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $118,439, reflecting a 1.8% gain over the past 24 hours, which suggests that some investor confidence has returned to the market despite recent volatility. This short-term rebound occurs amid increasing on-chain and market activity, which analysts are closely tracking. One such contributor, Trader Oasis, recently published an analysis on CryptoQuant outlining various indicators tied to Bitcoin’s current movement. Related Reading: Bitcoin Returns Under $117,000: Is Social Media FOMO To Blame? Bitcoin Open Interest, Price Divergence, and Institutional Signals The analyst explored a range of technical and behavioral metrics, including open interest, Coinbase premium index, and funding rates, that are influencing BTC’s recent price behavior and hinting at what may lie ahead. Trader Oasis began by noting that Bitcoin’s breach of the $107,000 resistance signaled the beginning of a potential distribution phase. He pointed out that a divergence between price and open interest acted as a preliminary bullish signal, preceding the asset’s climb. The current state, where both price and open interest are rising in tandem, is seen by some as a sign of strengthening momentum in the market. He also evaluated data from the Coinbase Premium Index, which remains above zero, typically seen as an indication of institutional demand. However, Oasis observed that the indicator’s flat behavior, even as price rises, could imply large entities are securing profits. He further suggested that a breakout above the descending trend line could trigger a stronger upward move, but a fall below zero might represent a new entry signal. Regarding funding rates, he noted that the current rise reflects renewed market confidence, although it is still below previous extreme levels. This, in his view, implies that while enthusiasm exists, excessive leverage is not yet present. Profit-Taking Rises as Binance Dominates Realized Flows A separate analysis by another CryptoQuant contributor, Crazzyblockk, looked at the realized profit and loss (PnL) across centralized exchanges. According to the data, Bitcoin investors realized $9.29 billion in profits in a single day, marking a record high for such flows. This surge in realized PnL reflects widespread profit-taking in the wake of Bitcoin’s recent price rally, especially among short-term holders. Related Reading: Dormant Bitcoin Wallet Moves $1.2B in BTC: Is A Major Sell-Off Coming? On Binance specifically, the realized PnL remains below its all-time highs but has seen a rising share compared to other exchanges. Data shows that on some days, Binance’s share of realized profits has reached up to 60%, reinforcing its growing importance in shaping market behavior. Crazzyblockk concluded that this concentrated profit-taking, led by Binance users, could indicate a shift in market dynamics, noting: Binance’s increasing dominance in realized PnL flows reinforces its critical role in market sentiment and liquidity. For traders and analysts, it is crucial to closely monitor Binance’s on-chain activity alongside other exchanges to stay ahead of potential volatility.

The joint venture will enable the companies to expand their reach into the UAE, highlighting the growing demand for secure and compliant asset infrastructure in the region. Ripple With Another Move In The UAE Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, which launched at the end of last year, has secured its first major custody partner in the Arab Emirates, Ctrl Alt, with its network now encompassing clients from Europe, Africa, the Asia-Pacific region, and Latin America. The Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa at Ripple, Reece Merrick, commemorated the partnership: “The Dubai Land Department’s Real Estate Tokenization Project is a prime example of the forward-thinking, innovative initiatives that are positioning Dubai at the heart of the global digital asset industry. This is the first time a government real estate registration authority in the Middle East has tokenized property title deeds on a public blockchain. That the DLD has chosen XRPL for this is exciting and reinforces the blockchain’s credentials of choice for financial use cases.” Ctrl Alt recently acquired its Virtual Assets Service Provider (VASP) license from Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), authorizing it to carry out issuer-related services. This will enable them to run a legally compliant platform for the production, administration, and distribution of Asset-Referenced Virtual Assets (ARVA) and tokenized real-world assets. “As the designated tokenization provider for the DLD Project, Ctrl Alt brings deep expertise in financial engineering and digital asset infrastructure, so it makes sense for us to partner with Ripple to use their custody technology to support this initiative. This will allow us to leverage proven and trusted technology that meets the highest security and operational standards.” – Matt Ong, CEO and Founder, Ctrl Alt. Dubai continues to pave the way towards a more open, unambiguous, and efficacious real estate market with its Real Estate Tokenization Project. Minting property deeds on the blockchain enables fractional ownership, expands investor participation, and enhances the efficiency of operations. An Integration and Adoption Boom The border-crossing cryptocurrency’s spree of acceptance doesn’t seem to be showing signs of slowing down. Earlier this year, the company behind it secured a license from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to offer crypto payments in the UAE. Following that, Ripple procured the brokerage firm Hidden Road in a $1.25 billion deal, making it the first in the crypto world to own and operate a multi-asset prime broker. RLUSD has also been in the spotlight, having been integrated into the Swiss bank AMINA and with the oldest US bank, BNY Mellon, becoming its custodian.

On Wednesday, token holders overwhelmingly approved a proposal to unlock WLFI for trading, with 99.94% voting in favor. The move marks a turning point for the Trump-linked project, which was launched last year as a decentralized finance platform offering both a governance token and a stablecoin. The proposal, first introduced on July 9, outlined plans to transition World Liberty from a closed ecosystem to one with broader market participation. Big news from the WLFI community The community has officially voted — and the results were overwhelming. $WLFI will be tradable The people have spoken Now it’s time to execute. Standby for the full launch plan — coming soon. — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) July 16, 2025 Trading Begins for Early World Liberty Financial Holders, Full Unlock Still Pending “This would mark a major milestone in the development of the World Liberty Financial ecosystem,” the team wrote. It added that this would open the door for wider community access and protocol development. WLFI tokens were initially sold in two tranches, priced at $0.015 and $0.05. However, buyers were not allowed to trade them at the time. Instead, they received voting rights on protocol decisions and access to Trump-related events. For instance, in May, top TRUMP memecoin holders were invited to a gala dinner with the president. Among the guests was Tron founder Justin Sun . With trading enabled, price discovery and speculation will now begin. Although only early investor tokens will be unlocked initially, a second vote will determine when the remaining supply of the 100b WLFI tokens can be released. Trump’s Inner Circle Anchors World Liberty’s Leadership and Ownership The team noted that founder, advisor and team allocations will follow a longer vesting schedule. This is meant to signal long-term alignment with the project’s success. Meanwhile, Trump’s three sons serve as official advisors to World Liberty. They are joined by real estate executive and longtime Trump ally Steve Witkoff, who now serves as the US special envoy to the Middle East. Additionally, Witkoff’s sons, Zach and Alex, are co-founders of the project. A company linked to Trump, DT Marks DEFI LLC, is expected to receive 22.5b WLFI tokens. Additionally, Trump personally held 15.75b WLFI as of the end of last year. According to Bloomberg, the Trump family has earned roughly $390m from WLFI sales, contributing to a total $620m in crypto-linked wealth . Lawmakers Question Conflicts as Trump Crypto Profits Soar Democratic lawmakers have voiced concerns over Trump’s growing involvement in crypto. This includes his ventures in Bitcoin mining and stablecoin development. As a result, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Maxine Waters have called on the US SEC to investigate possible conflicts of interest. Meanwhile, the White House has stated that Trump’s assets are held in a trust managed by his children and has denied any conflict of interest. However, the terms of this trust have not been disclosed. Importantly, Trump remains the sole beneficiary. This means he could access proceeds from crypto ventures at any time or once he leaves office. Despite the controversy, supporters see WLFI’s trading debut as a financial opportunity and a show of political loyalty. “We invested to get rich,” one holder posted on the project website. Another simply wrote, “To make America great again.” Most token holders remain anonymous, shielded behind crypto wallet addresses.

Analyst Sees Fresh $2 Billion Liquidity Triggering Next Leg Up,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-set-to-soar-analyst-sees-fresh-2-billion-liquidity-triggering-next-leg-up/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is currently stabilizing within the $116,000 to $120,000 range. However, fresh liquidity totalling $2 billion in stablecoins could help propel the flagship cryptocurrency to new all-time highs (ATHs). Bitcoin To Benefit From Fresh Liquidity According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Amr Taha, more than $2 billion worth of stablecoins – primarily Tether (USDT) – were deposited into major derivatives trading platforms earlier today. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profit-Taking Spikes Without Price Drop – Strong Demand Or Delayed Reaction? Taha believes that this surge in inflows signals increased appetite for leveraged positions among seasoned traders, many of whom are anticipating a potential breakout in BTC’s price. Notably, this fresh batch of USDT was minted by Tether Treasury, suggesting institutional demand is driving the activity. Historically, large-scale stablecoin inflows have preceded bullish market momentum, as traders often use them to open long positions on Bitcoin and altcoin futures and perpetual contracts. Rapid stablecoin deposits into derivatives exchanges often act as a leading indicator for major price rallies. Meanwhile, fellow CryptoQuant contributor TraderOasis pointed to rising Open Interest, noting that it is increasing alongside BTC’s price – a classic signal of strong bullish sentiment. To explain, rising open interest in tandem with a rising Bitcoin price typically signals increasing market participation and bullish sentiment, as more traders are opening positions expecting further upside. However, it can also indicate a buildup of leverage, which may lead to heightened volatility or a sharp correction if sentiment shifts. The analyst also highlighted the Coinbase Premium Index, which remains above zero – a sign that US-based buyers are paying a premium over global spot prices. They added that the indicator is currently within a ‘Breaker’ structure, sharing the following chart for context. TraderOasis noted that while BTC price is rising, the Coinbase Premium Index indicator has remained relatively flat. The analyst explained: This suggests to me that major players are taking profits. If the descending trend structure I marked with an arrow is broken, the price is likely to rise much more strongly. On the other hand, if the indicator drops below the ‘0’ level, I may consider it a buying signal, as we are still in a macro bullish market. Short-Term Pullback For BTC? While the $2 billion stablecoin injection is likely to act as a bullish catalyst for BTC and the broader crypto market, some exchange data suggests a potential short-term pullback before the next leg up. Related Reading: No Mania Yet: Bitcoin ATH Lacks Hype, Suggesting Further Upside Potential For instance, BTC deposits to exchanges spiked after the digital asset hit a recent high around $123,000 – a pattern that often precedes local tops and is typically followed by a price correction. That said, despite recent profit-taking, BTC has not experienced a major price drop, pointing to robust underlying demand. At press time, BTC trades at $119,171, up 2.4% in the past 24 hours.

The price is now consolidating gains and might continue to rise above the $3.10 support zone. XRP price started a fresh increase above the $3.020 zone. The price is now trading above $2.950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.950 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $2.880 zone. XRP Price Eyes More Upsides XRP price started a fresh increase after it settled above the $2.840 level, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to climb above the $2.950 resistance level. The bulls remained in action and the price gained pace for a move above $3.00 barrier. Finally, the price tested the $3.10 zone. A high was formed at $3.10 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a move below the $3.050 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.660 swing low to the $3.10 high. The price is now trading above $2.950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $3.020 level. The first major resistance is near the $3.050 level. A clear move above the $3.050 resistance might send the price toward the $3.10 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.120 resistance or even $3.150 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near the $3.20 zone. Downside Break? If XRP fails to clear the $3.00 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.950 level and the trend line zone. The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.660 swing low to the $3.10 high. The next major support is near the $2.880 level.

Some coins are showing clear signs of strength. Toncoin is one of them. The TON price chart shows strong upside, now near $7.50 with a solid base at $6.80. Hedera is also in the spotlight, with its HBAR price target pointing to a possible 45% jump, backed by improving DeFi numbers and a technical double bottom pattern. Still, BlockDAG (BDAG) is drawing attention for a different reason. It has teamed up with Seattle’s top teams, the Seawolves and Orcas, creating new ways to blend crypto and real-world engagement. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release active and a current entry price of $0.0016, BDAG offers those entering now a possible 3,025% return. TON Charts Stay Firm With $8.20 in Sight The TON price chart shows Toncoin climbing 6.41% in a day, bringing it near $7.50. It’s gained 13.45% over the past week and has held above $6.80 many times, giving confidence to those watching for a continued uptrend. Volume keeps growing, showing more traders are following the move. RSI stays below the overbought level, which means there could still be room for gains. If key resistance breaks, the TON price chart suggests a run toward $8.20 may come next. These signs keep attention focused on Toncoin as a leading mover right now. HBAR Could Rally as Price Target Stays Strong HBAR is moving quickly, now up 80% since its June low and reaching $0.2285. That’s the highest it’s been since March. The HBAR price target now looks stronger thanks to big jumps in DeFi use. Total value locked went from $151 million to $215 million. Stablecoin supply also rose sharply from $40 million to $151 million. A clear double bottom pattern is forming, with the neckline near $0.2288. This pattern supports the HBAR price target of $0.3327, a possible 45% rise. HBAR has also moved above its 50 and 100-day EMAs, and both RSI and MACD suggest the trend could continue in the near term. Seattle Sports Deals Push BlockDAG Forward as Launch Nears Sports and crypto are coming together in new ways, and BlockDAG is moving fast with headline partnerships. As the Official Blockchain Partner of the Seattle Seawolves, who have won Major League Rugby twice, BlockDAG is offering fans co-branded content, behind-the-scenes access, and NFT-linked fan tokens that bring a new kind of sports connection. BlockDAG has also teamed up with the Seattle Orcas, a rising team in Major League Cricket. This deal gives cricket fans Web3 experiences with player-led digital content, rare collectibles, and tools for blockchain-powered fan access. These partnerships line up with BlockDAG’s current GLOBAL LAUNCH release. The price is set at $0.0016 until August 11, offering early buyers a chance to gain 3,025% based on the confirmed $0.05 launch price. These new sports ties put BlockDAG in a different category compared to other presale cryptos. The project has already raised $340 million and sold more than 23.9 billion coins. This shows that many people are joining the growing BlockDAG community. For those asking about the best crypto to buy today, the mix of sports partnerships, strong traction, and high potential returns makes BlockDAG hard to ignore. What’s Moving in the Market Now The TON price chart shows strength as Toncoin stays above support levels. If the trend keeps up, the token could push toward $8.20 in the near term. At the same time, the HBAR price target is gaining attention. Hedera’s strong DeFi growth and clear technical setup point to a possible 45% rally. Both coins are being tracked closely by traders looking for breakout moves. Still, the talk around the best crypto to buy today leads back to BlockDAG. With $340 million raised, 23.9 billion coins sold, and a limited $0.0016 price tied to a 3,025% gain, its mix of real-world partnerships and Web3 tools puts it in a strong position ahead of the GLOBAL LAUNCH release deadline.

The asset had slipped to lows near $116,000 following inflation data. However, BTC has rebounded since, reaching $119,248 earlier today and trading at $119,187 at the time of writing, roughly 3.1% below its all-time high of $123,000 set earlier this week. While broader macroeconomic concerns are shaping price sentiment, new on-chain metrics from the mining sector are drawing attention. A CryptoQuant analyst has watched miner activity closely, as some key indicators suggest that miners may be preparing to sell. This development could influence short-term price action, though the broader outlook for Bitcoin remains largely unchanged, according to the analyst. Bitcoin Miner Behavior Points to Short-Term Pressures CryptoQuant contributor Avocado Onchain highlighted in a recent post that the Miner Position Index (MPI) has jumped to 2.7. This index compares the amount of Bitcoin being moved by miners to exchanges with the historical one-year average. A high MPI reading generally implies increased selling intent, as miners move assets to trading platforms. Avocado noted that the current reading may indicate mild selling pressure, which could contribute to a near-term correction or sideways trading pattern. However, he also emphasized that the current MPI value is still far from the elevated levels typically observed at market cycle peaks. The analyst suggested that this activity may be part of a recurring intra-cycle trend in which brief corrections are followed by further upward movement. He advised that it remains uncertain whether this miner activity marks a one-off event or signals a larger selling wave. Either scenario may affect short-term volatility, but not necessarily the broader trajectory. Network Flows Support the Data Trend In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant contributor Arab Chain examined the implications of increased miner activity. According to their findings, network data reveals a noticeable uptick in miner-related movements, levels last seen in November 2024. Arab Chain explained that while miner activity on the blockchain is rising, this alone doesn’t confirm sales unless Bitcoin is transferred to exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin OG Whale Moves 40,000 BTC To Galaxy, Triggering Market Shock To further validate the outlook, Arab Chain analyzed platform inflow data. They observed a correlation between BTC transfers to exchanges and Bitcoin’s recent climb above $116,000. This movement may indicate that miners view current prices as favorable for selling, possibly to cover operational costs or secure liquidity. The data also hints at miners anticipating a potential correction, which could drive more transfers and further market fluctuations. They concluded that the extent of any correction would largely depend on whether this wave of miner activity persists.

With its low presale price and clear DeFi-first roadmap, many now see Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as one of the most undervalued opportunities in the current market cycle. Avalanche (AVAX) important development Avalanche (AVAX)’s gaming ecosystem officially launched on July 14, 2025, with titles like Off the Grid and Shrapnel leading the charge. Powered by Avalanche (AVAX)’s subnets, the ecosystem offers low-latency, gas-free transactions and NFT-driven player ownership, processing 20M+ daily transactions. The Avalanche9000 upgrade enables customizable Layer-1 blockchains, enhancing scalability and interoperability for games. Partnerships with studios like Gunzilla and GREE, alongside integrations with Xsolla and Loco’s 50M+ user base, drive adoption. AVAX surged 15.75% to $21.53, reflecting market excitement. The ecosystem’s focus on seamless gameplay and Web3 features, like in-game asset marketplaces, positions Avalanche (AVAX) as a gaming blockchain leader. Technicals suggest a $24 target if momentum holds, with 1.4M+ transactions on PulsarGame’s subnet underscoring early success. This launch marks a pivotal step for Avalanche (AVAX) in redefining Web3 gaming with high-performance infrastructure. Real lending, real revenue, real demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just another trend-following altcoin. It’s building a next-generation DeFi protocol designed to support a dual lending model—one that will allow users to participate in Pool-to-Contract (P2C) lending with blue-chip assets and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending with higher-yield, high-volatility tokens like meme coins. Once launched, both systems will operate on non-custodial smart contracts, designed to generate revenue for the protocol and establish real utility behind the MUTM token. In the upcoming P2C model, users will be able to deposit assets like ETH, AVAX, or DAI into decentralized lending pools and earn stable, passive returns. For instance, depositing 5 ETH into a future P2C pool offering a 7.1% APY could potentially yield around $1,065 annually (depending on the ETH price at that time)—all while maintaining exposure to ETH’s price. Borrowers, on the other hand, will use supported crypto assets as overcollateralized collateral, enabling them to access liquidity (e.g., USDT) without needing to sell their holdings. What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart further is its planned mtToken mechanism. These yield-bearing tokens will be minted 1:1 when users deposit crypto into P2C pools. Over time, mtTokens will increase in value as lending interest accrues. Additionally, these tokens will be stakeable in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s smart contracts, where users can earn extra MUTM rewards. These rewards are designed to be powered by protocol revenue through strategic MUTM buybacks, creating a smart-loop system that ties protocol activity directly to token demand. Peer-to-Peer lending without shared risk While many existing platforms lump all borrowers into a single liquidity pool, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending engine that will offer a more personalized and risk-isolated approach. Once live, this feature will allow users to customize loan agreements without exposing their funds to broader market volatility. For example, a future lender could choose to offer 3,000 USDT to a borrower who provides PEPE tokens as collateral. The lender will set the terms—say, 12% interest, a 20-day repayment window, and a 68% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. When both parties agree, the smart contract will execute on-chain, and the loan will remain isolated from any shared liquidity pools. If a deal fails, there will be no contagion—no ripple effect across other users’ funds. This P2P model is being designed to attract risk-tolerant lenders in search of higher returns and borrowers who want greater flexibility than what’s typically available in traditional DeFi protocols. To protect both parties, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to implement a “Stability Factor” that will determine automatic liquidation points. If the value of the collateral falls below a safe threshold, third-party liquidators will step in to liquidate the loan, ensuring that lenders are repaid and the protocol’s stability remains intact. For additional transparency and user confidence, the entire platform has been reviewed through CertiK’s auditing framework, with a Token Scan score of 95.00 and a Skynet score of 77.50. These ratings provide peace of mind for both institutional and retail participants, especially in a market that increasingly values audit reliability. Beta platform, Layer-2 expansion, and presale urgency Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to launch its Beta version, which will mark the beginning of a broader roadmap that includes Layer-2 scaling, a decentralized stablecoin, and full DeFi ecosystem integration. The stablecoin will be minted only when users borrow against overcollateralized crypto assets, and will be burned once the loan is repaid or liquidated. Interest rates will be governed algorithmically by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s system to ensure the $1 peg remains intact, even during volatility. To boost adoption and reward early supporters, the team has also introduced a $100,000 MUTM giveaway , with 10 winners each receiving $10,000 worth of tokens. Combined with growing community engagement and over 12,000 followers on X, momentum around the protocol is accelerating as each presale milestone passes. As Avalanche (AVAX) shifts focus toward blockchain gaming, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as the go-to DeFi protocol for real returns and stable growth. Analysts are already forecasting a price between $0.24 and $0.30 by Q1 2026. And with the token still sitting at $0.03, many investors are already making the shift—swapping hype for utility, and speculation for smart yield. The next AVAX breakout might not come from gaming. It might come from DeFi, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leading the charge.

While Ethereum (ETH) focuses on scalability and Layer-2 expansion, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is matching the pace with real-world DeFi solutions, combining smart lending mechanics, audited protocols, and passive income tools designed to reward both conservative and aggressive investors. From staking rewards driven by platform revenue to lending markets that support everything from ETH to meme coins, Mutuum’s approach is geared for longevity, and now riding a wave of attention that shows no signs of slowing down. Ethereum (ETH) climbs past $3,000 Ethereum (ETH) vaulted past $3,000, hitting $3,052.91 recently, with an 18% weekly gain, fueled by whale accumulation and institutional fervor. Over 2,500 ETH were staked, and $6.1B poured into US spot ETFs, with BlackRock’s ETHA amassing 2M ETH. The Pectra upgrade’s testnet success, enhancing Layer-2 efficiency and slashing fees, has driven DeFi TVL to $64B. A bullish pennant breakout signals a $3,300 target, though RSI at 73 hints at a $2,850 dip risk. ETH’s climb reshuffles altcoin dynamics, funneling capital into DeFi leaders like LINK (+6% to $15.40) and COMP (+5%), as Ethereum (ETH)’s ecosystem thrives. Layer-1 rivals like BNB (+2%) gain modestly, but meme coins like DOGE and SHIB stagnate as investors chase utility. US trade friction may rattle markets, but ETH’s momentum could lift altcoins unless a correction hits. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) With Ethereum (ETH) leading the charge into Layer-2 solutions, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also preparing for scalability. Its roadmap includes Layer-2 integration to lower gas fees and improve throughput, a decentralized stablecoin pegged to $1 and only minted via overcollateralized loans, and the launch of its Beta platform to drive mass adoption. Security is another pillar of Mutuum’s growth. The project has completed a thorough audit with CertiK, receiving a Token Scan score of 95.00 and a Skynet rating of 77.50. These numbers show a clear commitment to transparency and smart contract integrity—especially crucial for any platform handling on-chain lending and collateral management. Investor momentum is further fueled by the $100,000 MUTM giveaway , where ten lucky holders will each receive $10,000 in tokens. This campaign, along with Mutuum’s fast-growing community (12K+ followers on X), has helped make MUTM one of the most talked-about presale tokens in DeFi this month. An analyst who correctly forecasted Ethereum (ETH)’s 2021 rally now expects Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to 10x by mid-2026, with targets set at $0.30. With only a few presale phases remaining and an official listing planned at $0.06, the upside is clear for those who secure an entry before Phase 5 ends. mtTokens, real yield, and the DeFi advantage What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart from trend-driven altcoins is its vision to generate value through real platform activity, not hype. The protocol is being developed around a dual lending structure: Pool-to-Contract (P2C) lending for stable, automated yield on blue-chip tokens like ETH and MATIC, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending for higher-yield, customizable loans on tokens like DOGE and PEPE. For long-term ETH holders, Mutuum is preparing to offer an efficient way to earn passive income without giving up price exposure. After launch, depositing ETH into a P2C pool will allow users to earn a variable APY based on platform utilization and borrower demand. In return, users will receive mtTokens—ERC-20 tokens that automatically accrue interest. These mtTokens will also be stakeable, unlocking MUTM token rewards that come from real protocol revenue and are distributed through smart contract-controlled buyback mechanisms. This model is designed to cycle value directly back to the most active participants. Risk-tolerant investors will be able to leverage the upcoming P2P model to seek higher returns by lending to borrowers who provide niche or volatile tokens as collateral. For instance, a lender could arrange a 20-day loan on 1,500 USDC, accepting PEPE tokens as collateral with 13% interest and a 70% loan-to-value ratio. Unlike pooled lending, these P2P deals will be fully isolated, meaning individual risk doesn’t affect the broader ecosystem—a structure that opens up high-upside potential for those looking to build their own terms. Supporting this flexible lending architecture will be a Stability Factor-based liquidation system, designed to trigger automatic liquidations when borrower collateral falls below safe thresholds. In these cases, third-party liquidators will step in to repay the lender and secure the collateral, keeping the system solvent and reinforcing long-term protocol reliability. As the DeFi market accelerates and Ethereum (ETH) continues its climb, the smart money is rotating into tokens with structure, transparency, and actual revenue models. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the next step forward—and the $0.03 window won’t be open much longer.

On Wednesday, Moynihan said that the bank is working to launch a stablecoin; however, the timeline is unclear. “We feel both the industry and ourselves will have responses. We’ve done a lot of work,” Moynihan told Reuters . He added that investors can expect the lender to move forward with it soon. The second-largest U.S. bank initially touted its dollar-pegged stablecoin launch in February, stressing how regulatory developments could shape its adoption. “It’s pretty clear there’s going to be a stablecoin,” Moynihan confirmed at the time, provided legal frameworks allowed it. BofA Aims to Rollout Stablecoin When Client Demand is High Additionally, CEO Moynihan noted that BofA is trying to understand customer demand in the space, which isn’t high currently. “[The bank] would roll out a stablecoin at an appropriate time, likely in partnership with other players,” he added. Further, the progress has been slower than anticipated by some investors, as banks are still awaiting legal clarity. On Wednesday, Trump announced that 11 of the 12 House representatives have agreed to support the GENIUS ACT bill. The legislation allows for the establishment of a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The move comes after the House voted 196–222 against advancing the bill on Tuesday and temporarily stalling progress on a wider crypto legislative package.

This is a good opportunity for us,” said Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup. Besides, Morgan Stanley is following stablecoin developments closely, CFO Sharon Yeshaya noted. She said that the bank is looking into stablecoin use cases and how clients would benefit from it. “But, it really is a little early to tell, especially for the businesses we run versus businesses that you might see from competitors, on how a stablecoin would play in,” she added.

DOGE is now consolidating and might aim for a move above $0.2120. DOGE price started a fresh increase above the $0.1880 and $0.20 levels. The price is trading above the $0.20 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.2060 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start a fresh rally if it clears the $0.2120 and $0.2180 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Eyes More Gains Dogecoin price started a fresh increase from the $0.1880 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE was able to climb above the $0.1950 and $0.200 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above the $0.2120 resistance. Finally, the price traded close to the $0.2220 resistance. A high was formed at $0.2205 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1885 swing low to the $0.2205 high. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.2020 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Besides, there is a bullish trend line forming with support at $0.2060 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.2120 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.2150 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.2220 level. A close above the $0.2220 resistance might send the price toward the $0.2320 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.250 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.2650. Downside Correction In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.2120 level, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.2060 level or the trend line zone. The next major support is near the $0.2040 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1885 swing low to the $0.2205 high. The main support sits at $0.20. If there is a downside break below the $0.20 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.1950 level or even $0.1880 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now above the 50 level.

Price targets $0.00004676–$0.00005876 next as bullish momentum and market interest continue to grow. BONK Breaks Resistance, Extends Rally Bonk (BONK) rose to $0.000039 at press time, its highest level in several months. The price is up 24% in the past 24 hours and over 75% since this time last week. Daily trading volume has crossed $3 billion, reflecting renewed market activity. Interestingly, the price move followed a clean breakout above a long-term descending trendline and horizontal resistance near $0.00003. The breakout structure remains intact after a successful retest of support, with price now pressing toward the next area of supply around $0.000037. Technical Setup Points to $0.00004676–$0.00005876 Range Crypto analyst Professor Moriarty noted the chart shift earlier in the week. “After several attempts, it finally broke through resistance and held above it,” he posted. $BONK is up 49% since my last post After several attempts, it finally broke through resistance and held above it Now it’s facing the next key zone. If it keeps the bullish momentum and breaks it with confidence, the road to new highs will be wide open https://t.co/P12lJS8aqJ pic.twitter.com/KxoqBZxVe5 — Professor Moriarty (@Moriarty_web3) July 16, 2025 BONK is now approaching a price zone that previously capped upside in late 2024. While clearing this region in volume, the subsequent targets to monitor are at $0.00004676 and $0.00005876. These levels converge with previous swing highs and may act as short-term objectives should the current trend persist. Broader Market Tailwinds Support Move BONK’s breakout comes as broader crypto sentiment improves. Open interest is rising across major exchanges, and risk appetite has returned to the meme coin sector. Notably, the token was recently added to Grayscale’s institutional tracking list, which some market watchers see as a step toward broader legitimacy. For now, BONK trades just below a key resistance band. A near break above 0.000037 would be a sign of continuation. A failure to clear this area may deliver a short-term consolidation or test of support at around the $0.000029 level.

The total PENGU balance across these three wallets has reached 2.92 billion tokens (approximately $96.73 million), equivalent to 3.8% of the total circulating supply.

According to the analysis , Binance, OKX, Bybit, and Bitget are the top four exchanges in Q2 2025 in terms of spot and derivatives markets. As Bitcoin skyrocketed in recent days and made history with the value of $122,000, the crypto exchanges’ activity increased. Top Four Cryptocurrency Exchanges in Q2 2025 Binance: Binance held a trading volume share of 35.39%, making a strong position in the global competition. Despite the slight decrease from Q1 2025, which was approximately 36.57%, Binance’s share trading volume remained the largest market during Q2 of the year. OKX: The OKX’s market share increased by 1.08%, marking 14.34% in Q2 2025. The increased percentage suggests that OKX attracted more trading activity, probably due to strong product offerings, deeper liquidity in derivatives, and other promotional activities. Bybit: In Q2 2025, Bybit dipped from 13.06% to 12.26% but still retained its position in the top crypto exchanges for the year. Despite enduring the largest crypto hack of $1.5 billion in February 2025, the exchange replenished its reserves within 72 hours and took decisive measures to reinforce users’ trust. Bitget: Bidet added over 2 million new users in Q2 2025, contributing to a higher platform activity of 11.45%. Driven by its product innovation, such as AI-powered tools, the platform expanded its global reach, marking a slight increase of 0.14% from Q1 2025. What Contributed to the Trading Volume of Crypto Exchanges in Q2 2025? With new laws, clarity in regulations, and high demand for crypto assets, the crypto exchange market reached $21.6 trillion with its top 10 crypto exchanges in Q2 2025. The value of Bitcoin , Ethereum , Solana, and other crypto assets has surged, likely contributing to the trading volume of exchanges. However, despite all contributions, the overall trading volume across the top exchanges declined in Q2. The downfall is likely an outcome of the hesitant retailer participation, slow regulatory progress, geopolitical tensions, and legal uncertainties.",News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING|MARKET|BNB|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-17 05:22:08

ARK also recently offloaded Coinbase shares, along with smaller sales of Robinhood and Block stock. Meanwhile, a look at government Bitcoin holdings reveals that Bulgaria may have missed out on a $25 billion windfall after selling 213,519 BTC that was seized in 2017. Critics say the early sale showed very poor foresight, and contrasts very sharply with countries like the US, China, and the UK, which all hold large Bitcoin reserves. ARK Invest Dumps Bitcoin ETF Shares Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest made its largest share sale of the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) since the fund's mid-June stock split. It offloaded 225,742 ARKB shares from its ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) on Tuesday. The transaction brought in approximately $8.7 million based on ARKB’s closing price of $38.70. Although this marks the biggest single-day ARKB sale by volume, it still trails the firm’s previous record in dollar terms, which is a $12 million sale in April that involved 159,496 shares. This move happened shortly after ARKB completed a 3-for-1 stock split , which effectively tripled the number of shares and reduced the price per share from roughly $90 to around $30. Despite the split, the fund’s market value remained unchanged, and ARKB recently traded near record highs, peaking at $39.3 on July 6. When adjusted for the stock split, that price equates to an all-time high of approximately $117.9 per share. Stock split announcement In addition to reducing its exposure to ARKB, ARK Invest also sold 34,207 shares of Coinbase (COIN) on Tuesday, bringing in $13.3 million. This sale took place after a series of recent profit-taking actions involving Coinbase, including $2 million worth of shares sold last Thursday and another $2 million sold the following day from its ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK). The firm also reduced its holdings in Robinhood and Block last week by selling 58,504 Robinhood shares for $5.6 million and 24,780 Block shares for $1.7 million. ARK's Circle sales on June 23 (Source: ARK Invest) While ARK has been very active in selling off several high-profile holdings, it paused further reductions in its Circle (CRCL) position after divesting 415,844 shares worth about $110 million on June 23. These strategic moves suggest ARK is rebalancing its portfolios and taking advantage of strong market performance in its crypto-related holdings. Selling Bitcoin Early Cost Bulgaria Billions ARK Invest is not alone in its profit taking spree. In 2017, Bulgaria made headlines by seizing 213,519 Bitcoin, which was valued at around $3.5 billion at the time. This was enough to cover a very large portion of the country’s national debt. The government reportedly sold the Bitcoin the next year, but there is still some speculation that it may hold some of the digital assets despite official denials. Today, that same Bitcoin stash would be worth more than $25.24 billion, which is more than Bulgaria’s current public debt of $24 billion, according to World Economics data. Bulgaria Bitcoin holdings (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) While some may see the early liquidation as a missed opportunity, experts offer a more nuanced perspective. Alex Obchakevich , founder of Obchakevich Research, explained that Bitcoin’s volatility made it difficult to treat as a stable reserve asset. He argued that the risks of a sharp decline in value likely outweighed the potential upside at the time. A more balanced strategy, he said, would have involved holding 10–15% of the Bitcoin, slowly liquidating the rest, and using derivatives for hedging. Others, however, were more critical of the government’s move. Robert Znidar , director at Iconomi, attributed the decision to a lack of understanding of Bitcoin’s philosophy and long-term utility. He believes that given today’s increased institutional acceptance of crypto, such a decision would likely not be repeated. Similarly, Bulgarian native and co-CEO of Web3 market maker Enflux, Valentin Mihov , reflected on how governments at the time misunderstood crypto’s strategic potential. He acknowledged that concerns around custody, regulation, and EU fiscal policy played a big role in the decision, but suggested a partial hold would have been a lot wiser. A 10–20% strategic reserve, he said, could have positioned Bulgaria as a forward-thinking leader in sovereign Bitcoin adoption. The situation draws a sharp contrast with other governments, many of which hold large amounts of Bitcoin. According to recent data, countries collectively hold around 463,000 BTC, about 2.3% of the total supply. Governments holding Bitcoin (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) The United States leads with over 198,000 BTC, followed closely by China with 190,000. Other top holders include the United Kingdom with 61,245 BTC, Ukraine with 46,351, and North Korea with 13,562, much of which was reportedly acquired through state-sponsored cyberattacks.

That question haunts every late investor who missed early gems like PEPE or BONK. In a week where XRP futures just set a massive new record on CME with volumes crossing $1.6 billion, institutional confidence is creeping back into crypto. Regulated growth is heating up. Despite this broader market stabilization, two altcoins have been bucking bearish sentiment with sharp moves: Turbo and AI Companions. Turbo has been climbing the charts with meme coin momentum and fresh AI integration, while AI Companions have shown a sharp increase in trading volume and investor attention. However, for those seeking something untouched, raw, and still off the public radar, only one new contender is currently wide open: MoonBull . MoonBull whitelist is officially live, offering early access to one of 2025’s most hyped 100x cryptos. This is a first-come, first-served opportunity – once the list fills, it will be closed for good. Don’t sleep on it. MoonBull Whitelist Is Live and It’s the Only 100x Crypto With First-Mover Advantage MoonBull ($MOBU) is turning heads as the freshest Ethereum meme coin built for true degens. But it’s not just the theme or timing that matters – it’s the whitelist. Currently, only a limited number of spots are available. Those who jump in get the lowest entry price, secret staking rewards, exclusive bonus allocations, and early insight into MoonBull’s roadmap. The MoonBull whitelist isn’t a gimmick. It’s a gate. It offers first access before the crowd floods in. While anyone can eventually enter Stage 1 when it goes public, only whitelisted members receive private launch notifications in advance. That means getting in before the noise, before the price shoots up, and before the masses even know the timer has started. Why the MoonBull Whitelist Might Be Your Final Golden Ticket In crypto, timing isn’t just important – it’s everything. The MoonBull whitelist hands out rare front-row access for a launch that’s strictly first-come, first-served. Once spots fill, that door slams shut. No second chances. No late-night leaks. All updates drop straight to whitelist inboxes before the public even knows what hit them. Getting whitelisted means locking in the rock-bottom price. It means collecting juicy bonus tokens before any listings go live. It means unlocking elite staking rewards that most won’t even hear about. Most of all, it means entering a VIP launch tier where only the earliest, savviest degens are seated. In a market overflowing with noise and delay, Moon Bull cuts straight to business. There’s no fluff. No fake promises. Just an exclusive, early-access opportunity built to reward speed and belief. For anyone who’s missed the last round of 100x cryptos, this might be the last window before the rocket takes off. Turbo Token: Firing on All Cylinders With Meme Energy and AI Fuel Turbo is up 75% this year, 55% in the past month, and another 55% just this week. Earlier today, it surged 35%, blowing through resistance levels and catching the eye of meme coin hunters. Part of that spike came from a massive partnership announcement with PAAL AI. This collab unlocked new in-community tools for Turbo holders, including meme generators, market bots, and AI-based analysis in real-time. What sets Turbo apart is its hybrid nature. It started as a digital art experiment but evolved into a high-utility meme project powered by AI. Traders are drawn not just to the charts, but to the experience Turbo builds. With RSI and MACD flashing green and Fibonacci patterns pointing sky-high, Turbo’s chart is giving technical bulls something to cheer about. Altcoin season rumors are intensifying, and Turbo is well-positioned for continued upward momentum. As BTC floats above $123K and ETH regains strength above $3K, Turbo is soaking in the spillover liquidity. However, it’s essential to note that Turbo has already made several significant moves. It’s an in-progress rocket. Traders seeking the next untapped 100x crypto moonshot may want to shift their attention toward MoonBull. AI Companions: AIC Volume Spikes, But Price Recovery Still Underway AI Companions (AIC) saw its trading volume skyrocket 446% in just 24 hours, reaching $7.3 million. That’s a strong signal of renewed interest. The current price sits at $0.1089, up nearly 195% from its all-time low of $0.03751. However, it’s still nearly 80% down from its all-time high of $0.5446. The market cap of AI Companions hovers at $110 million, ranking it #454 on CoinGecko. This mid-tier placement means there’s still room to grow, but the coin is already well into its maturity curve. AI Companions was built to offer interactive AI agents across DeFi platforms, targeting both developers and community managers. That utility has drawn a loyal user base, and the token has held fairly steady despite dips. Compared to other trending projects, AIC is on the path to recovery. It’s no longer a micro-cap flyer, but it hasn’t yet crossed into blue-chip safety either. While it holds promise for stable gains, those who missed earlier 100x cryptos may not find the insane multiplier potential here. MoonBull, with its live whitelist and untouched market cap, offers that clean-slate entry that speculative investors crave. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, MoonBull stands out as the only true under-the-radar contender among today’s hottest altcoins. While Turbo is already revving its engine and AI Companions is working its way out of the dip, MoonBull is still chilling behind the gate, but that gate’s about to swing wide open. The MoonBull whitelist isn’t just another form – it’s a one-way ticket to get in before the FOMO frenzy kicks off. Every minute counts. The limited whitelist spots are disappearing quickly, and those who secure them now will enter at the floor level before MoonBull gains mainstream attention. With elite staking perks, bonus token drops, and private roadmap insights, this meme coin might just become the biggest 100x crypto of 2025. For traders tired of being late to the party, this is the chance to flip the script. Don’t miss out while others are still sleeping on it. If MoonBull lives up to its early buzz, and all signs say it might, those who got whitelisted will be the ones laughing all the way to the meme bank. Claim your whitelist spot now, before it’s gone. For More Information: Website: https://www.moonbull.io/ Telegram: https://t.me/MoonBullCoin Twitter: https://x.com/MoonBullX FAQs What is MoonBull and why is it trending now? MoonBull is an Ethereum-based meme coin with a live whitelist giving early access to staking rewards, bonus tokens, and secret roadmap info. It’s trending as one of the top 100x cryptos for 2025. How does Turbo compare to MoonBull? Turbo has already surged multiple times, supported by AI integrations. MoonBull, on the other hand, offers a fresh entry with high upside potential as it hasn’t launched yet. Why are AI Companions gaining attention? AI Companions saw a massive spike in trading volume. Its AI tools and utility model are gaining traction again, even though it remains below past highs. How do I get into the MoonBull whitelist?

48391947,https://coinpedia.org/?p=483194,1752730270,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,"Ruvi AI (RUVI) Might Beat Avalanche (AVAX) This Year, Audited And Still Cheap Creates The Perfect Entry For Whales",https://coinpedia.org/press-release/ruvi-ai-ruvi-might-beat-avalanche-avax-this-year/,"The post Ruvi AI (RUVI) Might Beat Avalanche (AVAX) This Year, Audited And Still Cheap Creates The Perfect Entry For Whales appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News When it comes to top-performing blockchain projects, Avalanche (AVAX) has been a dominant force. Recognized for its high-speed transaction capabilities and decentralized application ecosystem, Avalanche has maintained a stronghold in the market. However, analysts are now shifting their focus to Ruvi AI (RUVI) , an audited, utility-driven token with enormous ROI potential and a significantly low cost of entry. With its innovative integration of blockchain and AI, coupled with stellar early-stage achievements, Ruvi AI is positioning itself as a major contender to outperform Avalanche in 2025. Transparency and Security at the Core Ruvi AI has taken significant steps to ensure investor confidence, prioritizing security and transparency from the outset. A third-party audit conducted by CyberScope , a leading blockchain security firm, has validated Ruvi AI’s smart contracts , confirming their scalability and resistance to vulnerabilities. This kind of assurance is critical for investors wary of the risks often associated with emerging cryptocurrencies. Additionally, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange , a globally recognized trading platform. This ensures post-presale liquidity , a vital element for maintaining investor confidence as Ruvi AI transitions to public exchanges. With these pillars of security and transparency firmly in place, Ruvi AI stands out as a reliable option compared to many speculative projects. Presale Milestones That Outshine the Competition Ruvi AI’s remarkable early-stage performance says a lot about its potential. The key achievements so far include: Over $2.3 million raised , reflecting strong market trust in the project. 190 million tokens sold , showcasing impressive adoption. A growing community of 2,300 holders , signaling positive momentum and widespread support. At the current Phase 2 price of $0.015 per token , Ruvi AI offers a highly affordable entry point. By the end of the presale, the token’s price is guaranteed to rise to $0.07 , resulting in an almost 5x ROI before it even reaches public trading. Post-listing, experts predict Ruvi AI could hit $1 per token , delivering an extraordinary 66x ROI for today’s investors. This structured growth trajectory, anchored by tangible milestones, makes Ruvi AI a particularly enticing choice for whales and strategic investors hedging big bets on blockchain technologies. Real-World Use Cases Backed by AI and Blockchain Unlike Avalanche’s focus on decentralized applications, Ruvi AI diversifies its appeal through utility-driven applications . By integrating blockchain technology with artificial intelligence , Ruvi AI aims to revolutionize industries like marketing, entertainment, and finance. Marketing Enhanced by AI Ruvi AI provides cutting-edge marketing tools powered by artificial intelligence. These tools optimize audience targeting, streamline advertising budgets, and maximize campaign ROI. For businesses looking for precise and impactful marketing solutions, Ruvi AI offers a competitive edge. Supporting the Content Creator Economy Content creators globally face significant challenges, from delayed revenue payments to poor audience analytics. Ruvi AI resolves these problems with blockchain-secured instant payouts and AI-based audience analytics , allowing creators to engage their audiences more effectively and boost monetization opportunities. Transforming Financial Transactions Financial systems are plagued with inefficiencies like high international transfer fees and slow transaction times. Ruvi AI addresses these with low-cost, fraud-resistant cross-border payment solutions , streamlining global payments and reducing costs for consumers and enterprises alike. These real-world applications are crucial in creating sustained token demand, ensuring Ruvi AI’s growth is not just hype but underpinned by substantive, widespread value. Amplify Returns with Exclusive VIP Investment Tiers Ruvi AI encourages early investment with VIP tiers that offer significant bonuses. These tiers create lucrative opportunities for investors looking to maximize their ROI. VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These structured investment tiers provide a compelling argument for early whale investors to capitalize on Ruvi AI’s upward momentum at discounted rates. Ruvi AI’s Edge Over Avalanche in 2025 While Avalanche remains a key player in decentralized finance, Ruvi AI’s audited security , early-stage affordability , and utility-focused applications make it a standout choice for investors looking for substantial growth. With a guaranteed 66x ROI potential and its seamless entry into various industries, Ruvi AI is primed to capture significant market share in the months ahead. For investors seeking a project at the intersection of innovation and profit potential , Ruvi AI offers an unparalleled opportunity.

While attention has largely focused on Bitcoin and stablecoin issuers, crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) pointed to XRP as another major token that stands to benefit significantly if the legislation becomes law. In a post on X, SMQKE shared a document excerpt discussing how a regulatory shift, particularly through the GENIUS Act , could affect XRP. The image discusses how a settlement of the legal dispute between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which aligns with the GENIUS Act’s stablecoin framework, may accelerate XRP’s reintegration into U.S. financial markets, while attracting institutional investors and supporting its price. Remember, the GENIUS Act will rapidly accelerate XRP’s reintegration into U.S financial markets which will support its price by attracting institutional investors. Documented. pic.twitter.com/dMsoL8GC8X — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 16, 2025 A Bill Designed to Bring Regulatory Certainty The GENIUS Act, which has already passed in the Senate , proposes a federal framework for stablecoins and seeks to create a clear regulatory environment for digital asset compliance. It is one part of a legislative package that includes the Digital Asset Market Structure Clarity Act and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, all of which passed a key procedural vote following days of internal GOP disagreement. These bills were initially voted down , but have now succeeded by a narrow 217–212 after President Trump intervened directly. He pledged his support in exchange for including provisions from the Anti-CBDC bill in the larger defense authorization package. With this deal in place, the House is now expected to hold final votes on each bill, beginning with the GENIUS Act. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Path to Institutional Adoption The document shared by SMQKE notes that aligning the end of the lawsuit with the provisions of the GENIUS Act could reduce barriers to XRP’s access to U.S. financial infrastructure and restore confidence among large investors. Ripple and the SEC initially chose to settle the legal battle, but the court blocked this move because it sought to modify the final ruling. However, Ripple has chosen to move forward and has dropped its appeal , expecting the SEC to do the same and put an end to years of legal turmoil. This move has cemented XRP’s status, as Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty confirmed that the ruling determining that XRP is not a security remains unchanged . According to SMQKE, this clarity combined with clear rules in the GENIUS Act could “accelerate XRP’s reintegration into U.S financial markets which will support its price by attracting institutional investors.” As lawmakers prepare to take final votes, the implications for XRP may be more immediate than many expected.

This marks the largest single-day inflow in the category’s short but rapidly growing history, pushing total cumulative net inflows to $6.48b. It’s a turning point for Ether ETFs, which initially faced investor hesitation following their approval last year. BlackRock’s ETHA led the pack with a staggering $499.25m in net inflows in one day, bringing its cumulative total to $7.11b. The ETF now holds $7.73b in net assets, with a market share of 1.90% of all Ethereum. Fidelity’s FETH followed with $113.31m in inflows, while Grayscale’s ETHE added $33.04m despite lingering effects from early redemptions. Source: SoSoValue Ethereum Tops $3,200, Outpaces Bitcoin and Solana in Daily Gains The surge came as Ethereum crossed the key $3,200 threshold, rising more than 6.8% on the day to trade near $3,347. It outpaced both Bitcoin and Solana , reflecting growing institutional interest in the asset. Daily volumes soared, and total value traded across ETH spot ETFs reached $2.59 billion. Open interest in ETH futures has also reached a new peak of $45b, up 60% since late June. This surge in derivatives activity points to increased institutional positioning and heightened expectations of further price momentum. ETH Gains Attributed to Staking Yields, Deflation and Long-Term Utility Bitget Wallet CMO Jamie Elkaleh said Ethereum’s current momentum signals more than short-term bullishness. “Ethereum is emerging as the yield-generating infrastructure play,” he said, citing staking yields of 4% to 6% and deflationary supply mechanics post-EIP-1559. “BlackRock’s accumulation of ETH is not just about price upside—it’s a strategic position in what many see as the backbone of future onchain finance,” he added. ETH ETFs are now seen as a bridge between crypto-native strategies and traditional finance. BlackRock’s accumulation, for instance, is widely viewed as a long-term bet on Ethereum’s growing role in powering decentralized finance, NFTs and Web3 infrastructure. Investor Confidence Returns as Redemption Pressure Fades These record inflows are especially notable considering that many ETFs struggled with outflows during their early months, largely due to Grayscale trust redemptions. The July reversal suggests renewed investor confidence, now that redemption-driven selling has waned. Despite the bullish narrative, risks persist. Regulatory ambiguity around whether ETH qualifies as a security continues to hang over the market. Meanwhile, competition from high-speed alternatives like Solana and Layer 2 scaling solutions could splinter Ethereum’s dominance. Still, Ethereum’s appeal lies in its dual identity, as both a yield-bearing financial instrument and the backbone of onchain innovation.

Once passed, this new law will introduce the first official rules for stablecoins in the United States. It will focus on making stablecoins safer, more transparent, and widely accepted in the financial system. USD1 Stablecoin Set to Benefit from GENIUS Act Analyst Dr. Altcoin explained how this could benefit USD1, a stablecoin created by World Liberty Financial. USD1 is backed one-to-one with the US dollar and supported by assets like cash and US Treasuries. It has already been listed on major centralized exchanges , including MEXC, where it is paired with Pi, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies. The GENIUS Act includes strict requirements. It bans unbacked algorithmic stablecoins, demands one-to-one reserve backing, monthly public reserve updates, and yearly audits. It also limits big tech companies from launching their own stablecoins unless they follow all the rules. Additionally, the bill allows for freezing or burning tokens for national security reasons. Pi Network Gains Stability with USD1 Pairing For the Pi Network, this is a great opportunity. The new PI/USD1 trading pair means Pi users now have access to a more stable, regulated, and trustworthy trading environment. This helps with accurate price discovery, better liquidity, and makes Pi more attractive to institutional investors. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Bills Clear Procedural Hurdles in House After Tuesday’s Failure , As USD1 gains popularity and gets listed on more exchanges, Pi Network could see increased attention and use. The GENIUS Act is not just about setting rules. It is about building a stable and compliant future for crypto. With strong support and a growing ecosystem, Pi Network and USD1 may be at the center of the next wave of crypto adoption . Pi Network has dropped 23% over the past month and is now trading at around $0.4399. The price has been moving sideways, staying in the $0.40 to $0.50 range as selling pressure continues to build due to unlocked token supply. For Pi to see a strong upward move, it needs to break above the $0.80 level. Until then, any small bounce from the current zone is likely to face resistance and lead to more price pressure. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Unlike CME, most other issuers are jumping at the chance to bring the speculative tokens closer to investors. For instance, asset managers like VanEck and 21Shares are pushing forward with plans to introduce spot ETPs pegged to meme tokens such as Dogecoin and TRUMP. CME launched crypto derivative products tied to Solana and XRP CME’s global head of cryptocurrency products, Gio Vicioso, remarked, “We’re launching these products based on underlying coins and tokens that have a use case, so I don’t anticipate that we will be doing anything in the meme coin space, as the use case for such products is really not there.” In the last few months, the exchange launched crypto derivative products tied to only major cryptocurrencies, Solana, XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. So far, they are doing well. CME’s Solana Futures started trading on March 17 and have seen close to $5 billion in total trading volume, with daily volumes fluctuating between $75 million and $100 million. Shortly after the launch, even Vicioso claimed the futures had received strong early support, emphasizing the firm’s intent to equip investors with instruments to build cryptocurrency portfolios. The firm’s XRP futures launched in May are also close to reaching $2 billion in cumulative trading, hitting a peak daily volume of $235 million last Friday. The products have only been accessible from Sunday 6 p.m. ET to Friday 5 p.m. ET, pausing daily for one hour of routine maintenance. However, the CME is thinking of giving traders 24/7 access. Vicioso stated that it’s important they bridge the downtime from Friday evening to Sunday evening, given the rising demand from traders. The Nasdaq and NYSE are already making progress in modernizing infrastructure for 24/7 trading, in response to increased activity in crypto and other volatile asset categories. Crypto exchanges were quick to list Trump’s meme coin While the CME distances itself from meme coins, many crypto exchanges have taken a more welcoming stance, some more eagerly than others. According to Reuters, major crypto exchanges were much quicker to list the Trump Coin than other meme coins, despite their pledges to adequately evaluate “risky” tokens before issuing them. Some exchanges approved the asset while the majority of tokens were still held by Trump and his associates—a scenario typically viewed as high risk, since insider sell-offs could crash the price and harm other investors. Just 48 hours after launch, TRUMP had been picked up by eight of the world’s largest crypto exchanges. Coinbase followed by adding the token on its roadmap on January 18, and finally listing it on January 21. Upbit was the last of the top 10 to list it, on February 13. Analysts claim, however, that they listed the token much faster than some of the largest meme coins. The same 10 exchanges, Binance, Gate.io, Bitget, MEXC, OKX, Coinbase, Bybit, Upbit, Crypto.com, and HTX, took an average of 129 days to list the four other top meme coins by market cap as of May 29: Pepe, Bonk, Fartcoin, and dogwifhat. In contrast, it took them four days on average to list $TRUMP. Though exchanges Bitget, MEXC, OKX, Coinbase, and Upbit insist they all went through the proper evaluation procedures before listing the token. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

XRP Price Rallies, Ethereum Price Eyes Major Breakout",https://coinpedia.org/news/altcoin-season-alert-xrp-price-rallies-ethereum-price-eyes-major-breakout/,"The post Altcoin Season ALERT! XRP Price Rallies, Ethereum Price Eyes Major Breakout appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After a quiet June, the crypto market is showing fresh signs of life Altcoin season. Top cryptocurrencies, including SEI, SUI, Ethereum, and XRP Price, are making notable moves. According to analysts, this altcoin rally might be led by solid Layer-1 blockchains , marking a shift away from the memecoin-driven hype. Ethereum Price Breaks Out with Bullish Signals Ethereum price today is leading the altcoin revival, surging 9% to cross $3,330. The breakout above the critical $2,800 resistance level was spotlighted by analyst Michaël van de Poppe , who views it as a strong signal of returning altcoin strength, with Ethereum at the forefront. Currently, ETH is just 9.7% away from breaking out of a massive 4-year-long accumulation triangle, a technical formation that could trigger a parabolic rally. Adding fuel to the bullish momentum, SharpLink Gaming , a publicly traded company, recently purchased 9,424.69 ETH worth $32 million, highlighting growing institutional interest in Ethereum over Bitcoin. Source : CryptosBatman X Post A potential cup-and-handle formation is also appearing on ETH charts, similar to one seen in late 2023 that preceded a 100% price surge. If Ethereum breaks the $3,100 neckline, analyst cryptosBatman expects a rise toward the $3,800 to $4,000 zone. Whales and ETH ETF Shifts Add More Fuel Supporting the bullish case is unusual whale behavior. A major short position with 18x leverage is currently sitting on a $3.5 million loss. If ETH pushes above $3,500, it could trigger a short squeeze liquidation, adding more fuel to the breakout. Meanwhile, institutional attention is growing as Ethereum slowly chips away at Bitcoin’s long-held ETF dominance, attracting serious investor interest. XRP Price Rallies on Legal Hopes and Whale Moves XRP is also seeing renewed momentum, climbing over 7% in the last 24 hours. Analysts say this could be linked to the broader altcoin shift and growing speculation around the final resolution of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC . Although no official ruling has come in yet, investors are hopeful that a settlement or final clarity will open the door for U.S. exchange relistings and institutional adoption. Adding to the optimism, on-chain data shows a spike in large XRP transactions, a sign that whales may be repositioning ahead of a major move. Whales have bought 2.20 billion $XRP in the last two weeks! pic.twitter.com/qpZ2xK7G7J — Ali (@ali_charts) July 16, 2025 BTC Dominance Wanes, Paving the Way for Ethereum and XRP Price Surge Bitcoin’s breakout above $111,000 to $120,000 echoes previous cycles where altcoins followed shortly after. Analysts point to past bull runs, like in 2017 and 2020, where BTC’s gains paved the way for Ethereum and XRP rallies. With BTC dominance showing early signs of decline, history may be repeating as altcoins prepare for their next big move. Overall, if ETH breaks $3,500 resistance level and XRP keeps rising, a bigger rally could follow, but traders should still watch for solid volume and confirmation before going all in. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ethereum price surged over 9% today, breaking above a critical resistance of $2,800. Analysts believe this breakout signals the return of altcoin strength, backed by bullish technical patterns and institutional buying like SharpLink Gaming’s $32 million ETH purchase. Is altcoin season starting in 2025? Analysts say yes. Altcoin season might be beginning as BTC dominance weakens and Layer-1s like Ethereum, SEI, SUI, and XRP show strong price action. A shift from memecoins to utility-driven projects is fueling this rally. Are whales accumulating Ethereum and XRP right now? On-chain data shows large ETH and XRP transactions, suggesting that whales are repositioning ahead of a major move. One ETH short whale is sitting on a $3.5M loss, which could trigger a squeeze. How is Ethereum’s ETF interest growing compared to Bitcoin? Ethereum is slowly chipping away at Bitcoin’s ETF dominance. The growing ETH spot ETF demand highlights increasing institutional interest beyond Bitcoin. What Layer-1 coins are leading the current rally? SEI, SUI, and Ethereum are currently leading the charge among Layer-1 blockchains, shifting attention away from memecoins to scalable, infrastructure-level projects. Why is XRP up today? XRP has jumped more than 7% in the last 24 hours. The surge is likely due to optimism over the potential resolution of Ripple’s lawsuit with the SEC, increased whale transactions, and the overall strength of the altcoin market.",News|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|ETH|ALTCOIN|XRP|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-17 05:53:58
48392987,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=178958,1752731713,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/48392987.jpeg,U.S. Stock Markets Triumph: A Boost for Investor Sentiment and Economic Indicators,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-stock-markets-rise-2/,"BitcoinWorld U.S. Stock Markets Triumph: A Boost for Investor Sentiment and Economic Indicators In a significant development for global finance, the major U.S. Stock Markets concluded trading with notable gains, signaling a wave of optimism that could ripple across various asset classes, including the dynamic world of digital currencies. For those keenly observing the ebb and flow of financial landscapes, understanding the drivers behind these traditional market movements is crucial, as they often provide valuable context for anticipating shifts in Cryptocurrency Trends . Today’s positive close is more than just a number; it’s a barometer of growing confidence that could indirectly fuel broader investment appetite. What Drove the Stellar Market Performance ? The past trading session saw all three major U.S. indices climb, showcasing a robust collective performance. This upward trajectory reflects a complex interplay of factors, from positive corporate earnings reports to promising economic data and shifting expectations regarding monetary policy. When these foundational markets exhibit strength, it often suggests underlying economic stability, which can have a cascading effect on investor confidence across the board. Let’s take a closer look at the numbers: Index Closing Change S&P 500 +0.32% Nasdaq Composite +0.10% Dow Jones Industrial Average +0.53% The Dow Jones Industrial Average, representing 30 large U.S. companies, led the charge, indicating strength in established sectors. The S&P 500, a broader measure of large-cap U.S. equities, also posted solid gains, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite saw a modest but positive increase. This broad-based rally suggests that the positive momentum wasn’t confined to a single sector but was rather a reflection of improving sentiment across the board. How Does This Impact Investor Sentiment ? The closing bell ringing in positive territory for U.S. Stock Markets has a profound effect on Investor Sentiment . When markets are on an upward trend, it fosters a sense of optimism and reduces risk aversion. Investors feel more confident in deploying capital, not just into traditional stocks but potentially into more volatile assets like cryptocurrencies as well. This increased confidence can lead to a ‘risk-on’ environment where market participants are more willing to seek higher returns, even if it means taking on more risk. Key aspects of improved investor sentiment include: Increased Confidence: A rising tide lifts all boats, making investors feel more secure about their portfolios and the broader economy. Reduced Fear: Positive market news can quell anxieties about recessions or economic downturns, encouraging sustained investment. Wealth Effect: As portfolios grow in value, consumers and investors may feel wealthier, potentially leading to increased spending and further investment. This psychological boost is critical because market movements are not just driven by fundamentals but also by the collective mood of investors. A positive feedback loop can form, where rising prices lead to more optimism, which in turn leads to more buying. What Are These Positive Economic Indicators Signaling? The strong showing in U.S. Stock Markets often reflects underlying positive Economic Indicators . These indicators are crucial pieces of data that provide insights into the health and direction of the economy. A buoyant stock market can be a leading indicator of future economic growth, as it anticipates corporate earnings and overall economic prosperity. Some of the economic signals that might be contributing to this positive market performance include: Inflation Data: Signs of cooling inflation can alleviate pressure on central banks to raise interest rates aggressively, making equities more attractive. Employment Figures: Strong job growth and low unemployment rates indicate a healthy consumer base with spending power. Corporate Earnings: Companies reporting better-than-expected profits can boost stock prices and overall market confidence. Consumer Spending: Robust retail sales and consumer confidence surveys suggest a resilient economy. These indicators collectively paint a picture of an economy that is navigating challenges effectively, providing a solid foundation for continued market strength. Understanding these broader economic currents is vital for any investor, including those in the crypto space, as they often set the stage for market-wide movements. How Do Cryptocurrency Trends React to Stock Market Health? While often seen as distinct, the world of Cryptocurrency Trends is increasingly influenced by the performance of traditional financial markets, especially the U.S. Stock Markets . For a long time, Bitcoin and other digital assets were considered uncorrelated or even inversely correlated to traditional assets. However, in recent years, particularly since the pandemic, a stronger correlation has emerged. Here’s how stock market health can influence crypto: Risk-On/Risk-Off Dynamics: When traditional markets are performing well, and investor sentiment is high (a ‘risk-on’ environment), investors may be more inclined to allocate capital to higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a downturn in stocks can trigger a ‘risk-off’ move, leading to outflows from crypto. Liquidity Flows: Positive stock market performance can free up capital or create a perception of wealth, leading some investors to diversify into crypto. Macroeconomic Context: Both stock and crypto markets react to the same overarching macroeconomic factors—inflation, interest rates, geopolitical events, and regulatory changes. It’s not a direct one-to-one relationship, and crypto markets have their own unique drivers (technological advancements, adoption rates, regulatory clarity). However, ignoring the broader financial ecosystem, particularly the health of major stock markets, would be a mistake for any serious crypto investor. The current positive momentum in stocks could provide a supportive backdrop, but crypto’s inherent volatility and unique characteristics mean it will always march to its own beat to some extent. What’s Next for Investors? Actionable Insights The recent positive close in U.S. Stock Markets is certainly welcome news, but it’s important for investors to maintain a balanced perspective. While the current Market Performance suggests strength and positive Investor Sentiment , markets are inherently dynamic and subject to change. Understanding these shifts, and how they relate to broader Economic Indicators , is key to navigating both traditional and digital asset landscapes. For those interested in Cryptocurrency Trends , here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on both traditional market news and specific crypto developments. The interconnectedness is growing. Diversify Wisely: While crypto offers unique opportunities, a diversified portfolio that considers various asset classes can help mitigate risk. Assess Risk Tolerance: Understand that even in a ‘risk-on’ environment, cryptocurrencies remain highly volatile. Invest only what you can afford to lose. Look Beyond the Headlines: Dig into the underlying reasons for market movements. Is it sustainable growth, or a short-term rally? A Resilient Outlook The impressive close for U.S. Stock Markets serves as a powerful reminder of the resilience and dynamic nature of global finance. This positive shift in Market Performance not only bolsters Investor Sentiment but also provides valuable insights into the current state of key Economic Indicators . While the immediate impact on Cryptocurrency Trends may not always be direct, the overall positive economic backdrop can foster an environment conducive to broader investment and growth across all asset classes. As we move forward, a keen understanding of these interconnections will be invaluable for navigating the complexities of the financial world.

This effort follows Tuesday’s failed attempt to advance the proposed legislation to a floor debate during the “Crypto week.” Related Reading: SUI Eyes 140% Move As Price Reclaims $4 – New ATH Imminent? US House Passes Motion To Reconsider On Wednesday, the US House of Representatives voted on a motion to reconsider three major crypto legislations that failed to pass their procedural vote on Tuesday. As reported by NewsBTC, Congress’s lower chamber blocked the motion in a 196-223 vote, with 13 Republicans siding with the Democrats. Following the failed vote, Lawmakers had reportedly planned to hold a vote to reconsider the motion for later in the day, but it was ultimately scheduled for Wednesday morning. On Tuesday night, US President Donald Trump personally met with 11 of the 12 Republican representatives needed to pass the bills, securing their support. The lawmakers met for the second time this week to decide the fate of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act of 2025, and the anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) bill. The motion to reconsider the trio of bills cleared the House in a 215-211 vote, with all Republican representatives voting in favor this time. Now, the US House prepares to hold a new procedural vote later today and decide whether to send the three landmark bills to a final vote. Representative Andy Harris shared on X that “House Freedom Caucus Members will be voting in favor of the rule today after reaching an agreement with President Trump last night.” Under the agreement, the House Committee on Rules will meet today to include “clear, strong, anti–Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) provisions to the CLARITY legislation” to ensure Americans are “protected from government overreach into their financial privacy.” Crypto Legislation Faces New Challenges Despite the crucial approval of a motion to reconsider, the bills now face a new roadblock. Politico reporter Meredith Lee Hill revealed that “there’s another crypto mess unfolding on the House floor.” In a series of X posts, the journalist affirmed that the potential merger of two of the three crypto legislations could pose a problem for the upcoming vote. Seemingly, the House Grand Old Party (GOP) leaders are trying to combine the House’s market structure and anti-CBDC bills after passing the floor. However, Republicans from the House Financial Services Committee are hesitating at that plan, as it “will doom Clarity.” House Agriculture Committee Republican representatives also consider that combining the two bills could kill the CLARITY Act, arguing that “even the threat of doing this emergency rules meeting may have already done so.” Journalist Eleanor Terret added that combining the bills could make CLARITY harder to pass because “they risk losing Dem votes over the anti-CBDC language.” A GOP Senate staffer reportedly told Terret that they are “just hoping the House can move something, anything, so crypto legislation can survive to the next step. We have options to move forward, but no one wants another failed vote that kills momentum.” Related Reading: Top Crypto Exchanges Made $172 Million From TRUMP Memecoin Listing – Report Meanwhile, the GENIUS Act would remain a standalone bill, despite previous attempts to merge it with the market structure bill. Since it already passed the Senate, the bill only needs to pass the final House vote to head to President Trump’s desk. Despite the legislative uncertainty, the crypto market continues to recover from yesterday’s drop, with Bitcoin (BTC) holding the $119,000 area as support.

According to Wedson, although prominent traders have begun to slightly reduce their short-term positions, strong confidence in the market remains. Wedson highlighted data on the “Leading Trader Long/Short Ratio,” examining the trading direction of the 20% with the highest margin balances. This ratio has recently declined slightly from 2.1. This suggests that some high-level investors are taking profits or mitigating risk following Bitcoin's recent surge. Related News: BREAKING: The Obstacles Blocking Cryptocurrency Bills in the US Have Finally Been Overcome However, the ratio is still hovering above 2.5 on the daily chart, suggesting that large-capital traders are mostly holding long positions. The analyst noted that many “whales,” particularly in Ethereum and other altcoins, have increased their long positions, adding that some investors are closing their Bitcoin positions and moving towards altcoins. This shift is creating high market volatility and numerous “traps” throughout the day. Wedson also placed special emphasis on Polkadot (DOT): “DOT is poised to exit its accumulation phase soon.

This impressive movement underscores the growing strength and resilience of the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization. According to Bitcoin World Market Monitoring, ETH has reached a unit price of $3,400, with specific data from the Binance USDT market showing it trading at an even higher $3,410.90. This remarkable performance has captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, prompting questions about the factors fueling this ascent and what it means for the broader cryptocurrency market . What’s Driving the Latest ETH Price Surge? The recent jump in ETH price is not an isolated event but rather the culmination of several contributing factors. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone looking to make sense of the current market dynamics. Here are some key elements at play: Network Upgrades and Developments: Ongoing enhancements to the Ethereum network, such as the upcoming Dencun upgrade and the continuous improvements towards scalability and efficiency, instill confidence among investors. These upgrades promise lower transaction fees and faster processing times, making the network more attractive for users and developers. Growing Institutional Interest: More traditional financial institutions are exploring and adopting Ethereum-based solutions. This increased institutional engagement brings significant capital and legitimacy to the ecosystem, pushing prices higher. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Expansion: Ethereum remains the backbone of the DeFi ecosystem. The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols continues to grow, driving demand for ETH as the primary asset for gas fees and collateral within these applications. NFT Market Resurgence: While not at their peak, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) continue to find niche markets and new applications, many of which are built on Ethereum. Renewed interest in digital collectibles and art contributes to network activity and ETH demand. Broader Market Sentiment: A general bullish sentiment across the entire cryptocurrency market , often led by Bitcoin’s performance, tends to positively influence altcoins like Ethereum. When Bitcoin shows strength, other major cryptocurrencies typically follow suit. Understanding the Ethereum Ecosystem’s Impact Beyond its price, Ethereum stands as a foundational technology in the digital economy. It’s not merely a digital currency but a decentralized platform that enables smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). This utility is what truly differentiates Ethereum and provides long-term value. The ecosystem supports a vast array of innovations, from lending platforms and stablecoins to gaming and supply chain management. This broad utility creates continuous demand for ETH, as it is required to pay for transactions and computations on the network. Consider the versatility of Ethereum compared to other digital assets: Feature Ethereum (ETH) Bitcoin (BTC) Primary Function Smart contracts, dApps, digital currency Digital gold, store of value Network Fees (Gas) Paid in ETH Paid in BTC Ecosystem DeFi, NFTs, Gaming, Enterprise Solutions Payment network, Lightning Network Consensus Mechanism (post-Merge) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Proof-of-Work (PoW) This table highlights how Ethereum’s design as a programmable blockchain gives it a unique position and significant influence over the future of decentralized technology. Navigating the Volatile Cryptocurrency Market While the recent surge in ETH price is exciting, it’s important to remember that the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile. Prices can fluctuate dramatically in short periods, influenced by global economic news, regulatory developments, technological breakthroughs, and even social media sentiment. How can investors navigate these unpredictable waters? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based on hype alone. Understand the technology, the project’s fundamentals, and its long-term potential. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio to spread risk across different assets. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory changes, and project developments. Reliable sources like Bitcoin World Market Monitoring can provide timely updates. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide if you are investing for the long haul (HODLing) or looking for short-term trading opportunities. Each strategy requires a different approach to risk and capital management. Understanding these principles is crucial for anyone participating in the dynamic world of digital assets. Is This the Start of a Major ETH Rally ? The question on many investors’ minds is whether this current momentum signifies the beginning of a sustained ETH rally . While no one can predict the future with certainty, several indicators suggest positive sentiment for Ethereum. Analysts often look at trading volumes, support and resistance levels, and broader market trends to gauge potential future movements. The consistent development on the Ethereum network, coupled with increasing adoption by businesses and individuals, builds a strong case for its long-term value proposition. However, potential challenges remain, including regulatory uncertainties and competition from other layer-1 blockchains. A true rally would likely involve sustained trading volumes, continued institutional inflows, and a clear path forward for network scalability and adoption. Investors should watch for these signs to assess the longevity of the current upward trend. Actionable Insights for Crypto Trading For those engaged in crypto trading , the current market conditions present both opportunities and risks. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Set Clear Goals: Before entering any trade, define your profit targets and stop-loss levels. This helps manage risk and prevents emotional decision-making. Utilize Exchange Tools: Platforms like Binance offer various tools, including limit orders, stop-loss orders, and trailing stops, which can help automate your trading strategy and protect your capital. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps mitigate the impact of market volatility by averaging out your purchase price over time. Stay Updated on News: Major announcements, partnerships, or regulatory changes can significantly impact price. Being informed allows you to react promptly.

Key Takeaways: B2C2 plans to raise up to $200 million, allowing SBI Holdings to reduce its 90% stake. SBI Holdings has driven B2C2’s global growth, expanding its presence across London, the U.S., and Japan. B2C2 has acquired Paris-based Woorton and registered as a VASP in Luxembourg. Part of the funding will enable SBI Holdings to reduce its majority stake in the company. SBI Financial Services, a subsidiary of SBI Holdings, acquired its 90% ownership in B2C2 in December 2020, following an initial $30 million investment earlier that year. SBI Holdings Drives B2C2’s Global Expansion Under FCA Regulation SBI Holdings has played a key role in the growth of B2C2, which has expanded its presence with offices across London, the U.S., and Japan, and operates under FCA regulation. In its full-year financial results published in May , SBI credited the revitalization of the crypto market following the inauguration of former President Trump as a significant factor driving B2C2’s expansion. Earlier reports suggested SBI was contemplating selling part of its stake in B2C2 in a deal valued around $100 million, though the company denied those claims at the time. The planned capital raise underscores B2C2’s ambitions to strengthen its market position amid an increasingly competitive crypto landscape. London-based crypto market maker B2C2 is looking to raise up to $200 million, partly to allow SBI Holdings to reduce its 90% stake. SBI first invested in B2C2 in July 2020 and took a 90% stake that December. https://t.co/7X03uQH7Jq — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 17, 2025 In February last year, B2C2 secured a virtual asset service provider (VASP) registration , expanding its operations to Luxembourg ahead of new rules being implemented in Europe. At the time, the firm stated that it had officially become the twelfth VASP to be registered on the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier’s (CSSF) public register in Luxembourg. B2C2 operates across the Americas, Asia-Pacific and EMEA regions. In 2023, the market maker acquired Paris-based rival firm Woorton in a bid to expand its European presence. Crypto Venture Capital Surges in Q2 2025 Venture capital investment in the crypto sector rebounded strongly in Q2 2025, with companies raising a total of $10.03 billion, the highest quarterly figure since Q1 2022. June was the standout month, pulling in $5.14 billion, signaling renewed investor appetite after months of stagnation. Top fundraises included Strive Funds’ $750 million raise in May, focused on Bitcoin-related strategies, and TwentyOneCapital’s $585 million in April. Other notable companies securing capital were Securitize, Kalshi, Auradine, ZenMEV, and Digital Asset, highlighting growing interest across diverse crypto projects. Coinbase Ventures dominated investment activity with 25 deals in Q2, followed by Pantera Capital, Animoca Brands, Andreessen Horowitz, and Galaxy. Dealmaking was widespread across blockchain infrastructure and DeFi sectors, while categories like CeFi, NFTs, and GameFi saw moderate funding. Seed-stage deals made up the largest portion of fundraising rounds, indicating strong early-stage interest, followed by strategic rounds and mergers and acquisitions. Series A and incubation rounds accounted for smaller shares, reflecting a diverse funding landscape as the crypto ecosystem continues to mature.

On the trade front, Trump said he would send a single letter to over 150 countries, outlining the tariff rates they would face and describing most as “not big countries” with limited U.S. trade ties. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) hovered around $118,000 on Thursday, moving sideways after retreating from record highs earlier in the week, as investors weighed developments on key cryptocurrency regulation bills. Gold prices fell to around $3,340 per ounce on Thursday, giving back gains from the previous session. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.22% to 39,439, while the broader Topix Index fell 0.1% to 2,816 during Thursday morning trading, as traders remained cautious after US President Trump reiterated his intention to impose a 25% tariff on Japan. The Japanese yen fell to around 148 per dollar on Thursday, as investors reacted to disappointing trade figures that fueled concerns about a potential technical recession. Japan's trade surplus significantly narrowed to JPY 153.1 billion in June 2025, a substantial drop from JPY 221.3 billion a year prior and well under the forecasted JPY 353.9 billion. Exports fell for the second consecutive month, declining 0.5% year-on-year to JPY 9,162.6 billion. Conversely, imports edged up 0.2% to JPY 9,009.5 billion, defying predictions for a 1.6% drop and marking their first increase in three months. Investors are now turning their attention to the upcoming Upper House election on July 20, amid growing speculation that the government may unveil new fiscal stimulus measures. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.08% to around 3,500 while the Shenzhen Component climbed 0.6% to 10,780 on Thursday, with mainland stocks showing mixed performance as investors continued to monitor ongoing global trade developments. China’s cabinet on Wednesday pledged to contain ""irrational"" competition in the electric vehicle sector, vowing stronger cost investigations and price monitoring, according to state broadcaster CCTV. Trump has softened his stance on China to secure a summit with Xi Jinping and a trade deal, shifting focus from tough rhetoric to quick purchase agreements amid ongoing trade concerns. Investors now await the People’s Bank of China’s latest loan prime rate decision later this week, with expectations for no change. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 0.14% were little changed in Thursday morning trade, after ending slightly lower in the prior session. India ( SENSEX ) fell 0.26% to 82,441 in early deals on Thursday, reversing from an almost flat performance in the previous session. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.77% to above 8,595 on Thursday, reversing losses from the previous session, supported by a positive lead from Wall Street overnight. The Australian dollar weakened to below $0.650 on Thursday, pulling back gains from the previous session, as weaker-than-expected labor data reinforced expectations of an RBA rate cut in August. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that the unemployment rate rose to an over three-year high of 4.3% in June, ending its five-month hold and exceeding forecasts of 4.1%, while employment increased by just 2K, well below the expected 20K gain. Consumer inflation expectations in Australia eased to 4.7% in July 2025 from June’s two-year peak of 5.0%, suggesting a more balanced outlook for inflation risks amid continued labor market strength. In the U.S., on Wednesday, all three major indexes ended in green after President Trump stated he wasn’t planning to dismiss Fed Chair Jerome Powell, easing concerns stirred by earlier reports that he was considering taking action. U.S. stock futures declined notably on Thursday despite overnight Wall Street gains, as sentiment wavered after President Trump’s assurance that he has no plans to remove Fed Chair Powell: Dow -0.16% ; S&P 500 -0.13% ; Nasdaq -0.10% .

While blockchain technology offers transparency, it also exposes financial activities to an unprecedented degree. This is where innovations like Privacy Pools step in, offering a crucial layer of confidentiality. The crypto community is buzzing with the news that Privacy Pools, the innovative on-chain privacy solution, is now officially supporting Sky’s USDS stablecoin. This development marks a significant stride towards enhancing financial privacy in the decentralized ecosystem, especially for those utilizing stablecoins. Privacy Pools: Pioneering On-Chain Privacy, What Is It? At its core, Privacy Pools is designed to bring much-needed anonymity to blockchain transactions. Think of it as a digital mixing service, but with a crucial distinction: it leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to allow users to prove they own funds without revealing the specific source of those funds. This technology is a game-changer for on-chain privacy , enabling users to break the traceable link between their deposited and withdrawn funds. The project has garnered considerable attention, not least because it is backed by none other than Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin , whose endorsement signals the project’s technical robustness and ethical alignment with core blockchain principles. The mechanism works by allowing users to deposit funds into a common ‘pool.’ When they withdraw, the system uses ZKPs to verify that the withdrawn funds correspond to a legitimate deposit, without revealing which specific deposit it was. This creates an anonymity set, making it incredibly difficult to trace transactions back to their origin. For individuals and entities alike, this means: Enhanced Fungibility: Every unit of a cryptocurrency becomes indistinguishable from another, just like physical cash. Protection Against Surveillance: It helps prevent unwanted tracking of spending habits or financial associations. Increased Security: By obscuring transaction patterns, it adds a layer of security against targeted attacks. The Strategic Move: Integrating USDS Stablecoin The integration of Sky’s USDS stablecoin into Privacy Pools is a monumental step. Stablecoins, designed to maintain a stable value, are the backbone of many decentralized finance (DeFi) activities. They are used for trading, lending, borrowing, and payments, making their transaction histories particularly sensitive. Until now, stablecoin transactions on public blockchains have been entirely transparent, revealing balances, spending patterns, and even who interacts with whom. This level of transparency, while inherent to blockchain, poses significant privacy risks for users. By bringing USDS into the Privacy Pools ecosystem, users can now conduct transactions with this stablecoin with a much higher degree of privacy. This means: Private Payments: Businesses and individuals can make and receive payments without revealing their entire transaction history. Confidential DeFi Engagements: Participation in lending protocols, liquidity provision, or yield farming can be done with greater anonymity. Reduced Data Leakage: Protects users from having their financial activities scrutinized by third parties, whether for marketing, regulatory, or malicious purposes. This move is not just about one stablecoin; it sets a precedent for how other stablecoins might integrate privacy features, fundamentally changing the landscape of private digital transactions. What Does This Mean for Cryptocurrency Privacy as a Whole? The support for USDS by Privacy Pools is a significant indicator of the growing demand and technological feasibility for enhanced cryptocurrency privacy across the board. For too long, the trade-off between blockchain transparency and user privacy has been a contentious issue. Solutions like Privacy Pools are bridging this gap, demonstrating that it is possible to maintain the integrity and verifiability of blockchain while offering users the confidentiality they desire. This development sends a strong signal to the broader crypto industry: privacy is no longer a niche concern but a fundamental requirement for mainstream adoption. As more assets become compatible with privacy-enhancing protocols, the entire ecosystem benefits from increased fungibility and reduced vulnerability to financial surveillance. It empowers users with greater control over their financial data, aligning with the core ethos of decentralization and individual sovereignty. Vitalik Buterin’s Vision: The Backing Behind Privacy Innovation The involvement and endorsement of Vitalik Buterin cannot be overstated. As a co-founder of Ethereum and a leading voice in the blockchain space, Buterin has consistently advocated for privacy as a critical component for the long-term success and ethical development of decentralized systems. His support for Privacy Pools underscores the project’s legitimacy and its alignment with the foundational principles of a truly decentralized and user-centric internet. Buterin’s insights often shape the direction of the blockchain industry, and his emphasis on privacy highlights its importance for preventing censorship, ensuring economic freedom, and fostering a more equitable digital future. His backing provides a powerful stamp of approval, attracting talent, resources, and further attention to the critical work being done by Privacy Pools. It’s a clear signal that privacy solutions are not just theoretical concepts but practical necessities for the evolving digital economy. Addressing Challenges and Looking Ahead: The Future of Private Digital Transactions While the integration of USDS is a major win, the path to widespread on-chain privacy is not without its challenges. Regulatory scrutiny remains a significant hurdle, as governments worldwide grapple with how to balance privacy with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) concerns. Projects like Privacy Pools must navigate these complex legal landscapes, ensuring compliance while still delivering robust privacy features. However, the project’s stated plans to expand into multi-asset Privacy Pools indicate a clear vision for the future. This expansion would allow a broader range of cryptocurrencies and tokens to benefit from the same privacy guarantees currently extended to USDS. Imagine a future where any digital asset can be transacted with a strong layer of confidentiality, making the entire blockchain ecosystem more resilient and user-friendly. This forward-looking approach suggests a commitment to making privacy a default feature, rather than an add-on, for digital assets. For users, this development means exploring options for more private stablecoin transactions. It’s an invitation to engage with protocols that prioritize user confidentiality and contribute to a more private digital economy. Conclusion: A New Era for Private Digital Assets The integration of Sky’s USDS stablecoin into Privacy Pools represents a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency privacy . Backed by the visionary Vitalik Buterin , this move not only enhances the utility of USDS but also sets a powerful precedent for the entire stablecoin market and the broader quest for on-chain privacy . As Privacy Pools continues its expansion into multi-asset support, we are witnessing the dawn of a new era where financial confidentiality on the blockchain becomes more accessible and robust. This development is a testament to the ongoing innovation within the crypto space, continually striving to balance transparency with the fundamental human right to privacy.

Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo have agreed to pay a combined $120 million to settle a lawsuit alleging they hid conflicts of interest when selling ViacomCBS shares, which contributed to the collapse of Bill Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management, reports Reuters. The case against the three banks was filed last month by former shareholders of ViacomCBS, now known as Paramount Global. Archegos, a family office that once managed $36 billion, collapsed in March of 2021 when Hwang’s leveraged investment bets in ViacomCBS and other firms fell through. Archegos had about $20 billion of ViacomCBS exposure. The three banks helped Archegos place massive bets on ViacomCBS and other stocks, while at the same time, they acted as underwriters for ViacomCBS in a secondary offering. Investors led by the Camelot Event Driven Fund and the Municipal Police Employees’ Retirement System of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, accused the three banks of hiding their roles with Archegos and selling off their shares to avoid losses. The settlement is pending approval by a judge in New York state court. Morgan Stanley, Goldman and Wells Fargo have denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle the lawsuit. Hwang and former Archegos chief financial officer Patrick Halligan were convicted of fraud in 2024 over the firm’s collapse. Hwang was sentenced to 18 years in prison and Halligan was sentenced to eight years in prison. Both are appealing while out on bail.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-trump-is-about-to-flip-the-switch-for-xrp-heres-why/,"In a recent video shared on X, Levi Rietveld, founder of the Crypto Crusaders community, addressed what he believes is a pivotal moment for XRP and the broader crypto market. Referencing both political developments and ongoing macroeconomic trends, Rietveld argued that President Donald Trump is poised to trigger a significant shift in the financial landscape that could heavily favor XRP. Rietveld highlighted a recent report from major outlets, such as The New York Times, suggesting that Trump had plans to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump denied the story shortly after its release but added that Powell is currently under investigation. This statement is an important part of Rietveld’s broader argument for XRP’s bullish future. Trump Is About To FLIP The SWITCH OVERNIGHT For XRP! #XRP pic.twitter.com/SIVNS39TFj — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) July 16, 2025 A New Direction for the Federal Reserve? Trump cannot directly fire Powell without cause. However, the president would have faced a similar situation with former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, but Gensler chose to resign . Powell, on the other hand, stated that he would resist any attempt by the Trump administration to remove him before the end of his tenure in May 2026. However, Rietveld notes that Trump could fire Powell if an investigation deems he’s not acting in the U.S.’s best interest. Powell has resisted Trump’s calls to cut interest rates . If the investigation leads to his removal, Trump would likely appoint a Fed Chair more favorable to aggressive rate cuts and quantitative easing. Reports also suggest Powell is considering resignation , which would make Trump’s job easier and help create a more favorable climate for XRP and other cryptocurrencies. Digital Assets in a Shifting Economic Climate Rietveld tied this potential change in monetary leadership directly to rising demand for assets viewed as hedges against inflation, including cryptocurrencies. He warned of the long-term devaluation of the U.S. dollar, citing a dramatic drop in purchasing power from 1950 to 2025. According to Rietveld, the dollar’s value has declined to just $0.07 compared to its 1950 equivalent, with the pace of devaluation accelerating significantly over the past few decades. He argued that this environment drives investors toward alternatives like XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, and some experts believe XRP can kickstart the biggest monetary reset in history as the dollar declines. “What we see is the value of digital assets skyrocket” during periods of monetary expansion, he said. XRP, in particular, has shown strong price movement recently, with Rietveld highlighting its eight-day climb and current resistance levels around $3.06 to $3.07. While acknowledging the risks of investing in volatile markets, Rietveld said he believes the odds are increasingly in favor of crypto, especially if Trump implements his preferred economic strategy.

This expansion enhances Supra’s expansive suite of native price feeds across crypto, FX, equities, ETFs, and commodities, cementing Supra’s role as the most comprehensive onchain data infrastructure for Web3 builders. Supra envisions these new price feeds will motivate developers to combine potentially causal macro factors with price-based analysis to develop compelling strategies. For the first time, developers and traders on Supra can natively access critical macro-economic data, all cryptographically secured and delivered with the low latency and high reliability that Supra’s oracles are known for. This unlocks a powerful new category of smart contract logic and trading strategies that dynamically respond to both price action and macroeconomic conditions, all in a trustless, verifiable way. “By adding native economic indicators to Supra’s data stack, we’re enabling dApps, DAOs, and DeFi traders to programmatically incorporate macro-economic variables into their onchain logic, eliminating dependency on centralized data providers or manual offchain integrations,” said Joshua Tobkin, CEO and Co-Founder of Supra. “We’re excited to see what kinds of innovative algorithms and protocols developers will build with these new tools at their fingertips.” Powering the Next Wave of Intelligent Trading Logic Supra’s expanded data stack, combining native economic indicator feeds with high-fidelity price feeds and AutoFi capabilities, provides developers with a more robust foundation for developing advanced trading and investment strategies, such as: Custom Indexing : Supra’s index generator allows developers to construct onchain indices that combine asset prices and macroeconomic indicators. This allows traders to benchmark or structure products that adjust weights based on economic health, for example, allocating more heavily to risk assets when GDP growth is strong or tilting defensively when macro signals deteriorate. Macro-Informed Rebalancing : With native access to timely economic data such as unemployment rates, CPI, or bond yields, smart contracts can automatically rebalance positions to reflect shifts in the broader economy, such as increasing stablecoin allocations during high inflation or adjusting collateral ratios when interest rates move. Compound Algorithms : Developers can design algorithms that merge short-term technical signals with macro-economic context, improving robustness across market regimes. For instance, a strategy might only execute momentum trades when macro conditions are supportive, or pause trading entirely when economic stress indicators exceed a certain threshold. Event Driven Strategies: Protocols can implement onchain logic that reacts automatically to scheduled macro-economic releases, such as CPI prints, GDP updates, or central bank rate decisions, enabling strategies that hedge, rebalance, or shift exposure precisely when major economic data is published, without relying on manual intervention. Dynamic Yield Adjustment: DApps can adjust their staking rewards, borrowing rates, or protocol fees in response to macro-economic conditions like inflation rates or changes in benchmark yields, allowing protocols to maintain stable incentives, protect peg stability, or align returns with real-world monetary trends. Integrating macro-economic data directly into Supra’s native oracle network represents a significant advancement for decentralized finance, enabling developers to build applications and protocols that systematically adapt to changing economic conditions whilst maintaining trustless execution and verifiable data integrity. A Future-Proof Data Layer for Web3 Supra’s vertically integrated stack, encompassing smart contracts, native oracle price feeds, verifiable randomness (VRF), automation, cross-chain messaging, and now macro-economic data, empowers developers with everything they need to build at scale without relying on fragmented third-party solutions. Supra can achieve this through its comprehensive, seamlessly integrated toolkit to build the next generation of DeFi, DAOs, and trading protocols. “Supra is committed to delivering the most accurate, reliable, and comprehensive data infrastructure in Web3,” added Tobkin. “With native economic indicators, we’re giving developers the tools they need to build applications that are not just reactive, but proactive, capable of adapting to a fast-changing world.” Supra invites developers and traders to explore these new capabilities, now available through Supra’s Developer Hub and API suite.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $118,459 (+0.7%) Market cap $2.11 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $42.13 Billion (+18.9%) Circulating supply 19.87 Million BTC All-time high $111,970; May 22, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $119,376 24-hour low $118,000 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $118,459 Price Prediction $ 128,009 (10.76%) Fear & Greed Index 64 (Greed) Sentiment Bullish Volatility 1.77% Green Days 17/30 (57%) 50-Day SMA $ 106,055 200-Day SMA $ 87,760 14-Day RSI 54.56 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin triggered bullish pressure toward $119K.

The price is now making a strong comeback above EMA trend lines. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin faces bullish volatility above $118K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that Bitcoin faced strong bullish pressure as it surged above $118K. Currently, buyers are triggering significant domination, resulting in a surge above immediate Fib levels toward $118.5K. The 24-hour volume has dropped to $2.05 billion, showing a decline in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $118,459, surging by over 0.7% in the last 24 hours. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and trades around the overbought region at 68, hinting that a bearish correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $119,842, it will fuel a bullish rally to $122,349. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $116,412, beginning a bearish trend to $112,323. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bullish pressure as buyers accumulated heavily around recent lows. This pushed the BTC price toward $119K. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $120K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Bitcoin ETF volume is on a rising trend, recording $102.14 million in daily total net inflows on June 30, marking day 15 of a gigantic inflow streak that now totals $4.73 billion. It also marks the third consecutive month of total net inflows totaling $12.8 billion since April. Bitcoin price prediction July 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $109,000, making Q2 its best quarter since 2020. In the second quarter of 2025 alone, it went up by 31%, showing strong market activity and growing investor trust. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $101,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 $101,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 $68,000 $120,000 $160,000 Bitcoin Price Predictions 2026-2031 Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2026 $115,000 $130,000 $185,000 2027 $140,491 $170,100 $216,738 2028 $164,063 $185,068 $244,142 2029 $195,629 $200,312 $255,321 2030 $225,903 $248,568 $270,593 2031 $285,058 $303,555 $350,548 Bitcoin price prediction 2026 Bitcoin might witness slow growth after 2025’s halving surge, resulting in a surge in selling pressure. However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

Cathie Wood of Ark Invest forecasts Bitcoin may hit $600,000 by 2030, with a potential rise to $1.5 million in her bull case scenario after Bitcoin ETF approval (Bitcoin exchange traded funds). Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-17 07:20:00

Sounds like something out of a futuristic novel, doesn’t it? Well, it’s happening. Windtree Therapeutics, a name traditionally associated with healthcare innovation, is making a bold and potentially game-changing move by launching a significant BNB crypto treasury strategy. This isn’t just a small pilot; we’re talking about a deal that could see up to $200 million dedicated to digital assets, marking a pivotal moment for both the biotech sector and the broader crypto landscape. This unprecedented step positions Windtree Therapeutics at the forefront of corporate digital asset adoption, potentially setting a new precedent for how traditional companies interact with cryptocurrencies. Let’s dive deep into what this means, why it’s happening, and the broader implications for the future of finance. What is Windtree Therapeutics’ Groundbreaking BNB Crypto Treasury Plan? According to reports from Business Insider, Windtree Therapeutics has inked a substantial $60 million deal with Build and Build Corp. This initial agreement has the potential to expand significantly, reaching up to a staggering $200 million dedicated to a BNB-focused crypto treasury strategy. For those unfamiliar, BNB is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance ecosystem, one of the largest and most influential players in the crypto world. This strategic move is not merely an investment; it’s a deliberate and comprehensive treasury management approach, aiming to leverage digital assets for corporate financial health and growth. The significance of this development cannot be overstated. Pending regulatory approval, Windtree Therapeutics is poised to become the first Nasdaq-listed company to offer direct exposure to BNB. This isn’t just about holding crypto; it’s about integrating a digital asset into the core financial operations of a publicly traded entity. This decision reflects a growing recognition among traditional corporations of the potential benefits that cryptocurrencies can offer, from diversification to inflation hedging and even new revenue streams. This initiative represents a strategic pivot for a company rooted in a highly regulated industry. It suggests a forward-thinking leadership team willing to explore innovative financial strategies to enhance shareholder value and secure long-term stability in an evolving economic climate. The focus on BNB, a top-tier cryptocurrency with a robust ecosystem, indicates a calculated risk, rather than a speculative gamble. Why Are Companies Pursuing a Nasdaq Crypto Strategy? The decision by Windtree Therapeutics to pursue a Nasdaq crypto strategy raises a crucial question: why are more traditional companies, especially those listed on major stock exchanges like Nasdaq, turning their attention to digital assets? The reasons are multifaceted and reflect a maturing understanding of the crypto market’s potential beyond mere speculation. Diversification of Treasury Assets: In an era of low interest rates and inflationary pressures, traditional cash holdings can lose purchasing power. Cryptocurrencies, particularly established ones like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and now BNB, offer an alternative asset class that can act as a hedge against inflation and provide uncorrelated returns. Growth Potential: Despite volatility, the long-term growth trajectory of the crypto market remains attractive. Companies like Windtree may see an opportunity to participate in this growth, adding a dynamic component to their treasury. Early Mover Advantage: Being among the first to adopt a comprehensive crypto treasury strategy can provide a competitive edge, attracting forward-thinking investors and potentially setting industry trends. Technological Alignment: For some companies, especially those in tech or innovation-driven sectors, embracing digital assets aligns with their core identity of being at the forefront of technological advancement. Accessibility and Liquidity: As the crypto market matures, institutional-grade solutions for custody, trading, and risk management are becoming more readily available, making it easier for public companies to engage. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have been the primary choices for institutional crypto adoption thus far, Windtree’s focus on BNB highlights a growing recognition of other major cryptocurrencies’ utility and ecosystem strength. This move could inspire other Nasdaq-listed companies to explore a broader range of digital assets for their treasury strategies. The Rise of Institutional Crypto Adoption: A New Era? Windtree Therapeutics’ bold move is not an isolated incident but rather a significant marker in the broader trend of institutional crypto adoption. What began with pioneering companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets has evolved into a more diverse and sophisticated engagement from traditional finance, corporations, and even sovereign wealth funds. This shift signifies a fundamental change in how the financial world views digital assets. No longer just a niche interest for tech enthusiasts or retail traders, cryptocurrencies are increasingly being recognized as a legitimate asset class with unique properties and potential benefits. The entry of a biotech company like Windtree further diversifies the types of institutions entering the space, demonstrating that crypto’s appeal extends far beyond the tech sector. Consider the following examples of how institutional crypto adoption has progressed: Institution Type Examples of Engagement Impact Publicly Traded Companies MicroStrategy, Tesla, Block (formerly Square), Windtree Therapeutics Adding crypto to balance sheets, driving corporate adoption. Investment Funds/ETFs Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Bitcoin Spot ETFs (e.g., BlackRock, Fidelity), Crypto Hedge Funds Providing regulated access for institutional investors. Traditional Banks JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, BNY Mellon Offering crypto custody, trading services, research. Payment Processors PayPal, Visa, Mastercard Integrating crypto into payment networks, enabling crypto purchases/spending. This table illustrates a clear trajectory: from early, somewhat experimental forays to a more structured and integrated approach. The approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs in the US further cemented crypto’s place in mainstream finance, providing a regulated and accessible investment vehicle for a wider range of institutions. Windtree’s BNB strategy fits perfectly into this narrative of expanding institutional engagement, validating not just Bitcoin, but the broader altcoin market as well. Navigating the Future: Crafting a Robust Digital Asset Strategy While the prospect of a digital asset strategy offers exciting opportunities, it’s crucial for companies like Windtree Therapeutics, and any other considering a similar path, to approach it with careful planning and robust risk management. The cryptocurrency market, despite its growth, remains inherently volatile and subject to unique regulatory and security challenges. Key Considerations for a Corporate Digital Asset Strategy: Regulatory Clarity: The crypto landscape is still evolving from a regulatory standpoint. Companies must navigate a patchwork of rules and anticipate future changes, especially concerning taxation, accounting, and compliance. Volatility Management: Digital assets can experience rapid price swings. A comprehensive strategy must include risk mitigation techniques, such as diversification within the crypto portfolio, setting clear investment limits, and potentially using hedging instruments. Security and Custody: Protecting digital assets from theft or loss is paramount. This requires robust cybersecurity measures and often involves partnering with institutional-grade custodians that offer secure storage solutions. Accounting and Reporting: Integrating crypto into traditional financial statements requires clear accounting policies and transparent reporting to shareholders and regulators. Legal and Governance Frameworks: Establishing clear internal policies, legal frameworks, and governance structures is essential to ensure responsible and compliant management of digital assets. Market Research and Due Diligence: Thorough research into the chosen digital assets, their underlying technology, ecosystem, and long-term viability is critical. Windtree’s choice of BNB suggests a focus on established, utility-driven cryptocurrencies. For Windtree, the potential benefits include enhanced treasury performance and a cutting-edge image. However, the challenges are equally significant. Managing a volatile asset class within a biotech company’s traditional risk profile will require sophisticated financial management and clear communication with investors. The success of this venture could pave the way for many more companies to follow suit, but its pitfalls could also serve as a cautionary tale. Benefits of Windtree’s Move: Enhanced Treasury Returns: Potential for higher returns compared to traditional low-yield assets. Inflation Hedge: Digital assets can serve as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation. Pioneer Status: Establishes Windtree as an innovator in corporate finance, potentially attracting new investors. Diversification: Adds a new, uncorrelated asset class to the company’s balance sheet. Increased Visibility: Generates significant media attention and investor interest. Challenges and Risks: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their extreme price fluctuations, which could impact financial statements. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape poses compliance risks. Security Concerns: Risk of hacks or loss of assets if not properly secured. Public Perception: Potential for investor skepticism or negative public reaction due to crypto’s perceived risk. Accounting Complexity: Unique accounting treatment required for digital assets. A New Horizon for Corporate Finance Windtree Therapeutics’ audacious leap into the BNB crypto treasury realm is more than just a headline; it’s a powerful signal of a shifting paradigm in corporate finance. By committing up to $200 million to a digital asset strategy, this Nasdaq-listed biotech company is not only seeking to optimize its own treasury but is also challenging conventional wisdom about how traditional businesses can and should engage with the rapidly expanding digital economy. This move underscores the growing legitimacy and strategic importance of cryptocurrencies as a viable component of institutional portfolios. As regulatory frameworks evolve and the market matures, we can expect more companies, perhaps even those in unexpected sectors, to explore similar avenues. Windtree’s pioneering effort with BNB could very well be the spark that ignites a broader wave of corporate crypto adoption, pushing the boundaries of what’s considered a conventional treasury strategy. The journey ahead will undoubtedly have its challenges, but the potential rewards—for Windtree and for the entire financial ecosystem—are immense. This truly marks a new and exciting chapter where biotech innovation meets blockchain revolution.

On July 14, Bitcoin price briefly touched $123,000 before cooling off. While BTC posted a modest 0.7% gain in the past 24 hours, Ethereum surged by 7.3%, XRP by 7.7%, BNB by 3.4%, Solana by 5.2%, Dogecoin by 7%, and Cardano by 3.7%, signaling a potential altcoin season. Why Ethereum Is Soaring: Spot ETFs See Historic Inflows Ethereum’s price explosion is largely driven by unprecedented inflows into U.S. spot Ether ETFs . According to data from Coinglass, July 14 saw a record-breaking $726.6 million net inflow into ETH ETFs—the largest daily intake since launch. Here’s a breakdown of the top ETF inflows: BlackRock’s ETHA : $499.2 million Fidelity’s FETH : $113.3 million Grayscale ETHE : $33 million Grayscale ETH : $54.2 million Bitwise ETHW : $14.4 million Franklin’s EZET : $5.1 million VanEck’s ETHV : $3.7 million Invesco’s QETH : $3.7 million Combined, these ETFs now hold over 5 million ETH, nearly 4% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply (120.7M ETH). .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Altcoins to URGENTLY Accumulate on the Dip , Ethereum Supply Crisis? ETF Demand vs. ETH Issuance Ethereum’s net issuance is unable to keep up with institutional demand. Over the past 24 hours: ETH issued by the network: ~$6.74 million worth ETH purchased by ETFs: Over 107x that amount This massive imbalance between issuance and ETF buying could lead to supply-side pressure, potentially driving ETH prices even higher in the short term. ETH Price Performance: A 40% Monthly Rally As of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,378.77, marking a 40.4% increase since July 1, when it stood at just $2,403.27. The 14-day price gain stands at 30.5%, highlighting growing institutional interest and strong investor sentiment. Is Altcoin Season Here?The latest price action suggests a full-blown altcoin rotation is underway. As Bitcoin dominance shows signs of retreat, capital appears to be flowing into Ethereum and other major altcoins, which are now posting larger gains than BTC. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ethereum’s price is rising due to record inflows into U.S. spot Ether ETFs. On July 14, over $726 million flowed into ETH ETFs, led by BlackRock and Fidelity. This surge in institutional demand is driving Ethereum’s bullish momentum. What caused Ethereum to cross $3,300? The price breakout above $3,300 was fueled by massive spot ETF purchases, far outpacing new ETH issuance. ETFs bought over 107 times more ETH than was created by the network in the last 24 hours. How much ETH do spot ETFs hold now? As of today, spot Ethereum ETFs hold over 5 million ETH, which accounts for approximately 4% of Ethereum’s circulating supply. Is this the beginning of altcoin season? Yes, Ethereum’s outperformance and the rotation of capital into XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, and others suggest that altcoin season may be starting.",Price Analysis|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|ALTCOIN|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-17 07:21:08

While the broader market strolls cautiously, these two assets have bucked the trend, delivering double-digit gains. The drive for their rallies comes from technical breakouts and strong fundamental catalysts. As trading volumes surge and momentum builds, traders are curious if this bullish momentum can push both coins to fresh local highs, or even retest all-time highs. Join me as I decode the same in this price analysis. FLOKI Price Analysis: FLOKI has seen a remarkable 32.63% price increase in just 24 hours, with a weekly gain of 42.2%. It currently trades at $0.0001307 after breaking out from a critical resistance zone around $0.000088. The surge was catalyzed by a series of bullish developments, including the play-to-earn game Valhalla crossing 1 million transactions and 125,000 NFT mints on the opBNB mainnet. The sharp price move pushed FLOKI above its prior resistance at $0.00009681, turning it into new support. On the technical front, RSI has soared to an overbought score of 76.36. However, this often reflects strong bullish momentum rather than an imminent reversal in memecoin rallies. The next resistance for FLOKI lies around $0.000137 , with potential to test $0.000168 if the momentum persists. BONK Price Analysis: BONK is outpacing most of its rivals with a 24.27% daily and 78.04% weekly price rally. Trading at $0.00003924, BONK surged past a long-standing resistance at $0.00002434. The bullish sentiment was significantly driven by Grayscale adding BONK to its Q3 2025 watchlist, a massive credibility boost. Furthermore, the BONK DAO burned 100 billion tokens worth $3.4 million, tightening supply amid growing demand. Technically speaking, the RSI is at 85.92, well into overbought territory. Still, traders seem unfazed as the price action targets the next resistance near $0.00004681. The 60.78% spike in 24-hour trading volume to $2.41 billion confirms strong market participation. If bullish momentum holds, BONK could also aim for its ATH of $0.00005916 . FAQs Is it too late to buy FLOKI or BONK now? Both tokens are in overbought zones, so caution is advised. Short-term dips could offer better entries. Why is FLOKI’s price up today? Key drivers include the success of FLOKI’s Valhalla game, NFT mints, and a technical breakout above resistance. Why is BONK gaining more than other memecoins? BONK’s surge is backed by Grayscale’s endorsement, a large token burn, and increased ecosystem activity.",Price Analysis|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,TRADING|BONK|FLOKI|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-17 07:22:26

Analysts Are Ignoring Dogecoin (DOGE) for This Crypto at $0.03,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-next-100x-crypto-analysts-are-ignoring-dogecoin-doge-for-this-crypto-at-0-03/,"While the market gets distracted by memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE), early insiders are eyeing something far more explosive, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Flying under the radar at just $0.03, this DeFi disruptor is being talked about in crypto alpha groups and whale circles alike. Mutuum Finance presale phase 5 is more than 80% sold out. The presale has been purchased by more than 13500 investors. It has already collected more than $12.5 million. This could be the low price breakout everyone is sleeping on. With July fading fast, time is running out to grab what some are calling the next 100x before it goes mainstream. Meanwhile, as Dogecoin (DOGE) remains on watch, Mutuum Finance is where the real FOMO begins. Mutuum Finance Attracts Attention Mutuum Finance is greatly impacting the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector because it is providing a real-world applicable scalable monetary system. The popularity can even be quantified by the level of the interest of the investors since it has already crossed 13,500 token holders, coupled with over $12.5 million worth of investments that are evidence of the market’s willingness to be able to support itself in the long term. $50,000 Official Bug Bounty Program In addition to enhancing its security and transparency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) further initiated Official Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK, a blockchain security company. The project will reward 50,000 USDT to the hunters that show potential areas of concern through the program. The objective of the bounty program is to obtain adequate coverage in each of the types of vulnerability; it is broken down into the four severity levels; i.e., critical, major, minor and low. The project reflects the active will of the team towards the preservation of its ecosystem and investors’ confidence. Mutuum Rewards Supporters with a $100K Giveaway Mutuum Finance has launched a 100,000 giveaway in an attempt to win over the community as well. The individuals who will participate will be sampled in order to ascertain the list of ten individuals that will receive $10,000 in MUTM as rewards. This grand act does not only determine those who will be rewarded beforehand, but it also indicates that the project is willing to establish a solid and worthwhile base of users. Fueling The Future of DeFi through Dual-Lending Mutuum Finance offers a distinct platform on which users control their assets of decentralized borrowing. The platform employs such double-model structure to provide adaptability together with efficiency that encompass Peer-to-Contract as well as Peer-to-Peer of lending models. Peer-to-Contract utilizes self-executing smart contracts that execute the lending function autonomously with no intervention from humans. They are designed to run dynamically based on changing market prices, providing a variable rate of interest pegged on the present supply and demand of an in-real-time interest. On the one side, Peer-to-Peer model eliminates middlemen and provides an opportunity to be in touch with lenders and borrowers directly. This is even superior towards utilization for volatile goods because it allows customized terms of loans and flexibility based on user choice and his or her risk-bearing capability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly climbing the DeFi charts, having already raised $12.5 million and brought in over 13,500 participants as phase 5 of the presale nears a complete sellout. Priced at just $0.03, this project is gaining serious traction among insiders betting on a true 100x play.

Strong volume, on‑chain metrics and bullish catalysts from fee burns all point to higher targets, if BNB can clear three crucial levels $1,000 may lie within reach. Breaking $700 Unlocks Short‑Term Momentum BNB just reclaimed the $700 mark, a ceiling it hadn’t held since May, underscoring deep liquidity at that threshold. Above $700, the chart forms a breakout, not a pullback, which initiates automated buying and sparks a rally to the subsequent hurdle. Traders who watched BNB bounce back to a high of $700.69 are well aware of that level being psychologically significant, and a clear breakout of that level can push the price towards $800. Clearing $800 Signals Bullish Control The $800 zone represents a 14% climb from today’s level and coincides with the 0.382 Fibonacci extension off the March low, often where strong corrective rallies stall. On‑chain, B inance’s quarterly token burns have removed over 3 million BNB this cycle, trimming supply and boosting scarcity. If BNB closes a daily candle above $800 on solid volume (above 8 million tokens), technical desks will flip $850 and $900 from resistance into support, clearing a path for $1,000 as traders chase momentum. Surpassing $900 Triggers the Final Leg to $1,000 A sustained move above $900 often precedes three‑digit percentage rallies. On July 14, BNB’s futures open interest hit fresh highs, indicating institutional desks are sizing up for major advances. Breaking $900 with widening bid‑ask spreads could ignite a short squeeze, lifting BNB toward its next all‑time high near $1,078 before 2025 ends. With quarterly reports showing Binance Smart Chain daily transactions up 12% month‑on‑month, network demand provides the fuel for that final leg. Hedge with PayFi’s High‑Velocity Upside BNB’s journey to $1,000 hinges on three thresholds—$700, $800 and $900. Clearing each will flip short‑term sceptics into buyers, unleashing fresh capital into the token. As a tactical kicker, PayFi presale Remittix (RTX) offers an asymmetric hedge. It has raised over $16 million at $0.0811, auto‑burns 0.1% per transaction, and settles USDC to 30+ countries in under ten seconds. A $250,000 Remittix Giveaway boosts urgency, awarding $10,000 in RTX to one lucky presale participant. Blending BNB’s large‑cap momentum with Remittix’s payment‑rail growth could capture both stable, protocol‑driven gains and the leap‑for‑leap upside of a high‑utility token.

Just as blockchain revolutionizes finance, ChatGPT is reshaping how we interact with information and AI. This comprehensive guide dives into OpenAI’s transformative AI chatbot , exploring its rapid evolution, key features, and the significant impact it holds for the future of technology and beyond. The Evolution of OpenAI and its AI Models Since its launch in November 2022, ChatGPT , OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot , has seen significant growth, reaching 300 million weekly active users. The year 2024 marked a period of intense activity for OpenAI, characterized by strategic partnerships and major product releases. Its collaboration with Apple for Apple Intelligence and the introduction of GPT-4o with advanced voice capabilities were notable milestones. The highly anticipated text-to-video model, Sora, also debuted, showcasing OpenAI’s expanding capabilities in generative AI . However, OpenAI also navigated internal challenges, including the departure of high-level executives such as co-founder Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. The company faced lawsuits alleging copyright infringement from media organizations and an injunction from Elon Musk regarding its transition to a for-profit entity. By 2025, OpenAI actively addresses perceptions of losing ground in the AI race to rivals like DeepSeek. The company has focused on strengthening ties with Washington while pursuing an ambitious data center project and reportedly laying groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history. Advancements in ChatGPT Features and Capabilities OpenAI has consistently rolled out updates to enhance ChatGPT ‘s functionality, making it a more versatile tool for various applications. Voice and Multimodal Interactions: The conversational voice mode has been upgraded for paid users, offering more natural and fluid interactions. GPT-4o provides enhanced voice capabilities, enabling easier language translation and more engaging dialogue. Coding and Research Tools: OpenAI introduced Codex, an AI coding agent powered by codex-1, designed for precise software engineering tasks. Features like ‘deep research’ now connect with GitHub, allowing developers to analyze code repositories and engineering documents. Flex processing offers a lower-cost option for slower AI tasks, suitable for model evaluations and data enrichment. ChatGPT can also directly edit code within developer tools like Xcode and VS Code. User Experience and Personalization: ChatGPT now remembers previous conversations to customize responses, rolling out to Pro and Plus users. A new ‘Study Together’ feature is being tested to enhance its educational utility. Shopping features provide recommendations, images, and product reviews. Users can also assign ‘traits’ like ‘Chatty’ or ‘Gen Z’ to personalize the chatbot’s personality. An image ‘library’ section was added for easier access to AI-generated images. Business and Enterprise Solutions: OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov for U.S. government agencies, offering enhanced security and compliance. New functions for business users include integrations with cloud services like Google Drive and Box, meeting recordings, and MCP connection support for in-depth research. A data residency program was launched in Asia, mirroring one in Europe, to meet local data sovereignty requirements for enterprise users. Growth and Accessibility of the AI Chatbot The widespread adoption of ChatGPT continues to impress. The chatbot’s weekly active users doubled from 200 million in August 2024 to 400 million by February 2025, a growth attributed to new models and features like GPT-4o. The iOS app alone saw 29.6 million downloads in a single month. OpenAI has also made strides in accessibility, allowing users to engage with ChatGPT web search without logging in. Furthermore, a free ChatGPT Plus subscription was offered to college students in the U.S. and Canada, expanding access to premium features and advanced AI models . Navigating Challenges and Controversies with Generative AI Despite its rapid advancements, generative AI , and ChatGPT specifically, has faced a share of challenges and controversies. Accuracy and Misinformation: Instances of ‘sycophancy’ where ChatGPT became overly agreeable were reported and addressed by OpenAI. More critically, the chatbot has generated false information, leading to defamation concerns and potential lawsuits. The issue of minors engaging in inappropriate conversations due to a bug also surfaced, prompting quick fixes. Privacy and Data Handling: OpenAI has faced privacy complaints in Europe regarding defamatory hallucinations. While the company offers mechanisms for users to object to personal data processing and request deletions, the retention period for deleted Operator data (up to 90 days) has raised questions compared to ChatGPT’s 30-day policy. Ethical Considerations: A new MIT study suggested that using ChatGPT might harm critical thinking skills, with researchers observing minimal brain engagement in users. Concerns about copyright infringement have arisen, particularly with the viral Studio Ghibli-style images generated by the platform. OpenAI has also rolled out safeguards against biorisks to prevent models from giving advice that could lead to harmful attacks. Operational Hurdles: The immense popularity of new features, such as the image generator, has led to capacity issues, causing product release delays and occasional service slowdowns, as acknowledged by CEO Sam Altman. What’s Next for OpenAI and AI Models? OpenAI’s roadmap indicates a strong focus on developing more powerful and versatile AI models and expanding its ecosystem. The company plans to release a new ‘open’ AI language model, its first since GPT-2, in the coming months. CEO Sam Altman also hinted at GPT-5, a ‘unified’ next-gen release integrating technologies like o3, which will replace standalone models. OpenAI is exploring new product categories, including an AI-powered web browser to challenge Google Chrome and potentially its own social media network to compete with X and Instagram. The company is also heavily investing in AI ‘agents’ — automated systems that can autonomously perform tasks like sorting sales leads or complex research. These specialized agents are rumored to come with significant monthly fees, reflecting the high costs associated with advanced generative AI development and operation.

Ethereum surged 20% to $3,339, its highest level in five months, acting as a strong catalyst for altcoins across the board. XRP and Solana followed with 5% gains, signaling capital is starting to shift from Bitcoin into top Layer-1s. Other altcoins like Cardano, Polkadot, and Chainlink are also gaining traction, supported by institutional interest and growing regulatory clarity. In a new video , Altcoin Daily analysts painted a bullish outlook for the crypto market in 2025, breaking down recent political moves, market trends, and bold expert predictions. Crypto Week Push Analysts say crypto is getting a major boost from U.S. legislation. Congress is set to pass three key bills: the Genius Act (stablecoin rules), the Clarity Act (crypto classification), and a bill to block a U.S. CBDC. The Genesis Act has already passed the Senate and is likely to be signed soon, fueling fresh confidence in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Altcoins on the Move With current Altcoin season is heating up as CryptoQuant’s MVRV indicator shows sustained altcoin momentum for the first time in over a year. Capital is rotating out of Bitcoin into Layer-1s like SUI (+36%), SEI (+41%), and ETH (+23.3%), while meme coin interest fades. Continued BTC consolidation above $112K could boost altcoins, but sharp BTC moves may pull liquidity away. Ethereum recently crossed $3,300 for the first time in five months, a clear signal of returning strength to altcoins. $ETH strength is the domino that triggers altcoin euphoria. Not too far away now, play your cards right and you'll be rewarded. — VirtualBacon (@VirtualBacon0x) July 16, 2025 Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe believes Ethereum (ETH) is heading toward the $4,000 mark . He suggests that any short-term corrections or pullbacks should be seen as buying opportunities. I think that $ETH is on the path towards $4,000.

She also urges the U.S. government to use the system and guardrails to ensure crypto isn’t used to blow up the economy. The U.S. lawmakers argued that the legislation has a provision that would let any company listed on the New York Stock Exchange opt out of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulation by digitizing itself. According to Sen Warren, companies could join the blockchain and detach from the regulators’ reach, which would blow up the value of the NYSE. Warren shares concerns about the CLARITY bill She wants to limit US companies (Amazon, Meta, GE) to protect the ""US economy"" / NYSE? Not against NYSE, but it's just one company, fully owned by ICE, market cap: ~$100 billion. Amazon market cap: $2.40 trillion. NYSE ≠ economy. All companies = economy. https://t.co/6Xo6QVgL1p — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) July 17, 2025 One of the provisions Warren is worried about is that the bill would allow projects to raise capital through token sales while using a functional blockchain. Warren said large companies could sidestep the SEC entirely, which could open the door for unregulated corporate fundraising and diminishing investor accountability. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce acknowledged that token classification should not prevent virtual currencies from being subject to securities law. She also argued that many projects should remain under the SEC’s watch since they involve investor funding and central control. “Under the House bill, a publicly traded company like Meta or Tesla could simply decide to put its stock on the blockchain and – poof! – it would escape all SEC regulation. That is a serious problem for our country.” – Elizabeth Warren , Senator for Massachusetts. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse mentioned on July 9 that over 55 million U.S. citizens participate in the crypto economy, equating to a $3.4 trillion market cap. He believes that a regulatory framework for crypto market structure is necessary to secure the future of the industry, which is long overdue. Americans for Financial Reform (AFR) said the legislation would limit the financial regulator’s power to protect retail investors. The consumer advocacy group also believes the CLARITY Act is more deregulatory than FIT21, which was established in 2024. According to the group, the bill could exempt digital assets from the SEC’s regulations, which may elevate scams and theft in the crypto sector. Representatives Maxine Waters and Angie Craig have also shared their concern about the legislation, saying that it limits the powers of the SEC. The U.S. officials also argued that the Digital Asset Market Structure Clarity Act favors the crypto sector more than retail investors and could reduce regulatory accountability in the U.S. The CLARITY Act has already passed the House Agriculture Committee and the House Financial Services Committee and is waiting to advance to the Senate, where its approval is not guaranteed. This week, the legislation was also under the scope during Washington’s ‘Crypto Week,’ which focuses on crypto policies, including other bills under review.

U.S. President Donald Trump said he expects the legislation to be on his desk after passing the Senate. The Anti-CBDC bill also aims to prevent the Federal Reserve from establishing a central bank digital currency for monetary policy. The government agency reported in 2022 the pros and cons of a CBDC as it tried to explore the possibilities of the initiative. Representative Andy Harris revealed that the House Freedom Caucus had agreed to meet later after the vote to add CBDC provisions into Clarity. Maxine Waters, Democrat of the House Financial Services Committee, argued that the GENIUS Act and the Anti-CBDC Act are an invitation for Trump to continue his crypto dealings. Former White House ethics lawyer Richard Painter and Warren have been against Trump’s involvement in the digital asset sector, with reports that his portfolio had surged by roughly $620 million due to his crypto investments.

Google AI is at the forefront of this transformation, recently rolling out groundbreaking features that promise to streamline daily tasks and enhance information access. For those accustomed to the rapid advancements in decentralized tech, Google’s latest AI initiatives offer a compelling glimpse into a more automated and intelligent future, making everyday interactions remarkably efficient. How is Google AI Revolutionizing Business Interactions? Imagine needing to confirm store hours, check product availability, or inquire about service pricing, but without the hassle of making a phone call yourself. Google has just made this a reality for all users in the United States with its new AI-powered business calling feature. This innovative tool leverages advanced artificial intelligence to dial local businesses on your behalf, gathering the information you need and presenting it directly to you. It’s a game-changer for convenience, especially for those who prefer to avoid phone conversations or are simply short on time. The process is remarkably simple. When you search for something like “pet groomers near me” on Google, you will now see a new option: “Have AI check pricing.” Once selected, the system will ask a few quick questions, such as the type of pet you have, the specific services you require, and your preferred timing. The Google AI then takes over, making the call and collecting the relevant details. This feature was initially tested with users in Google’s Search Labs experiments, proving its utility before a wider rollout. A critical aspect of this feature is transparency. Google has learned from past experiences where its AI-powered calling features, which simulated human speech, raised concerns about misleading users. To address this, Google ensures that every call made by its AI system begins with a clear announcement: “This is an automated system calling from Google on behalf of a user.” This upfront disclosure maintains trust and clarity, ensuring businesses know they are interacting with an AI, not a human. The benefits of this AI-powered business calling are clear: unparalleled convenience, significant time savings, and direct access to specific information without the traditional back-and-forth. It transforms how users interact with local services, streamlining routine inquiries and enhancing the overall search experience. While initially rolling out to all US Search users, Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers will enjoy higher usage limits, further enhancing their access to this powerful automation. What’s New with Gemini 2.5 Pro in Google Search AI Mode? Beyond automating calls, Google is significantly upgrading its core search experience. Google Search AI Mode , the interactive interface that allows users to pose complex and multi-part questions, is now supercharged with the integration of Gemini 2.5 Pro . This advanced model represents a substantial leap forward in conversational AI and reasoning capabilities within search. The Gemini 2.5 Pro model is specifically designed to excel in areas requiring deep cognitive abilities. Google highlights its prowess in advanced reasoning, complex mathematical problems, and intricate coding questions. For users seeking highly detailed or technical answers, selecting the 2.5 Pro model from a simple drop-down menu in AI Mode will unlock a new level of analytical power. This integration signifies Google’s commitment to delivering more sophisticated and accurate responses to user queries. The enhancement of Google Search AI Mode with Gemini 2.5 Pro also underscores Google’s ongoing competitive efforts in the AI landscape. Companies like Perplexity AI and OpenAI’s ChatGPT Search have been pushing the boundaries of AI-driven information retrieval. By embedding a more capable model like Gemini 2.5 Pro, Google aims to maintain its leadership position and offer a superior, more intelligent search experience. This continuous evolution means users can expect increasingly nuanced and comprehensive answers to their most challenging questions. This isn’t the first enhancement to AI Mode since its launch. Google has consistently been building out its capabilities, recognizing the growing demand for more interactive and intelligent search tools. Just last month, Google introduced the ability to have a back-and-forth voice conversation with AI Mode, making interactions even more natural. In May, a dedicated shopping experience was integrated, allowing users to view product visuals and receive AI-powered guidance leveraging extensive product data. These iterative improvements demonstrate Google’s vision for a future where search is not just about finding links, but about directly providing answers and facilitating actions. Unlocking Knowledge with Deep Search Capabilities One of the most exciting additions to Google Search AI Mode alongside Gemini 2.5 Pro is the introduction of ‘Deep Search.’ This groundbreaking feature promises to save users countless hours by automating what would typically be a laborious research process. Instead of manually sifting through hundreds of search results and cross-referencing information, Deep Search does the heavy lifting for you. How does it work? Deep Search conducts hundreds of individual searches, intelligently sifting through vast amounts of data and issuing reasoning across differing pieces of information. The result is a comprehensive and fully-cited report, generated in minutes. This capability is particularly useful for in-depth research related to various aspects of life, whether it’s for academic pursuits, professional development, or personal interests. For instance, if you’re exploring new job opportunities, Deep Search can compile extensive reports on industry trends, company profiles, and skill requirements, providing a holistic view that would otherwise take days to assemble. Similarly, for hobbies or studies, it can consolidate information from diverse sources into a coherent summary. The true power of Deep Search capabilities shines in instances where you’re making significant life decisions. Consider buying a new house: Deep Search could provide a detailed analysis of neighborhoods, property values, local amenities, and even financial implications. Or, if you need assistance with complex financial analysis, it can synthesize data from various economic reports and market trends to provide actionable insights. The integration of these advanced Deep Search capabilities within Google Search AI Mode signifies a paradigm shift in how we approach information gathering. It moves beyond simple keyword matching to genuine understanding and synthesis of data, empowering users with comprehensive knowledge at their fingertips. This feature directly addresses the challenge of information overload, transforming it into actionable, digestible insights. The Broader Impact of Google’s AI Advancements These recent rollouts by Google are not isolated features; they are integral parts of a larger strategy to embed advanced artificial intelligence into the core of its products and services. The evolution of Google AI , from automated business calls to sophisticated search models, reflects a clear vision for a future where technology acts as an intelligent assistant, anticipating needs and streamlining complex tasks. The convenience offered by AI-powered business calling has significant implications for both consumers and small businesses. Consumers save time and avoid potential awkwardness, while businesses may see a shift in how initial inquiries are handled, potentially freeing up staff for more complex customer interactions. However, it also highlights the increasing need for businesses to ensure their online information is accurate and up-to-date, as AI systems will rely heavily on publicly available data. Furthermore, the introduction of Gemini 2.5 Pro and enhanced Deep Search capabilities within Google Search AI Mode sets a new benchmark for search engines. This pushes the boundaries of what users can expect from online information retrieval, moving towards a more proactive and analytical approach. For developers and researchers, access to such powerful models opens new avenues for innovation, potentially accelerating advancements in various fields that rely on data synthesis and complex problem-solving. As AI continues to evolve, the ethical considerations surrounding its deployment remain paramount. Google’s commitment to transparency in its automated calling feature, by having the AI identify itself, is a crucial step in building user trust. The ongoing development of AI, particularly in areas that simulate human interaction or perform complex reasoning, will require continuous vigilance and thoughtful design to ensure beneficial and responsible use. What’s Next for Google AI and Search? The recent announcements are just snapshots of Google’s continuous journey in AI development. The company is clearly investing heavily in making its AI models more powerful, more accessible, and more integrated into everyday tools. We can anticipate further refinements to the AI-powered business calling feature, perhaps expanding to more types of inquiries or even international markets. For Google Search AI Mode , the integration of Gemini 2.5 Pro is likely just the beginning. Future iterations may see even more advanced models, greater personalization, and deeper integration with other Google services. The vision seems to be a search experience that isn’t just a portal to information, but an intelligent agent that understands context, anticipates needs, and provides direct, actionable insights. The emphasis on ‘Deep Search capabilities’ also suggests a future where complex research becomes a trivial task, democratizing access to comprehensive knowledge. The competitive landscape will undoubtedly continue to drive innovation. As other tech giants and startups push their own AI boundaries, Google will likely accelerate its development cycle, bringing even more sophisticated features to users at a rapid pace. This dynamic environment promises an exciting future for AI, where capabilities once thought to be science fiction become commonplace tools enhancing productivity and convenience for everyone. In conclusion, Google’s latest advancements in AI, particularly the new AI-powered business calling feature and the powerful enhancements to Google Search AI Mode with Gemini 2.5 Pro and Deep Search capabilities , mark a significant step forward in making artificial intelligence a truly integral part of our daily lives. These innovations promise unparalleled convenience, deeper insights, and a more intelligent way to interact with the digital world, solidifying Google’s position at the forefront of the AI revolution.

As the calendar turned to a new month, it has gained over 62% in just 25 days from last week, June, to when writing XRP at $3.15. Now, with the debut of ProShares Ultra XRP ETF (UXRP) scheduled on July 18, 2025, and a recent groundbreaking partnership with Dubai’s Land Department for tokenized real estate custody on July 16th, many analysts believe XRP crypto is on the verge of a historic breakout. A Game-Changing ETF Launch on the Horizon The ProShares’ decision to launch UXRP, which is the first-ever leveraged XRP ETF offering 2x daily exposure. It marks a major step in institutionalizing XRP exposure for traders and investors, which is slated for July 18, 2025. UXRP arrives at a time when market appetite has clearly advanced with several optimistic factors. With UXRP’s daily 2x exposure, it firmly gives short-term speculators the firepower to magnify price action, especially during volatile momentum phases. According to Crypto Post , this move has the potential to initiate a parabolic rally and could even push XRP crypto’s market cap toward a $1 trillion milestone and surpass Ethereum firmly. Also, the timing couldn’t be more strategic, considering XRP’s recent chart breakout and regained investor interest. Dubai’s Landmark Tokenization Deal Amplifies Utility Beyond trading catalysts, on July 16, XRP’s real-world utility just received a massive boost. Ripple announced a partnership with Ctrl Alt and the Dubai Land Department to leverage Ripple Custody to store tokenized real estate title deeds on the XRP Ledger. These tokenized assets would enable users fractional ownership, with much greater transparency, and broader accessibility to Dubai’s high-value real estate market. In partnership with Ctrl Alt and the Dubai @Land_Department , Ripple Custody will deliver scalable and secure storage for the Dubai Land Department’s tokenized real estate title deeds, which have been issued on the XRP Ledger – enabling fractional ownership, transparency, and… — Ripple (@Ripple) July 16, 2025 With governments that are now validating XRP’s ledger as a public record-keeping solution, its narrative is shifting towards becoming an infrastructure backbone. This adds structural weight to the XRP price and bolsters long-term investor conviction. Confidence Returns In XRP Price Amid Macro Peace Technically, the XRP price has already broken out of its multi-year falling wedge, which had kept the asset in consolidation since its all-time high near $3.40. However, in the past 25 days, it has surged nearly 62% and in intraday increased from $2.88 to $3.15, marking a 9% gain, accompanied by strong trading volumes and a market cap of $185.76 billion. This momentum became possible because of the ceasefire between the U.S., Israel, and Iran, which has created a favorable backdrop for risk assets. Since this geopolitical de-escalation, capital has flowed back into crypto markets, especially into large-cap tokens like XRP and Bitcoin. Notably, Bitcoin’s strength has helped XRP maintain its uptrend, setting the stage for further gains. This capital could be clearly seen on the Santiment chart that shows wallet holders holding 1 million to 10 million XRP have strongly surged in July, which is confirmed by rising exchange outflow, and whale transaction count (>1m USD). Based on this Shibo , an expert declared that XRP “could have the biggest day in history tomorrow on July 18th, while targets near $3.40 are in focus short-term, sentiment points to even higher levels. In another separate analysis, expert Cameron Fous said XRP is on the edge of completing a “decade-long ultimate breakout pattern.” If the token can close above its ATH of $3.40 and hold, many believe it could flip Ethereum’s market cap",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|WALLET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-17 07:41:45

Key Takeaways: Thailand plans to launch a crypto sandbox allowing tourists to convert crypto into baht for spending. The program expands on Phuket’s pilot and involves licensed operators. Industry experts warn the ecosystem isn’t fully prepared. The initiative expands on a prior pilot program focused on Phuket and aims to widen crypto adoption across the country’s broader tourism sector, according to a report by the Bangkok Post . Under the proposed sandbox, visitors would exchange cryptocurrencies through licensed operators and use the converted baht via regulated electronic money platforms, such as QR code payments. Thailand Expands Crypto Sandbox Program The program builds on the concept first introduced by former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra’s Phuket sandbox proposal, which sought to integrate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as payment options in tourist-heavy areas to boost adoption. Licensed digital asset exchanges, brokers, and dealers would be eligible to operate within the sandbox for up to 18 months, with the possibility of extension. Operators must adhere to strict eligibility standards, comply with service limitations, observe spending caps for tourists, and follow anti-money laundering rules to participate. However, the initiative has raised concerns among some industry voices. The Tourism Council of Thailand (TCT) cautioned that the government should ensure the readiness of the entire ecosystem before launching the program. Bhummikitti Ruktaengam, TCT’s vice president, highlighted that many local stakeholders, including those in Phuket, remain unaware of the ongoing public consultation process. THAILAND OPENS DOORS TO CRYPTO-SPENDING FOR TOURISTS – Thailand is rolling out a bold new initiative—foreign tourists can now convert crypto into baht and spend it across the country.

Without clear regulatory frameworks, there is a risk that crypto exchanges could be exploited for illegal activities. Tourism operators are also seeking clarity regarding which crypto assets will be accepted and the scope of permitted exchange services. More Countries Consider Crypto Payments for Tourists In May, Bhutan introduced an initiative that allows tourists to pay for nearly every aspect of their visit using cryptocurrency. The country has partnered with Binance Pay and DK Bank to create the world’s first national-level crypto tourism payment system. The system enables travelers with Binance accounts to use digital assets for payments ranging from airline tickets and visa fees to hotel stays, tours and even roadside fruit stalls. Likewise, Binance Pay has teamed up with French fintech Lyzi to bring cryptocurrency payment options to over 80 businesses along the French Riviera, including hotspots like Cannes, Nice, Antibes, and Monaco. Customers, both visitors and locals, can now pay using stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies at various establishments such as hotels, restaurants, and luxury retailers by simply scanning a QR code. The system offers instant transaction confirmation without gas fees, while merchants receive immediate euro settlements through the platform’s integration.

By 2028, DOGE may potentially achieve a peak price of $0.793921. By 2031, DOGE might touch $1.29 with an average trading price of $1.24. Propelled by a dedicated community of part-time developers and enthusiastic internet supporters, Dogecoin is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Despite relying on borrowed code due to limited resources, its popularity continues to soar, with tens of thousands of social media followers advocating for supply limitations. Having touched its ATH at $0.7376, will DOGE reach $1? Let’s get into the Dogecoin price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Dogecoin Token DOGE Price $ 0.212 (+7.09%) Market Cap $31.95B Trading Volume (24-hour) $3.32B Circulating Supply 150.12B DOGE All-time High $0.7376 May 07, 2021 All-time Low $0.00008547 May 07, 2015 24-hour High $0.2178 24-hour Low $0.1984 Dogecoin price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 8.48% 50-Day SMA 0.18261 14-Day RSI 70.06 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green Days 18/30 (60%) 200-Day SMA 0.176676 Dogecoin price analysis: DOGE at $0.212 following a swift recovery TL;DR Breakdown : Dogecoin price analysis confirmed an uptrend as the price increased to $0.212. Cryptocurrency gains 7.09% of its value. DOGE coin faces resistance around $0.221. On July 17, 2025, Dogecoin price analysis revealed an increasing trend for the meme coin. The coin’s price recovered to $0.212 today. From an overall observation, the currency gained 7.09 percent in the past 24 hours. Buyers’ support was strong yesterday, as the coin started to rally from $0.198, and the price has now been increasing again, reaching $0.212. However, today’s trend mostly looks undecided with a little bullish bias. Dogecoin 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of Dogecoin confirmed a bullish trend in the market. The cryptocurrency’s value stepped up to $0.212 today. Green candlesticks on the price chart signify renewed buying activities. The coin gained significant value yesterday, but now the bullish momentum seems to be slowing down once again as the price is swinging in both directions. DOGE/USD 1-day Price Chart. Source: TradingView The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is expanding, leading to high volatility levels. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $0.216, whereas its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.146. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is trending at the border of the overbought area. The indicator’s value has increased to 70.18 in the past 24 hours. The flattening curve on the RSI graph signifies a balanced market setup. If buyers step in with more support, the RSI level might keep heading into the overbought area. DOGE/USD 4-hour price analysis The four-hour price chart of Dogecoin also confirmed a bullish trend in the market. The DOGE/USD price has been facing increasing volatility toward the $0.213 level on an hourly basis. The increasing volatility signals a higher chance of a trend reversal and more price oscillation in the coming hours. However, buyers are still holding the DOGE price above $0.200. DOGE/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The Bollinger Bands are slowly diverging, leading to increasing volatility. This high volatility signifies higher market unpredictability. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $0.214, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $0.186, showing the support point. The RSI indicator is trending upwards in the neutral region. Its value has increased to 65.69 in the past four hours. This situation hints at a dominance by the buyers, and further appreciation also seems possible, as the price has already fluctuated in both directions during the past few hours and has since settled on the upper side due to increased volatility.

Dogecoin price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s value has increased to a high of $0.212 in the past 24 hours. If buyers maintain their momentum, DOGE’s price might trigger further gains and head toward $0.221. However, a lack of buying interest at the current levels might trigger some selling pressure, which could present slight losses for intraday traders. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.463121 level by 2026. Why is DOGE up? DOGE’s price increased to $0.212 over the last 24 hours as bullish momentum continued around immediate support channels. Moreover, buyers are currently dominating the price action. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.2481 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by March 2027. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support for this meme coin can push it to $1 by 2030. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 3,015.42 DOGE in July; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is trading below the year’s peak price of $0.414, which was observed on January 17, 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.29 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial. Recent news/opinion on Dogecoin Bitwise Asset Management filed an amended S-1 registration for a Dogecoin ETF on June 26, 2025. This time, Bitwise included in-kind creation and redemption mechanisms, meaning that authorized participants would be able to exchange ETF shares directly for Dogecoin (and vice versa) rather than requiring cash conversions. Bitwise originally filed for the Dogecoin ETF in January 2025, but previously, the SEC delayed its review of Bitwise’s Dogecoin ETF, citing market risks and investor protection. See the S-1 revision filing here . The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed its decision on crypto exchange-traded funds linked to Dogecoin. The agency’s filings list three affected products, including the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, and have asked for public comments on the product. Read more about it here .

Our analysis shows that DOGE could cross $1.29 by 2031. Dogecoin historic price sentiment DOGE price history 2013 was the beginning of Dogecoin, and it surged to $0.0004 in the first days of trading. By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, and April saw the lowest DOGE price of $0.142. However, in May, the meme coin recovered back to the $0.249 mark, following some improvement. Near the start of July 2025, Dogecoin is trending near the $0.165 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|DOGE,EN,0,0,MINING|DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-17 08:00:39

WLFI Transition From Voting Rights To Tradable Assets World Liberty Financial, a venture associated with Donald Trump’s family, launched the WLFI tokens last autumn as part of its decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, which also includes a stablecoin called USD1. Initially, these tokens were not designed for trading; instead, they granted holders voting rights on certain business developments, including changes to the platform’s underlying code. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Index Spikes Above 30, But Bitcoin Dominance Remains High, What Next? Early investors were primarily drawn to WLFI due to its association with Trump, banking on the expectation that the tokens would appreciate in value thanks to his backing. The recent vote to allow trading of the tokens marks a crucial shift, enabling market forces to set their prices. This transition is likely to attract a wider array of investors, potentially generating trading fees for exchanges that list WLFI and fueling speculation about the tokens’ future value. Although it remains unclear how this will directly benefit the Trump family, the increased trading activity may enhance the overall value of their holdings, which are substantial. Trump’s Potential Conflicts Of Interest Critics, including several Democratic lawmakers, have raised concerns regarding the ethical implications of the Trump family’s financial involvement in World Liberty Financial. Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Maxine Waters have voiced their worries to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), arguing that the family’s financial stake constitutes a significant conflict of interest that could influence regulatory oversight of the cryptocurrency industry. They pointed out that the WLFI tokens have not been classified as securities by the SEC, which means they are not subject to the same level of regulatory scrutiny as traditional investments like stocks. The White House has maintained that Trump’s assets are managed by a trust overseen by his children, asserting that there are no conflicts of interest. However, the specifics of this trust arrangement remain undisclosed. World Liberty Financial Promises More Details Trump’s company, DT Marks DEFI LLC, was allocated 22.5 billion of the total 100 billion WLFI tokens, with Trump himself holding approximately 15.75 billion tokens as of the end of last year. Reports suggest that the Trump family has generated around $500 million from World Liberty since its inception. Related Reading: BNB Price Stalls: Struggles to Resume Gains While Altcoins Rally In light of the recent vote, the White House declined to comment to Reuters on how the tradability of WLFI might affect the family’s financial interests. A spokesperson for World Liberty Financial indicated that further details about the trading process would be provided soon. The proposal to initiate tradability received overwhelming support, with 99.94% of approximately 20,900 votes in favor. Many token holders expressed their motivations for voting, with some citing expectations of price increases and others aligning their investment with support for Trump.

With this move, XRP becomes the latest altcoin to join the crypto offering that includes Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) futures. While it was stated that CME is one step closer to the spot XRP ETF after its XRP move, bad news came from CME for some altcoins. According to Coindesk, CME announced that there are no plans to launch memecoin products. While asset managers like VanEck and 21Shares are scrambling to launch spot ETFs tied to memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Trump Coin (TRUMP), CME will take a different path. Gio Vicioso, CME's global head of cryptocurrency products, said the company is considering launching products related to cryptocurrencies with real-world use cases, while staying away from memecoins, which are speculative assets. “CME launches products based on the underlying cryptocurrencies that are its use case. So we're not planning to do anything in the memecoin space because the use case for that type of product doesn't really exist.” CME is also considering switching to a 24/7 trading system to align with crypto markets, but hasn't yet officially announced any action.

48398785,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/solana-gains-12-today-ozak-al-could-be-the-next-undiscovered-gainer,1752739538,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/48398785.jpeg,Solana Gains 12% Today -Ozak Al Could Be the Next Undiscovered Gainer,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/solana-gains-12-today-ozak-al-could-be-the-next-undiscovered-gainer,"Ozak AI is already at Phase 4 of its presale, and its cost is projected to go higher as the phases move upward because it is currently at $0.005. With more than $1.34 million already collected, this AI-driven project is causing some murmurs in the crypto realm with an indication that it may very well be the next great one to break out. What is Driving the Very Fast Pace of Growth of Ozak AI? The low price of Ozak AI is not the only reason why investors are looking at this project. As data analysis, automation, and decision-making with the help of artificial intelligence become more essential, Ozak AI establishes itself as a utility-centered platform incorporating AI solutions into the Web3 ecosystem directly. On the one hand, due to tokenomics that provides incentives to the early adopters and an actively growing community, the project has gained momentum quickly. The current Phase 4 of the presale, which is still going on, has already created great demand, along with the $1M giveaway , and the clock is against the buyers to draw in at the $0.005 rate before it can go upwards. Solana Trading Activity is Ahead, but the Barrier of Ozak AI is Lower Although Solana has been doing better in the market, as evidenced by the recent increase in price of 12% today, its current market price of more than $167 is far off the mark for most small-scale investors. However, in comparison, the entrance ticket at Ozak AI is only half a cent ($0.005), and it would be a no-brainer to participate in potentially huge growth at a primitive stage. A play of a clear breakout on the trading chart of Solana shows a period of bullish continuation, so it could be resisted at the level of a substantial resistance zone. The trend is being brought to parallels with the situation of Ozak AI , which is not yet available on large exchanges but where, however, buyers are also feeling a strong rush in terms of presale. SOL 1D-chart showing price action | Source: X Basically, as Solana is demonstrating that a quality project with strong fundamentals and utility tokens can succeed in any market, the same thing may happen with Ozak AI- only that early investors would be able to jump on the wagon before it becomes the hype. Can Ozak AI Become the Next Jewel of the Unknown? Having achieved good results with presale, an excellent AI-based roadmap, and community hype, Ozak AI could be more than another presale project. It will be useful commercially: AI-assisted standards giving live Web3 applications, such as fraud monitoring or tailor-made trade bots. Most analysts are of the opinion that what is prominently referred to as Ozak AI is flying well below the radar, just like Solana did prior to its blast to the heights. The upside potential is high that would come along with early investors since the price is currently standing at about $0.005 with more than $1.3 million already on the table. In case Ozak AI is listed on the leading exchanges after the presale and reaches a small level of adoption, the profits may match or even surpass the ones in the preliminary waves of Solana and Dogecoin. In the meantime, it is simply a matter of time but it might be wise to fool around a little when the bigger market starts realizing it, as clever investors have already captured it. Conclusion While Solana breaks resistance and flies, investors seeking the next Solana might want to pay careful attention to Ozak AI. Ozak AI is a ticking bomb with momentum, price, and innovation on its side; it may just be one big announcement away from a parabolic move.

BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) just posted its biggest day ever, pulling in $489 million—its largest inflow since launching in July. That came with a massive $1.8 billion in trading volume , signaling a major surge in institutional interest. Over the past five trading days, ETHA alone attracted $1.25 billion, making up nearly 20% of its total inflow since inception. The excitement wasn't limited to BlackRock. Across all U.S. Ethereum ETFs, daily inflows hit a record $720 million , crushing the previous high of $430 million. Fidelity’s FETH saw $113 million, and Grayscale’s mini trust added $54 million—both posting their best days in months. With ETFs now holding 5 million ETH (4% of the total supply), demand is outpacing supply by an enormous margin. Ethereum-focused treasuries also hold $5.3 billion worth of ETH and are buying at 36 times the rate of daily ETH production . On top of that, ETH investment funds have logged 12 straight weeks of inflows, including $990 million just last week. Meanwhile, ETH’s price hit a six-month high of $3,420 before settling near $3,350—up 30% over the last two weeks and well ahead of Bitcoin’s 8.5% gain in the same period.",,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|BTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-07-17 08:07:35

Together, these projects highlight how innovation and specialization are reshaping what’s possible in the crypto ecosystem this year. Avalanche Builds On Its Scalable Framework To Attract Developers Avalanche, the highly-scalable, open-source platform for launching decentralized finance applications and enterprise blockchain deployments in one interoperable, highly scalable ecosystem, is becoming one of the leading blockchain projects to date following the launch of its final, public testnet Its infrastructure offers decentralized applications to do cheap and fast transaction, which has made it appealing for DeFi platforms, NFT ecosystems and enterprise solutions. Speed and security combined, beautiful dapps In this way, Avalanche empowers projects to launch cutting-edge platforms that are inherently secure so they stay reliable as they grow. Its ecosystem development is driven by and maintained through community-led initiatives and developer grants incentivising experimentation and growth. With the competition in the blockchain industry increasing, Avalanche’s obvious focus on throughput and user-friendly utilities is one way to maintain relevance for projects that require reliable and scalable infrastructure. Lightchain AI Moves Toward End Of July 2025 Release Date Lightchain AI is advancing toward its planned rollout at the end of July 2025, preparing to introduce its distinctive approach that fuses artificial intelligence with a decentralized environment. By enabling secure AI processing on-chain, Lightchain AI aims to tackle challenges that conventional blockchain systems may not fully address, such as verifiable AI tasks and transparent governance for complex workloads. This launch reflects careful groundwork to ensure both scalability and trust, offering new capabilities for developers exploring intelligent applications. As its release date approaches, Lightchain AI’s promise to deliver a framework that supports fair participation and privacy adds an interesting dimension to blockchain’s next wave of technical evolution. Community Watches How Lightchain AI Positions Beside Major Chains With its debut approaching, Lightchain AI is attracting curiosity about how it may stand out alongside major blockchain networks known for scalability and versatility. Its entry brings a fresh focus to decentralized intelligence, where verifiable AI computations could complement the strengths of established platforms like Avalanche. Supporters are interested in how Lightchain AI’s governance model and transparent architecture will encourage developers to build applications that benefit from both AI capability and blockchain security. This dynamic positions Lightchain AI as a potential value-add rather than a direct competitor, highlighting how emerging solutions can enrich the broader ecosystem. As July nears, community discussions suggest that Lightchain AI could carve out a niche within the expanding decentralized landscape. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

""Will They Not Approve?""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/cryptocurrency-homing-sec-member-speaks-out-on-xrp-etfs-will-they-not-approve/,"Following Bitcoin and Ethereum, a number of altcoin ETFs are expected to be approved in the US, including the XRP and Solana ETFs. However, the SEC has so far not issued a positive decision and has postponed its decisions. These postponements have caused disappointment in the market, with SEC member Caroline A. Crenshaw speaking out against the postponement of XRP and altcoin ETFs. While many investors have expressed frustration at the SEC’s repeated delays of spot ETFs for altcoins like XRP, the SEC member stated that the delay shouldn’t be interpreted too much. In a recent interview, Caroline Crenshaw explained that the delays in approving spot XRP ETFs were not due to outright rejection, but rather due to procedural reviews by the SEC that require careful analysis rather than quick decision-making. Crenshaw said he acknowledged the growing dissatisfaction among investors, but said they had to. Crenshaw said the SEC has systematically evaluated numerous altcoin ETF applications, including XRP, in detail, without issuing a definitive approval or rejection yet. The SEC member emphasized that the fact that an ETF application has not yet been approved should not be interpreted as a definitive rejection and that the SEC has not yet made a final decision on whether to approve XRP and other applications. Crenshaw added that while the ETF approval process may seem slow to investors, the SEC's review process is designed to protect market integrity and investor interests. Market analysts predict that spot ETF approval for XRP could happen before the October deadline. While spot XRP ETFs are still under SEC scrutiny, the SEC has previously approved futures-based XRP products like the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF, suggesting a higher likelihood of approval for XRP sports ETFs. *This is not investment advice.

The deal, centred on knowledge-sharing, follows a recent meeting in South America between Bilal bin Saqib, Pakistan’s Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on crypto and blockchain, and El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele. It comes as Pakistan works to establish a government-led Bitcoin reserve, while El Salvador continues to expand its federal digital asset strategy, which began in 2021. The meeting between Saqib and Bukele focused on establishing a partnership to transfer knowledge about cryptocurrency governance and strategy, as per a Bloomberg report. El Salvador’s Bitcoin reserves hit 6,238 BTC El Salvador’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at 6,238 BTC, equivalent to approximately $745 million at current market rates. These reserves are part of a broader national strategy, initiated in September 2021, when the country became the first to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. Despite global scrutiny, El Salvador has continued to purchase the asset and integrate blockchain-based technologies into its economy. This ongoing accumulation reflects President Bukele’s policy of positioning Bitcoin as a long-term sovereign asset. According to an earlier government statement in June, Bitcoin remains a core component of the country’s economic diversification plans. The new agreement with Pakistan is aimed at transferring El Salvador’s experience in digital asset governance and infrastructure development. Pakistan eyes Bitcoin reserve amid IMF restrictions In contrast, Pakistan is still in the early stages of exploring a centralised crypto strategy. The nation’s government recently announced its intent to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve, with state backing. However, its plans to subsidise energy for Bitcoin mining were blocked by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has raised concerns over the role of cryptocurrency in state governance. Earlier this month, the IMF declined Pakistan’s proposal to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining operations, citing its stance against the inclusion of crypto in official economic frameworks. The rejection comes in the context of Pakistan’s existing $7 billion loan agreement with the IMF, which remains in effect until 2027. The fund has consistently discouraged countries under its financial support programmes from adopting or promoting digital currencies. Knowledge-sharing partnership offers strategic advantages The new alliance with El Salvador could help Pakistan navigate some of these institutional hurdles. By accessing insights into how El Salvador has structured its Bitcoin acquisitions, handled regulatory frameworks, and continued crypto operations despite IMF pressure, Pakistan may be able to develop a more sustainable strategy tailored to its own constraints. While both countries are at different stages of crypto integration, the partnership formalises efforts to exchange technical, policy, and economic knowledge. For Pakistan, aligning with a country that has embedded Bitcoin into national governance may also provide leverage in ongoing global discussions about digital asset legitimacy.

Mutuum Finance is in the fifth stage of presale which costs $0.03. Stage 5 is already over 80% sold out since investors rush to secure the ground price. Launch project price is at $0.06, promising at least 100% profit for those who buy today. The presale has raised over $12.5 million and attracted more than 13,500 different investors. While other altcoins are holding steady, Mutuum Finance is quietly gearing up for liftoff, drawing comparisons to SHIB’s explosive breakout. Steady Momentum Continues in Mutuum Finance Presale In the current Phase 5 presale, Mutuum Finance is selling tokens for $0.03 per token. The phase has an 100% ROI because the price of the token will launch at $0.06. Investors’ interest keeps on growing, with over 13,500 investors placing over $12.5 million in their bets on the presale so far. Early predictions indicate MUTM can bounce to a $5 price in 2025. Its good fundamentals and practical applicability coupled with this positive prediction are attracting retail and institutional attention to the platform. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Focused on Platform Security and Stability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making its second bet on long-term stability with the launch of a value-backed stablecoin that will be pegged to the US dollar (USD) on the Ethereum blockchain. It will be a stable, secure financial asset avoiding the volatility and risk potentially associated with algorithmic stablecoins. To further boost its legitimacy, the project has also undergone a complete audit by CertiK. It is one of the most important milestones that show the zeal of Mutuum Finance to become an institution-grade and open DeFi platform. It shows that the team is keen on matching the industry in security as well as performance. Mutuum Finance Certik and $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance has also collaborated with CertiK to implement a structured Bug Bounty Program. With a reward pool amounting to $50,000 USDT, the program does accept the identification and reporting of vulnerabilities within the smart contracts of the platform. The rewards are further offered in four severity levels i.e. critical, major, minor and low. The move demonstrates the commitment of the Mutuum Finance to building a community-driven, secure and sustainable ecosystem. $100,0000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway in an attempt to claim the community as well. Those that will participate will be sampled to come up with the list of ten individuals that will receive $10,000 in MUTM as winners. This grand move does not just specify those who will be rewarded early, yet it also signals that the project is ready to develop an effective and stable user base. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up as one of the most explosive new entries in the crypto space, blending real-world DeFi utility with security-first architecture and rapidly rising investor interest. With over $12.5 million raised, 13,500+ investors on board, and a CertiK-audited protocol backed by a $50K bug bounty, confidence is soaring. The presale is already 80% sold out in Stage 5, and a launch price of $0.06 is set, meaning buyers at this stage could be looking at 100% gains even before public trading begins. As the next wave of potential breakout tokens takes shape, Mutuum Finance is drawing the spotlight, exploring the project now before the presale closes.

The WLFI team explained that this move is part of its strategy to transition from a closed network to one of open participation. Making the tokens tradable will allow for peer-to-peer transactions and listings on secondary markets, which will also enable price discovery and potentially increase token value through speculation and wider adoption. WLFI pointed out that increased tokenholder participation will be key to protocol decisions, including votes on emissions, ecosystem incentives, and treasury actions. The token unlock is set to be phased, with a detailed launch plan expected soon. The WLFI team also engaged blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs for transaction monitoring to ensure secure operations. WLFI website WLFI launched in September of 2024, and received endorsements from Donald Trump and his sons Eric, Donald Jr., and Barron. The president reported a $57 million profit from WLFI in a June 2025 financial disclosure, but reports indicate the Trump family reduced its stake in the project to 40% as of June. WLFI previously sold 20 billion tokens in October of 2024 at $0.015 each, which raised $300 million. It sold another 5 billion in January 2025 at $0.05 per token, bringing in an additional $250 million. Trump Media Files AI Trademarks WLFI is not the only Trump-linked venture making strides. Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), which is majority-owned by the family of President Donald Trump, recently filed two trademark applications related to artificial intelligence for its Truth Social platform. The trademarks, “Truth Social AI” and “Truth Social AI Search,” are intended to support a new feature that will deliver what the company calls “reliable information, non-woke news, and entertainment,” according to TMTG Chairman and CEO Devin Nunes. TMTG share price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) After the announcement was made, TMTG’s shares rose by 5.5% on Wednesday, which allowed it to outperform the broader Nasdaq index. Despite the boost in share price, Trump Media reported a net loss of $31.7 million for the first quarter of 2025, with revenue totaling $8.8 million. Truth Social’s AI feature seems to be part of the broader trend among social media platforms taking advantage of artificial intelligence for services like real-time translation, help center automation, and personalized content. This move by TMTG follows a pattern of the company exploring emerging technologies. In the past, it also filed trademarks related to crypto payments, trading platforms, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In February, another Trump-owned entity, DTTM Operations, submitted trademarks for a Trump-branded metaverse project. In January, Truth Social reportedly had 6.3 million users, but the figure fluctuated over the past year and is still quite small compared to major platforms like Facebook, which reported 3.1 billion monthly active users in 2023. The rise of AI in social media has not been without controversy . On X, Elon Musk’s Grok AI faced a lot of criticism for being too “woke,” prompting a retooling that resulted in the AI describing itself as “ MechaHitler .” Allegations have also pointed out that mainstream platforms like Facebook suppress conservative viewpoints. Trump Meme Coin Set for Major Unlock Meanwhile, the upcoming unlocking of 90 million TRUMP tokens could add fuel to the intensifying debate in Washington during what many are calling “Crypto Week.” The Trump-themed meme coin was launched in January, and is poised for a major supply boost that will increase its circulating supply by 45%. This will be one of the largest token releases since the project launched with 200 million tokens in circulation and a three-year plan to unlock a total of one billion tokens. TRUMP unlock progress (Source: Tokenomist ) The token unlock coincides with political maneuvering around key cryptocurrency legislation. This week, Republicans are trying to pass three major crypto bills: the GENIUS Act, which would regulate stablecoins; the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act, which opposes central bank digital currencies; and the CLARITY Act, which aims to create a clear structure for crypto markets. Although the package failed a procedural vote in the House on Tuesday, Donald Trump reportedly convinced Republicans to reverse course. The memecoin’s timing, along with Trump’s influence over party members, attracted a lot of sharp criticism from Democrats. Representative Maxine Waters’ office denounced the token by claiming it exists solely to capitalize on Trump’s public image and extract value from investors. She and other Democrats proposed amendments targeting what they term “crypto corruption” linked to Trump’s ventures, including his meme coin, involvement in World Liberty Financial, and alleged efforts to curry favor with crypto donors. As Congress now prepares to reconsider the crypto bills, the TRUMP token unlock could increase the growing tensions between financial innovation and political power.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-17 09:30:00

This company has truly redefined corporate finance, and its recent achievements are nothing short of spectacular. On Wednesday, Strategy closed with an astounding record market capitalization of $128.4 billion , with its shares trading at $455.90 . This remarkable milestone is largely attributed to its aggressive and unwavering commitment to its Strategy Bitcoin Holdings , making it a pivotal player in the cryptocurrency world. How Strategy’s Bitcoin Holdings Fueled a Record MicroStrategy Market Cap? The story of Strategy’s transformation from a business intelligence firm to a Bitcoin powerhouse is a testament to bold leadership and a clear vision. Under the guidance of its executive chairman, Michael Saylor, the company began accumulating Bitcoin in August 2020, pioneering a corporate treasury strategy centered on the digital asset. This move initially raised eyebrows, but its long-term payoff is now undeniable. The firm’s dedication to Bitcoin has not only shielded its balance sheet from inflation but has also propelled its valuation to unprecedented heights, establishing a new benchmark for the MicroStrategy Market Cap . Strategy’s consistent acquisition of Bitcoin, even during market downturns, has allowed it to amass a substantial treasury. This unique approach has effectively transformed the company into a de facto Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) for many investors seeking exposure to the digital currency through traditional equity markets. The company’s share price often correlates closely with Bitcoin’s performance, reflecting the market’s perception of Strategy as a primary vehicle for Bitcoin investment. The Unprecedented Scale of Strategy’s Bitcoin Investment Strategy Let’s talk numbers, because they paint a powerful picture of Strategy’s commitment to its Bitcoin Investment Strategy . According to The Block, the firm now holds an incredible 601,550 BTC . To put that into perspective, this vast sum is currently valued at approximately $73 billion . What’s even more striking is that this represents about 2.86% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply . This makes Strategy the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin by a significant margin, solidifying its position as a major whale in the crypto ocean. The average purchase price for this colossal hoard of Bitcoin stands at $71,270 per BTC . This figure is particularly noteworthy as it highlights the company’s long-term conviction, having accumulated Bitcoin across various price points, including periods of significant volatility. This disciplined accumulation strategy underscores a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as a store of value and a hedge against economic uncertainties. Metric Value Current Market Cap $128.4 Billion Shares Closed At $455.90 Total Bitcoin Holdings 601,550 BTC Value of BTC Holdings $73 Billion Percentage of Bitcoin Supply 2.86% Average BTC Purchase Price $71,270 What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Institutional Adoption? Strategy’s success serves as a powerful beacon for Bitcoin Institutional Adoption . Its impressive market performance, directly tied to its Bitcoin treasury, provides a real-world example of how a publicly traded company can successfully integrate Bitcoin into its core financial strategy. This provides a tangible case study for other corporations, asset managers, and even sovereign wealth funds contemplating similar moves. Benefits of such adoption include: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an attractive asset to combat inflationary pressures on traditional fiat currencies. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can provide diversification away from traditional assets, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Growth Potential: As a relatively nascent asset class, Bitcoin offers significant upside potential compared to more mature markets. First-Mover Advantage: Companies adopting Bitcoin early may gain a competitive edge in attracting a new generation of investors and talent. However, it’s also important to acknowledge the challenges. The volatility of Bitcoin remains a significant concern for many traditional institutions. Regulatory uncertainties and the need for robust custody solutions are also factors that potential adopters must consider. Despite these hurdles, Strategy’s journey demonstrates that with conviction and a long-term outlook, these challenges can be navigated. Is This Corporate Bitcoin Strategy a Blueprint for Others? The question on many minds is whether Strategy’s bold Corporate Bitcoin Strategy can be replicated by other companies. While Strategy has certainly set a precedent, its unique circumstances and early adoption afforded it advantages that might be harder for newcomers to achieve at the same scale. Michael Saylor’s evangelism for Bitcoin has also played a crucial role in shaping the company’s narrative and investor confidence. For other corporations considering a similar path, key actionable insights include: Clear Strategy: Define your objectives for holding Bitcoin (e.g., treasury reserve, investment, payment rail). Risk Management: Understand Bitcoin’s volatility and implement a robust risk management framework. Custody Solutions: Secure reliable and compliant custody solutions for your digital assets. Regulatory Compliance: Stay informed about evolving regulations in your jurisdiction. Investor Communication: Clearly communicate your Bitcoin strategy to shareholders and the market. While not every company can or should become a ‘Bitcoin company’ like Strategy, its model offers valuable lessons on leveraging digital assets to enhance corporate value and embrace financial innovation. Conclusion: A New Era of Corporate Finance Strategy’s achievement of a $128.4 billion market cap , primarily driven by its staggering 601,550 BTC holdings , marks a significant moment in financial history. It underscores the growing influence of Bitcoin as a legitimate and powerful asset class, capable of transforming traditional corporate balance sheets. This pioneering approach by Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, has not only yielded substantial returns but has also paved the way for broader Bitcoin Institutional Adoption , challenging conventional financial wisdom. The company’s audacious Corporate Bitcoin Strategy serves as a compelling case study, demonstrating the potential for long-term value creation when a firm commits to a forward-thinking Bitcoin Investment Strategy . As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, Strategy’s journey will undoubtedly be remembered as a pivotal chapter in the integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance, inspiring future innovation and challenging companies to rethink their financial futures.

Institutional and high-net-worth investors are now pouring capital into a far more aggressive play: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , a meme coin priced at just $0.0014 in its ongoing presale. Why are these deep-pocketed players turning their attention away from a crypto like Ethereum and toward a frog-themed meme coin? Because LILPEPE is no ordinary token. It combines meme virality with real-world blockchain infrastructure—something ETH investors can’t afford to ignore. Here are the three core reasons big money is making the leap from Ethereum to Little Pepe. LILPEPE is building an entire Layer 2 blockchain for meme coins The Ethereum network remains congested and expensive, especially during bull runs. Meme coins launching on ETH often get crushed by gas fees, frontrunning bots, and a lack of optimized infrastructure. That’s where Little Pepe is flipping the game. Unlike typical meme coins, LILPEPE is developing its own Layer 2 solution, designed explicitly for meme tokens. It’s sniper bot-resistant, faster, cheaper, and designed to support frictionless token launches through its Meme Launchpad. This isn’t just a coin—it’s the Ethereum of meme coins in the making. That kind of bold technical direction is exactly what Ethereum investors appreciate: utility, scalability, and architecture. Except in this case, they’re getting in early—at under $0.002—before the chain launches and listings ignite the full parabolic run. Big investors are moving into LILPEPE now because they understand this is an infrastructure-level investment with the branding power of a meme coin. LILPEPE offers hyper-growth potential from a ground-floor entry point While Ethereum might be a strong long-term hold, its upside is limited compared to early-stage altcoins. ETH may double or even triple over the next cycle, but Little Pepe is positioned to deliver returns of 100x to even 500x for early entrants. Let’s break down the numbers: LILPEPE is currently priced at $0.0014 in stage 5 of its presale, having already raised over $5.4 million and sold more than 4.4 billion tokens. A move to just $0.10—a fraction of SHIB or DOGE’s highs—would represent a 7,000% gain. If it hits $1, that’s a 71,000% return. This asymmetric upside is what draws big investors who are willing to risk a portion of their ETH holdings for much larger potential payoffs. With a limited presale window, high demand, and increasing media coverage, LILPEPE represents one of the most explosive entry points available in the market right now. For capital allocators who made their fortunes during Ethereum’s early years, Little Pepe feels like a familiar opportunity, with even greater velocity. It’s already listed on CoinMarketCap and preparing for tier-one exchange listings One of the key signals that institutional players look for in microcaps is visibility, and LILPEPE is already listed on CoinMarketCap, a major milestone that many meme coins never achieve during their presale. This listing lends the project early credibility, allowing traders and investors to track its performance, volume, and buzz in real-time. Even more compelling is the fact that Little Pepe’s team has already confirmed listings on at least two major centralized exchanges upon launch—a sign that the project is not only well-connected but also serious about scaling. When large investors see a token with both infrastructure innovation and exchange accessibility, it checks all the boxes. Unlike ETH, which is now widely held and relatively stable, LILPEPE is in the early stages of its lifecycle, when the most significant gains are typically made. With early access now available and listings set to go live after the presale, institutional buyers are loading their bags before the public frenzy begins. Final thoughts: Ethereum is safe, but LILPEPE is strategic Ethereum is still an incredible blockchain—robust, battle-tested, and home to some of crypto’s most valuable protocols. But the days of 100x gains from ETH are long gone. Today’s serious investors aren’t abandoning Ethereum because it’s bad—they’re reallocating capital toward opportunities with greater upside, and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) fits that bill perfectly. With real infrastructure, early exchange visibility, and a rapidly growing community, LILPEPE isn’t just the next meme coin—it’s the meme coin ecosystem. And at under $0.002, big money is betting that this frog will leap far past the rest.

Despite the stability, investors still missed the spike seen in December 2024, with Trump’s win being the strongest factor. Now in H2 2025, the factors have increased enormously, like bullish sentiment building around the major acquisition of SRM Entertainment via reverse merger, high on-chain revenue, and technical strength, clearly hinting at something big coming up for TRX crypto . The token appears to have entered a potentially transformative phase for both traders and long-term investors. TRX Price: Strong Fundamentals and Rising Optimism According to analysts , the TRX price on the daily chart has remained firmly in a consistent uptrend since April, navigating May-June market volatility with notable stability. Even during the U.S.-Israel-Iran conflict, TRON avoided steep corrections that affected much of the crypto market, clearly indicative of its underlying strength that goes beyond speculation. Similarly, it has been evident on the chart that the announcement of a ceasefire was the trigger that brought renewed momentum in the entire space. Since then, the TRX crypto has continued to push higher alongside top altcoins like XRP , ADA, and others. Likewise, another major catalyst has been Justin Sun’s acquisition of “SRM Entertainment Inc.” which has officially become “TRON Inc.” on NASDAQ on July 17, verified by a pinned post on Justin Sun’s official X account. This move has marked a significant step in TRON’s strategy to blur the lines between Web3 innovation and Wall Street’s traditional financial infrastructure. As a result of the ongoing optimistic factors and new factors joining, the past few days have been more positive for the markets. For instance, the market responded swiftly, as SRM stock surged more than 40% from $7.50 to $10.50, while the TRX price gained nearly 5% in a single session. On-Chain Strength: Revenue and Utility Drive Conviction Beyond headlines, the on-chain data paints an equally bullish picture, too. Research on CryptoQuant highlights that the TRON crypto is currently generating an average of $2 million in daily revenue, which is entirely through the network fees alone. What this figure means is that it is one of the most profitable blockchains, which has strong growing utility and demand from users and developers alike. In parallel, another insight reveals that the daily transaction counts have soared beyond 9 million, with the 100-day moving average of transactions nearing all-time highs. This sustained user engagement and fee generation is reinforcing the long-term outlook for the network. These consistent activity levels, when paired with bullish technical patterns, show that a major movement is on the horizon. Institutional Interest and Technical Setup Align For TRX Price Growth The scale of capital flowing into TRX shows a broader rise in institutional interest. Data from Defi_Zee shows that the WLFI acquired 40.71 million TRX by investing $9.83 million at an average price of $0.242, and is now sitting with a 25% unrealized profit. Also, TRON Inc. (formerly SRM) purchased 365 million TRX crypto, investing $100 million at $0.274 is sitting up 10% already. Source: CryptoQuant Technically, the TRX price is aimed at testing the $0.32 resistance while forming an ascending triangle on the weekly chart. According to CryptoQuant’s technical insights, this structure increases the odds of a breakout and could flip its ATH in a single spike similar to the last seen move in Q4 2024. However, analysts also warn caution that traders should remain wary of potential fake-outs or short-term pullbacks before a sustained upward move materializes.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,TRADING|TRX|BUSINESS|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-17 09:37:26

The two leaders signed a Letter of Intent that paves the way for a formal collaboration on cryptocurrency projects. Saqib praised Bukele as a pioneer who embraced Bitcoin early, when the global community was doubtful. “He stood with conviction when it wasn’t cool to support Bitcoin,” Saqib tweeted on X. Learning from El Salvador’s Bitcoin Blueprint El Salvador’s Bitcoin policy has been of global interest, particularly after the country legalized BTC as its legal tender in 2021. Despite pressure from the IMF, Bukele has continued to build national Bitcoin reserves, which currently total over 6,240 BTC—worth about $740 million. Pakistan is attempting to do likewise. Currently in the midst of executing a $7 billion IMF loan program until 2027, the country is attempting to position itself as a digital asset hub, following the example of El Salvador’s model. The partnership is seeking to drive blockchain-enabled financial inclusion, develop crypto-friendly regulations, and promote Bitcoin adoption in public sector programs. IMF Pushback on Pakistan’s Mining Ambitions Interestingly, the IMF recently blocked Pakistan’s proposal to use 2,000 megawatts of surplus power for Bitcoin mining. Despite the country’s excess electricity—especially in winter—the IMF opposed subsidized energy for crypto-currencies on grounds of potential market disruption. The suggestion was part of Pakistan’s broader digital transformation action plan, led by the Pakistan Crypto Council and endorsed by the Ministry of Finance. Global Crypto Vision: From Islamabad to San Salvador This latest engagement, like a virtual meeting with Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, is a reflection of Pakistan’s ambition to be a regional digital finance leader. With this move, Pakistan is joining the likes of El Salvador and global crypto pundits, making a case for blockchain integration and regulation on a long-term basis.",Blockchain|Sticky|Regulation,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|MINING|MARKET,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-07-17 09:39:24

Recently, this dynamic took a sharp turn in the United Kingdom, sparking a vital debate that resonates far beyond its borders. The very idea of crypto donations to political parties, once seen by some as a step towards modernizing political finance, is now under intense scrutiny. Are we witnessing a necessary crackdown on potential illicit funding, or an overreaction to a nascent technology? Why the Push for a UK Crypto Ban? Pat McFadden’s Stance The call for a comprehensive UK crypto ban on political donations comes directly from Pat McFadden, the UK Cabinet Office Minister. His reasoning, as reported by Cointelegraph, is straightforward: the inherent difficulty in tracing such donations. In an era where transparency in political funding is paramount, the perceived anonymity or pseudonymity of cryptocurrency transactions presents a significant challenge to existing regulatory frameworks. McFadden’s concerns highlight a broader apprehension among regulators worldwide regarding digital assets. While blockchain technology offers immutable records, the ability to link those records to real-world identities without robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures remains a hurdle. For political finance, this means: Lack of Donor Transparency: Identifying the ultimate source of funds can be challenging, raising questions about foreign influence or undeclared interests. Compliance Nightmares: Existing election laws are not designed for the unique characteristics of digital assets, creating a compliance void. Risk of Illicit Funds: The fear that untraceable funds from criminal activities could seep into the political system. The Challenge of Tracing Crypto Donations: A Closer Look When Pat McFadden speaks about the difficulty in tracing crypto donations, he’s touching upon a core issue that has plagued the adoption of cryptocurrencies in regulated sectors. While every transaction on a public blockchain like Bitcoin is recorded and publicly viewable, linking a wallet address to an individual or entity requires off-chain information, usually provided by exchanges or service providers. Without this, the ‘traceability’ becomes complex. Consider the stark contrast between traditional fiat donations and cryptocurrency contributions: Feature Traditional Fiat Donations Cryptocurrency Donations Tracing Relies on bank transfers, clear sender/receiver identities. Public ledger but pseudonymity of wallet addresses; requires off-chain data for identity. Regulatory Oversight Well-established frameworks (e.g., Electoral Commission rules). Nascent, often unclear or non-existent specific regulations for political funding. Transparency Donor identities often disclosed publicly above certain thresholds. Transaction amounts are public, but donor identity is not inherently linked. Global Reach Cross-border transfers involve international banking regulations. Easier to send funds globally, potentially bypassing national financial controls. This inherent difference is what drives concerns from figures like Pat McFadden, who are tasked with upholding the integrity of the political finance system. Bitcoin Donations: A New Frontier for Political Funding? Adding fuel to this fiery debate was the announcement two months prior that Nigel Farage’s Reform Party would be the first political party in British politics to accept Bitcoin donations . This move was lauded by some as a progressive step, embracing modern financial technologies and potentially attracting a new demographic of donors interested in digital assets. For the Reform Party, it represented an opportunity to differentiate itself and tap into a growing pool of wealth held in cryptocurrencies. The decision by the Reform Party highlights the tension between innovation and regulation. On one hand, it showcases the potential for cryptocurrencies to democratize fundraising and offer alternative avenues for financial support. On the other, it immediately triggered alarms for those concerned about the regulatory blind spots. For political parties, accepting Bitcoin donations could offer: Reduced Transaction Fees: Potentially lower costs compared to traditional payment processors. Global Accessibility: Easier for supporters worldwide to contribute. Technological Edge: Positioning the party as forward-thinking and tech-savvy. However, these benefits come with significant risks, particularly the regulatory uncertainty that Minister McFadden has pointed out. The lack of clear guidelines means parties accepting such donations are operating in a grey area, potentially exposing them to future compliance issues or public backlash. Navigating the Future of Political Donations in the UK The call for a ban on political donations in cryptocurrency by Pat McFadden is not an isolated incident but rather a symptom of a larger global challenge: how to integrate rapidly evolving digital finance with established regulatory frameworks. The UK, like many nations, is grappling with finding a balance between fostering innovation and ensuring financial integrity and security. What could the future hold for crypto in UK politics? Several paths are possible: Outright Ban: The most immediate solution proposed by McFadden, simplifying regulatory oversight but potentially stifling innovation and limiting donor choice. Strict Regulation: Implementing robust KYC/AML requirements specifically for political crypto donations, mirroring existing fiat rules. This would require cooperation from crypto exchanges and potentially new legislation. Self-Regulation/Industry Standards: Less likely for political finance, but a model where the crypto industry itself develops best practices for transparency. Technological Solutions: Development of new blockchain tools that enhance traceability for compliance purposes, without sacrificing user privacy where not required by law. The debate ignited by McFadden’s comments forces a crucial conversation about the nature of money in politics. As digital assets become more mainstream, the pressure on governments to develop clear, enforceable regulations will only intensify. The outcome in the UK could set a precedent for other nations grappling with similar issues. A Compelling Summary: The Unfolding Crypto-Political Drama Pat McFadden’s call for a ban on crypto donations to UK political parties has brought the complex relationship between digital assets and democratic processes into sharp focus. Citing concerns over traceability, the Cabinet Office Minister’s stance directly challenges the growing trend of parties, like Nigel Farage’s Reform Party, embracing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin for fundraising. This controversy underscores the urgent need for robust regulatory frameworks that can both accommodate technological innovation and uphold the foundational principles of transparency and accountability in political finance. The path forward for crypto donations in the UK remains uncertain, but the debate has undoubtedly begun, signaling a critical juncture for both the crypto industry and political governance.

As of today, meme tokens are outperforming even the most prominent players in crypto. According to CoinGecko, the meme coin category has increased by 13.9% in the last 24 hours, outperforming Bitcoin’s 4.9% and Ethereum’s 6.6%. With a meme supercycle looking increasingly plausible in 2025, it’s time to ask: which tokens could make history by breaking into the crypto top 5 by market cap? Here are three contenders that aren’t just vibing with the memes, they’re building movements. And yes, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is one of them. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): from meme chain dream to market reality Freshly listed on CoinMarketCap, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is proving it’s not just here for the fun, it’s here for the long haul. With $5.28 million raised and over 4.3 billion tokens sold, this Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 meme coin is merging meme culture with serious blockchain infrastructure. At the center is the Little Pepe Chain, a high-speed, low-cost EVM Layer 2 explicitly designed for the creation, trading, and innovation of meme coins. Unlike most meme coins that launch on top of someone else’s rails, LILPEPE is building the track. The listing on CoinMarketCap is more than exposure; it’s a launch signal. Watchlists are growing. Whales are circling. And the presale’s Stage 5 is already selling out at $0.0014, with a confirmed listing price of $0.003, giving early buyers a baked-in 114% upside. But what really makes LILPEPE a top 5 contender? Dedicated Layer 2 infrastructure for meme coin ecosystems Fair tokenomics and zero tax on trades Staking, DAO governance, and creator tools built in A $777,000 giveaway to reward early believers and build virality In a meme supercycle, the infrastructure token powering the next 100 meme launches won’t just follow trends; it will define them. LILPEPE is positioned to be that token. Book of meme (BOME): blending internet culture with blockchain brilliance Is there a coin more in tune with the internet’s pulse than Book of Meme (BOME)? This unique token is aiming to immortalize viral content on-chain. With NFT integrations and decentralized archival functions, BOME operates like a cultural time capsule for digital art and memes. Its charm lies in duality: it’s part meme, part museum, and it has captured the attention of digital creators and serious traders alike. From early listings on major exchanges to massive social momentum, Book of Meme is a cultural asset with long-term staying power. The crypto community is starting to recognize the potential of “meme as medium,” and Book of Meme is leading that frontier. In a supercycle built on internet identity, BOME could ascend quickly. Bonk (BONK): the comeback canine dominating Solana Don’t let the dog-themed branding fool you. Bonk is Solana’s meme coin golden child. After a quiet start, Bonk surged in popularity due to strategic airdrops, social media revival, and real-world utility within Solana DeFi, enabling users to benefit from Solana’s fast speeds and low costs, which facilitate viral microtransactions and campaigns. Volume and listings grow, boosting its reputation in the ecosystem. With a loyal base, strong tokenomics, and developer enthusiasm, BONK has transformed from an underdog to an alpha. In a meme-focused market rally, it has everything it needs to leap toward the top. Final thoughts: supercycle favorites with real firepower We’re entering a market phase where meme culture may outperform fundamentals; however, the coins most likely to survive and thrive are those that combine both. LILPEPE, BOME, and BONK each represent a new breed of meme token: part cultural movement, part technical ecosystem. With its CoinMarketCap listing locked and $5.28 million in early capital raised, LILPEPE is already checking the boxes that historic tokens checked in their early days. If a meme supercycle hits full speed in 2025, one (or more) of these projects may be sitting next to ETH and BTC in the top 5. Invest accordingly, and meme responsibly.

Today, the Base blockchain , an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, is making waves with a suite of groundbreaking announcements poised to redefine user experience and developer capabilities. These strategic advancements, including a dramatic reduction in block times and a significant rebrand of Coinbase Wallet, signal a bold step forward for the ecosystem. If you’ve ever been frustrated by slow transaction confirmations or complex gas fees, get ready for a paradigm shift. The Rise of the Base Blockchain : A New Era of Speed The Base blockchain , incubated by Coinbase, has quickly emerged as a significant player in the Layer 2 landscape. Its mission? To onboard the next billion users into the crypto economy by making decentralized applications (dApps) more accessible, affordable, and performant. The latest updates are a testament to this commitment, focusing on core infrastructure improvements that directly impact the speed and efficiency of every interaction within the Base ecosystem. Imagine a digital highway where transactions zoom past at lightning speed, almost instantaneously. This is the vision Base is bringing to life. For users, this means quicker confirmations for trades, faster interactions with decentralized applications, and a smoother overall experience. For developers, it unlocks new possibilities for building highly responsive and real-time dApps that were previously constrained by network latency. The strategic importance of Base cannot be overstated. As an L2 built on Ethereum, it inherits the security of the mainnet while offering superior scalability. This balance is crucial for fostering widespread adoption, ensuring that as more users and applications join, the network can handle the increased load without sacrificing performance or security. Revolutionizing Transactions with Flashblocks Technology One of the most significant technical upgrades announced by Base is the introduction of “Flashblocks.” This innovative enhancement dramatically reduces the network’s block time to an astonishing 200 milliseconds (0.2 seconds). To put this into perspective, Ethereum’s block time is approximately 12-15 seconds, while other fast chains like Solana aim for around 400 milliseconds. Base is now operating at a speed that rivals, and in some cases surpasses, even some of the fastest blockchains in the industry. What does 200ms block time truly mean for you? Near-Instant Confirmations: Transactions will be finalized almost as soon as you initiate them, making real-time interactions on dApps a reality. Think instant NFT mints, rapid DeFi trades, and seamless in-game asset transfers. Enhanced User Experience: The ‘waiting game’ often associated with blockchain transactions will largely disappear, leading to a more fluid and intuitive user journey, akin to traditional web applications. New dApp Possibilities: Developers can now build more complex and interactive applications that rely on immediate state changes, opening doors for innovative gaming, high-frequency trading bots, and responsive social platforms. Reduced Latency for Oracles: Data feeds from external sources (oracles) can be updated and consumed much faster, leading to more accurate and timely information for DeFi protocols and other data-intensive applications. The underlying mechanism of Flashblocks involves optimized block production and propagation, allowing validators to confirm transactions at an unprecedented pace. This technical feat is crucial for Base’s ambition to become the go-to platform for high-throughput decentralized applications, laying the groundwork for a truly responsive and dynamic on-chain experience. The Strategic Coinbase Wallet Rebrand : What It Means for Users Alongside the technical upgrades, a major user-facing change has been announced: the rebrand of Coinbase Wallet to simply “Base.” This strategic move signifies a deeper integration between Coinbase’s vast user base and its incubated Layer 2 network. It’s more than just a name change; it represents a unified vision for a seamless and intuitive crypto experience. Key implications of the Coinbase Wallet rebrand: Unified Ecosystem: The rebrand strengthens the connection between Coinbase’s centralized exchange and its decentralized Base network. Users of Coinbase Wallet will now inherently identify with the Base ecosystem, fostering a sense of cohesion. Simplified Onboarding: For new users entering the crypto space through Coinbase, the transition to using a self-custodial wallet and interacting with dApps on Base will be significantly smoother. The familiar branding reduces friction and builds trust. Enhanced Trust and Security: Leveraging the established reputation of Coinbase, the rebranded wallet instills greater confidence in users regarding the security and reliability of their assets and transactions on the Base network. Streamlined User Journey: The rebrand paves the way for tighter integration between Coinbase’s centralized services and the decentralized Base chain, potentially offering more direct pathways for users to move assets between the two. This rebrand isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s a strategic alignment designed to bridge the gap between centralized crypto access and decentralized innovation, making the latter more approachable for millions of users worldwide. It’s a clear signal that Coinbase is doubling down on its commitment to Base as a core pillar of its future strategy. Introducing MagicSpend Feature : Simplifying Crypto Payments Perhaps one of the most user-friendly innovations introduced is “MagicSpend.” This revolutionary feature allows users to pay gas fees and send transactions directly using their Coinbase balances. This addresses a long-standing pain point in the crypto world: the complexity and volatility of gas fees. For years, new users have struggled with the concept of gas fees – needing a separate token (like ETH) just to perform a transaction, often in fluctuating amounts. MagicSpend eliminates this hurdle entirely. Imagine wanting to send some USDC to a friend or interact with a DeFi protocol, and instead of ensuring you have enough ETH for gas, you can simply use your existing USD balance held on Coinbase. It’s akin to paying for an online purchase with your bank account balance, rather than needing to convert it to a specific digital currency just for the transaction fee. How MagicSpend transforms your crypto experience: Eliminates Gas Fee Hassle: No more worrying about managing a separate gas token or topping up your wallet with small amounts of ETH just to make a transaction. Seamless Transactions: The process of sending crypto or interacting with dApps becomes as straightforward as using any traditional online payment system. Increased Accessibility: Lowers the barrier to entry for new users who might be intimidated by the intricacies of gas fees, making crypto more approachable for the mainstream. Improved User Confidence: Users can transact with peace of mind, knowing that the underlying complexities of gas are being handled seamlessly by the platform. MagicSpend is a game-changer for user experience. It abstracts away one of the most significant friction points in decentralized applications, paving the way for broader adoption and more intuitive interactions within the Base ecosystem. This feature alone has the potential to unlock a new wave of crypto users who have previously been deterred by the technicalities of on-chain transactions. The Impact on Reducing Crypto Fees and User Experience While Base, as an L2, inherently offers lower transaction fees compared to Ethereum mainnet, the combination of Flashblocks and MagicSpend creates a powerful synergy that further enhances the overall cost-effectiveness and user experience. It’s not just about raw transaction costs, but the perceived cost and convenience. How these innovations collectively impact fees and UX: True Cost Efficiency: Flashblocks, by increasing network throughput, can help stabilize and potentially lower transaction fees on Base during periods of high demand, as more transactions can be processed within the same timeframe. Zero-Friction Fee Payment: MagicSpend effectively makes the act of paying gas fees invisible and effortless for users who hold balances on Coinbase. While the fee itself still exists, the burden of managing it disappears. This is a massive psychological win for users, akin to having an ‘all-inclusive’ payment experience. Broader Economic Accessibility: By simplifying fee management, Base opens up decentralized finance to a wider audience, including those with smaller capital who might have been deterred by the thought of disproportionately high gas fees on the mainnet. Enhanced Developer Economics: Lower, more predictable transaction costs on Base make it more attractive for developers to build and deploy dApps, fostering a vibrant ecosystem and potentially leading to more innovation and utility. These developments signify a concerted effort by Base to address some of the most persistent challenges in the blockchain space: speed, complexity, and cost. By tackling these head-on, Base is positioning itself as a leading platform for the next generation of decentralized applications, one where user experience is paramount. Looking Ahead: Base’s Vision for Decentralized Finance The recent announcements from Base are not isolated upgrades; they are integral parts of a larger, ambitious vision for decentralized finance. Base aims to be the foundational layer for mainstream adoption of dApps, bridging the gap between traditional financial systems and the burgeoning crypto economy. By prioritizing speed, user-friendliness, and cost-efficiency, Base is building an ecosystem designed for scale and accessibility. The integration with Coinbase, one of the largest and most trusted crypto platforms globally, provides Base with an unparalleled advantage in terms of user acquisition and liquidity. This symbiotic relationship ensures that Base has the resources and reach to truly make a dent in bringing decentralized technologies to the masses. However, the journey ahead for Base, like any evolving blockchain, will present its own set of challenges. Maintaining decentralization as it scales, fending off competition from other robust Layer 2 solutions, and continuously innovating to meet evolving user demands will be crucial.

According to Dr. Mahmoud AlBurai, Senior Director of Real Estate Policies and Innovation at Dubai Land Department, 68% of the 1,025 investors who participated in funding the five tokenized properties were first-time real estate buyers. This number reflects how tokenization of real estate assets can bring in new investors by democratizing the process and making it simpler, and more cost-effective to participate. Five Dubai tokenized properties sold fast AlBurai noted on LinkedIn discussing the recent funding of two new tokenized properties, “I am so delighted to share with you the great success we achieved today in funding 2 luxury properties part of Dubai Real estate tokenization project funded by 462 investors.” He added that in total for the five tokenized properties funded to date there were 1,025 investors from 69 nationalities investing on average $2,432 with 685 of them being first time buyers. According to a recent Fitch rating report that came out in May 2025, Dubai real estate prices rose 60% from 2022 to the first quarter of 2025. Fitch added that it expected a moderate price correction of up to 15% in the second half of 2025 and 2026. Fitch attributes this to a spike in deliveries in 2025 and 2026 to a planned 210,000 units, doubling from the previous three years. Dubai which has long been espousing its digitization efforts being one of the first to come out with its blockchain strategy, with UAE also being the first in the MENA region to develop its digital economy strategy under Dubai Economic Agenda D33 has been pushing the envelope forward with virtual asset regulations, stablecoin regulations, and now tokenization of real estate assets. In May, the Dubai Land Department (DLD) launched the pilot phase of the Real Estate Tokenization Project, aimed at tokenizing property deeds in collaboration with Dubai’s regulatory body VARA and the Dubai Future Foundation. Since then, it has already successfully funded five real estate projects with its PRYPCO Mint platform, powered by the XRP Ledger and issued through Ctrl Alt. DLD expects that real estate tokenization sector will be valued at $16 billion by 2033 representing a whomping 7% of Dubai’s total real estate transactions. This comes as the global market for tokenized real estate is experiencing growth with ScienceSoft expecting that the market size in 2039 will be $3 trillion, 15% of global real estate under management. EY, in a report, reinforces that the importance of tokenized real estate lies in its ability to be accessed by investors around the world, fostering a diverse investor base and enabling cross-border investments. EY expects the global real estate market to reach $280 trillion, with assets under management totaling $3.7 trillion, and they expect tokenization will unlock a significant portion of this market for international investors. So it would seem Dubai is on to something big, not only digitizing its economy but also broadening its real estate market to include more international investors as well as more first-time international buyers.

With trading volume soaring by 72.78% to $727.58 million and the price reaching an intraday high of $0.993, CRV has officially broken free from months of consolidation. That being said, technical and on-chain signals now suggest that CRV’s parabolic breakout is more than just a speculative spike. As it’s a move driven by real scarcity and structural shifts. Intrigued by the numbers and metrics? Read this CRV price prediction for the short term. Scarcity Drives the Price Surge? One of the strongest reasons behind CRV’s rally is its growing scarcity across exchange platforms. Exchange netflows for CRV were at -2.67 million on July 16. This is a clear indication that more tokens are being withdrawn from trading platforms than deposited. Complementing this is CRV’s Stock-to-Flow (S2F) ratio, which just spiked to its highest-ever level. A high S2F ratio means limited new issuance and high scarcity. This makes ideal conditions for price appreciation, which is evident in the case of CRV. CRV Price Analysis: On the daily chart, the CRV token has broken out of a descending triangle pattern. The breakout has occurred with strong momentum, as shown by the price leaping from $0.773 to a recent high of $0.9872. Successively, Bollinger Bands show a strong expansion, confirming increased volatility and directional strength. That being said, RSI stands at an overbought zone of 84.99. Moving forward, the next resistance levels lie at $1.10 and $1.30, which align with historical supply zones. Meanwhile, a stop-loss at $0.89 can help manage risk in case of a freefall. FAQs Why is CRV price rising so fast? CRV is rising due to a technical breakout and on-chain signals showing reduced token availability on exchanges and heightened scarcity. Is now a good time to buy CRV? Momentum is strong, but RSI suggests short-term overbought conditions. Entry should be taken with caution and a stop-loss. What are the next price targets for CRV? Immediate resistance lies at $1.10, with a potential extension toward $1.30 if the bullish momentum continues.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,CRV|TRADING|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-17 09:56:05

It arguably has little resistance from here because it never spent time trading here on the verge of price discovery,” he wrote, adding that a cluster of regulatory and corporate tailwinds “is a pretty good setup into decent tailwinds and so far has traded very cleanly.” By Wednesday afternoon XRP was changing hands at $3.08, up roughly 27 percent on the week and hovering just below its highest close since the 2021 cycle high. Daily volumes have topped US $8.5 billion and momentum indicators on major venues show relative‑strength indexes back in “buy” territory, underscoring Pentoshi’s contention that overhead supply is thin. Upcoming XRP Price Catalysts The first fundamental catalyst is Washington’s sudden enthusiasm for federal stablecoin rules. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act sailed through the Senate in June and secured the votes it needs in the House this week after an eleventh‑hour whip by President Donald Trump. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise told reporters, “We’re back on track … all three bills will be encompassed in the work we do today,” referring also to the CLARITY and Anti‑CBDC acts. Related Reading: XRP Becomes Top 3 Crypto After ProShares ETF Approval, Can It Flip ETH? Ripple, which launched its dollar‑backed RLUSD last December, is already positioning for that environment. On 2 July the company filed for a US national bank charter and a Federal Reserve master account that would let it custody RLUSD reserves directly at the Fed. Two weeks later it confirmed plans to secure an EU electronic‑money‑institution licence under MiCA; a company spokesperson said Ripple aims “to become MiCA‑compliant” because it sees “significant opportunity in the European market.” The second driver is the near‑resolution of Ripple’s grinding courtroom saga. On 26 June, when US District Judge Analisa Torres rebuffed a joint motion by Ripple and the SEC that would have vacated her permanent injunction and sliced the civil penalty from $125 million to $50 million, ruling the parties had “not come close” to establishing the “exceptional circumstances” required to alter a final judgment. The next day CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced on X that Ripple will drop its own cross‑appeal and “close this chapter once and for all,” adding that he expects the SEC to withdraw its appeal as well. For now, however, Torres’s injunction and the full $125 million penalty remain in force, leaving any definitive resolution, however, the end has never been closer. Related Reading: XRP Countdown Begins—Analyst Predicts Explosive Run To $11 With the litigation roadblock largely cleared, exchange‑traded‑fund issuers have accelerated filings. ProShares on 15 July rolled out 2× leveraged futures funds tied to Solana and XRP, noting that spot‑based products remain in the SEC queue. Only a week earlier, the agency issued new disclosure guidance meant to streamline crypto‑ETF approvals. Trump Media & Technology Group has even asked the SEC to sign off on a “blue‑chip” basket ETF that would hold bitcoin, ether, solana and xrp, signalling bipartisan pressure to open the ETF spigot further. Ripple is also arming itself for a buying spree. “Our M&A people are very busy,” chief technology officer David Schwartz told DL News in late June, revealing “multiple potential acquisitions in various different stages.” The firm has already paid $1.25 billion for prime broker Hidden Road this year and is building an on‑ledger lending protocol slated for Q3, moves that could deepen XRP liquidity and justify higher valuations. Each strand—the GENIUS Act, the bank charter and MiCA licences, the SEC’s retreat, the ETF pipeline, and Ripple’s war‑chest for acquisitions—converges on the same conclusion: regulatory opacity is fading just as institutional distribution channels open. Whether that is enough to propel XRP through the previous all-time high at $3.84 from January 2018 remains to be seen, but the technical setup is also looking quite strong, as Pentoshi concludes. At press time, XRP traded at $3.14.

However, while Sui (SUI) makes headlines, another project is quietly gathering serious investor momentum— Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , an Ethereum-based altcoin combining decentralized lending tools with institutional-grade security. Currently priced at just $0.03 in Phase 5 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised $12.45 million, with over 75% of the current round sold. As the price is set to increase to $0.035 in the next phase, this marks a rare moment to enter before retail demand spikes. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly capturing investor attention not only because of its value entry point but also due to its verified smart contract security. The project has undergone a complete audit by CertiK, scoring an exceptional 95.00 Token Scan rating and a 77.50 Skynet score—clear indicators of a secure and well-structured DeFi protocol. This technical credibility is helping Mutuum Finance (MUTM) build trust not just with retail buyers but also with institutional watchers looking beyond hype-driven assets. Sui (SUI) Adoption Update Sui (SUI) is cementing its position as an institutional favorite, with its price climbing 6.7% to $3.409 by July 15, 2025. Binance’s native USDC integration, announced February 27, 2025, has unlocked seamless capital flows for institutional investors, boosting Sui (SUI)’s $1.8B DeFi TVL. The Move language and Narwhal-Tusk consensus enable 297,000 TPS, attracting firms like VanEck and Grayscale, who praise Sui (SUI)’s scalability for tokenized assets. Over 7M Phantom wallet users and $7.8B in monthly DEX volume underscore its enterprise appeal. Sui (SUI)’s institutional traction could divert capital from ETH and SOL, uplifting privacy tokens like ZEC. Meme coins may lag, but Sui (SUI)’s enterprise focus could spark a Layer-1 rally if adoption accelerates. Momentum, Milestones, and the Window That’s Closing Fast With over 13,400 holders and a Twitter community of more than 12,000 followers, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has quietly built strong grassroots momentum while preparing for the next major milestones. The Beta platform release, set to launch alongside the token listing, marks a significant step forward in utility rollout. It will showcase live lending functionality, user dashboards, and staking modules—all critical components for DeFi adoption. To support early adopters and expand user onboarding, the project has also launched a $100,000 giveaway , giving 10 winners the chance to claim $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. This campaign adds another incentive layer while building excitement ahead of the upcoming price tier shift. Investors who entered during earlier rounds have already started seeing impressive gains. For example, one buyer who committed $5,000 during Phase 2 at $0.015 per token secured 333,333 MUTM tokens. As the presale has progressed to $0.03 in Phase 5, that initial stake has doubled in value to $10,000, reflecting a 100% return before the token has even listed publicly. With the listing price locked in at $0.06, this investor’s holdings are projected to reach $20,000, marking a 300% gain over the original allocation. Longer-term forecasts are even more compelling: if MUTM achieves analyst targets of $0.24 to $0.45 by late 2025, the same portfolio could be worth between $80,000 and $150,000—a staggering 1,500% to 2,900% return. As an Ethereum-based protocol combining audited smart contracts, real product development, and sustainable staking rewards, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out among presales for offering genuine utility alongside high upside potential. Lending Freedom and Passive Income in One Protocol Unlike single-function tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being developed around two complementary lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). These systems are designed to offer flexibility for users across the risk spectrum. In the upcoming P2C model, investors will be able to lend assets like ETH, LINK, or BTC into smart contract-managed liquidity pools where interest will be earned based on real-time utilization. For example, users depositing a blue-chip asset can expect variable APYs tied to lending demand—automated and transparently managed through decentralized infrastructure. For users who prefer personalized lending agreements, the P2P model will enable direct loan creation—particularly valuable for meme coin traders or holders of speculative tokens. In this setup, users offering DOGE or PEPE as collateral will be able to negotiate custom terms—including interest rates, loan durations, and collateral ratios—with individual lenders. These loans will be fully isolated, meaning lenders take on only the specific risk they agree to, without any exposure to the wider liquidity pools. What’s more, all future depositors will receive mtTokens—ERC-20 tokens that represent both the original deposit and accrued yield over time. These mtTokens will also be stakeable, unlocking passive dividends paid directly from protocol revenue. As part of its design, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will conduct MUTM token buybacks using fees generated from lending activity, then redistribute those tokens to mtToken stakers—making it one of the few platforms actively connecting protocol utility to long-term token value growth. As Sui (SUI) continues to enjoy a temporary spotlight following its 17% gain, many seasoned investors are already diversifying into more utility-driven plays. Analysts who accurately predicted Ethereum’s breakout now name Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a top contender to outperform legacy altcoins in the next bull cycle. With the next pricing tier about to activate and demand accelerating, the window to enter at $0.03 is closing fast. The smart capital is already moving. It’s not just about being early—it’s about being right.

48403881,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=178996,1752746434,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/48403881.jpeg,Hashed stablecoin: South Korea’s Crypto Giant Unveils Bold Trademark Play,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/hashed-stablecoin-korea-trademarks/,"BitcoinWorld Hashed stablecoin: South Korea’s Crypto Giant Unveils Bold Trademark Play The dynamic world of cryptocurrency never stands still, and recent developments from South Korea’s prominent venture capital firm, Hashed, are once again stirring the pot. Known for its significant investments and foresight in the digital asset space, Hashed has made a strategic move by filing multiple crypto trademarks related to stablecoins. This isn’t just a bureaucratic step; it’s a powerful signal, hinting at ambitious plans that could reshape the landscape of Hashed stablecoin initiatives and further solidify South Korea crypto leadership in the global blockchain arena. What does this mean for the future of digital finance, and how might it impact the burgeoning Korean blockchain ecosystem? What’s Behind Hashed’s Bold Move in the Hashed Stablecoin Space? On July 14, as reported by Digital Asset, Hashed formally applied for trademarks including “KRWo,” “OKRW,” and “FKRW.” These specific terms immediately suggest a strong connection to the Korean Won (KRW), indicating a potential intention to launch or support a stablecoin pegged to South Korea’s national currency. For those unfamiliar, stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to minimize price volatility, usually by being pegged to a “stable” asset like fiat currency, gold, or other cryptocurrencies. They act as a crucial bridge between the volatile crypto market and traditional financial systems, facilitating transactions, lending, and hedging. Hashed’s Vision: As a leading venture capital firm, Hashed has consistently been at the forefront of identifying and nurturing groundbreaking blockchain projects. Their move into stablecoin trademarks suggests a long-term vision that extends beyond mere investment – it points towards active participation in shaping the future of money. The “KRW” Clue: The presence of “KRW” in the proposed trademark names like “KRWo” is highly indicative. It suggests a focus on a Korean Won-pegged stablecoin, which could serve as a foundational layer for various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications within the Korean market, or even for cross-border transactions involving the won. Strategic Timing: This action comes at a time when global discussions around stablecoin regulation are intensifying, and central banks worldwide are exploring their own Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Hashed’s proactive approach positions them as a key player in this evolving narrative. Why are Crypto Trademarks Crucial for Future Digital Asset Innovation? Filing crypto trademarks might seem like a mundane legal process, but in the fast-paced world of digital assets, it’s a critical strategic maneuver. Trademarks protect a company’s brand, name, and associated services, preventing others from using similar names that could confuse consumers. For a venture like Hashed, securing these trademarks is about much more than just legal protection; it’s about staking a claim in an emerging market segment and setting the stage for future digital asset innovation . Consider the implications: Aspect Significance of Trademark Filing Brand Protection Safeguards the unique identity of any future Hashed stablecoin, preventing competitors from leveraging similar names or concepts. This builds trust and recognition. Market Positioning Signals Hashed’s serious intent to enter the stablecoin market. It can attract potential partners, developers, and users who are looking for reliable and legally sound digital financial instruments. Future Product Development Provides a legal foundation for developing and launching products or services related to the trademarked terms. This could include wallets, payment systems, or DeFi protocols built around the stablecoin. Investor Confidence Demonstrates a commitment to long-term strategy and legal compliance, which can significantly boost investor confidence in Hashed’s ventures and the broader Korean blockchain ecosystem. In a space often criticized for its “Wild West” nature, moves like these by established firms underscore a growing maturity and a focus on building sustainable, compliant infrastructure. It’s a clear indicator that major players are looking to bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized technologies responsibly. The Broader Landscape of South Korea Crypto Adoption South Korea has long been a hotbed for cryptocurrency activity. With a tech-savvy population and a strong interest in emerging technologies, South Korea crypto adoption rates are among the highest globally. However, the regulatory environment has often been a tightrope walk, balancing innovation with investor protection and financial stability. Regulatory Evolution: South Korea has made significant strides in crypto regulation, particularly with the implementation of the Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information (Special FT Act). This act mandates real-name accounts for crypto transactions and imposes strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements on exchanges. Government Stance: While the government has shown caution, it has also expressed a desire to foster blockchain technology and digital asset innovation. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) and other bodies are actively working on frameworks for digital assets, including stablecoins. Retail and Institutional Interest: Both retail investors and institutional players in South Korea have shown immense interest in cryptocurrencies. The country boasts a vibrant developer community and numerous blockchain startups, making it a fertile ground for projects like a potential Hashed-backed stablecoin. Hashed’s trademark filings are not happening in a vacuum; they are part of a larger national conversation about how South Korea will integrate digital assets into its financial future. This strategic move could potentially pave the way for a domestically-focused stablecoin that aligns with national financial objectives and regulatory expectations. What Does This Mean for the Korean Blockchain Ecosystem? The potential launch of a Hashed-backed stablecoin, especially one pegged to the Korean Won, could have profound implications for the entire Korean blockchain ecosystem. A reliable, regulated, and widely accepted domestic stablecoin could unlock a myriad of new possibilities, driving further innovation and adoption. Here’s how it could impact the ecosystem: Enhanced DeFi Activity: A stablecoin pegged to the KRW would significantly boost local DeFi protocols, allowing for more seamless lending, borrowing, and trading activities without the foreign exchange risk associated with USD-pegged stablecoins. Streamlined Payments: Imagine instant, low-cost payments using a digital Won. This could revolutionize e-commerce, remittances, and even everyday transactions within South Korea, offering an alternative or complement to traditional payment rails. Interoperability: A robust Korean Won stablecoin could serve as a crucial interoperability layer, connecting various blockchain networks and traditional financial systems within the country. Competitive Edge: As countries globally race to develop their own digital currencies, a successful private-sector stablecoin could give South Korea a competitive edge in the global digital economy, showcasing its capacity for private-sector led digital asset innovation . While a private stablecoin and a CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) are distinct, the development of a strong private stablecoin could inform and even complement the Bank of Korea’s ongoing CBDC research. It could provide real-world testing grounds for digital currency infrastructure and user behavior. Navigating the Future of Digital Asset Innovation The journey towards widespread digital asset innovation , particularly concerning stablecoins, is fraught with both immense opportunity and significant challenges. Hashed’s recent trademark filings are a testament to the ongoing push for a more digitized and efficient financial future, but what hurdles lie ahead? Opportunities: Global Reach: A successful Hashed stablecoin could facilitate easier cross-border transactions for Korean businesses and individuals, reducing costs and increasing speed. Financial Inclusion: Stablecoins can offer access to financial services for underbanked populations, particularly in developing economies, though this might be less of a primary driver in South Korea. Programmable Money: The underlying blockchain technology allows for “programmable money,” enabling smart contracts to automate payments and financial agreements, opening up new business models. Challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: Stablecoins, especially those pegged to fiat currencies, are increasingly under the microscope of financial regulators worldwide. Hashed will need to navigate a complex and evolving regulatory landscape in South Korea and potentially internationally. Market Adoption: While crypto adoption is high in South Korea, convincing the broader public and traditional businesses to use a new digital currency requires significant effort in education, infrastructure, and trust-building. Competition: The stablecoin market is already competitive, dominated by giants like Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC). A new entrant, even a localized one, will face the challenge of gaining significant market share. Moreover, potential future CBDCs could also pose competition. Technological Risks: Ensuring the security, scalability, and stability of a blockchain-based stablecoin requires robust technical infrastructure and ongoing vigilance against cyber threats. Hashed’s strategic move is a clear indication that major players are not just watching from the sidelines but are actively investing in and shaping the future of digital finance. Their foresight in securing these trademarks positions them uniquely to lead significant advancements in the stablecoin sector, not just in South Korea but potentially influencing global trends. Conclusion: Hashed’s Vision for a Digitized Won Hashed’s recent filing of crypto trademarks for stablecoin-related terms like “KRWo” marks a pivotal moment for South Korea crypto and the broader Korean blockchain ecosystem. This strategic foresight by a leading venture capital firm underscores a powerful commitment to driving digital asset innovation , potentially laying the groundwork for a robust Hashed stablecoin pegged to the Korean Won. While the path ahead involves navigating regulatory complexities and fostering widespread adoption, Hashed’s bold move signals a future where digital currencies play an increasingly central role in South Korea’s financial landscape. It’s a compelling step towards a more efficient, interconnected, and digitally native economy, promising exciting developments for investors, developers, and everyday users alike.

WhaleFUD shared this update on X as part of Ripple’s expanding regulatory efforts in the region. Expanding XRP’s Reach in Europe In December 2023, Ripple secured registration as a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) with the Central Bank of Ireland. That step enabled the company’s Irish entity to offer limited crypto-related services within the country. However, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, which became fully effective in December 2024, introduces a harmonized licensing regime across all EU and EEA countries. By obtaining a MiCA license, Ripple could offer its services across the region with a single authorization. The regulatory alignment would not only streamline Ripple’s European operations but it would also expand the compliant use of XRP as part of its cross-border payment ecosystem. Building Infrastructure Around XRP While Ripple continues to develop products such as RLUSD, XRP remains central to the company’s on-chain liquidity solutions. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product, already used in several corridors , relies on XRP to enable near-instant settlement. A MiCA license would allow Ripple to scale this infrastructure across the EU with greater regulatory clarity, making XRP more accessible within formal financial systems. European financial institutions evaluating tokenized payment rails under MiCA would be able to engage Ripple’s services, and, by extension, XRP, within a fully authorized framework. A crypto researcher recently revealed that XRP will be classified as a utility token under MiCA . He also claimed that legal certainty could make the asset more attractive as a liquidity tool in cross-border payments under EU law. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Long-Term Play for XRP’s Utility in Europe Earlier this year, Ripple also established Ripple Payments Europe S.A. in Luxembourg, further signaling its intent to solidify a regulated presence in the EU. The company is reportedly pursuing an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license in the country, adding to its list of licenses from across the globe . Though XRP is not a stablecoin, its role in facilitating liquidity and value transfer within Ripple’s network would likely benefit from the added institutional access and legal backing a MiCA license provides. Ripple’s MiCA license bid signals a shift toward serving regulated European institutions, aiming to embed XRP in compliant payment services and boost adoption by providing legal certainty for digital asset use across the EU.

Twitter Is Buzzing,https://coinpedia.org/news/can-musks-grok-crack-satoshis-bitcoin-wallet-twitter-is-buzzing/,"The post Can Musk’s Grok Crack Satoshi’s Bitcoin Wallet? Twitter Is Buzzing appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Elon Musk , CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has stirred up the crypto crowd once again, this time with a simple laughing emoji. His reaction came after a playful post on X, where a user offered $200 to Grok, Musk’s AI chatbot, to crack open the Bitcoin wallets believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto. That single emoji was enough to send speculation swirling. Grok says, “Challenge Accepted “ In response to the post, Grok accepted the challenge, though with a heavy dose of sarcasm. It pointed out that trying to brute-force a 256-bit private key is practically impossible, even with all the GPUs in the world. As for the $200 tip? Grok joked it was “decent,” but nowhere near enough for a task that involves immense randomness and technical complexity. Still, Musk’s reaction, paired with Grok’s response, has sparked fresh talk about Musk’s links to crypto and the identity of Bitcoin’s elusive creator. Could Satoshi Become Richer Than Musk? Elon Musk has an estimated net worth of $366B. With Bitcoin hovers at $118,400 and taking Satoshi Nakamoto’s 1.029 million BTC into account, his current net worth is estimated at $129 billion. To dethrone Musk, BTC price/coin must cross $335,925 mark. Nakamoto now trails behind tech giant Oracle’s Larry Ellison ($257 billion) and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg ($247 billion). As Bitcoin’s value skyrockets, some wonder if Satoshi could take over Musk as the world’s richest person. Is Musk Actually Satoshi? That Theory Still Lives Musk’s experience in cryptography and co-founding X.com, which later became PayPal, has long fueled speculation that he could be Satoshi. A former SpaceX intern even pointed to resemblances between Musk’s and Satoshi’s writings. Musk stated, “ Not true ,” and dismissed all the speculation back in 2017. Nevertheless, his funny interaction with Bitcoin-related subjects backs speculation. Final Take Elon Musk’s playful reaction to the Satoshi wallet joke may seem harmless but in the crypto world, even a simple emoji can spark headlines. As Bitcoin’s price keeps rising, the idea that its anonymous creator could one day surpass Musk in wealth is fueling even more curiosity. For now, Musk’s humor keeps the mystery going and the crypto community watching closely.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-17 10:04:45

48404224,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=178997,1752747039,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/48404224.jpeg,SEC Bitcoin ETF Delay: Understanding the Crucial Impact on In-kind Redemptions,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-bitcoin-etf-delay/,"BitcoinWorld SEC Bitcoin ETF Delay: Understanding the Crucial Impact on In-kind Redemptions The world of cryptocurrency ETFs is buzzing once again, but this time with a note of cautious anticipation. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has just announced a postponement of its decision regarding a significant aspect of the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust and Bitwise Ethereum ETF: the allowance of ‘in-kind redemptions.’ This delay, reported by Decrypt based on a July 16 filing, keeps investors and market participants on the edge of their seats, wondering about the future trajectory of these highly anticipated investment vehicles. What does this mean for the burgeoning SEC Bitcoin ETF landscape and the broader digital asset market? What Does the SEC Bitcoin ETF Delay Mean for Investors? For those closely following the evolution of cryptocurrency investments, the recent move by the SEC is a familiar one – a delay, not a denial. The proposed rule change, which was submitted by NYSE Arca on May 21, aims to enable in-kind redemptions for Bitwise’s spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds. While the initial approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year was a monumental step, most currently operate under a ‘cash redemption’ model. The SEC’s decision to push back on the in-kind redemption model for the Bitwise ETFs signals a continued cautious approach to integrating digital assets into traditional finance. This delay extends the review period, giving the regulatory body more time to deliberate on the complexities and potential implications of such a mechanism. For investors, it means that while the dream of a more efficient and potentially tax-friendly redemption process for these ETFs remains alive, its realization is still some way off. The market is now keenly watching for the SEC’s next move, understanding that each decision shapes the accessibility and operational dynamics of crypto-based financial products. Unpacking In-kind Redemptions: Why the SEC is Hesitant At the heart of the SEC’s deliberation lies the concept of In-kind Redemptions . But what exactly are they, and why are they such a focal point for regulators and issuers alike? What are In-kind Redemptions? In an in-kind redemption model, authorized participants (APs) exchange shares of an ETF directly for the underlying assets (in this case, Bitcoin or Ethereum) rather than cash. Conversely, for creation, APs would deliver BTC or ETH to the fund in exchange for new ETF shares. Benefits for Investors and Issuers: This method is generally considered more tax-efficient because it avoids the need for the fund to sell assets and incur capital gains, which could then be passed on to shareholders. It can also be more efficient for market makers, potentially leading to tighter spreads and lower costs for investors. SEC’s Concerns: The primary reason for the SEC’s hesitation revolves around investor protection and market integrity. Regulators are wary of potential market manipulation, custody risks associated with holding large amounts of volatile cryptocurrencies, and ensuring robust oversight mechanisms are in place. The direct handling of crypto assets by APs, rather than cash equivalents, introduces new layers of complexity and risk that the SEC is meticulously evaluating. The current spot Bitcoin ETFs, including those from BlackRock and Fidelity, operate on a cash redemption model, where APs transact in cash to create or redeem shares. While functional, many in the industry believe in-kind redemptions offer a superior structure, aligning more closely with how traditional commodity and equity ETFs operate. The SEC’s extended review period for Bitwise underscores their deep dive into these nuanced operational differences and their potential systemic impact. The Broader Impact on Ethereum ETF and the Crypto Market While the immediate focus is on Bitwise’s specific filings, the SEC’s approach to in-kind redemptions has far-reaching implications, particularly for the anticipated Ethereum ETF landscape. The approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is still pending, and the SEC’s cautious stance on redemption mechanisms for Bitcoin ETFs will undoubtedly influence its decisions for Ether-based products. If the SEC eventually approves in-kind redemptions for Bitcoin ETFs, it could set a precedent that smooths the path for similar structures in Ethereum ETFs. Conversely, continued delays or outright rejections could mean that all future spot crypto ETFs, including those for Ethereum, might be restricted to cash redemption models for the foreseeable future. This regulatory uncertainty can impact: Institutional Adoption: A more streamlined and tax-efficient in-kind redemption process could attract more institutional capital into the crypto space. Delays might deter some traditional finance players. Market Liquidity: In-kind redemptions can theoretically improve market liquidity by allowing APs to manage arbitrage opportunities more efficiently, directly interacting with the underlying crypto markets. Investor Confidence: Clear and consistent regulatory frameworks build investor confidence. Protracted delays, while understandable from a regulatory perspective, can sometimes foster uncertainty. The broader Crypto ETF market is still in its nascent stages, and every regulatory decision, no matter how small it seems, contributes to shaping its long-term structure and growth potential. This specific delay highlights the SEC’s commitment to a methodical, albeit slow, integration of digital assets into the mainstream financial system. Bitwise’s Position: A Pioneer in the Crypto ETF Race Bitwise has consistently been at the forefront of bringing digital asset investment products to market. They were among the first to file for a spot Bitcoin ETF and have been vocal proponents of more efficient and investor-friendly structures, including in-kind redemptions. Their proactive approach demonstrates a commitment to innovation within the regulatory boundaries. For Bitwise, this delay means a continuation of the waiting game. While they already have an operational spot Bitcoin ETF utilizing cash redemptions, securing approval for in-kind redemptions would offer them a competitive edge and potentially reduce operational complexities and costs. Their continued engagement with the SEC highlights the industry’s persistent efforts to refine and optimize crypto investment vehicles. This isn’t just about one company; it’s about pushing the entire industry forward towards more mature and integrated financial products. Navigating Challenges and Seizing Opportunities in the Crypto ETF Landscape The journey to fully integrated crypto ETFs is fraught with challenges, but also ripe with opportunities. The SEC’s delay on in-kind redemptions for the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF underscores the regulatory hurdles that remain. Challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: The SEC’s primary mandate is investor protection and market integrity, leading to intense scrutiny of novel asset classes and redemption mechanisms. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies presents unique challenges for fund management and risk assessment. Custody and Security: Ensuring the secure custody of digital assets is paramount, and the regulatory framework around this is still evolving. Opportunities: Maturing Market: Each regulatory step, even a delayed one, contributes to the maturation and legitimization of the crypto market. Increased Access: ETFs provide an accessible entry point for traditional investors who may be hesitant to directly hold cryptocurrencies. Innovation: The ongoing dialogue between issuers and regulators fosters innovation in product design and operational efficiency, pushing the boundaries of financial technology. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Spot Crypto ETFs? The SEC’s decision on in-kind redemptions for the Bitwise ETFs will undoubtedly set a precedent for future spot Crypto ETF products. While a definitive timeline remains elusive, market participants anticipate further engagement between issuers and the regulatory body. It is plausible that the SEC may request more information, propose specific conditions, or even hold public forums to gather diverse perspectives before making a final determination. The path forward for crypto ETFs, particularly those seeking more advanced operational structures like in-kind redemptions, will likely involve continued adaptation and collaboration between innovators and regulators. The ultimate goal for many is a seamless integration of digital assets into the broader financial ecosystem, offering investors diverse, regulated, and efficient avenues to gain exposure to this transformative asset class. Conclusion: Patience is a Virtue in the Crypto ETF Journey The SEC’s postponement of its decision on in-kind redemptions for the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs serves as a reminder that the journey of integrating cryptocurrencies into traditional financial products is a marathon, not a sprint. While the delay might be frustrating for some, it underscores the regulatory body’s commitment to a thorough and cautious approach, prioritizing investor protection and market stability above all else. The debate around In-kind Redemptions highlights critical operational and tax efficiency considerations that could significantly shape the future of these investment vehicles. As the industry continues to mature and regulatory clarity slowly emerges, patience remains a virtue for investors and innovators alike, eagerly awaiting the next chapter in the evolving story of SEC Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF products.

However, Big U.S. tech firms have come out with claims of unfair targeting by the EU, complaining that the bloc’s rules infringed on their right to free speech. Brussels has several concurrent investigations into Musk’s X under the EU’s DSA (Digital Services Act). It was expected to complete its probe into X’s violation of transparency rules before the EU’s summer, but will likely miss the deadline following the pause. One of three officials familiar with the matter said it was all tied up, adding that clarity of the EU–U.S. trade negotiations was necessary before pushing forward with investigations. The European Commission has sought to secure a trade agreement with the U.S. since April. The Commission’s President, Ursula von der Leyen, stated that the bloc would not change its rulebook despite pressure from the United States. President Donald Trump has directly attacked the EU probes and fines on U.S. firms, calling them “overseas extortion” and indirect taxation. Trump defended U.S. tech giants despite falling out with Musk a few weeks back. The bloc imposed fines of up to €700M on Meta and Apple for breaching antitrust regulations. Cavazzini separates X probes from trade talks European lawmaker Anna Cavazzini expected the Commission to continue “decisively” with its investigations into the X platform amid ongoing tariff negotiations with different U.S. representatives. The Commission also asserted that the investigations against X were independent of the trade talks. It added that it was fully committed to enforcing the DMA (Digital Markets Act) and the DSA. The Commission also disclosed that content moderation was another area it investigated alongside transparency violations. The Polish government and some European lawmakers also pushed the Commission to investigate X’s AI chatbot Grok. The chatbot generated some highly antisemitic tropes last week. However, the X team disagreed with the Commission’s interpretation of the DSA’s scope. The team also claimed that the Commission had disregarded entirely the “comprehensive work” done by the team to comply with the bloc’s rules. “The commission must continue making changes to EU regulations an absolute red line in tariff negotiations with the U.S.” – Anna Cavazzini , European lawmaker for the Greens Brussels officials said all decisions related to the U.S. were particularly politically sensitive due to the ongoing trade negotiations. They added that it was important not to offend Trump and his administration or escalate conflicts in transatlantic trade. However, they have also warned that any company breaching the DSA could face fines of up to 6% of its global turnover, and repeat offenders could face a total ban from European operations altogether. France launches criminal investigations against X France started investigating the X platform following accusations of high-profile political interference in Germany and Brazil. The Paris Public Prosecutor’s Office claimed that X was accused of the “alteration” of automated data processing functioning and the “fraudulent” data extraction from automated data processing systems by organized groups. These accusations allowed French prosecutors to order police interviews and search operations under French law. Nine EU civil society organizations have also filed complaints against X regarding the use of users’ data to target adverts. The organizations—the Center for Democracy and Technology Europe, Global Witness, AI Forensics, Panoptykon Foundation, Entropy, VoxPublic, European Digital Rights, Gesellschaft für Freiheitsrechte e.V. (GFF), and Stichting Bits of Freedom—took their complaints to the French media regulator Arcom and the European Commission. The organizations urged both regulators to enforce the DSA, which prohibited targeted adverts based on sensitive user data like sexuality, race, and religion. They said their concerns were based on their probe into X’s publicly available Ad Repository database, which the DSA requires companies to set up.

48404423,https://coinpedia.org/?p=483349,1752747285,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Trusted UK Agent Caught Stealing Over 50 BTC from Seized Funds,https://coinpedia.org/news/trusted-uk-agent-caught-stealing-over-50-btc-from-seized-funds/,"The post Trusted UK Agent Caught Stealing Over 50 BTC from Seized Funds appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The rot starts from the head.” This age-old proverb rings true in a shocking case from the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA), where a former officer, Paul Chowles , was convicted of stealing a significant number of Bitcoins seized during the Silk Road 2.0 investigation. Chowles’ Role in the Infamous Silk Road 2.0 Case The Silk Road 2.0 was a notorious dark web marketplace taken down by the FBI in 2014. It had served as a successor to the original Silk Road, facilitating illegal drug sales, money laundering, and other criminal activities. One of its co-founders, Thomas White, was arrested and later sentenced to over five years in prison for a range of charges, including drug trafficking, laundering proceeds of crime, and even possessing child abuse material. As part of the investigation, at least 97 BTC were confiscated from White’s digital wallets. Chowles, then an NCA officer, was actively involved in data recovery and analysis from the seized devices. But rather than upholding the law, he ultimately chose to abuse his access. The Insider Theft That Shocked the Agency In 2017, the NCA identified that more than 50 BTC had quietly disappeared from the seized stash. Initially, investigators suspected White himself, but after strong denial from his side, attention turned inward. What followed was an internal probe that uncovered corruption in their ranks. During searches of Chowles’ properties, authorities discovered a mobile phone linked to the wallet where the stolen Bitcoin was sent. Notebooks containing crypto wallet passwords and login details were also found. His search history revealed he had been looking up information about using crypto exchanges. Investigators also learned that Chowles had used a crypto mixer called Bitcoin Fog — a service commonly used to anonymize cryptocurrency transactions. Analysis by Chainalysis revealed that some of the stolen BTC was later liquidated using crypto debit cards and crypto exchanges. From Crimefighter to Convict: The Sentencing Eventually, Chowles admitted guilt and pleaded guilty to charges of theft, transferring criminal property, and concealing criminal property. His betrayal earned him a 5.5-year prison sentence. Prosecutor Alex Johnson of the Crown Prosecution Service confirmed that asset confiscation proceedings would now follow to recover the stolen funds. The scale of Chowles’ theft was staggering. Reports state he spent approximately $146,580 using crypto debit cards, and his total illegal benefit was estimated at $821,345. At today’s Bitcoin price of $118,258, the seized funds are now worth far more than they were in 2014, adding to the severity of the breach. This case not only exposed a deep failure in oversight but also delivered a message: corruption can exist even among those appointed to root it out. And in the crypto space, where traceability meets complexity, even an insider’s mistake leaves a trail. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a landmark move that signals a significant shift in the landscape, Shinhan Bank , a titan among South Korean financial institutions, has officially launched a dedicated crypto page within its popular SOL Bank application. This isn’t just another update; it’s a pioneering step, marking Shinhan Bank as the first Korean commercial bank to venture into this digital frontier with such a comprehensive offering. For anyone tracking the integration of digital assets into mainstream finance, this development is nothing short of fascinating, promising to reshape how users interact with cryptocurrencies in South Korea crypto markets. Shinhan Bank’s Bold Leap: Pioneering Crypto Integration On July 17, Shinhan Bank made headlines with its announcement, detailed by Asia Economy, about the launch of its specialized crypto page. This strategic initiative is embedded within the “lifestyle” tab of its widely used SOL Bank app, making it easily accessible to millions of users. But what exactly does this dedicated section offer, and why is it such a significant milestone? The new crypto page is designed to be a one-stop hub for users interested in the digital asset space. It provides a range of features aimed at both novice and experienced crypto enthusiasts: Real-time Crypto Prices: Users can now conveniently track the live prices of various cryptocurrencies directly within their banking app, eliminating the need to switch between multiple platforms. Beginner Guides: Recognizing that many users are new to the complexities of crypto, the page includes educational resources to help demystify blockchain technology and digital assets. Expert Reports: For those seeking deeper insights, the platform offers expert analyses and market reports, providing valuable information for informed decision-making. Latest News: Staying updated on the fast-paced crypto market is crucial, and the integrated news feed ensures users have access to the most recent developments. This move by Shinhan Bank is more than just adding a feature; it’s an acknowledgement of the growing demand for crypto services and a proactive step towards meeting that demand within a regulated, trusted environment. What Does This Mean for the Korean Commercial Bank Landscape? Being the first Korean commercial bank to launch such a dedicated crypto page places Shinhan Bank at the forefront of financial innovation in the region. Historically, traditional banks have approached cryptocurrencies with caution, often due to regulatory uncertainties and perceived risks. However, as the digital asset market matures and gains wider acceptance, financial institutions are beginning to recognize its potential. This development signifies several key shifts: Legitimization: A major commercial bank embracing crypto adds a layer of legitimacy and trust for the general public, potentially encouraging more mainstream adoption. Accessibility: Integrating crypto information and services directly into a banking app lowers the barrier to entry for many, making it less intimidating for new users to explore digital assets. Competitive Pressure: Shinhan Bank’s move could spark a competitive race among other Korean commercial bank s to offer similar or even more advanced crypto services, accelerating the integration of digital assets into the broader financial system. This proactive stance by Shinhan Bank could set a precedent for how traditional finance interacts with the crypto world, not just in South Korea but globally. Unlocking New Opportunities: Benefits for South Korea Crypto Adoption The implications of Shinhan Bank’s initiative for South Korea crypto adoption are profound. South Korea has always been a hotbed for cryptocurrency activity, with a tech-savvy population and a strong interest in digital innovation. However, regulatory frameworks have often been stringent, leading to a cautious approach from traditional financial players. This new crypto page offers several benefits: Enhanced User Experience: By centralizing information and eventually trading features within a familiar banking app, Shinhan Bank is significantly improving the user experience for crypto enthusiasts in South Korea. Increased Trust and Security: Operating within a regulated bank environment can alleviate concerns about security and scams, which have historically plagued the nascent crypto market. Users may feel more secure managing their crypto assets through a trusted financial institution. Bridge Between TradFi and Crypto: This initiative acts as a crucial bridge, connecting the established world of traditional finance with the dynamic realm of digital assets. It facilitates a smoother transition for users who might be hesitant to engage directly with standalone crypto exchanges. The success of this venture by Shinhan Bank could pave the way for a more robust and integrated South Korea crypto ecosystem, attracting new users and fostering greater innovation. Seamless Transactions: The Power of Korbit Integration Beyond just providing information, Shinhan Bank has even more ambitious plans for its crypto page. The bank intends to introduce actual crypto trading features through its existing real-name account integration with local exchange Korbit . This is a critical development that moves beyond mere information provision to facilitating actual transactions. The planned features include: Balance Checks: Users will be able to view their cryptocurrency balances held on Korbit directly within the Shinhan Bank app. Limit Increase Requests: Streamlining the process for users to request higher trading limits, making it easier for them to manage larger transactions. The integration with Korbit is a strategic partnership that leverages the expertise of a well-established local crypto exchange while providing the security and familiarity of a major bank. This collaboration is a testament to the growing synergy between traditional finance and crypto exchanges, recognizing that each brings unique strengths to the table. For users, it means a more seamless and integrated experience, reducing friction in managing their digital assets. This deepening relationship between Shinhan Bank and Korbit could set a new standard for how banks collaborate with crypto platforms globally. The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities While Shinhan Bank’s move is undoubtedly a positive step, the path forward for crypto integration in traditional banking is not without its challenges. Regulatory clarity remains a key factor, as governments worldwide grapple with how to best regulate digital assets. Security concerns, particularly regarding cyberattacks and data privacy, will also need continuous attention. Furthermore, educating a broad user base about the intricacies of cryptocurrencies will be an ongoing task. However, the opportunities far outweigh the challenges. As more institutions like Shinhan Bank embrace digital assets, we can expect to see: Increased Liquidity: Greater institutional involvement can bring more capital into the market, enhancing liquidity. Innovative Products: The integration could lead to the development of new financial products that blend traditional banking services with crypto. Global Adoption: Success stories in one region often inspire similar initiatives elsewhere, potentially accelerating global crypto adoption. This bold step by the Korean commercial bank demonstrates a forward-thinking approach, positioning Shinhan Bank as a leader in the evolving financial landscape. A New Era for Finance in South Korea Shinhan Bank’s launch of a dedicated crypto page is more than just a new feature; it’s a powerful statement about the future of finance. By offering real-time crypto prices, educational resources, expert reports, and the promise of direct trading features through Korbit integration , the bank is making digital assets more accessible and trustworthy for its vast customer base. This pioneering move by a major Korean commercial bank is set to significantly impact South Korea crypto adoption, fostering a more integrated and user-friendly environment for digital asset management. As the first of its kind, Shinhan Bank is setting a precedent that other financial institutions, both in South Korea and globally, will undoubtedly watch closely. This could very well be the beginning of a new era where cryptocurrencies are not just an alternative investment but an integral part of mainstream banking services, seamlessly woven into our daily financial lives.

48408251,https://coinpedia.org/?p=483355,1752752444,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Dogecoin (DOGE) in Trouble: These 2 Utility-Backed Meme Coins Are Getting All the Attention in 2025,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/these-2-utility-backed-meme-coins-are-getting-all-the-attention-in-2025/,"The post Dogecoin (DOGE) in Trouble: These 2 Utility-Backed Meme Coins Are Getting All the Attention in 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Dogecoin (DOGE) might be the original meme coin, but in 2025, it’s no longer the most exciting. As the crypto landscape evolves, a new generation of meme tokens is gaining traction by offering more than just laughs — they’re offering real technology and long-term utility. Two standout projects are leading this revolution: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) and Pepe (PEPE). Both have surged in visibility and adoption, while DOGE appears to be stuck in a state of stagnation. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme Hype Meets Layer-2 Innovation Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is quickly rewriting the rules of what a meme coin can be. No longer just a fun community token, LILPEPE is now listed on CoinMarketCap (CMC) — a significant milestone that cements its credibility and transparency in the eyes of global crypto investors. Currently in Stage 5 of its presale, LILPEPE is priced at $0.0014, with over $5.3 million raised out of a $6.575 million target. The presale has already sold more than 4.34 billion tokens, or 82.72% of the total supply allocated for this round, and the price is about to rise to $0.0015 in the next stage. But it’s not just the numbers that make Little Pepe stand out — it’s the technology and vision behind the project. Unlike most meme coins that rely solely on social media hype, LILPEPE is building the first-ever Layer 2 blockchain specifically for meme coins. This blockchain promises ultra-low fees, lightning-fast transactions, and, most importantly, built-in protection against sniper bots — a critical advantage for fair token launches and the protection of retail investors. The integrated meme coin launchpad enhances its appeal, enabling developers to launch, fund, and grow their meme coin projects directly on the LILPEPE chain. LILPEPE isn’t just a meme coin — it’s the infrastructure for the next generation of meme coins. The team behind LILPEPE comprises anonymous yet well-connected crypto veterans with a proven track record of success in past top meme projects. Their reputation, combined with high execution and clear milestones, has led to significant community support. Upon launch, LILPEPE is expected to be listed on two major centralized exchanges (CEXs), with plans underway for a future listing on the world’s largest exchange. Now officially tracked on CoinMarketCap, the project has entered a new phase of credibility and exposure. With a real roadmap, a growing base of long-term holders, and a utility-focused ecosystem, Little Pepe is no longer just a meme — it’s a movement. PEPE: Whale Accumulation and Bullish Momentum Fuel the Rally While LILPEPE is capturing investors with its future-focused tech, Pepe (PEPE) is staging an impressive comeback in the current bull market. Over the past 24 hours, PEPE has surged by 14%, jumping from $0.000011141 to $0.000012812, fueled by heavy whale buying and a broader market rally. According to Nansen data, the top 100 PEPE addresses have increased their holdings by over 2.3% in the past month, while exchange balances have decreased by 2.17%. This classic supply squeeze — with whales accumulating and fewer tokens available on exchanges — often signals long-term investor confidence. Currently, whales hold 304.1 trillion PEPE tokens, which continues to grow. The movement of tokens off exchanges and into private wallets suggests these large holders are in it for the long run. From a technical standpoint, PEPE has established a wide trading range between $0.000009823 and $0.000013068 during its latest rally. Analysts have identified $0.000012482 as a key resistance level, while $0.000011013 remains a solid support level, backed by strong buyer interest on dips. Further validation comes from the CoinDesk Memecoin Index (CDMEME), which climbed 11.3% in the past 24 hours, outperforming the broader CoinDesk 20 Index’s 7.3% gain. It’s clear that traders are flocking to memecoins, and PEPE is one of the biggest beneficiaries. While PEPE doesn’t yet offer the kind of advanced utility LILPEPE is building, its explosive momentum, high liquidity, and whale support give it real staying power in the meme coin arena. Dogecoin’s Diminishing Dominance Dogecoin is lagging, with no DeFi, no Layer 2, and no major upgrades, making it feel increasingly outdated. With no clear development roadmap, DOGE’s future relies heavily on its past, which may no longer be sufficient in a market shifting toward meme coins that offer utility, speed, and developer engagement. In 2025, investors want more than just memes — they seek ecosystems, scalability, and fairness. LILPEPE and PEPE deliver in these areas, each in their own way. Conclusion: The Meme Coin Market Has a New Leader DOGE may have started the meme coin revolution, but Little Pepe and PEPE are leading the next wave. With LILPEPE now listed on CoinMarketCap, building a dedicated Layer-2 chain, and closing in on a multi-million-dollar presale target, it has quickly become one of the year’s most exciting projects.

Citing data from Goldman Sachs prime brokerage desk, Reuters reports hedge funds dumped bank stocks for the second straight week and bought consumer staple stocks at the fastest pace in nearly two years. The funds are exiting long positions in US banks and global financial services companies while adding short positions on European financial stocks. Goldman says banks, financial services firms and insurance companies were net sold while those involved in trading and consumer finance were net bought. The moves come as Wall Street’s record rally is set to be put to the test this week, as major banks release their second-quarter earnings reports. Meanwhile, hedge funds are buying consumer staples, which include food, beverages and tobacco that tend to be insulated from economic downturns because they are essential items. Goldman says this is the most net-bought stock sector at the Goldman Sachs prime brokerage desk this month.

Noyb has made a name for itself by filing complaints against American companies like Apple, Alphabet, and Meta, triggering several investigations and billions of dollars in fines. Noyb’s argument to regulators The advocacy group’s complaints were lodged with data protection authorities in Belgium, Greece, and the Netherlands. Their primary focus is the companies’ alleged refusal to grant users full access to their personal data, as EU law requires. According to noyb, the refusal is rooted in stubbornness ,which keeps the average European user ignorant of how their data is processed and whether it complies with GDPR provisions, particularly where data transfers to China are concerned. Most tech companies usually have a tool that allows them to fulfill requests for downloading user information. However, some Chinese companies have made it almost impossible to access the information, noyb has said. If these Chinese companies had implemented some automation tool that allows them to fulfill GDPR access requests on a mass scale, like via a “download your information” tool, it would hypothetically make it extremely easy for them to comply with EU law. However, according to Kleanthi Sardeli, data protection lawyer at noyb, TikTok, AliExpress and WeChat all enjoy collecting as much data about their users while keeping them them dark about its use. Noyb says both TikTok and AliExpress have refused to give the data subjects access to all of their data as required under Article 15 GDPR, with TikTok only providing part of the complainant’s data in an unstructured form that it alleged was hard to grasp. AliExpress chose to provide a broken file that could be opened only once, while WeChat just completely ignored the complainant’s request. TikTok and AliExpress’s actions forced the users to send a series of follow-up questions, giving them a second chance to respond. However, rather than supply the missing data, both companies repeated the contents of their privacy policy without any individual information, making it impossible for the complainants to verify whether their data had been processed in line with the GDPR. Fresh complaints follow earlier actions against other companies Noyb has been busy this year. The advocacy group reportedly already filed complaints against TikTok, AliExpress, SHEIN, Temu, and WeChat earlier this year in January, seeking to get them to suspend data transfers to China while calling for fines that can reach up to 4% of offending firms’ global revenue. According to EU law, data transfers outside the EU are only permitted if the destination country doesn’t undermine the protection of data. Since Chinese laws do not limit access to personal data by the authorities, it is not possible for companies to protect EU users’ data from government access. SHEIN, Temu and Xiaomi reportedly provided the complainants with additional information during the proceedings, but TikTok , AliExpress and WeChat continued to violate the GDPR. Kleanthi Sardeli, data protection lawyer at noyb said: “The GDPR makes it clear that companies must give their users specific information about the data they are processing about them. Just because they receive a lot of requests doesn’t mean they can withhold information.” The fresh noyb complaints filed with the data protection authorities (DPAs) in Belgium, Greece and the Netherlands request that the respective DPAs issue a decision declaring that TikTok, AliExpress, and WeChat have violated Article 12 and 15 of the GDPR. In addition, the group has requested that the companies be ordered to fulfill the complainants’ access requests and suggest that the DPAs impose an administrative fine to prevent similar violations in the future.

The launch of spot Ethereum ETFs has been a highly anticipated event, and BlackRock’s ETHA has just delivered a performance that has sent ripples across the entire crypto ecosystem. On July 16, this prominent Ethereum ETF recorded an astounding net inflow of $489.14 million, equivalent to 148,585 ETH. This wasn’t just another good day; it marked ETHA’s highest daily inflow since its inception, with trading volume soaring to a record $1.8 billion. This colossal surge signals a pivotal moment for institutional crypto adoption and could have a significant ETH market impact. BlackRock ETHA: A New Benchmark for Institutional Interest BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, entering the crypto space with a spot Ethereum ETF was always going to be a game-changer. Their reputation and vast network bring an unparalleled level of legitimacy and accessibility to digital assets for traditional investors. The recent inflow figures for BlackRock ETHA aren’t just numbers; they represent a powerful vote of confidence from institutional players who are increasingly recognizing the potential of Ethereum. Record-Breaking Performance: The $489.14 million net inflow on July 16 surpassed all previous daily records for ETHA, showcasing rapidly accelerating interest. Massive Trading Volume: A concurrent trading volume of $1.8 billion further underscores the high liquidity and active participation in this specific Ethereum ETF. The BlackRock Effect: BlackRock’s involvement provides a stamp of approval that resonates deeply with traditional financial institutions, often leading to a domino effect of further investment. While net flow data for other spot ETH ETFs is still awaited, ETHA’s performance alone paints a compelling picture of growing institutional appetite for Ethereum. Understanding the Significance of Spot ETH Inflows What exactly do these massive spot ETH inflows mean, and why are they so important? When an ETF experiences a net inflow, it means that investors are buying more shares of the ETF than they are selling. To accommodate this demand, the ETF issuer (in this case, BlackRock) must acquire more of the underlying asset – actual Ethereum – from the open market. This direct buying pressure can have a profound effect on the asset’s price and market dynamics. Consider the trajectory of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. Their successful launch and subsequent inflows were significant drivers of Bitcoin’s price rally, validating the concept of accessible crypto investment vehicles for a broader audience. The current trend with Ethereum ETFs, particularly BlackRock ETHA, suggests a similar pattern is emerging for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The consistent flow of capital into these regulated investment products indicates a long-term commitment from sophisticated investors who seek exposure to Ethereum without the complexities of direct crypto ownership. This shift from speculative retail interest to sustained institutional demand is a hallmark of market maturation. The Accelerating Trend of Institutional Crypto Investment The record inflows into BlackRock ETHA are not an isolated event but rather a clear indicator of a broader, accelerating trend: the mainstreaming of institutional crypto investment. For years, digital assets were largely viewed with skepticism by traditional finance. However, the maturation of the market, clearer regulatory frameworks (albeit still evolving), and the undeniable performance of cryptocurrencies have shifted perceptions. Institutions are now looking beyond Bitcoin to other established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, recognizing its foundational role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and the broader Web3 ecosystem. Ethereum’s robust developer community, ongoing technological upgrades (like the transition to Proof-of-Stake), and its utility as a programmable blockchain make it an attractive long-term investment. This wave of institutional capital brings with it not just liquidity but also increased credibility, improved infrastructure, and potentially greater price stability as the market becomes less reliant on purely retail sentiment. It’s a testament to the fact that digital assets are no longer a niche curiosity but a legitimate asset class being integrated into diversified investment portfolios. What Does This Mean for the ETH Market Impact? The immediate and long-term ETH market impact of such significant inflows from an Ethereum ETF like ETHA could be multifaceted: Price Appreciation: Direct buying pressure from the ETF on the open market can lead to an increase in Ethereum’s price. Sustained inflows suggest a strong underlying demand that could support upward price momentum. Increased Liquidity: As more institutions participate through ETFs, the overall liquidity of the ETH market improves, making it easier for large transactions to occur without significant price slippage. Reduced Volatility: While crypto markets are inherently volatile, the entrance of institutional money, often characterized by longer investment horizons and more sophisticated risk management, can gradually contribute to a more stable market environment over time. Enhanced Legitimacy: The success of spot Ethereum ETFs, particularly those from major players like BlackRock, further legitimizes Ethereum as an investable asset class, potentially attracting even more capital from cautious institutional investors. Network Development: A healthier market and increased investment can also indirectly benefit the Ethereum network itself, encouraging further development, innovation, and adoption of its underlying technology. While past performance is not indicative of future results, the precedent set by Bitcoin ETFs suggests a positive correlation between sustained ETF inflows and the underlying asset’s market performance. Looking Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities for Ethereum ETFs Despite the current euphoria, the journey for Ethereum ETFs and the broader institutional crypto landscape isn’t without its challenges. Regulatory clarity remains an ongoing process in many jurisdictions, and market dynamics can shift rapidly. However, the opportunities presented by these investment vehicles are immense. The success of BlackRock ETHA could pave the way for other asset managers to see similar success with their own spot ETH ETFs, leading to a competitive market that benefits investors through lower fees and more diverse offerings. It also sets a precedent for potential spot ETFs for other major cryptocurrencies in the future. For investors, these ETFs offer a regulated, accessible, and often more secure way to gain exposure to Ethereum’s growth story. As the digital economy continues to evolve, the integration of traditional finance with decentralized technologies through products like the Ethereum ETF will be crucial for broader adoption and innovation. Conclusion: A New Era for Ethereum Investment The colossal $489.14 million net inflow into BlackRock’s ETHA on July 16 marks a truly historic moment for the Ethereum ecosystem and the broader cryptocurrency market. This record-breaking event underscores the surging institutional crypto interest and highlights the growing confidence in Ethereum as a legitimate and valuable asset. The impact of these substantial spot ETH inflows is likely to resonate across the ETH market, influencing price, liquidity, and overall market sentiment. As institutional capital continues to flow into these regulated investment products, we are witnessing a significant evolution in how the world perceives and interacts with digital assets. This isn’t just about a single ETF’s success; it’s about the accelerating mainstream adoption of a technology poised to redefine our financial future.

According to Sensor Tower data, the exchange’s ranking has climbed 65% over the past month, rising from 386 to 137 while Bitcoin has gained 10% during the same period. Historically, Coinbase app downloads have mirrored crypto movements . During past bull markets, Coinbase consistently entered the top 175 of app store charts, whereas ranks below 500 often aligned with prolonged bear markets. Bitcoin’s recent surge to a new all-time high of $122,884, currently trading around $118,294, has fueled speculation that retail investors might be returning. Mixed Signals on Retail Return The crypto community remains divided on whether retail is truly coming back. Crypto analyst Tony Edwards noted on X that retail is “definitely starting to come back in,” citing a spike in his YouTube analytics. Similarly, Lab4Crypto remarked that “the crowd is slowly returning,” urging investors not to miss out if this marks the beginning of a new retail wave. However, some remain cautious. André Dragosch, head of research at Bitwise, argued that “retail is almost nowhere to be found,” pointing to stagnant Google search interest for “Bitcoin” despite its price surging to new highs. Crypto trader Elisa echoed this sentiment, highlighting that Google Trends data for “crypto” remains far below the peaks seen during the 2021 bull market. Traditional Indicators May Be Losing Reliability While retail interest is often gauged through app downloads and search trends, some industry observers warn these metrics may not reflect the complete picture in the current market. The rise of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs has provided retail investors with alternative avenues for crypto exposure, potentially reducing the reliance on direct exchange sign-ups. Since their January 2024 launch, spot Bitcoin ETFs have amassed $53.05 billion in inflows , while spot Ether ETFs, launched in July 2024, have attracted approximately $6 billion, according to Farside data. Bitfinex analysts noted on Tuesday that new Bitcoin buyers appear to be price-agnostic, with wallets holding between 1 and 100 BTC accumulating around 19,300 BTC monthly, outpacing the 13,400 BTC monthly issuance post-April 2024 halving.

At press time, CRV was trading just under the psychological $1.00 level, capping off a 42% rally so far this week and marking a remarkable 28.7% surge in the past 24 hours alone. CRV price breakout above multi-month resistance The current CRV’s uptrend follows a breakout above a major descending triangle pattern that had capped its upside for months, with the $0.81 level acting as a critical resistance zone. Curve DAO (CRV) price chart | Source: GeckoTerminal After consolidating for weeks within a compressing structure, the altcoin decisively broke out on July 16, igniting a wave of algorithmic buying that pushed prices sharply higher within hours. The pattern’s breakout confirmed bullish technicals and opened the door to significant upside potential, with analysts projecting a measured move toward the $1.30 to $1.50 range if momentum continues to build. Notably, the rally drove the altcoin to the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.9601, further validating the breakout’s strength and setting up a potential push toward the December 2023 peak at $1.2484. Trading volume surged nearly 98% on the day of the breakout, reaching $795 million and confirming the strength of the move with broad participation. CRV buyers dominate as exchange supply dries up While technical patterns offered the initial spark, it was the aggressive return of buyers and deep market participation that gave Curve DAO (CRV) its explosive lift this week. On-chain data from CryptoQuant shows that CRV exchange netflow plunged to a three-week low of -$2.67 million on July 16, following a similarly sharp drop to -$2.29 million the day prior. This consistent outflow from centralised exchanges signalled intense accumulation activity, as traders pulled tokens into private storage and sharply reduced the available supply for sale. Adding to the scarcity narrative, CRV’s stock-to-flow ratio — a widely tracked measure of token scarcity — surged to an all-time high of 71.68, indicating that fewer tokens are circulating relative to total supply. Historically, such supply constraints have preceded strong rallies in altcoins, particularly when matched with rising demand and speculative positioning. CRV’s futures markets fuel momentum and bullish sentiment In the derivatives markets, sentiment turned decidedly bullish as funding rates flipped positive and long positions began to dominate open interest. At press time on July 17, CRV’s OI-Weighted Funding Rate had climbed to 0.0316, with predictions pointing higher, while the long-short ratio was at 0.9948, according to Coinglass data . This shift in futures positioning reflected a growing belief among traders that Curve DAO (CRV) would continue to climb, further reinforcing spot demand and supporting upward momentum. At the same time, momentum indicators added fuel to the fire, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) hitting 84.7 and the Directional Index (+DI) jumping to 40.5, both signalling sustained strength in the ongoing rally. A bullish crossover on the MACD, with the line rising to 0.048 above the signal line at 0.007, underscored growing upside momentum, despite signals of overbought conditions. Key Curve DAO (CRV) price levels to watch in the coming days Although Curve DAO (CRV) now trades near a psychological milestone, bulls still face critical hurdles that must be cleared for the uptrend to continue toward $1.30 and beyond. A daily close above $0.9601 would confirm the continuation of the breakout, while reclaiming and holding $1.00 could unlock the next leg toward Fibonacci extension levels near $1.07 and ultimately $1.50. On the downside, failure to hold the $0.77 support area — previously resistance — could invalidate the bullish structure and trigger a short-term correction toward $0.70. Nevertheless, with momentum building across technical, on-chain, and derivative indicators, Curve DAO’s rally appears to be entering a new phase of strength driven by fundamentals rather than hype.

The Debate Continues Despite Its Current Developments,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-pi-network-a-scam-the-debate-continues-despite-its-current-developments/,"The post Is Pi Network a Scam? The Debate Continues Despite Its Current Developments appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Is Pi Network a scam? This has been a long-standing debate in the digital assets space, and various industry stakeholders have shared their opinions on this. While the crypto network is actively developing in 2025 to create a user-friendly environment and spread wide-scale adoption, the controversy is yet to be settled. Understanding Pi Network Pi Network was initially launched in 2019 by a group of Stanford graduates, aiming to make crypto mining accessible to everyone through a simple app on mobile. With promising services through smartphone apps, it accumulated a vast number of users. However, after some time, the project faced continuous criticism, which led to its exclusion from major crypto exchanges. What Are the Major Red Flags in Pi Network? Lack of transparency: One of the key reasons for Pi Network’s banishment from crypto exchanges is its lack of transparency. As the blockchain is not transparent, users find it difficult to assess the safety capabilities of the system. Data Privacy and Risk: Its lack of public evidence demonstrates that Pi Network has undergone a security audit by a third party. Without an audit, the project is viewed as unverified and exposes users’ private information and data to potential risks. Lack of Technical Conditions: Pi Network encourages a pyramid scheme for its promotion, meaning users are encouraged to invite others to increase the mining speed. While it primarily focuses on expanding the network, the valuable technical services and conditions remain absent. Major Industry Leader calling Pi Network a Scam Early this year, Bybit CEO Ben Zhou and a few other crypto experts labelled the Pi Network project a scam. Zhou explicitly said, “Yes, I still think you are a scam, and no, Bybit will not list scam.” While Zhou shared his opinion about the crypto network openly on X, other crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Binance indicated their views by excluding Pi Network from their crypto listings .

In a market breakdown released on July 16, Olszewicz dismissed any lingering doubt about the current market structure, arguing that the conditions for outsized altcoin performance are firmly in place. Crypto Alert: Altcoin Season Is Here “For years, you’ve had people telling you, ‘It’s an alt season.’ The funny thing is, when alt season is actually here, you don’t need anybody to tell you—it’s obvious,” Olszewicz said, emphasizing that current price action across major alts and risk assets leaves little room for ambiguity. Related Reading: Crypto Relief: House Advances GENIUS, CLARITY, Anti-CBDC Bills After Narrow Vote According to Olszewicz, Bitcoin remains the backbone of the crypto market, consolidating near $120,000 at the yearly pivot with “plenty of room to go” on technicals. He acknowledged that BTC’s strength underpins the entire market cycle, but the focus has shifted to the explosive moves underway in altcoins. “Let’s be honest—you’re here because you want to outperform BTC by 2x to 5x. That’s the goal,” he said. Ethereum sits at the center of this rotation, breaking out decisively from $2,200 to above $3,200. “ETH has had quite the breakout. It’s above the next pivot at $3,200. I don’t need the cloud to tell me this is bullish,” Olszewicz noted, pointing to technical tailwinds and regulatory clarity surrounding staking and ETFs as additional catalysts. While ETH advocates have renewed confidence, Olszewicz cautioned against overconfidence: “Be careful drinking the Kool-Aid. ETH could go to $10K, but I think it’ll struggle at $5K. For July, $4K looks realistic—but that’s already nearly 4x from the April bottom.” The analyst also flagged Solana as a key player for those who missed the early moves in BTC and ETH. “Sol is starting to look better and better here, approaching the yearly pivot. If it breaks above $177, watch out,” he said, although he warned that the SOL/ETH chart still shows weakness. Other strong setups include Sui, Avalanche, and meme coins like Dogecoin and Pepe, which have already logged triple-digit percentage gains in recent weeks from their respective bottom. Still, Olszewicz urged traders to temper expectations for an uninterrupted melt-up. Historically, August and September have been weaker months for crypto, and he anticipates potential sharp corrections in alts. “Maybe we don’t see huge continuation in those months. We could even get negative 25% days on alts—just randomly, for whatever reason. You know that’s coming,” he said. Related Reading: Crypto Bulls Rejoice: Congresswoman Confirms Powell’s Imminent Firing Despite these caveats, the broader outlook remains decisively bullish. “It’s hard to throw a dart and miss at this point in the market. Everything looks good. If you’re in positions that aren’t working here, you need to ask yourself why,” Olszewicz added. He highlighted that even NFTs, long considered a proxy for speculative appetite, are surging again, with collections like Pudgy Penguins and Bored Apes seeing multi-week highs. As for the much-debated ETH/BTC pair, Olszewicz reminded traders that relative value matters. “This is why everyone came here—for this chart. We’re still far below the cloud, at levels last seen in 2020. The target for mean reversion is 0.038. Until ETH/BTC is above the weekly cloud, don’t get carried away with the ETH-maxi stuff,” he said, adding that the long-term bear trend could persist into 2026 despite short-term strength. Olszewicz closed with a note of caution for overleveraged traders. “This is a marathon, not a sprint. Don’t lose your shirt on 50x leverage when there’s so much market left to trade,” he warned. With total altcoin market capitalization approaching critical resistance near $1.5 trillion and sentiment flashing risk-on across the board, the message from one of crypto’s most followed analysts is clear: Altcoin Season isn’t coming—it’s already here. At press time, the total crypto market cap surged to 3.75 trillion.

XRP Hits the Psychological Price of $3.25 As XRP rebounds from the neckline of a 7-year double bottom pattern, the 3rd-largest cryptocurrency continues to find the right footing after breaching the psychological prices of $3.0, $3.10, and $3.20. As a result, XRP is trading at $3.27, representing a 33.7% weekly increase, according to CoinGecko data . Market analyst Amina Chattha had previously opined that an inverse head & shoulders breakout was igniting XRP’s bullish momentum persists. Source: Amina Chattha Based on this analysis, XRP might be eyeing $3.50 next, which will see it record a new all-time high since the present one stands at $3.40. Therefore, XRP's climb to $3.27 is no flash in the pan, it’s the product of leveraging exchange-traded fund (ETF) hype , real‑world utility, technical breakout, regulatory clarity, and macro bullishness. Together, these forces have turned XRP's price zone into a psychological battleground. For instance, market attention has focused on the planned debut of the ProShares UXRP , a leveraged 2× XRP futures ETF. Anticipation around UXRP has already injected significant speculative momentum into XRP’s price. Leveraged instruments tend to amplify both trading volume and volatility, creating the conditions for sharp short‑term upside. Crypto analysts are positioning for further upside as traders stack leverage into momentum phases. Beyond crypto hype, XRP is benefiting from a broader wave of institutional interest. Grayscale recently added XRP to its Digital Large Cap Fund , marking a watershed in institutional acceptance. Additionally, the U.S. House’s movement on crypto bills, such as the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts, is shaping a friendlier regulatory environment that supports Ripple’s stablecoin strategy and separates XRP from SEC constraints. Korbit Makes a Bold XRP Move According to digital strategist John Squire, “9,999,999 XRP transferred. South Korea’s top exchange Korbit just moved nearly 10 MILLION XRP in one shot.” Source: XRPSCAN Korbit’s move, devoid of any stablecoins or fiat conversions, has sparked buzz ranging from strategic reallocation to market signaling. Transferring nearly 10 million XRP without converting to taker assets hints that Korbit isn’t unloading its XRP exposure. This quiet accumulation or redistribution can be seen as a signal of confidence in the asset, as opposed to washing out their holdings. Notably, large transfers like this typically stem from internal ledger reorganizations, such as consolidating hot and cold wallets, adjusting liquidity pools, or preparing for custodial updates. Analysts argue it’s a routine yet significant operational move, indicating active liquidity management by Korbit. Conclusion Korbit’s near 10 million XRP transfer is more than a mere internal shuffle, it’s a potential bellwether. It showcases operational strength, underscores market confidence, and syncs with an ecosystem abuzz about XRP’s future. As the XRP community watches for further on-chain signals, this move could mark an understated yet impactful milestone in the asset’s bullish narrative. For instance, fingers are crossed for the XRP Army as to whether the altcoin will soar to a new ATH in the course of this month as bulls continue holding the psychological price of $3.25.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ASIA|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-17 12:00:12

This announcement, coming from the highest echelons of the U.S. House of Representatives, signals a potentially pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry, indicating a growing willingness within a major political party to bring regulatory clarity to the volatile yet innovative world of digital assets. The Pivotal Shift in US Crypto Legislation The Speaker’s statement, reported by JinSe Finance citing Jin10.com, suggests a concerted effort to move forward with a regulatory framework that many in the crypto community have long awaited. For years, the lack of clear, comprehensive crypto legislation in the United States has been a significant hurdle for innovation, investment, and mainstream adoption. Businesses have struggled with regulatory uncertainty, often operating in a gray area that hinders growth and pushes talent overseas. This latest declaration from the US House Speaker could mark a turning point, providing the necessary political momentum to address these challenges. What does this mean for the current landscape? Historically, legislative efforts around cryptocurrencies have been fragmented, often debated across various committees with differing views on how to classify and regulate digital assets. From stablecoins to NFTs, and from decentralized finance (DeFi) to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), the scope of potential legislation is vast. This agreement among Republicans indicates a unified front to tackle these complex issues, aiming to provide a clearer path for the industry to thrive while also protecting consumers and maintaining financial stability. Understanding the US House Speaker’s Stance When the US House Speaker , Mike Johnson, makes such a statement, it carries substantial weight. As the leader of the House, his endorsement is crucial for prioritizing bills, allocating resources, and rallying party members to support specific legislative initiatives. His commitment suggests that cryptocurrency regulation is no longer a fringe issue but a mainstream policy concern that demands attention and action. Why is Speaker Johnson’s backing so important? His position allows him to: Set the Agenda: Influence which bills come to the floor for a vote. Unify the Party: Encourage members to vote along party lines, or at least to engage constructively. Signal Intent: Send a clear message to the industry, investors, and international partners about the U.S.’s regulatory direction. While the exact nature of the legislation remains to be fully detailed, it is widely anticipated to cover key areas such as market structure, consumer protection, and the classification of various digital assets. This move could pave the way for the U.S. to solidify its position as a leader in the global digital economy, fostering an environment where innovation can flourish responsibly. Decoding Republican Support and Internal Dynamics The announcement of Republican support for advancing crypto legislation is a significant political development. Generally, many Republicans advocate for policies that promote innovation, reduce regulatory burdens, and foster economic competitiveness, principles that often align with the decentralized and entrepreneurial spirit of the crypto industry. They tend to view digital assets as a new frontier for American ingenuity and a tool for individual financial freedom, rather than primarily as a source of illicit activity or systemic risk. However, the path to consensus is rarely smooth. Eleanor Terrett, host of Crypto in America, earlier reported on X that nine Republican lawmakers voted against a crypto bill, with three others not yet casting their votes. This highlights that while there’s a general agreement to push legislation, internal disagreements exist, likely concerning the specifics of any proposed bill. These dissenting votes could stem from various factors: Specific Bill Details: Disagreements over particular clauses, definitions, or regulatory agencies’ roles. Ideological Differences: Some lawmakers might hold more conservative views on financial innovation or have concerns about potential risks associated with digital assets. Constituent Concerns: Representing districts with varying perspectives on crypto’s benefits and risks. Regulatory Approach: Debate over whether to adopt a light-touch approach or a more stringent regulatory framework. Overcoming these internal divisions will be key to ensuring any proposed legislation has enough bipartisan backing to pass both the House and the Senate. The Speaker’s commitment, however, suggests a strong push to reconcile these differences and present a unified front. What This Means for Digital Assets in America The potential for comprehensive digital assets legislation carries profound implications for the entire crypto ecosystem in the United States. For businesses, regulatory clarity means the ability to plan, invest, and innovate with greater certainty. Currently, many crypto companies face a patchwork of state-level regulations and conflicting guidance from federal agencies, making compliance complex and costly. A unified federal framework could: Foster Innovation: Encourage new companies to build and operate within the U.S., retaining domestic talent and capital. Attract Investment: Provide institutional investors with the confidence needed to deploy significant capital into the crypto space. Enhance Consumer Protection: Establish clear rules of the road for exchanges, custodians, and other service providers, reducing risks for everyday users. Improve Market Integrity: Combat illicit finance and market manipulation through clear oversight mechanisms. For individual investors, clear rules around digital assets could lead to more secure platforms, better-understood investment products, and a reduction in scams and fraudulent activities. It could also clarify tax obligations and provide a more stable environment for long-term participation in the crypto market. The U.S. has been lagging behind other major economies, such as the European Union with its MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation, in establishing a comprehensive framework. This renewed push could help the U.S. regain its competitive edge and ensure it remains a hub for financial innovation. Charting the Future of US Blockchain Policy The commitment from the US House Speaker to advance blockchain policy signals a recognition of the underlying technology’s transformative potential beyond just cryptocurrencies. Blockchain, as a distributed ledger technology, has applications across various sectors, including supply chain management, healthcare, voting systems, and identity verification. Comprehensive legislation could therefore extend beyond just the financial aspects of crypto to foster broader blockchain adoption and research. What are the next steps in this legislative journey? Typically, a bill would go through: Committee Review: Where experts and stakeholders provide testimony, and the bill is debated and amended. House Vote: If it passes committee, it moves to a full House vote. Senate Review: If passed by the House, it moves to the Senate, where it undergoes a similar process. Presidential Assent: Finally, if passed by both chambers, it goes to the President for signature into law. The road ahead will undoubtedly involve intense debate, negotiations, and potential compromises. However, the explicit Republican support from the Speaker’s office provides a strong foundation. This proactive approach to blockchain policy is crucial for ensuring the U.S. remains at the forefront of technological advancement and global competitiveness. It represents a shift from reactive enforcement to proactive regulation, a move welcomed by many industry participants. The announcement from U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson marks a significant moment for the future of crypto legislation in the United States. With explicit Republican support , the stage is set for potential breakthroughs in establishing a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets and advancing robust blockchain policy . While challenges and internal divisions persist, the commitment from the US House Speaker signals a powerful shift towards embracing and integrating this innovative technology into the mainstream financial system. The journey ahead will require continued collaboration and thoughtful debate, but the path towards a more regulated and secure crypto landscape in America appears to be gaining unprecedented momentum.

The second quarter erased the rough start to 2025, while also leading to a shift in the profile of crypto traders. The crypto market added 24% on average in Q2, returning most crypto prices to highs not seen since January. Based on Coingecko data , Q2 showed gradual growth, while deeper trading trends shifted among market participant profiles. The market recovered $663.6B in lost value, ending the quarter with a market cap of $3.5T, just shy of the levels in January. New capital flowed into BTC, leading to a dominance above 62% for most of Q2. However, spot volumes lagged behind derivatives. BTC ended the quarter with 29.9% net returns, while ETH locked in 36.5%, but failed to cause an altcoin rally. The Q2 report by Coingecko showed a major theme of influence shifting to institutions . Spot trading also gave way to derivative activity, betting on price action even without holding actual coins or tokens. Q2 set the pace for the new series of records in July, as the crypto market remained lively despite geopolitical tensions and uncertainty. Trading in Q2 shifted to DEX and derivative exchanges Spot trading slowed down for the second quarter, despite a series of BTC records. Decentralized exchanges saw peak growth for both spot swaps and perpetual futures volumes. Hyperliquid emerged as the clear winner in the derivative category, while PancakeSwap enjoyed peak activity based on Binance’s campaigns and token launches. Centralized exchanges saw an outflow of volumes and users, signaling a broader shift in crypto usage. In June, the DEX share peaked at close to 30% of centralized volumes, showing decentralized markets are much more than a byline. With more stringent requirements on centralized markets, DEXs remain a source of no-KYC trading and a venue for newly launched tokens. Despite the market optimism, centralized exchanges lost more than 27% of their volumes from Q1, achieving $3.9T in total volumes for Q2. Binance still dominated the spot market, with a share of 37%-39% throughout the quarter. MEXC, HTX and Bitget increased their volumes, boosted by meme listings. Crypto.com lost the most activity, with volumes falling by 61.4% for the past quarter. After locking in the second spot for two consecutive quarters, Crypto.com fell to eighth position based on spot volumes. Circle opened IPO season in Q2 Some of the Q2 trends may set the pace for the rest of the year. One of the big trends remained the expansion of treasury companies , using the traditional market to raise funds and buy crypto. The surprise trend was crypto companies gaining market valuation through an IPO. Circle’s IPO exceeded expectations during the quarter, boosting excitement for crypto companies. The Circle IPO in June was 25 times oversubscribed and rallied on the first day of the trading launch. Despite the $31 per share price, the shares immediately rallied and closed at $83.23. Circle’s IPO may set the pace for the next quarter, when IPO are expected from Kraken, Gemini, and Grayscale.

Despite all, on-chain signals hint at more upside ahead, as a key metric used by analysts shows that short-term holders have not yet reached the usual profit levels that trigger heavy selling. Does this mean Bitcoin still has room left for a bigger rally? Bitcoin Bull Run Isn’t Over According to data shared by CryptoQuant author Darkfost , the Short-Term Holder Market Value to Realized Value (STH MVRV) ratio remains well below its critical threshold. This indicator measures unrealized profits for short-term Bitcoin holders and often signals when profit-taking could start. In the past cylce, when the STH MVRV reached about 1.35, meaning holders had roughly 35% unrealized profits, Bitcoin usually faced short-term corrections as investors start taking profits. This usually leads to short-term corrections in price. Looking at the current cycle, Darkfost notes that STH unrealized gains have never crossed the 42% mark, meaning the market hasn’t reached an extreme greed zone yet. Right now, the STH MVRV stands near 1.15, signaling that holders are sitting on about 15% gains, far from the levels that typically spark heavy selling. STH MVRV Signals More Upside Ahead for BTC “Every time the STH MVRV has reached around 1.35, it has triggered profit-taking behavior… There is still room for BTC to rise by approximately 20% to 25% before hitting that critical MVRV threshold again.” – By @Darkfost_Coc pic.twitter.com/HPNehg5EJ8 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 17, 2025 Why This Matters for Bitcoin’s Price What’s even more interesting is that the realized price for short-term holders just crossed $100,000 on July 11 for the first time ever. Today, it’s already above $102,000, setting a new benchmark in Bitcoin’s history. This shift raises the threshold for profit-taking even further, creating more breathing room for the current rally. How High Can Bitcoin Price Go? Based on past trends, Bitcoin still has room to climb by 20% to 25% before hitting the profit-taking zone near an MVRV level of 1.35. This means the market could experience another strong upward move before large-scale selling begins. Currently, Bitcoin is trading around $118,000. If it gains 20%, the price could reach about $141,600. Meanwhile, if the bitcoin see a 25% rise would push it close to $147,500.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-17 12:00:43

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/2-2-billion-xrp-in-two-weeks-heres-what-happened/,"XRP has surged past the $3 mark once again, currently trading at $3.26, with a 10.83% gain in the last 24 hours and a 33.91% increase over the past week. Behind this explosive price movement is a major wave of accumulation by large investors. According to renowned crypto analyst Ali, whales have purchased a staggering 2.2 billion XRP over the past two weeks, a development that’s fueling the ongoing rally and renewing optimism across the XRP community. Whale Accumulation Drives the Surge Ali shared on-chain data via X showing that wallets holding between 100 million and 1 billion XRP increased their balances significantly in July. Their collective holdings rose from 7.6 billion to 9.8 billion XRP, a clear sign of strategic accumulation. This trend underscores renewed confidence from institutional players and high-net-worth individuals in XRP’s long-term potential. Whales have bought 2.20 billion $XRP in the last two weeks! pic.twitter.com/qpZ2xK7G7J — Ali (@ali_charts) July 16, 2025 Additionally, the number of wallets holding at least 1 million XRP has climbed to a record 2,743, now controlling more than 47.3 billion XRP. Whale Alert and other blockchain trackers have confirmed large transfers throughout this accumulation phase, including movements to and from top exchanges, further validating the trend. XRP Reclaims $3 With Strong Technical Support This isn’t XRP’s first trip above the $3 threshold in 2025, but it’s the most decisive yet. After briefly touching $3 earlier in the year, XRP is now holding its ground more firmly. The token’s ability to maintain levels above $3 reflects a stronger technical foundation and broader market conviction. Analysts point to a breakout from a symmetrical triangle pattern, along with the formation of a bullish golden cross, where the 20-day exponential moving average has crossed above the 50-day EMA. If XRP closes the week above $3.30, it could open the door for a move toward its all-time high near $3.84. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional Interest and Market Expansion The rally is also being supported by a significant rise in institutional activity. Open interest in XRP perpetual futures has surged to $9.25 billion, nearly triple its April levels. Meanwhile, the launch of the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF (UXPR) is making it easier for traditional investors to gain leveraged exposure to XRP through regulated channels. This convergence of retail interest, institutional demand, and derivatives growth is reinforcing bullish momentum and expanding the token’s investor base. Ecosystem Growth and Market Catalysts Ripple’s growing footprint in global finance continues to strengthen XRP’s utility. The company recently partnered with the Dubai Land Department to tokenize real estate on the XRP Ledger, and is also expanding its payment infrastructure across Europe. These real-world applications are reinforcing the value of the XRP ecosystem. On the regulatory front, ongoing efforts by U.S. lawmakers to clarify crypto legislation are helping improve sentiment and reduce uncertainty for XRP and other digital assets. Final Thoughts XRP’s recent rally is not a fleeting spike, it is grounded in deep whale accumulation, strong technical signals, and expanding institutional involvement. Having previously crossed $3 earlier this year, the token’s renewed momentum above this critical level signals a maturing breakout. If current trends persist, XRP may be poised not only to challenge its previous all-time high but to surpass it in the near future.

CryptoQuant: Bitcoin Upside Potential of Up to 25% Still on the Table According to the company's analysis, the STH MVRV ratio is currently just 1.15, well below the 1.35 threshold that typically sees strong profit realization. What is STH MVRV? Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) is an indicator used to measure the level of unrealized profits made by short-term investors. It is calculated by dividing Bitcoin's market capitalization by the average purchase price (realized price) of short-term investors. According to CryptoQuant's analysis: The STH realized price surpassed $100,000 for the first time on July 11 and is currently above $102,000. This historical turning point shows that investors entered at higher prices and still have not moved into a strong profit area. An MVRV ratio of 1.35 historically indicates 35% unrealized profit, and whenever this threshold is crossed, the market experiences short-term corrections. Up to 25% Upside Potential The current MVRV ratio of 1.15 suggests there is still 20% to 25% upside room for Bitcoin compared to the historical threshold of 1.35. This could signal a new bull run window for investors. *This is not investment advice.

The plan, announced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Bank of Thailand, will allow digital asset transactions through licensed providers and e-wallet services under a closely monitored framework.

This rally seems to have been ignited by the approval of the first exchange-traded fund (ETF) linked to this token in the United States. We’re excited to introduce ProShares Ultra Solana ETF (SLON) and ProShares Ultra XRP ETF (UXRP). These new funds target 2x the daily returns of Solana and XRP, respectively. Learn more about our crypto-linked ETFs: https://t.co/ivXmFp8gMJ These funds invest in cryptocurrency… pic.twitter.com/m28zvnukkF — ProShares (@ProShares) July 15, 2025 The ProShares Ultra XRP ETF (UXRP) will hit the trading floor today once the American session opens. This vehicle provides leveraged exposure to the native asset of the Ripple network. It will seek to produce two times the daily performance of XRP. It will achieve this by investing in derivatives like futures and options. Although a spot ETF has not been approved for XRP yet, this marks a pivotal moment for this blockchain project after years of facing regulatory and legal issues, including a long-standing lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). XRP has now delivered a 57.2% gain since the year started and has broken out of its consolidation. The token stands just 15% away from its January 18 all-time high of $3.84. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Eyes $3.77 as First Stop After Breakout Trading volumes in the past 24 hours have nearly doubled after XRP broke the $3 threshold as it has potentially triggered a short-squeeze. Data from CoinGlass indicates that $360 million worth of short positions have been blown up in the past 24 hours. Around 7% of that total corresponds to XRP while Ethereum shorts suffered the strongest liquidations as the top altcoin reached $3,450. By using the height of the consolidation pattern seen in the daily chart we could estimate the magnitude of XRP’s next leg up. As a result, a 38% gain could be expected, meaning a baseline XRP price prediction of $3.77 per token for the next few days if bullish momentum continues to gain traction. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has already entered overbought territory. This increases the risk of a pullback but also favors a bullish outlook as it means that the uptrend is quite strong. Significant liquidity lies above the $3.4 level – the token’s local high – and we could expect a big explosive move once XRP hits that threshold as market participants will aim to fill the high volume of orders that sit at that level. As top cryptos continue their relentless rally, the best crypto presales are poised to deliver the highest returns as investors are hunting for assets that can deliver 10X gains. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) Raises More Than $3M to Unlock the Untapped Potential of BTCFi Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) has raised more than $3 million through its crypto presale already to launch its Solana-based side chain. This project will allow BTC holders to stake, earn yield, and lend their tokens safely and without leaving the security of the Bitcoin network. Through a Solana-powered bridge, BTC tokens will be sent to a canonical Bitcoin wallet address and will be automatically minted in the Bitcoin Hyper L2 to access its DeFi ecosystem. Once this solution is embraced by top wallets and exchanges, the demand for its utility token, $HYPER, will skyrocket. To buy this token at its discounted presale price, simply head to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card to invest.

FLOKI alone has shot up by a massive 32.8%, while Bonk jumped 16.2%, and Fartcoin rallied 23.5%. Other notable gains include Dogecoin up 7.4%, Shiba Inu by 5.5%, and Pepe by 6%. This rally comes as the crypto market rides a wave of bullish sentiment, fueled by signs of an incoming altseason and renewed momentum behind the pro-crypto GENIUS Act in the U.S . The current total market cap of meme coins stands at an impressive $79.87 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of over $33 billion, according to CoinGecko. Apart from Pudgy Penguins and Pump.fun, all other top meme coins have seen notable green candles. But what’s fueling this meme coin madness? Let’s break it down. FLOKI, Bonk, and Fartcoin Dominate the Charts FLOKI has taken center stage . With a 24-hour trading volume explosion of over 402%, the coin has managed a 42% rise over the past seven days, and its market cap now sits at $1.28 billion. This kind of sustained momentum, combined with community hype, is creating serious FOMO across social platforms. Bonk, the Solana-based meme coin, is riding high too. It’s gained nearly 69% over the week, with 16.2% of that coming just in the last day. With its market cap nearing $3 billion and trading volume surpassing it, Bonk’s surge is closely tied to Solana’s increasing DeFi activity and broader bullish pressure. Then comes Fartcoin—a name few took seriously until now. Posting an eye-popping 23.5% daily gain, it’s suddenly all over crypto Reddit and Telegram trading chats. While the fundamentals may be light, the market doesn’t care. The meme economy is running on vibes and volatility. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Bitcoin Could Still Climb to $147,000 Before Major Selling Begins , What Happened to Pudgy Penguins? Interestingly, while most meme coins are climbing, Pudgy Penguins has pulled back by 8.4% in the last 24 hours. However, this dip comes after a jaw-dropping 217.3% gain in the last 30 days. Even with this recent correction, it remains one of the top-performing meme assets over the past month, beating out Bonk’s 161% and FLOKI’s 74.6%. Bullish Macro Sentiment and the Altcoin Revival The crypto market as a whole is heating up fast. Bitcoin recently touched $123K , gaining 6.8% over the past week. Ethereum surged by nearly 25%, while XRP exploded by 32.9%. Cardano, Solana, and Dogecoin also saw significant gains, with Cardano leading that pack with a 29.5% rise. This isn’t just another temporary pump it looks and feels like the beginning of a real altseason. The Fear and Greed Index hovering around 70–74 shows growing investor confidence. Capital is moving away from Bitcoin dominance and pouring into altcoins and high-risk, high-reward meme tokens. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Their surge is tied to a combination of bullish crypto market sentiment, the rise of altseason, and regulatory developments like the GENIUS Act. FLOKI and Bonk, in particular, have seen explosive volume spikes and strong community support. Is this the start of altcoin season? It certainly looks like it. Bitcoin dominance is slipping, and altcoins—including meme coins—are outperforming.

Known for its high-speed blockchain performance and robust dApp ecosystem, Tron continues to expand its reach in DeFi and digital entertainment. Simultaneously, the emergence of Ozak AI —an artificial intelligence-powered blockchain project currently in presale—has stirred excitement with its bold vision and the possibility of delivering up to 200x returns from its current $0.005 price point. With both TRX and Ozak AI making headlines, investors are weighing two different styles of growth: one backed by years of development, the other by disruptive AI-powered innovation. Tron’s 2025 Outlook: Riding the Ascending Channel to $1 Tron’s price action currently reflects a bullish ascending channel, a technical pattern that typically signals a continuation of upward momentum. This pattern shows higher lows and higher highs, indicating sustained buying interest even during broader market consolidations. As TRX trades around $0.11, its price action remains comfortably inside this ascending formation, supported by positive sentiment across altcoins. Within this technical setup, key resistance levels for Tron stand at $0.15, where recent rally attempts have paused, $0.21, which was a multi-month ceiling during the 2021 bull run, and finally $0.30, a major macro resistance that, if broken, could open the path toward the $1 milestone by 2025. On the downside, TRX enjoys firm support at $0.095, the base of the ascending channel. Below that, $0.082 offers technical strength based on Q2 price action, and $0.065 is a historical demand zone that previously sparked strong reversals. As long as TRX maintains the channel and macro trends remain favorable, analysts believe a gradual climb toward $1 is not only plausible but increasingly probable. Tron’s active role in stablecoin transfers, USDT dominance on its chain, and the growing volume in its DeFi ecosystem are all key factors supporting this forecast. However, for TRX to rally past its previous all-time highs, continued adoption and innovation will be required to outpace competing Layer-1s. Ozak AI: Early Entry, Explosive Upside While Tron is building steadily on its existing ecosystem, Ozak AI is capturing attention with its potential to disrupt multiple sectors using artificial intelligence and decentralized computing. Currently in Stage 4 of Ozak AI presale , Ozak AI is available at just $0.005 and has already raised over $1.3 million. The project’s appeal lies in its promise to integrate AI Forecast Agents, a decentralized prediction system that leverages real-world data, machine learning, and blockchain immutability. Unlike traditional AI projects, Ozak AI introduces DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) to bring tangible utility into the token economy. By turning user data into fuel for AI models, and rewarding participation through the native OZ token, the platform merges AI with crypto-native incentives—a space few have entered with clarity or scale. If Ozak AI delivers on its roadmap and achieves a listing near or beyond its projected $1 post-launch target, early investors could see 200x returns—transforming a $100 stake into $20,000. With AI dominating global headlines and investor interest growing in predictive intelligence tools, Ozak AI’s model is especially compelling for those looking to ride the next wave of innovation. TRX vs Ozak AI Tron offers a relatively low-volatility investment compared to newer altcoins, ideal for those preferring an established blockchain with clear use cases. Ozak AI, on the other hand, presents an asymmetric opportunity—higher risk, but potentially far greater returns. TRX may provide solid 5x–8x growth if it hits the $1 level, but OZ could deliver 100x–200x if it reaches its $1 target from the presale entry of $0.005. For investors diversifying across crypto sectors, both projects serve different roles. Tron anchors portfolios with infrastructure-based fundamentals, while Ozak AI represents the bleeding edge of AI-crypto convergence. With Tron’s ascending channel providing a bullish backdrop and a target of $1 in 2025, TRX remains a solid Layer-1 option for long-term crypto holders. However, the explosive narrative and low entry price of Ozak AI could make it one of the standout performers of the next market cycle. Whether you prioritize stability or exponential upside, both TRX and OZ offer valuable positions in a diversified crypto strategy heading into 2025. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto task that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized community technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto lovers and corporations make the perfect choices.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000708. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000381 and an average trading price of $0.0032 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The recent launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1?

Momentum indicators show early divergence signals while the daily structure remains bullish. FLOKI on the daily timeframe: Floki Inu sees major breakout with volume surge validation The daily timeframe for Floki Inu on July 17 shows FLOKI’s breakout from a prolonged consolidation phase that lasted several months between $0.00007500-$0.00010000. The current price of $0.00012979 represents a decisive break above the upper Bollinger Band, with the 20-day SMA at $0.00009018 acting as strong support during any pullback scenarios. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The 24-hour volume has exploded to 175.81M, representing a massive 400%+ increase from typical daily volumes of 20-40M, confirming institutional and retail FOMO driving this breakout. The Bollinger Bands are expanding rapidly, suggesting increased volatility ahead. At the same time, the clean break above previous resistance zones around $0.00010500 indicates this move has legitimate backing rather than being a mere pump-and-dump scenario. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe: Momentum weakens in the meantime The 4-hour chart displays a textbook breakout pattern where FLOKI consolidated for nearly a week in a tight range before exploding higher with massive volume and strong bullish momentum. FLOKI is down -2.69% after a spectacular rally that saw the token surge over 40% from its base around $0.00009500 to recent highs near $0.00013500. The Alligator indicator shows all three lines (blue, red, green) perfectly aligned in bullish formation with price trading well above all moving averages. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView However, the recent red candle formation suggests profit-taking has begun, and the MACD shows momentum is starting to diverge negatively, indicating the explosive move may be losing steam as early buyers cash out near resistance.

Near-term consolidation is likely around current levels, with upside potential toward $0.00015000-$0.00017000. Critical support sits at $0.00011000, and a break below would invalidate the bullish breakout and target $0.00009000. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~9x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a $100 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 100x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

What Does XRP’s Skyrocketing Open Interest Mean Notional open interest (OI) in XRP perpetual futures has hit $9.68 billion, eclipsing January’s roughly $8.3 billion peak, marking the highest level in six months, according to CoinGlass data . This surge highlights explosive growth in leveraged bets, signaling strong confidence among traders. Historically, rising futures open interest usually trigger price increases, as evidenced by XRP climbing to a 6-month peak above $3.20. This is based on the fact that sustained positive funding rates suggest ”long” traders are actively financing shorts, which shows bullish leverage. On the macro scale, XRP has remained above its 100‑hour moving average and Ichimoku cloud, with significant support at $3 and upside potential to $3.4 if momentum holds with rising OI reflecting a strong inflow of leveraged long positions. Therefore, the jump to $9.68 billion in open interest doesn’t just signify speculation, it underscores profound market conviction, which paints a bullish picture for XRP with the altcoin having broken above the 20-day moving average . Ripple Seeks to Revamp Property Investment in Dubai Ripple has entered the Middle East’s digital asset space, teaming up with leading tokenization infrastructure platform Ctrl Alt to provide institutional custody for Dubai’s government-backed real estate tokenization initiative. Through this strategic partnership , Ctrl Alt will leverage Ripple’s institutional-grade custody tech to securely store tokenized real estate title deeds on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) , supporting the landmark real estate tokenization project by the Dubai Land Department (DLD). Recce Merrick, Ripple’s managing director of Middle East and Africa, deemed this development a game-changer and stated, “The Dubai Land Department’s Real Estate Tokenization Project is a perfect example of the type of forward-thinking, innovative initiative that is positioning Dubai at the heart of the global digital asset industry,” He added that this marked the Middle East’s first government-led tokenization of property title deeds on a public blockchain with DLD’s choice of the XRP Ledger highlighting its strength for real-world financial applications. On his part, Matt Ong, CEO and Founder, Ctrl Alt, pointed out, “As the designated tokenization provider for the DLD Project, Ctrl Alt brings deep expertise in financial engineering and digital asset infrastructure, so it makes sense for us to partner with Ripple to use their custody technology to support this initiative.” The Ctrl Alt CEO opined that partnering with Ripple gives them access to trusted, enterprise-grade technology that meets top security and performance standards with the primary objective being opening up Dubai real estate investment to a global audience. Therefore, the DLD’s Real Estate Tokenization Project is a major leap for asset tokenization and property investment in Dubai, driving greater transparency, efficiency, and accessibility. By tokenizing title deeds on the blockchain, it enables fractional ownership, allowing multiple investors to co-own property and unlocking broader market participation. Conclusion The DLD’s choice of the Ripple’s XRP Ledger underscores its growing reputation as a trusted platform for institutional-grade financial applications with this development marking the first time a Middle Eastern government real estate authority has tokenized property title deeds on a public blockchain. On the other hand, the surge in XRP perpetual futures open interest to $9.68 billion reflects a powerful upward price trend, growing institutional and retail leverage, supportive technicals, improved legal outlook, and accelerating volume across venues. These elements combine to create the possiblity of new highs with XRP’s present price sitting at $3.27, a stone’s throw away from the all-time high (ATH) price of $3.40.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|WALLET|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-17 12:10:02

For anyone deeply invested in the future of digital assets, understanding these movements is paramount. Reports indicate that the US House is on the cusp of a significant vote, one that could profoundly shape the regulatory landscape for stablecoins and the broader crypto market. This isn’t just about technicalities; it’s about the very foundation upon which the next era of finance will be built. Decoding the GENIUS Stablecoin Bill: A Game Changer? On July 18, the spotlight will be firmly on a rule vote for the GENIUS stablecoin bill. This legislative effort aims to establish a comprehensive framework for stablecoins, which are digital assets designed to maintain a stable value relative to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. The significance of this stablecoin bill cannot be overstated. Currently, stablecoins operate in a regulatory gray area, leading to uncertainty for issuers, users, and traditional financial institutions looking to engage with them. What could the GENIUS bill entail? While specifics often evolve, such legislation typically seeks to address several key areas: Reserve Requirements: Mandating that stablecoin issuers hold reserves (e.g., cash, short-term U.S. Treasuries) equivalent to the value of the stablecoins they issue, ensuring 1:1 backing. This aims to prevent the kind of collapses seen with algorithmic stablecoins that lacked proper collateral. Auditing and Transparency: Requiring regular, independent audits of reserve holdings and transparent reporting to regulators and the public. This builds trust and accountability. Licensing and Supervision: Establishing a clear licensing regime for stablecoin issuers, potentially under federal or state banking authorities, to ensure they meet capital, liquidity, and operational standards. Redemption Rights: Guaranteeing users the right to redeem their stablecoins for the underlying fiat currency at par value, reinforcing their stability. The potential benefits of a clear stablecoin framework are numerous. It could foster greater institutional adoption, provide regulatory certainty for businesses, and enhance consumer protection. However, challenges exist, including striking the right balance between robust oversight and fostering innovation, and avoiding an overly burdensome regulatory regime that could push development offshore. Navigating the CLARITY Market Structure Bill: What’s Next for Crypto Regulation? Following the stablecoin vote, attention is expected to shift to the CLARITY market structure bill , though its vote may be postponed until next week. This bill is arguably even more ambitious, seeking to define how the broader crypto market operates, including exchanges, brokers, and the classification of digital assets themselves. The lack of a clear market structure framework has been a persistent pain point for the crypto industry in the U.S., leading to regulatory uncertainty and enforcement actions by agencies like the SEC and CFTC. A comprehensive market structure bill would likely tackle: Jurisdiction: Clarifying whether digital assets fall under the purview of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as securities or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as commodities. This has been a central point of contention and legal battles. Token Classification: Establishing clear criteria for distinguishing between different types of digital assets (e.g., utility tokens, security tokens, payment tokens) and assigning appropriate regulatory oversight. Exchange Registration: Creating a pathway for crypto exchanges to register and operate legally, providing clear rules for trading, custody, and order execution. Investor Protection: Implementing measures to protect investors from fraud, manipulation, and other illicit activities within the crypto market. The successful passage of a market structure bill could provide much-needed regulatory certainty, allowing crypto businesses to innovate and grow within a defined legal framework. It could also enhance investor confidence and bring the U.S. closer to other jurisdictions that have established clearer rules, such as the EU’s MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation. The delay, while potentially frustrating, underscores the complexity and the intense debate surrounding these critical definitions. The Anti-CBDC Stance: A Defense Against Digital Control? Beyond the immediate legislative focus on stablecoins and market structure, another significant development is brewing: the expected inclusion of anti-CBDC provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a digital form of a country’s fiat currency, issued and backed by its central bank. While proponents argue CBDCs could enhance financial inclusion, efficiency, and monetary policy tools, critics voice strong concerns. The inclusion of anti-CBDC language in the NDAA, a defense spending bill, highlights the national security implications perceived by some lawmakers. Concerns often revolve around: Privacy: Fears that a government-controlled digital currency could allow for unprecedented surveillance of citizens’ financial transactions, eroding privacy rights. Government Control: Worries that a CBDC could give the government too much power over individuals’ spending, potentially allowing for programmatic control or even expiration dates on funds. Disintermediation of Banks: The potential for CBDCs to bypass commercial banks, altering the traditional financial system structure. National Security: Arguments that a CBDC could be vulnerable to cyberattacks or be used for geopolitical influence by adversaries if not properly secured. This move reflects a growing sentiment among a bipartisan group of lawmakers who are wary of a U.S. CBDC, prioritizing individual liberty and privacy over potential efficiencies. Its inclusion in a must-pass bill like the NDAA signals the strength of this opposition and could effectively block or significantly delay any efforts to implement a U.S. CBDC in the near future. The Broader Impact of Crypto Regulation on Innovation and Adoption These legislative efforts represent a pivotal moment for crypto regulation in the United States. The outcomes of these votes and the eventual shape of these bills will have far-reaching implications for: Innovation: Will clear rules foster a more robust environment for blockchain startups, or will overly restrictive regulations stifle growth and push talent overseas? Consumer Protection: How effectively will these frameworks shield everyday investors from scams and market volatility while allowing them access to new financial opportunities? Financial Stability: How will stablecoins and digital assets integrate into the existing financial system without introducing systemic risks? Global Competitiveness: Will the U.S. maintain its leadership in financial innovation, or will other nations with clearer regulatory frameworks pull ahead? The debate surrounding these bills is intense, with various stakeholders — from established financial institutions to grassroots crypto enthusiasts — lobbying for their interests. Lawmakers are grappling with the complex task of understanding nascent technology while crafting legislation that is both effective and future-proof. What Does This Mean for You? Actionable Insights As these legislative dramas unfold, what should the average crypto holder or enthusiast be doing? Stay Informed: Follow reputable crypto news sources and legislative updates. Eleanor Terrett’s reports, for instance, offer valuable insights into the congressional pulse. Understanding the nuances of these bills is crucial. Engage with Lawmakers: If you feel strongly about specific aspects of these bills, consider contacting your representatives. Advocacy groups like the Blockchain Association or Coin Center provide resources for effective engagement. Assess Your Portfolio: While direct impacts are speculative until bills pass, understanding the potential regulatory shifts can help you anticipate market reactions, especially concerning stablecoins and specific tokens. Understand Risks: Even with clearer regulation, the crypto market remains volatile. Do your due diligence and invest responsibly. The legislative process is often slow and arduous, but these upcoming votes signal a heightened focus on digital assets. The very fact that these bills are reaching the floor of the House indicates a growing recognition among policymakers of crypto’s permanence and importance. The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities The path to comprehensive crypto regulation in the U.S. is fraught with challenges. Bipartisan agreement is often elusive, and the technical complexities of blockchain technology can be difficult for non-experts to grasp. Jurisdictional squabbles between agencies like the SEC and CFTC further complicate matters. However, the opportunity for the U.S. to solidify its position as a leader in financial innovation, while safeguarding consumers and maintaining financial stability, is immense. These votes are not the end, but rather significant milestones in an ongoing journey. The outcomes will set precedents and influence future legislative efforts. The crypto community must remain vigilant, engaged, and ready to adapt to an evolving regulatory landscape. In conclusion, the upcoming U.S. House votes on the GENIUS stablecoin bill and the CLARITY market structure bill, coupled with the anti-CBDC provisions in the NDAA, represent a pivotal moment for the digital asset space. These legislative actions underscore the increasing mainstream recognition of cryptocurrencies and the urgent need for regulatory clarity. While the immediate future holds uncertainty, the long-term goal remains a robust, secure, and innovative crypto ecosystem within the United States.

Capital is rotating into altcoins, and confidence is rising across the board. In this wave of bullish momentum, companies like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) are stealing the spotlight for their aggressive Bitcoin adoption. Now, Strategy has secured a place among the t op 100 U.S. public companies , signaling how deeply Bitcoin has penetrated traditional finance. Strategy is accumulating Bitcoin since 2020, while back then many rejected their idea as a gamble, in 2025, it is a live example of building a billion-dollar empire by just adding small BTC constantly. They made every dip count. Strategy Climbs to Top 100 with $128.5 Billion Valuation Strategy’s market cap has hit a record $128.5 billion, placing it among America’s 84th-largest public companies. Just five years ago, it was worth under $2 billion. This dramatic growth is driven by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-centric playbook, turning the firm from a legacy software business into the largest corporate BTC holder. The company now holds 601,550 BTC, worth over $70 billion, making it a de facto Bitcoin ETF for equity investors. Its stock currently trades at $455.90, roughly 15% below its all-time high, but remains a favorite for investors betting on Bitcoin’s long-term upside. Bold Fundraising and Share Expansion Strategy’s transformation has been fueled by massive capital raises and share expansion. Since 2020, its share count has nearly tripled to 281.9 million through ATM offerings, a 10-for-1 stock split in 2024, and stock-based compensation. In late 2024, Strategy unveiled a $42 billion capital-raising plan, following a $21 billion raise the prior quarter. These funds have been funneled almost entirely into Bitcoin acquisitions. The company now acts as a leveraged Bitcoin proxy, with diluted shares outstanding estimated at 315.1 million, reflecting future conversions from debt and options. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Bitcoin Could Still Climb to $147,000 Before Major Selling Begins , Analyst Sees Breakout Ahead Crypto analyst Sean Trades recently shared a positive outlook for Strategy’s stock (MSTR).

After decades of counting millions of user numbers, recent figures suggest the franchise is losing a chunk of its audience. According to data from SteamCharts dated July 17, just 27,900 users were playing Call of Duty on Steam, with a 24-hour peak of 66,798 players. The figure is a whopping 86% decrease from its all-time peak, recorded at 488,897. Are FPS gamers still spending time on COD? In 2020, several gaming publications reported that players spent over 25 billion hours in the franchise, roughly 2.85 million years of gameplay. The claim recently went viral again on social media, but the gaming community has since questioned its accuracy. Gamers have logged more than 25 billion hours, equivalent to 2.85 million years, playing Call of Duty—surpassing the entire timeline of human history. pic.twitter.com/erFUGBZRP1 — Historic Vids (@historyinmemes) July 15, 2025 “How would they have gotten that number if the Xbox isn’t connected to the Internet?” one Reddit user asked, asking about how statistics like offline play could be reliably tracked. “I actually did a little bit more digging and found an even older article from 9 years ago claiming the same figures for hours. But again, all of these numbers are still questionable without any proper evidence. These numbers could have very well been pulled out of their ass,” another Redditor remarked. Call of Duty player numbers on Steam. Source: Steam Charts The latest IP release from Activision, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 , was added to Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass to purportedly boost the subscription platform. Yet, according to data from analytics firm Ampere shared with The Game Business , Black Ops 6 generated just a 2% increase in Game Pass subscriptions post-launch. In November 2024, shortly after the game’s debut, player numbers went up to 33.7 million from 2023’s 20.7 million. Gamers believed part of the surge was a result of dissatisfaction with 2023’s Modern Warfare 3 , bashed for reusing content and a short, forgettable campaign experience, dubbed as a “ Modern Warfare 2 DLC .” By March 2025, Ampere found that the total player count had declined to 20.6 million. The same month in 2024 had seen 20.8 million players, and March 2023 reported 22.4 million. Between July 10 and July 17, 2025, player numbers fluctuated between approximately 25,000 and 66,000 active users at peak hours. These numbers fall significantly short of the franchise’s highs and show how much loyalists have become somewhat apathetic to the game. Community frustrated over hacking, loot, and unnecessary promos The frustration among the active community members on Activision’s content and gameplay updates has only gone up since Microsoft acquired the game publisher in 2022. “This game is so dogshit. Movement is bad. Audio is bad. Meta is bad. Anticheat is bad. Bundles are bad. Lmaoooo,” wrote one disgruntled gamer on X. Complaints from the community include poor anti-cheat implementation, unbalanced gameplay mechanics, and a lack of meaningful content updates. Not many players have had positive things to say about COD, and even the season 4 Beavis and Butthead event, was profoundly lambasted. “Can’t wait to NOT play this! Seriously if you showed this screenshot to me back on mw2019 (not that long ago) I would’ve thought you were on crack. But still every cod influencer is going to buy it up and keep degrading the standard,” complained one X user. Activeplayer estimates show that Call of Duty: Warzone , the free-to-play battle royale spinoff, still attracts between 1 to 3 million daily active users, with monthly figures consolidating around 30 to 50 million.

This isn’t just a distant dream; it is becoming a tangible possibility, particularly in France. Recent developments indicate a significant shift in perspective, as French lawmakers have introduced a pioneering bill aimed at harnessing the nation’s often-debated surplus nuclear power for Bitcoin mining . This innovative proposal seeks to transform a perceived energy excess into a substantial economic asset, potentially generating up to $150 million in annual revenue. This initiative could mark a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry, offering a blueprint for more sustainable and economically beneficial crypto mining operations worldwide. French Lawmakers’ Vision: A New Era for Bitcoin Mining? The core of the proposed legislation, as reported by CryptoSlate, centers on a five-year pilot program designed to strategically utilize France’s abundant, and at times, surplus nuclear energy for energy-intensive Bitcoin operations. This move by French lawmakers is not merely an opportunistic venture; it represents a thoughtful approach to leveraging existing infrastructure while addressing the energy consumption concerns often associated with cryptocurrencies. France, with its robust nuclear fleet, frequently produces more electricity than it consumes, especially during off-peak hours. This surplus energy, which might otherwise be curtailed or sold at low prices, could now find a highly profitable application. The potential economic benefits are significant. With an estimated annual revenue generation of $150 million, this pilot program could provide a substantial boost to the French economy. Beyond direct revenue, it could foster job creation in the digital infrastructure sector, attract further investment in clean energy technologies, and position France as a leader in sustainable blockchain innovation. It is a strategic move that aligns economic growth with environmental responsibility. The Power of Nuclear Energy in Crypto Mining Why nuclear energy ? The answer lies in its unique characteristics. Unlike intermittent renewable sources like solar or wind, nuclear power provides a stable, baseload supply of electricity 24/7. This consistency is highly desirable for Bitcoin mining , which requires a continuous and reliable power source to maintain profitability. Furthermore, nuclear energy is a low-carbon source, producing virtually no greenhouse gas emissions during operation, which directly addresses one of the most significant criticisms leveled against Bitcoin’s environmental footprint. The concept of using ‘surplus’ energy is crucial here. France’s nuclear power plants operate most efficiently when running at full capacity. However, demand fluctuates. When demand is low, the excess power can be challenging to manage. Instead of curtailing production or exporting cheap electricity, directing this surplus to energy-intensive activities like crypto mining presents an elegant solution. It transforms a potential liability into an asset, optimizing grid stability and energy utilization. This approach contrasts sharply with traditional fossil fuel-based mining operations, offering a pathway towards truly sustainable digital asset creation. Is Sustainable Crypto Mining Finally Within Reach? The global conversation around Bitcoin’s energy consumption has often been heated, with critics pointing to its carbon footprint. However, initiatives like the one proposed by French lawmakers offer a compelling counter-narrative. By intentionally seeking out and utilizing clean, often wasted, energy sources, the industry can significantly mitigate its environmental impact. This isn’t just about reducing emissions; it’s about pioneering a model where digital innovation and environmental stewardship go hand-in-hand. The potential for renewable energy sources to power the crypto industry is immense. While solar and wind are critical components of a green energy future, their intermittency can be a challenge for constant operations like mining. Nuclear power, with its consistent output, complements these renewables by providing a stable foundation. This integrated approach, where various clean energy sources are strategically deployed, could pave the way for a future where crypto mining is predominantly powered by sustainable means, shifting the narrative from energy drain to energy innovation. Key Aspects of Sustainable Mining: Energy Source Diversification: Utilizing a mix of nuclear, hydro, solar, and wind. Load Balancing: Using mining as a flexible load to stabilize grids. Waste Heat Utilization: Exploring ways to repurpose heat generated by mining operations. Policy & Regulation: Governments encouraging green mining practices through incentives. Economic Opportunities and Challenges for Crypto Mining in France The proposed bill presents a wealth of economic opportunities for France. Beyond the direct revenue from Bitcoin mining , the initiative could stimulate significant technological advancements within the country. It could attract global crypto companies looking for stable, green energy solutions, leading to foreign investment and the development of specialized expertise in high-performance computing and energy management. Furthermore, the pilot program could serve as a model for other nations with similar energy profiles, fostering international collaboration in sustainable digital infrastructure. However, no ambitious project is without its challenges. Public perception of crypto mining , often associated with high energy use, will need careful management. Clear communication about the use of surplus and renewable energy will be vital to gain public support. Regulatory hurdles, including ensuring compliance with existing energy and financial laws, will also need to be navigated. Technical implementation, such as integrating mining facilities with existing nuclear grid infrastructure, will require meticulous planning and execution. Additionally, the volatile nature of Bitcoin’s price could impact the profitability projections, necessitating a flexible and adaptable framework. Potential Benefits: Revenue Generation: Up to $150 million annually. Grid Optimization: Efficient use of surplus nuclear power. Technological Leadership: Positioning France as an innovator in sustainable crypto. Job Creation: Growth in tech and energy sectors. Potential Challenges: Public Perception: Overcoming negative stereotypes about crypto energy use. Regulatory Framework: Developing robust and adaptable policies. Technical Integration: Ensuring seamless operation with energy grids. Market Volatility: Managing revenue fluctuations due to Bitcoin price swings. A Bold Step Towards a Sustainable Digital Future The proposal by French lawmakers to leverage surplus nuclear energy for Bitcoin mining is more than just an economic venture; it’s a statement about the future of digital assets and energy. It signifies a growing recognition that cryptocurrencies, when powered responsibly, can be part of a sustainable energy ecosystem rather than a drain on resources. This pilot program, if successful, could provide a powerful template for other nations, demonstrating how innovation, economic opportunity, and environmental responsibility can converge. As the world grapples with energy transitions and the increasing demand for digital infrastructure, France’s bold move could illuminate a path towards a truly green and prosperous future for crypto mining .

As Web3 platforms mature, crypto transfer times have become a decisive factor in user behavior, not just in theory, but in measurable preference. A 2024 survey of South Korean crypto investors found that 26.8% ranked deposit and withdrawal speed as the most important factor when choosing an exchange, ahead of both liquidity and reputation. Crypto users seek fast transactions Meanwhile, Binance’s 2024 Global User Survey, based on responses from over 27,000 participants, reported that 17.2% cited transaction speed and ease as a key reason for entering crypto in the first place. Transaction speed is no longer a bonus, it’s a baseline. Most exchanges still lag far behind. “ Two years ago, 10-minute swaps were the norm. Today, we’re consistently delivering under two, ” said Pauline Shangett, Chief Strategy Officer at ChangeNOW. “ That’s not just fast for Web3, it’s on par with the fastest crypto transfer solutions in fintech. ” The platform’s performance was independently validated in the July 2025 Swapzone Industry Report , which benchmarks real-time swap speeds across leading instant-exchange platforms. According to the report, the current industry median is 9-10 minutes, placing ChangeNOW among the top performers in the non-custodial segment. ChangeNow strives for low latency as industry standard “ Speed has become mission-critical, ” Shangett added. “ As real-world use cases scale and institutions demand fintech-grade UX from decentralized platforms, we anticipate sub-minute swaps becoming the industry standard by 2026. Latency will no longer be tolerated, especially in cross-chain and payment-focused applications. We’re building infrastructure that meets that bar today, not years from now. ” ChangeNow is carrying over $54M in daily volumes, focusing on swaps for top crypto coins and stablecoins. The market also operates as a crypto management platform, offering access for retail Web3 users. The exchange has evolved since 2017, growing its reach to 5M users worldwide.

That’s the blunt warning from Wall Street analysts, legal professionals, and even some people close to the White House. A new research note from Wolfe Research lays it out clearly: “This would be a mess.” Markets will crash, yields will spike, and the U.S. will lose credibility overnight. There’s no elegant way to spin it; kicking Powell out before his term ends would light a match under the whole economy. On Wednesday morning, things looked shaky for the Fed Chair after a senior White House official told CNBC that Trump told Republican lawmakers at dinner the night before that he’d likely fire Powell “soon.” That was the plan. But by the afternoon, Trump pulled a 180 in front of reporters. “We’re not planning on doing it,” he said . Then, as usual, he left the door wide open: “I don’t rule out anything… but I think it’s highly unlikely, unless he has to leave for fraud.” Analysts say markets would tank and lawsuits would follow Wolfe Research’s Tobin Marcus and Chutong Zhu said the firing would almost certainly trigger an equity selloff and push long-term bond yields up sharply. Why? Because it’d signal that the Fed isn’t independent anymore, and investors hate that. The legal fight would be immediate. If Trump tried to force Powell out, the Fed Chair would likely sue. Wolfe Research said as much: “If Trump moves to actually fire Powell rather than just pressure him to resign, Powell would presumably sue to stop it.” They also raised the possibility that Powell might be temporarily sidelined during the court fight. In other words, even if he ends up winning, the markets would still have to operate without a Fed Chair for months. This wouldn’t be Trump’s first battle against the heads of independent agencies. Wolfe pointed out that during Trump’s second-term firings, multiple agency commissioners sued after being removed. None of them won. But here’s the thing: Powell isn’t just a commissioner. He’s the head of the most powerful central bank on earth, a whole different level of power. That is definitely enough to change the legal playing field. Critics warn that credibility and inflation control would collapse Roger Altman, Evercore founder and former deputy Treasury secretary under Clinton, didn’t mince words. He called the idea of firing Powell “dreadful.” Speaking on CNBC, Altman said, “There are a lot of bad ideas out there. But the president firing the chairman of the Fed… that’s among the worst ideas.” His reasoning is simple: independent central banks work, political ones don’t. He pointed to Turkey and Argentina, where leaders control the central banks and inflation is out of control. Roger also doubted that Powell would willingly step down. “I don’t think Chairman Powell would accede to a request that he leave,” he said. That means the legal path is probably unavoidable — and likely messy. Even Jim Cramer jumped in. After watching markets move on the firing rumors, he said , “I hope today is the last day that Trump goes after Jay Powell.” He added, “Gunning for Powell will only hurt Trump, the same way it hurts the markets.” Jim pointed out that Powell’s term ends in ten months, so really Trump could just wait. Markets were rattled. The Dow finished up 0.53%, the S&P gained 0.32%, and the Nasdaq rose 0.26%. But don’t let the green fool you, there was serious concern all day that Trump might actually pull the trigger this time. Jim summed it up like this: “What’s in it for President Trump if he tries to fire Powell? I think we saw it today: nothing. The stock market would get rocked. Long-term interest rates would rise. What president would want that to happen?” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",Economy|Federal Reserve|USD,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|RESEARCH|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-17 12:25:05

This information was made public following a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed by journalist L0la L33tz, working on assignment for Bitcoin Magazine chairman David Bailey. Bailey had offered a $10,000 bounty for independently confirming the U.S. government’s Bitcoin holdings. L0la L33tz explained the distinction between seized and forfeited assets, emphasizing that the U.S. Marshals Service is responsible specifically for coins that have been seized and subsequently forfeited—meaning they have been designated as government property by a court order. Only these assets can be lawfully sold by the government. She noted that popular on-chain data trackers often overestimate the government’s holdings, as they sometimes include assets that have only been seized but not yet legally forfeited. These coins may be under the control of agencies like the FBI, but they remain unsellable until a court’s forfeiture decision is issued. As an example, L0la L33tz cited the 94,000 BTC linked to the Bitfinex exchange hack. Though some trackers attribute these funds to the U.S. government, a judicial forfeiture decision has not yet been reached in the case. As a result, concerns about imminent government sales of these coins are premature. The Marshals Service typically sells forfeited cryptocurrencies through public auctions. While there are currently no announced sales planned, all 28,988 BTC remain on the agency’s books. Arkham, a blockchain analytics firm, had previously identified U.S. government-controlled wallets holding approximately $23.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. The news drew criticism from some proponents of holding Bitcoin as a strategic reserve. Senator Cynthia Lummis, for example, called the current situation a “strategic mistake.” “I’m alarmed by reports that the U.S. has sold off over 80% of its Bitcoin reserves—leaving just ~29,000 coins,” she commented.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|ARKM|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-17 13:40:02

Today, the spotlight falls squarely on the Infini exploiter , the individual or group behind the significant security breach of the crypto credit card provider Infini. In a move that underscores the lucrative, albeit illicit, side of digital assets, this exploiter has just executed a massive ETH sale , converting a substantial portion of their ill-gotten gains into a stable asset. This transaction, involving 1,770 ETH exchanged for a staggering 5.88 million DAI, has sent ripples through the on-chain monitoring community, highlighting both the agility of sophisticated attackers and the persistent challenges in blockchain security . The Audacious Infini Exploiter: Unpacking the Initial Crypto Hack Let’s rewind a bit to understand the full scope of this story. On February 24, the crypto ecosystem witnessed a significant event when the Infini platform was targeted in a major crypto hack . The attacker successfully siphoned off an astonishing $49.5 million in digital assets. What followed was a strategic move by the exploiter, who promptly converted these stolen funds into 17,696 ETH, acquired at an average price of $2,798 per ETH. This initial acquisition was a clear bet on Ethereum’s future price trajectory, a gamble that has evidently paid off handsomely. The decision to hold ETH, rather than immediately liquidate, demonstrates a calculated approach, leveraging market dynamics to amplify their illicit gains. On-chain analytics platforms, like Lookonchain, play a crucial role in tracking such movements. Their vigilant monitoring provides transparency in a space where anonymity often reigns. It was through their diligent tracking that the recent significant transaction came to light, allowing the crypto community to observe the exploiter’s next steps in near real-time. Decoding the ETH Sale: Why the Shift to DAI Stablecoin? The latest development sees the Infini exploiter offloading 1,770 ETH for 5.88 million DAI stablecoin . This strategic pivot from a volatile asset like Ethereum to a stablecoin like DAI is particularly noteworthy. Why would an exploiter make such a move? Profit Realization: The most immediate reason is to lock in profits. With ETH’s price appreciating since the initial acquisition, the exploiter was sitting on a significant unrealized profit, now estimated to be over $10 million. Selling ETH for DAI allows them to crystallize these gains, protecting them from any subsequent market downturns. Stability and Liquidity: DAI is a decentralized stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. By converting ETH to DAI, the exploiter effectively stabilizes the value of their holdings. This provides a secure base for future operations, whether it’s further obfuscation of funds, moving to other chains, or preparing for eventual off-ramping into fiat currency. Reduced Volatility Risk: Holding large amounts of ETH exposes one to market volatility. While it offered significant upside, it also carried the risk of price corrections. Shifting to DAI eliminates this risk, ensuring the value of the stolen funds remains constant in dollar terms. This transaction underscores the sophisticated financial maneuvers often employed by those involved in large-scale crypto exploits. It’s not just about stealing funds; it’s about managing them strategically to maximize returns and minimize risks. Strengthening Blockchain Security: Lessons from the Infini Incident The Infini crypto hack and the subsequent activities of the Infini exploiter serve as a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges within blockchain security . While blockchain technology offers unprecedented transparency and immutability, the applications built on top of it, particularly in the DeFi space, remain vulnerable to sophisticated attacks. The incident highlights several critical areas for improvement: Robust Audits: Comprehensive and continuous security audits of smart contracts are paramount. Many exploits stem from vulnerabilities in code that could be identified through rigorous testing. Decentralized Security Measures: Implementing multi-layered security protocols, including bug bounty programs and white-hat hacker incentives, can help identify and patch vulnerabilities before they are exploited. Community Vigilance: The role of on-chain analytics platforms and the broader crypto community in tracking suspicious activities is invaluable. Prompt identification and reporting can sometimes limit the damage or aid in tracing funds. User Education: Users must be educated about the risks associated with interacting with new or unaudited DeFi protocols. Every exploit, while detrimental, provides valuable lessons for the ecosystem to learn and adapt. The goal is to build more resilient and secure platforms that can withstand increasingly sophisticated attacks, thereby fostering greater trust and adoption. What’s Next for the Infini Exploiter and the Crypto Community? With the ETH sale completed, the Infini exploiter is now sitting on a substantial sum of DAI stablecoin , making their next move a subject of keen interest for those tracking illicit funds. Will they attempt to bridge these funds to other chains, utilize privacy protocols, or seek to off-ramp them into traditional financial systems? These are the questions that law enforcement agencies and blockchain forensics firms will be working to answer. For the broader crypto community, this event serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of vigilance and continuous improvement in blockchain security . As the DeFi landscape continues to evolve, so too must the defenses against those who seek to exploit its nascent vulnerabilities. The pursuit of a truly secure and decentralized financial future requires constant innovation, collaboration, and an unwavering commitment to protecting user assets.

Wen Hou, the chief investment officer of the private investment firm Coincident Capital, believes the disappearance of his father, Naiping Hou, could be tied to his crypto wealth. The younger Hou tells ABC7 Eyewitness News that he hasn’t seen his 74-year-old father since they went on a fishing trip in March. Authorities believe the elder Hou was abducted that month, according to the news outlet. Wen says he exchanged text messages with his father’s phone, but now believes the person he was texting wasn’t Naiping. Wen says Naiping, a resident of Rancho Cucamonga, California, previously would never pass up an opportunity to see his grandkids. “I have really young children, and we frequently ask him if he wants to come and visit us… He would refuse now… saying, ‘I’m tired,’ or ‘I can’t meet,’ or ‘I’ll call you later.'” Some of Wen’s family friends then went to check on Naiping’s house, but when they arrived, the home was empty. Wen says they later realized more than $1 million had been stolen from his father’s bank accounts. “Money was being wired out to buy gold online. He’s not an online-savvy person, so I don’t know how he’s able to buy gold online.” The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department is looking into the matter, and Wen says his family is offering a $250,000 reward for critical info that could lead to a breakthrough in the case.

Popular meme tokens, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), have already garnered attention. Nevertheless, a new player has emerged in the meme coins market, and it may become a market leader one day – Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . LILPEPE, as of July 2025, costs only $ 0.0014 and has already attracted the attention of investors due to its Layer-2 blockchain, actual use, and growing community. Do not get us wrong, SHIB and DOGE have their chances, and in the following article, we will explore why the three meme tokens have a chance to 20x their value before 2025. LILPEPE: The Next Infrastructure-based Meme Coin Little Pepe (LILPEPE) stormed the meme coin market with its peculiar positioning. In contrast to SHIB and DOGE, LILPEPE comes with a real-life application, as the token will be built on a Layer-2 blockchain, which guarantees low transaction fees and accelerated transactions. At the time of writing, it is valued at merely $0.0014 on July 13, 2025, and despite its youth, it has already raised $5.8 million in its presale. LILPEPE boasts strong infrastructure, serving as a launchpad for meme tokens. Its Pepe Pump Pad, for instance, incorporates anti-rug pull features and liquidity locking, setting it apart from other meme coins. Considering that the crypto market is still on the rise, LILPEPE can potentially shoot to the moon, as analysts predict the asset will rise by 3,500% by 2026. This meme coin presents significant upside potential for early investors, and the asset may generate 20x returns in 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Original Meme Coin with a Loyal Community One should never think they need an introduction to Dogecoin, the first meme coin ever truly created, born from pure communal spirit and the blazing speed of viral marketing. Dogecoin initially emerged as a prank, but it now stands as one of the most-traded cryptocurrencies, boasting an awe-inspiring fan base that continues to innovate. At present, DOGE is priced at $0.2002, but it has seen a growth without a parallel in the past few years. DOGE will also experience stable growth as the year continues, as the meme coin market is gaining ground, despite its lower growth potential compared to more recent tokens, such as LILPEPE. Although 20x gains are not as probable as in the case of LILPEPE, DOGE can still become a profitable investment opportunity for long-term investors in 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Meme Coin That is Growing in Applications The meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) has become the second most-followed meme coin, widely spread throughout the crypto community. In contrast to DOGE, SHIB has moved past being almost purely a meme coin by developing ShibaSwap and its own NFT collection. Incorporating SHIB will lead to moderate growth for current owners, as the price is currently $0.000013, which is expected to appreciate over time. Nevertheless, it has some growth limitations, as it is highly capitalized and relies on the communities to drive the price direction. SHIB may not yield the same returns as LILPEPE in 2025, but its brand recognition and following make it one of the best meme coins to keep an eye on. Why These Meme Coins Have a 20x by 2025 Potential Although ETH and BTC remain the influential leaders in the field, LILPEPE, DOGE, and SHIB attract investors with a rather distinctive risk-reward balance in 2025. This is why they have the potential to go up to 20 by the end of the year: LILPEPE benefits from an L2 blockchain, which makes it scalable, allows for low fees, and provides real-world utility. Additionally, it has more long-term sustainability as a better meme coin alternative to DOGE and SHIB. An important aspect to note is that DOGE and SHIB are still supported by a strong community of practitioners, making their hype and price action in the short term. At only $ 0.0014, LILPEPE also holds the potential to increase its market price more than SHIB and DOGE, which already exceed $1 billion. As the market for meme coins grows, these tokens will enjoy increased popularity, media attention, and technical advancements in DeFi, NFTs, and other blockchain applications. Purchasing LILPEPE: How to The following is how to buy LILPEPE, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana to take advantage of their massive growth potential: Install MetaMask or Trust Wallet Fund your wallet with ETH or USDT (ERC-20) Go to the official presale page of LILPEPE at littlepepe.com Link your wallet and buy your tokens The LILPEPE presale will have steadily increasing prices. The sooner or earlier you invest, the higher the chances of your gain at the time LILPEPE enters the open market. Conclusion: LILPEPE, DOGE, and SHIB: The Meme Coins to Watch in 2025 Although Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have already proved to be leading meme coins, LILPEPE is a potentially interesting project with tremendous growth potential in 2025. LILPEPE, with its Layer 2 blockchain, actual utility, and active supporter community, is poised to surpass DOGE and SHIB in both price and market demand. LILPEPE offers the best risk-reward opportunity for those seeking maximum returns by 2025. Low prices, robust infrastructure, and unlimited upside create a compelling argument that LILPEPE is poised to deliver substantial returns by 2025 (10,000%+).

If so, a recent announcement from Evgeny Gaevoy, the CEO of leading crypto market maker Wintermute , has likely caught your attention. In a significant disclosure on X, Gaevoy revealed that the firm’s over-the-counter (OTC) desk has almost no Ethereum (ETH) remaining for sale. This isn’t just a fleeting headline; it’s a profound indicator of shifting dynamics within the digital asset space, particularly concerning OTC Trading and overall Digital Asset Liquidity . What Does Wintermute ‘s ETH Revelation Truly Signify? When a major player like Wintermute , renowned for its extensive operations in providing liquidity across various digital assets, states it has virtually no Ethereum left on its OTC desk, it speaks volumes. This isn’t about retail exchanges running out of ETH; it’s about a specialized desk that facilitates large, institutional-grade transactions. For an OTC desk, a depleted supply of a major asset like ETH suggests several critical points: Overwhelming Demand: The primary implication is an exceptionally high demand for Ethereum from institutional clients, high-net-worth individuals, and other large-scale buyers who prefer to execute trades away from public order books to minimize price impact. Liquidity Crunch for Large Orders: It indicates that even major market makers are finding it challenging to source sufficient ETH to meet the demand for large block trades, which are the bread and butter of OTC desks. Market Efficiency: It hints at the efficiency of arbitrageurs and other market participants quickly absorbing any available supply, making it difficult for desks to maintain inventory. This situation paints a vivid picture of the current appetite for Ethereum , extending beyond typical retail interest into the deeper pockets of the institutional world. It’s a testament to ETH’s growing utility and perceived value. The Crucial Role of a Crypto Market Maker like Wintermute To fully grasp the weight of Gaevoy’s statement, it’s essential to understand what a crypto market maker does. Firms like Wintermute are the backbone of market efficiency and stability. They operate by simultaneously quoting buy and sell prices for digital assets, thereby facilitating trades and ensuring there’s always a counterparty available. Their core functions include: Providing Liquidity: They ensure that assets can be bought and sold quickly without significant price fluctuations, especially for large orders. Bridging Bid-Ask Spreads: By constantly offering bids and asks, they narrow the gap between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept, making trading more cost-effective. Risk Management: They manage inventory risk and price volatility, often employing sophisticated algorithms and strategies. Wintermute ‘s success hinges on its ability to maintain robust inventory and access to deep liquidity pools. The fact that their Ethereum supply is dwindling suggests that even their sophisticated sourcing mechanisms are being tested by the sheer volume of buy requests. This isn’t just a business challenge for them; it’s a signal to the entire market about the prevailing sentiment around ETH. Navigating the World of OTC Trading : Why It Matters for Institutions OTC Trading , or Over-the-Counter trading, is a private way for large buyers and sellers to execute significant cryptocurrency trades directly with a market maker or another party, bypassing public exchanges. This method offers several distinct advantages, especially for institutions: Feature Public Exchange OTC Trading Transaction Size Typically smaller, fragmented orders Large block trades (e.g., millions of dollars) Price Impact High for large orders, can move market price Minimal or no price impact, fixed price agreed upon Privacy Trades visible on order books Private, off-exchange transactions Settlement Instantaneous through exchange Direct, bilateral settlement, often T+0 or T+1 The appeal of OTC desks for institutions is clear: they can acquire or divest large amounts of cryptocurrency without causing market ripples or revealing their intentions. The scarcity of Ethereum on Wintermute’s OTC desk highlights that this preferred avenue for institutional accumulation is facing supply constraints, which could push large buyers to other channels or even influence their purchasing strategies. The State of Ethereum : Why Is Demand So High? The surging demand for Ethereum , as evidenced by Wintermute ‘s situation, isn’t accidental. Several factors contribute to ETH’s robust appeal: The Merge and Staking: The transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with The Merge made ETH a yield-bearing asset, attracting stakers who lock up their ETH, reducing circulating supply. Deflationary Mechanism (EIP-1559): A portion of transaction fees on the Ethereum network is burned, permanently removing ETH from circulation. This deflationary pressure, especially during periods of high network activity, contributes to scarcity. Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum remains the dominant platform for decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and a vast array of dApps. Its utility as the ‘gas’ for this ecosystem ensures continuous demand. Institutional Adoption: More institutions are recognizing Ethereum as a programmable asset and a key component of the future digital economy, leading to significant accumulation. Potential for Spot ETH ETFs: The prospect of a spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the U.S. is a major catalyst, signaling mainstream acceptance and potentially opening floodgates for new capital. These combined forces create a powerful narrative for Ethereum , driving its perceived value and, consequently, the intense demand seen by market makers like Wintermute . Implications for Digital Asset Liquidity and the Broader Market The near depletion of Ethereum on Wintermute ‘s OTC desk has significant implications for overall Digital Asset Liquidity . Liquidity is the ease with which an asset can be converted into cash without affecting its market price. When a major liquidity provider faces scarcity: Increased Volatility Risk: Less available supply for large orders on OTC desks could force institutions onto public exchanges, potentially leading to larger price swings for big trades. Higher Premiums: Buyers might have to pay higher premiums to acquire large blocks of ETH, as supply becomes tighter across all channels. Shift in Sourcing Strategies: Market makers might need to explore new avenues for sourcing Ethereum , such as more aggressive accumulation from public exchanges or direct deals with large holders. Reinforced Bullish Sentiment: The scarcity itself can act as a bullish signal, suggesting that strong hands are accumulating and holding ETH, reducing available supply for sale. This situation underscores the evolving nature of the crypto markets, where even the largest players can experience supply constraints for highly demanded assets. It highlights the importance of deep and diverse liquidity pools for the healthy functioning of the ecosystem. Actionable Insights for Investors and Market Participants What can you take away from Wintermute ‘s revealing announcement? Understand Scarcity Signals: Pay attention to signals from major market makers. Their inventory levels can be leading indicators of institutional demand and supply dynamics. Evaluate Your ETH Position: If you are an Ethereum holder, this news reinforces the strong demand narrative, potentially supporting long-term value. If you’re looking to acquire, understand that large block purchases might become more challenging or costly through traditional OTC channels. Monitor Institutional Flows: The increasing institutional appetite for ETH is a key trend. Keep an eye on reports of institutional allocations and product launches (like potential ETFs). Diversify Your Sourcing: For large buyers, explore multiple OTC desks and liquidity providers, as some may have varying inventory levels. Stay Informed on Network Fundamentals: Continue to monitor Ethereum ‘s network activity, staking trends, and burning rates, as these directly impact supply. The landscape of Digital Asset Liquidity is constantly shifting, and understanding the mechanisms behind it is crucial for informed decision-making. A Compelling Summary: The Future of Ethereum and Institutional Demand Evgeny Gaevoy’s statement regarding Wintermute ‘s near-depleted Ethereum supply on its OTC desk is more than just a news byte; it’s a powerful indicator of the intensifying institutional demand for ETH . As a prominent crypto market maker , Wintermute ‘s experience reflects a broader trend of diminishing available supply for large-scale purchases, highlighting the growing significance of Ethereum in institutional portfolios and the tightening of Digital Asset Liquidity for this asset. This situation underscores Ethereum ‘s robust fundamentals, including its deflationary mechanics, staking appeal, and thriving ecosystem. For market participants, it serves as a reminder to closely monitor supply-demand dynamics and institutional flows, as these will continue to shape the future price action and accessibility of leading digital assets. The message is clear: the big players are accumulating, and the available supply for major block trades is becoming increasingly scarce.

Progress on US Debt Refinancing: How Much Is Done and What Remains As of mid-July 2025, the United States is navigating through one of the largest debt refinancing cycles in its history. For 2025, approximately $9.2 trillion in federal debt is due for refinancing—a figure that amounts to nearly a third of all outstanding US government debt and about 30% of GDP. Completed Refinancing (Jan–Jun 2025): Around $5 to $6.5 trillion of this year’s maturing debt has already been refinanced. This covers close to 55–70% of the total schedule, reflecting the typical front-loading strategy of Treasury auctions in the year's first half. Outstanding Refinancing (Jul–Dec 2025): An estimated $2.5 to $4 trillion remains to be rolled over by year-end. The Treasury will continue with regular auctions, but the bulk of the work—especially the spike in T-bill issuance—has set the tone for the remainder of the year. Year Total Due (USD Trillions) Already Refinanced Remaining 2025 9.2 5–6.5 2.5–4 2. The Short-Term T-Bill Strategy: Kicking the Can Down the Road Heavy Reliance on Short-Term Bills A defining feature of this refinancing round is the Treasury’s dependence on short-term Treasury bills (T-bills) —those maturing in one year or less. While the goal of extending average maturity persists, the majority of 2025's refinancing has been done via T-bills instead of longer-dated bonds. Estimated Share: About one-third of 2025 maturities originated as T-bills. Most new issuance has focused on instruments with maturities of 13, 26, or 52 weeks. Market Appeal: T-bills are attractive during uncertain or volatile times because they offer flexibility and are in high demand, but this has consequences. Risks: Larger Refinancing Wall in 2026 This tactic does not solve the long-term problem but simply delays it —a classic case of “kicking the can down the road.” By rolling over maturing debt with even more short-term debt, the Treasury ensures that 2026’s refinancing wall will also remain large , with about $7.6 trillion in debt coming due next year. The increased use of short-term maturities amplifies exposure to interest rate hikes. If interest rates rise, future rollovers will be at higher costs, straining the budget and potentially forcing difficult fiscal adjustments. Short-term refinancing creates frequent market risk events. Any disruption in Treasury markets—political standoffs, rate spikes, or liquidity crunches—could pose systemic risks to both the government and broader financial markets. 3. How Debt Refinancing Tactics May Impact the Crypto Market Macro Market Spillovers Volatility in Rates and Yields: Reliance on short-term debt makes Treasury yields more sensitive to policy shifts or market jitters. Sudden increases in government yields or failed auctions could spark capital flight from traditional assets, occasionally spilling over into higher demand for crypto as a hedge . Dollar Confidence and Alternatives: Aggressive short-termism raises questions about long-term fiscal stability and could negatively affect global confidence in the US dollar. Events that threaten “safe haven” status for Treasurys often lead some investors to diversify into non-sovereign assets— notably Bitcoin and major cryptocurrencies . Risk-On/Risk-Off Moves: In scenarios where government fiscal health deteriorates or there is fear of US debt volatility, crypto assets may see speculative inflows as alternative or “risk-on” stores of value. However, crypto markets may also be hit by liquidity shocks if a crisis in Treasurys sparks a broad risk-off move where investors scramble for cash. Potential Outcomes to Watch Sharp Rate Increases: Could fuel a crypto rally as investors flee future inflation and currency debasement fears. Treasury Market Stress: May initially cause volatility across all assets—including crypto—but could ultimately drive renewed interest in decentralized stores of value. Policy Uncertainty: Heavy-handed or unpredictable moves (e.g., abrupt Fed changes or rate policies) may heighten appeal for assets outside the traditional financial system. Conclusion The US approach to refinancing this year’s vast debt wall—by focusing on short-term T-bills—offers flexibility but perpetuates fiscal risk, leaving a larger challenge for 2026 and beyond. These decisions reverberate beyond the Treasury market, with potential to shake the confidence in traditional financial assets and spur activity in crypto markets as investors seek out alternative stores of value.",,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-07-17 13:51:34

Having already collected more than $1.34 million, this artificial intelligence-based project attracts the attention of investors who want to find the next scoop in the crypto market. With the influx of capital into Web3 in AI-centric utilities, Ozak AI makes itself unique with the mission of integrating the AI capabilities into the decentralized applications, smart contracts, and blockchain infrastructure directly. Its high utility, low entry cost, and roadmap have a lot of great potential, and that is why it is building steam that is quite serious. Investors Can’t Resist Themselves The trend of its interest in creating artificial intelligence within decentralization creates a new story to offer to its investors, a potential marketplace with explosive capacity. Ozak AI provides such tools as AI-based smart contracts, DeFi predictive analytics, and autonomous data validation, which reframe what can be done in Web3 systems. Its current presale price of only $0.005 is already a unicorn opportunity, and that too, with a price that is still 1/50th as low as AVAX when it was at its grassroots. As the company is listing and partnering with exchanges in sight, the Ozak AI demand will keep rising at an incredible pace. Youtube embed: Next 500X AI Altcoin Ozak AI vs Avalanche: Trading Trends and Opportunity Zones At the moment, the avalanche is being exchanged at almost 21.14 dollars, but analysts have already specified a mid-term goal at $71, which is more than a gain of 228%. Nevertheless, the market has already factored part of this course. Ozak AI, however, provides pre-stage exposure with 10x up to 100x growth, not out of the ordinary in tokens that succeed during presales. AVAX is a good mid-cap asset, but Ozak AI is more interesting to people who want more than to make a gradual profit. AVAX 1W-chart showing price action | Source:X It is the contrast of investing in what is already working and what may turn out as the next big thing. Ozak AI is also turning out to be a high-reward story, particularly to new entrants or small-cap chasers. 5 Fundamental Reasons why Ozak AI is Becoming an Investor Kiosk AI Integration: It is developing a general application and scalable artificial intelligence in a decentralized setting, which is an important trend in the technology of crypto and conventional finance. Early-Stage Advantage: Price per token is only $0.005, which cannot be surpassed in terms of entry-level exposure. The current volume raised by the project is more than 1.3 million dollars, which is evidence of a powerful early demand. Presale Momentum: On the stage of Phase 4, the pace is gaining momentum. Every stage is set to have an escalation of prices, which motivates investors to take action early before the coin penetrates centralized exchanges. Utility-Driven Roadmap: Ozak AI has a well-thought-out action plan, unlike most hypothetical tokens that do not have much of a product roadmap other than speculative ones. Community and Hype: As a result of an increasing and engaging social media presence, there is a lot of word-of-mouth and online buzz helping achieve plenty of rapid traction – the same can be said of community vibes early Dogecoin and Solana. $1 million giveaway: The Ozak AI team has come up with $1 million giveaway opportunity, which is another eye-catcher for the community. Conclusion The $71 target presented by Avalanche might sound quite appealing to mid-term investors, but for the ones who want to see asymmetric returns and to soak up fresh opportunities, the name that lingers in the mind of the investors is Ozak AI. With a certain strength of technology, the presence of strategic pre-sale prices, and enormous potential, the question is not will but when Ozak AI will appear in the spotlight.

Bullish chart patterns, including a symmetrical triangle breakout and golden cross, are fueling speculation of a move toward $200. But can SOL truly break past this critical resistance in July 2025? With a sharp rise in trading volume, ETF inflows, and Bitcoin’s ongoing rally, market sentiment is shifting. This article explores recent updates and technical indicators to assess whether a $200 breakout is achievable this month. Institutional Inflows Signal Growing Confidence in Solana Institutional interest in Solana surged notably in July 2025, marking a pivotal shift in how major investors view the blockchain. The launch of U.S.-based spot Solana ETFs, particularly the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF (SSK), has attracted over $41 million in inflows within just days of its debut. Collectively, three newly launched Solana ETFs have accumulated nearly $78 million in assets under management, signaling strong early demand. Futures open interest on SOL has also climbed to over $7.5 billion, nearing historic highs—further reflecting heightened institutional engagement. Top asset managers such as Grayscale, VanEck, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton have filed for Solana ETF products, and JPMorgan analysts project potential net inflows of $3–6 billion over the next year if approvals proceed. With the SEC streamlining ETF review processes, Solana is fast becoming a key institutional asset—not just a high-speed blockchain, but a vehicle for regulated capital allocation. Will Solana (SOL) Price Reach $200 This Month? Solana’s price has recently surged to around $175, reflecting a strong rebound from the $155–160 support zone. With Bitcoin reclaiming the $112,000 mark, risk-on sentiment is returning to the crypto market, benefiting high-beta assets like SOL. However, the $200 target remains a psychological and technical hurdle. The price is currently stuck within an ascending triangle and is attempting to break through the neckline, which also serves as a crucial resistance zone to overcome. The CMF has risen above 0, with the OBV maintaining an upward trend, which suggests a strengthening of the bulls’ position. Therefore, a breakout could further promote a potential move to $200, which may extend to $215. However, the short-term targets could vary between $185 and $190, and a rise above this range could validate the bullish spell for the Solana (SOL) price rally.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-17 13:52:45

While a few think this rally could cool off soon, many experts see the opposite. Old patterns are starting to show up again, and they hint that XRP might just be warming up for its next big jump. If you look closely, the clues for another breakout are hiding in plain sight. XRP Breakout Is Hidden in Plain Sight Ripple’s XRP is back in the spotlight, surging 10% in the last 24 hours to hit $3.20 and posting an impressive 33% gain over the past week. Meanwhile, the recent breakout wasn’t just another price pump. XRP shattered a long-term resistance trend that has been holding the token back for years. XRP is now consolidating in a smaller triangle pattern, a classic setup before another big move. If history repeats, this could pave the way for a sharp rally. Meanwhile, Versan Aljarrah, Co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist, says a hidden pattern is driving this rally. He points to an often-overlooked connection between XRP and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). According to him, every time the DXY falls sharply, XRP tends to shoot higher. XRP – Hidden in Plain Sight pic.twitter.com/BtQ5J4OSiW — Vandell | Black Swan Capitalist (@vandell33) July 16, 2025 Looking back, the same setup has appeared three times before, in 2018, 2021, and late 2024, each time sending XRP to multi-year highs. With the DXY now dropping again due to shifting economic policies, Aljarrah believes XRP could see another major jump if the dollar dips closer to levels last seen in 2018. Analysts See $6 or Higher Aljarrah isn’t alone in this bullish outlook. Well-known crypto analyst Ali Martinez predicts XRP could hit $6, while another expert, CasiTrades, highlights Fibonacci levels supporting a strong breakout. Meanwhile, optimism about a possible XRP ETF and the easing Ripple-SEC lawsuit has given the community more hope for price stability. Trading Volumes Hint at Strong Demand Adding fuel to the fire, XRP’s trading volume just jumped to $11.5 billion. Short sellers betting against the coin have lost big, with $360 million in shorts wiped out in the broader market, a sign that bulls are in control. Meanwhile, the daily chart shows a possible 38% upside if the momentum holds, putting XRP’s short-term target near $3.77.

In a recent post on X, Amonyx made a clear assertion that XRP will surpass Bitcoin in creating individual wealth and advised followers to bookmark the statement. His comment comes at a time when XRP has outpaced Bitcoin’s performance over several recent timeframes, according to market data. Over the past year, Bitcoin’s price has increased by approximately 81% while XRP has seen a 444% gain. In the past month, Bitcoin rose by around 11 percent compared to XRP’s 34 percent, and in the past week, Bitcoin appreciated 7 percent while XRP climbed 26 percent. These figures from CoinMarketCap illustrate XRP’s superior percentage gains relative to Bitcoin in the short and medium term, potentially providing a foundation for Amonyx’s perspective. Skepticism About Supply and Market Cap Following Amonyx’s statement , some X users voiced skepticism about the feasibility of his claim. One user, Mike DeVault, argued that XRP’s high supply prevents it from achieving the kind of scarcity-driven value appreciation that Bitcoin enjoys. He stated that for XRP to make all of its holders millionaires, the total market capitalization would need to exceed the value of all global assets, which he considered implausible. DeVault also suggested that widespread millionaire status would erode purchasing power, diminishing the value of wealth. Another user, posting under the handle Stevesik1, countered this argument by comparing XRP to oil markets. He remarked that market capitalization alone does not dictate value, pointing to oil as an example where supply, demand, and utility are the primary drivers of price. He criticized the focus on market capitalization as misguided, arguing that XRP’s utility and demand could sustain its value growth, unlike what he characterized as a speculative asset with no use case. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Debate Over Scarcity and Utility In response, DeVault reiterated his view that value in commodities derives from scarcity, citing Bitcoin’s limited supply as the reason for its high price. He argued that XRP’s abundance, unlike Bitcoin’s fixed maximum issuance, works against its ability to create such concentrated wealth. DeVault maintained that control over supply is a key mechanism for preserving value in any commodity, drawing parallels with how oil prices are managed to justify ongoing extraction costs. Current Market Context The exchange reflects a broader conversation in cryptocurrency circles about the roles of utility, scarcity, and market mechanics in determining value. While Bitcoin continues to lead the market by overall capitalization and remains known for its fixed supply, XRP has demonstrated significant price momentum, particularly over the past year. Supporters, such as Amonyx, point to its utility in cross-border payments and strong relative price performance as indicators of its potential to transform wealth generation in the sector. With XRP outperforming Bitcoin in percentage terms across multiple timeframes, advocates argue that it remains undervalued relative to its use case and adoption prospects . Skeptics, however, emphasize the challenges posed by its larger circulating supply and question whether it can sustain a trajectory capable of making as many millionaires as Amonyx predicts. The debate underscores divergent views on what ultimately drives value in digital assets. While no consensus emerged from the discussion, Amonyx’s confidence in XRP’s future remains clear and continues to draw attention as both assets post notable gains in the current market cycle.

As such, the drop in these reserves indicates that there has been a massive accumulation by whales who have been moving coins to cold storage for long-term holding. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Breakout Programmed: Diamond Hands Are Up 783%, SHIB Burn Rate Explodes 1,784% This development is significant as a price surge could follow, with Shiba Inu rallying to new highs. In 2023, as the exchange reserves began to decline, SHIB witnessed a God candle, which sent its price above the psychological $0.00003 level. The meme coin surged from a low of around $0.000007 back then. IntoTheBlock data also shows that Shiba Inu whales are back to accumulating SHIB, which could spark this rally as demand outweighs supply. Over the last week, SHIB’s largest transactions have been steadily climbing from the lows recorded in June when the meme coin fell to the support level at $0.000010. It is also worth noting that Shiba Inu’s correlation with Bitcoin is 0.92, indicating a strong positive correlation between the two assets. As such, the meme coin could also skyrocket as the leading crypto targets new all-time highs (ATHs). BTC is looking to reclaim the $120,000 psychological level, a development which could help SHIB maintain its momentum as it rallies towards $0.000020. Another Rally To $0.000030 In Sight For SHIB In an X post, crypto analyst Javon Marks confirmed that Shiba Inu is eyeing another rally to $0.000030. He stated that in the short term and based on confirmed data, SHIB is expected to reach the $0.000032 level in response to a bullish divergence. The analyst noted that this move itself is over 135% and could only be the start of a larger bullish reversal. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Could See 180% Explosion As This Indicator Flashes Bullish Divergence The analyst had earlier revealed that Shiba Inu had confirmed a clear bullish divergence on its Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). Marks further remarked that this development points to a nearly 180% upside, which would send the meme coin back to around $0.000032. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Investing Haven also confirmed that the targets of $0.000044 to $0.000066 remain valid for the top meme coin. At the time of writing, the Shiba Inu price is trading at around $0.00001439, up over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

For weeks, the market has been consolidating, but recent movements indicate a potential changing of the guard, at least temporarily. What exactly is unfolding, and what does it mean for your portfolio? Understanding the Shift in Bitcoin Dominance For a long time, Bitcoin has been the undisputed king of crypto, its market capitalization often dictating the overall sentiment and direction of the broader digital asset space. This metric, known as Bitcoin dominance , measures BTC’s market cap as a percentage of the total crypto market cap. When Bitcoin dominance falls, it typically suggests that altcoins are gaining strength relative to Bitcoin, often signaling the start of an ‘altcoin season’. Recent data from on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X highlights this very phenomenon: Bitcoin dominance has slipped below the 63% mark. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a significant indicator that capital is rotating from Bitcoin into alternative cryptocurrencies. This shift can be a thrilling period for investors, offering opportunities beyond the traditional market leader. The Ascent of Ethereum Price and Its Impact Leading the charge among the altcoins is Ethereum (ETH), which has impressively climbed above the $3,400 mark. Ethereum’s robust ecosystem, its pivotal role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and various layer-2 solutions, makes it a natural magnet for capital when investors look beyond Bitcoin. The strength of the Ethereum price is often seen as a bellwether for the broader altcoin market, and its current trajectory suggests a healthy appetite for smart contract platforms and their associated tokens. Ethereum’s continued development, including ongoing upgrades aimed at scalability and efficiency, reinforces its position as a foundational layer for the decentralized web. As more projects build on Ethereum and its layer-2 networks, demand for ETH, which powers these transactions, naturally increases. This sustained interest in Ethereum is a key driver for the current market sentiment. The Broadening Altcoin Rally : Beyond ETH While Ethereum leads the pack, the excitement isn’t confined to just ETH. Prices of major altcoins across the board are trending upward, indicating a widespread altcoin rally . This includes everything from established large-cap altcoins to emerging projects and even the more speculative memecoins. The diversification of capital flow suggests a growing confidence in the overall crypto market, with investors willing to explore higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities. This period of broad market participation is often characterized by: Increased Liquidity: More capital flowing into various projects. Sector Rotation: Investors moving funds from one crypto sector to another based on performance. New All-Time Highs: Many altcoins may start breaking previous resistance levels. Even memecoins, known for their volatile and community-driven price action, are experiencing significant upward momentum. While inherently risky, their participation in the rally underscores the speculative fervor returning to the market. Decoding the Crypto Fear Greed Index Market sentiment is a powerful force in cryptocurrency, and the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool for gauging it. This index analyzes various market factors, including volatility, market momentum, social media sentiment, and trading volume, to produce a score from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). After nearly two weeks of sustained gains across the market, the Crypto Fear Greed Index has climbed to 73. A score of 73 falls squarely in the ‘Greed’ territory. This indicates that investors are feeling optimistic and are more inclined to buy, often driven by the fear of missing out (FOMO). While ‘Greed’ can be a sign of a healthy bull market, it also serves as a cautionary signal. Historically, extreme greed levels can precede market corrections, as prices may become overextended. However, in the current context, it primarily reflects the widespread positive sentiment and belief in continued upward momentum. The Return of Retail Enthusiasm Perhaps one of the most exciting aspects of the current market surge is the noticeable return of retail enthusiasm . After periods of consolidation or downturns, retail investors often step back, waiting for clearer signs of recovery. The current rally, particularly the performance of altcoins and the rise in the Fear & Greed Index, suggests that individual investors are re-engaging with the market. This renewed interest manifests in several ways: Increased Trading Volume: More participants buying and selling. Social Media Buzz: Heightened discussions and positive sentiment across platforms. New Wallet Creations: More individuals entering the crypto space. Retail participation is crucial for sustaining a bull market, as it brings fresh capital and broadens the investor base beyond institutional players. Their collective energy often fuels the most explosive phases of a rally, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of optimism and price appreciation. Navigating the Opportunities and Challenges The current market environment presents both exciting opportunities and inherent challenges. The benefits of an altcoin rally are clear: the potential for significant gains, portfolio diversification, and the discovery of innovative projects. However, it’s also a time for caution: Volatility: Altcoins, especially memecoins, can experience rapid price swings. Risk Management: It’s crucial to invest only what you can afford to lose and to consider taking profits. Research: Not all projects will succeed; thorough due diligence is essential. For those looking to capitalize on this shift, a balanced approach is often recommended. While the allure of high-flying altcoins is strong, maintaining a core position in more established assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum can provide stability. Diversifying across different sectors within the altcoin market can also mitigate risk. A Compelling Outlook The cryptocurrency market is undergoing a fascinating transformation, with Bitcoin dominance yielding ground to a surging altcoin market led by a robust Ethereum price . This widespread altcoin rally , fueled by a rising Crypto Fear Greed Index and the palpable return of retail enthusiasm , paints a picture of a market brimming with opportunity. While the journey in crypto is always unpredictable, the current momentum suggests a period of vibrant activity and potential growth. As always, informed decisions and a strategic approach will be key to navigating these exciting times.

Lee cleared in 2015 merger case,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-court-acquits-samsung-chairman-jay-y-lee/,"South Korea’s Supreme Court on Thursday cleared Samsung Electronics chairman Jay Y. Lee for his role in a long ‑standing accusations of accounting fraud and market manipulation tied to a 2015 $8 billion merger. The unanimous verdict upholds last year’s appeals court decision, effectively closing a legal saga that shadowed Lee for nearly a decade. With this ruling, Lee, who is the grandson of the Samsung founder and its de facto leader since 2014, can now devote his full attention to Samsung ’s ambition of catching up in the fiercely competitive AI chip arena. Samsung investors have cheered the ruling Samsun’s lawyers were reportedly delighted at the ruling, which clarified that the merger – between Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries and at the center of the legal battle was wholly legal. “Today, the Supreme Court has clearly confirmed through its final ruling that the merger of Samsung C&T and the accounting treatment of Samsung Biologics were lawful.” Samsung lawyers. “We sincerely thank the court for its wise judgment following a thorough five-year trial process,” added the lawyers. Lee has been previously cleared of the fraud allegations in two earlier trials . Last year, a lower court dismissed the charges against Lee of coordinating the deal to cement his control of the electronics conglomerate. Prosecutors had argued the tie‑up unfairly consolidated power within the family’s empire, but judges found no wrongdoing. As the courts passed the ruling, Samsung investors were also relieved. Its shares rose by more than 3% by Thursday’s close, as it overtook the KOSPI index which was almost flat. Market watchers partly attributed the share price increase to legal clarity gained and partly a result of a rotation of funds after Goldman Sachs cut rating on rival SK Hynix, whose share price went down by as much as 9.5% in response. The case had drawn widespread scrutiny of the company as South Korea battles corporate scandals involving powerful family-run conglomerates known as chaebols. “The Supreme Court ruling clears a layer of legal uncertainty, which could be a long-term positive for Samsung.” Ryu Young-ho, a senior strategist at NH Investment & Securities. He added that a more hands‑on Lee could free executives to focus on long‑term R&D instead of short‑term results. “It remains to be seen how directly and proactively he will engage going forward, but if the owner takes a more active role, it could allow management to focus more on long-term initiatives rather than short-term results,” Ryu added. The company now eyes recovery with Lee driving new investments Business lobby groups have also welcomed the court decision calling it an advantage to the country’s broader economy. According to the Korea Enterprises Federation the judgement comes at a crucial time, as local businesses are increasing efforts in AI and semiconductors amid persistent US trade pressures. The Samsung group is also upbeat about Lee driving new investments as he steers the company to its recovery following the acquittal. The 57-year-old Lee has been entangled in several legal battles. In 2021, he served 18 months in prison for bribery linked to former President Park Geun‑hye, only to be pardoned in late 2023 by President Yoon Suk Yeol, who cited the need for Lee’s guidance during a national downturn. Lee’s challenges are however far from over, despite the acquittal. Samsung recently warned of a steeper‑than‑expected 56% plunge in second‑quarter operating profit, driven by sluggish AI chip sales. Market watchers worry the company must not only defend its core memory‑chip and smartphone businesses but also identify the next big technology engine. “Jay Y. Lee has to balance consolidating his authority with reigniting growth,” said Park Ju‑gun, head of analysis at Leaders Index. “He needs to both shore up existing divisions and scout new frontiers.” In the meantime, one major distraction is now off Lee’s plate. The market awaits to see if he can turn around Samsung’s fortunes, be it in AI chips, smartphones or the next big innovation. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

One analyst believes the altseason may begin as early as this week, drawing comparisons to patterns observed in previous bull cycles. Is It Finally Here? Less than a week ago, bitcoin (BTC) reached a new all-time high price of approximately $123,000. Since then, though , the primary cryptocurrency has cooled off slightly, giving room for some of the leading altcoins to record substantial gains , too . Over the past few days, Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP) , Stellar (XLM), Cardano (ADA), and many more have taken center stage thanks to their rapid price increases, while BTC’s dominance has slipped below 61%. BTC Dominance, Source: CMC These developments have led many in the crypto community to speculate that the altseason has either already begun or is just around the corner. One popular X user who shared their thoughts on the matter is 0xNobler. The analyst claimed the next altcoin season could start tomorrow (July 18), arguing that the same thing was observed in 2017 and 2021: “Every altseason started on the same day, and this one won’t be any different.” The X user suggested that the market is still in its early phase of an uptrend, with most capital concentrated in BTC and high-cap coins. Later, however, the interest could shift to smaller cryptocurrencies in terms of capitalization, while the dominance of the leader might continue to decline. “If this setup continues, the altcoin season could kick off next week, offering the best entry point. I’ve witnessed this pattern in past cycles, and recognizing it early changed everything,” the analyst added. Additionally, 0xNobler said they would accumulate several cryptocurrencies ahead of the next rally. Some of the well-known names include Hyperliquid (HYPE), Sui (SUI), Render (RENDER), and more . More Opinions Davinci Jeremie, a popular figure in the crypto space, widely known for urging people to buy BTC when its price was under $1, believes the altcoin season hasn’t arrived yet. However, he cautioned that when it starts, most will be too late. Altseason hasn’t started. But when it’s here, most will be too late. — Davinci Jeremie (@Davincij15) July 17, 2025 For his part, the veteran trader Peter Brandt argued that it’s already altseason. His thesis is based on the formation of a classical “cup with handle” on the chart, which shows the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, excluding BTC.

This rise in Ethereum also stimulated altcoins and increased the belief in the market that the altcoin season has begun. At this point, Bitcoin is moving into a consolidation phase after reaching a new all-time high, while ETH is now taking the lead. Every Drop in Ethereum Is an Opportunity! As Ethereum continues its rapid rise, popular analyst Michael van de Poppe argued that Ethereum’s momentum after testing multiple resistances could push the price up to $4,000, last seen in December. Poppe also stated that Ethereum is ready to rise to higher prices, and that every subsequent decline is a buying opportunity. “I think Ethereum will head towards $4,000. So, if there are any corrections coming, it would be great to capitalize on them and buy on dips.” In another post, Poppe pointed out that Ethereum has gained even more value against Bitcoin, and that this is a sign that the next phase, the altcoin season, is about to begin. The analyst finally emphasized that altcoins generally follow the trend of altcoin leader Ethereum and that altcoins could soon initiate an explosive price movement. *This is not investment advice.

Inverted head-and-shoulders pattern completes, with neckline at $2.9 now acting as support. Next resistance lies at $3.6, with $4 in sight if ETF momentum sustains. By Jainam Mehta XRP ( XRP-USD ) surged to $3.21 on Thursday, breaking above the critical $3 psychological barrier and marking its highest level since early 2025. The move follows a powerful technical breakout from a multi-month consolidation range and comes just ahead of the anticipated launch of the ProShares XRP Futures ETF on July 18. ETF optimism and institutional demand drive price The sudden surge in volume and momentum has coincided with renewed interest from treasury desks and whales, many of whom re-entered near the $2.9–$3 breakout zone. The launch of the ProShares ETF is widely viewed as a key driver, signaling growing institutional interest in XRP as a tradeable and hedgeable asset. Strategists noted that a sustained close above $3 could mark the beginning of a fresh price discovery phase. XRP price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Technical structure also reinforces the bullish case. The breakout confirms a larger inverted head-and-shoulders pattern, with the neckline at $2.90 now flipped into support. All major exponential moving averages (20/50/100/200) are rising in bullish alignment, and momentum indicators show acceleration without bearish divergence, supporting the view that bulls remain in control. Upside targets and key levels to watch The next area of resistance lies between $3.5 and $3.6, representing the January 2025 high. If XRP continues upward with strong volume and a weekly close above $3.2, a run toward the psychological $4 zone is possible. On the downside, support is located at $2.9, with deeper support near $2.4–$2.6 if the rally stalls. The Relative Strength Index ((RSI)) has entered overbought territory, but analysts suggest that momentum remains intact and dips could serve as opportunities within a broader uptrend. In our July 16 coverage, we identified XRP’s bullish reversal structure forming through a W-shaped pattern and a developing inverted head-and-shoulders setup . With the breakout now confirmed and ETF momentum building, attention shifts to whether XRP can sustain its trajectory above $3.2 toward fresh 2025 highs.

Here’s the Notable Signal,https://timestabloid.com/egrag-crypto-says-xrp-is-in-ultra-bullish-region-heres-the-bullish-signal/,"XRP has entered a critical phase in its market journey, now positioned within what top crypto analyst Egrag Crypto calls the “Ultra Bullish Region.” Backed by precise technical patterns and a steady rise in momentum, XRP appears to be gearing up for a powerful breakout, with its sights set firmly on what Egrag terms the “Valhalla” zone, a symbolic label for a massive upward price explosion. XRP Price Action and Current Market Standing As of report time, XRP is trading at $3.26, posting a strong 24-hour gain of 10.83%. This rally marks a significant development in the asset’s trajectory, pushing it into the $2.20–$3.20 price band, which Egrag identifies as the Ultra Bullish Region. The move is being closely watched by traders and analysts alike, as it positions XRP just beneath the next major target: the Valhalla zone, which begins at approximately $3.30. This surge is not occurring in isolation. Rather, it is the result of a carefully unfolding pattern that Egrag has been charting for months. According to his latest analysis, XRP’s upward journey has involved a step-by-step transition through key regions of support and resistance, each representing stronger bullish confirmation. #XRP Before and After – We are in the Ultra #Bullish Region waiting for Valhalla: Before: After: pic.twitter.com/nQIg3DEfi9 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) July 17, 2025 Technical Structure and the “Flipping It” Signal One of the most important milestones in XRP’s recent performance is what Egrag labels as the “Flipping It” moment. This occurred when XRP decisively broke through the resistance level and later turned that level into a new support zone. This flip, clearly marked on Egrag’s updated chart with a bold blue arrow, is seen as a classic bullish signal that often precedes continued upward movement. Additionally, XRP’s price has remained above the crucial support zone highlighted in both the “Before” and “After” charts as the “Do Not Lose It” level. This zone, located just above the long-term trendline, serves as a structural base for the current rally. Holding above it was essential to preserving the bullish thesis, and XRP has not only maintained that level, it has climbed far beyond it. Elliott Wave Count and the Path to Valhalla Egrag’s chart also integrates an Elliott Wave structure, indicating that XRP is currently progressing through wave (5) of a classic impulsive cycle. The wave (3) peak was registered in March 2025, and the current price movement suggests that wave (5) is in full motion. This fifth wave typically represents the most aggressive phase of a trend and, in this case, could drive XRP straight into the Valhalla region. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Valhalla zone, beginning at the $3.30 mark, represents a confluence of strong technical resistance and psychological importance. A confirmed breakout above this zone would not only validate the bullish wave structure but could also trigger an explosive move into new all-time highs. Outlook and Sentiment Moving Forward The excitement around XRP is not only technical. Fundamentally, Ripple’s increasing global influence, growing adoption of the XRP Ledger, and enhanced regulatory clarity across key markets are all contributing to a more favorable environment for XRP’s growth. These macro developments are providing strong tailwinds that support the current bullish narrative. Egrag has consistently emphasized the importance of maintaining structural support levels and respecting trendline formations. As long as XRP holds above the previously flipped resistance zones, particularly the $1.30 level, its pathway toward Valhalla remains open and viable. XRP has officially entered the Ultra Bullish Region, signaling strength, momentum, and a high probability of continuation. With solid technical structure, a confirmed bullish wave count, and growing macro support, Egrag Crypto’s analysis paints a compelling picture: XRP is not just climbing, it is positioning itself for a potential breakout of historic proportions. The next move above $3.30 could be the key that unlocks Valhalla. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

That’s the staggering reality facing Upbit , one of South Korea’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges. A recent revelation from a South Korean lawmaker suggests that Upbit could be on the hook for an astounding 183 trillion won, equivalent to approximately $131.5 billion, due to alleged legal transgressions. This isn’t just a slap on the wrist; it’s a potential financial earthquake that could send tremors through the entire South Korean crypto market and beyond. The Allegations Unveiled: What Did Upbit Do? The alarm was first sounded by Min Byeong-dug, a lawmaker from South Korea’s ruling Democratic Party. According to Kuki News, Min’s office disclosed that the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) , operating under the Financial Services Commission (FSC), conducted a thorough inspection of Dunamu, the parent company behind Upbit . The findings, published on February 25, painted a concerning picture. A review of the FIU’s report allegedly identified over 9.57 million violations across 10 distinct categories. While the specific nature of these categories remains undisclosed, the sheer volume of infractions suggests systemic issues within the exchange’s operations. In response to these findings, the FIU has already taken significant steps: A three-month suspension on certain business operations at Upbit has been imposed. Disciplinary measures, including dismissal and reprimands, have been levied against 10 individuals, comprising one executive and nine employees. It’s crucial to note that, as of the latest reports, no financial penalties have been formally imposed. The $131.5 billion figure is a potential fine, highlighted by the lawmaker, reflecting the maximum penalty that could be levied under specific legal frameworks for such extensive exchange violations . This distinction is vital for understanding the current stage of the situation. South Korea’s Stance: A Strict Landscape for South Korean Crypto South Korea has long been at the forefront of cryptocurrency adoption, but it has also established itself as a nation with a stringent regulatory approach. Unlike some jurisdictions that have adopted a more hands-off stance, South Korea has prioritized investor protection, anti-money laundering (AML), and financial stability. This proactive regulatory environment is largely driven by past incidents of fraud and market manipulation, which have made authorities particularly cautious. The government’s intent is clear: to foster a secure and transparent environment for digital asset trading. This includes strict Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements, mandatory reporting for suspicious transactions, and rigorous oversight of crypto exchanges. The ongoing scrutiny of Upbit underscores the seriousness with which South Korean regulators view compliance within the digital asset space. This isn’t just about one exchange; it’s about setting a precedent for the entire South Korean crypto ecosystem. The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU): Guardians of Compliance At the heart of this regulatory action is the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) . As an integral part of the Financial Services Commission (FSC), the FIU serves as South Korea’s central agency for combating money laundering and terrorist financing. Its primary role involves collecting, analyzing, and disseminating financial intelligence to relevant law enforcement and regulatory bodies. When it comes to cryptocurrency exchanges, the FIU conducts regular inspections to ensure compliance with the Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information. These inspections delve deep into an exchange’s internal controls, transaction monitoring systems, customer verification processes, and overall adherence to AML/CFT (Combating the Financing of Terrorism) regulations. The findings from the FIU’s report on Dunamu are the bedrock of the current allegations against Upbit , highlighting the unit’s critical role in maintaining the integrity of the nation’s financial system. Understanding Exchange Violations: What Does 9.57 Million Mean? The revelation of 9.57 million alleged exchange violations is a staggering figure that demands closer examination. While the specific nature of these 10 categories of violations hasn’t been detailed, such a high number typically points to systemic failures rather than isolated incidents. Common areas where crypto exchanges face compliance issues include: Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Know Your Customer (KYC) Deficiencies: Failure to properly verify customer identities, monitor transactions for suspicious activity, or report suspicious transactions to authorities. Internal Control Weaknesses: Inadequate systems or procedures to prevent errors, fraud, or non-compliance. Reporting Irregularities: Incorrect, incomplete, or delayed reporting of required financial data to regulatory bodies. Data Management Issues: Poor record-keeping or data security practices. Operational Misconduct: Violations related to trading practices, listing procedures, or market manipulation prevention. The gravity of 9.57 million violations across 10 categories suggests that these aren’t minor oversights. They could potentially involve a widespread breakdown in Upbit ‘s compliance framework, raising serious questions about its operational integrity and its commitment to regulatory standards. Such a high volume of infractions could erode public trust and necessitate significant remediation efforts from the exchange. The Broader Implications for Crypto Regulations and Beyond This situation involving Upbit serves as a potent reminder of the increasing global focus on crypto regulations . Governments worldwide are grappling with how to effectively oversee a rapidly evolving industry, balancing innovation with the need for consumer protection and financial stability. South Korea’s assertive stance could influence regulatory approaches in other jurisdictions, particularly in Asia, where similar concerns about market integrity and illicit financial flows persist. For Upbit , the immediate challenge is to address the FIU’s findings and navigate the potential for a massive fine. Even if the final penalty is less than the suggested $131.5 billion, any significant financial burden could impact its operations, expansion plans, and overall market position. Furthermore, the reputational damage from such allegations can be long-lasting, potentially affecting user trust and trading volumes. For the broader South Korean crypto market, this event highlights the ongoing tightening of regulatory screws. Other exchanges will likely face increased scrutiny, prompting them to review and bolster their own compliance frameworks. This could lead to a more mature and secure market in the long run, but also potentially higher operational costs and stricter requirements for new entrants. Lessons Learned: Navigating the Complex World of Crypto Compliance The situation at Upbit offers critical lessons for all participants in the cryptocurrency ecosystem: For Crypto Exchanges: Compliance is not merely a box-ticking exercise; it must be deeply embedded in every aspect of operations. Investing in robust AML/KYC systems, comprehensive internal controls, regular audits, and skilled compliance teams is paramount. Proactive engagement with regulators and immediate remediation of identified issues can mitigate future penalties. For Crypto Users: While the responsibility for compliance primarily lies with exchanges, users should be aware of the regulatory landscape in their jurisdiction. Opting for regulated exchanges with strong track records of compliance can offer a greater degree of security and reduce exposure to operational risks stemming from regulatory crackdowns. For Regulators: This case demonstrates the need for clear, consistent, and enforceable crypto regulations . While the potential fine is enormous, the focus should also be on fostering a culture of compliance through guidance and collaboration, not just punitive measures. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for South Korean Crypto The allegations against Upbit represent a watershed moment for the South Korean crypto market. The potential for a staggering $131.5 billion fine, stemming from millions of alleged exchange violations identified by the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) , underscores the intensifying global pressure on cryptocurrency platforms to adhere to stringent crypto regulations . While no financial penalty has been imposed yet, the disciplinary actions and the sheer scale of the alleged non-compliance highlight the critical importance of robust internal controls and unwavering commitment to legal frameworks. This incident will undoubtedly shape the future of digital asset trading in South Korea, serving as a powerful warning to other exchanges and potentially influencing regulatory trends worldwide. As the crypto industry continues to mature, the emphasis on compliance, transparency, and accountability will only grow stronger, ensuring a more secure and sustainable environment for all participants.

BNY Mellon: A Trusted Name in Asset Custody On July 9, Ripple formally announced that the Bank of New York Mellon, the oldest bank in the United States and a global leader in asset servicing, would safeguard the RLUSD reserves. These reserves are comprised solely of cash and short-term U.S. Treasuries, held in segregated, auditable accounts. This institutional-grade custody framework is designed to: Provide robust transparency for RLUSD holders Ensure liquidity and seamless redemption processes Instill confidence among regulators, enterprises, and investors Jack McDonald, Ripple’s SVP of stablecoins, emphasized that BNY Mellon’s “demonstrable custody expertise and strong commitment to financial innovation” were decisive factors in the partnership. Emily Portney, BNY Mellon’s global head of asset servicing, highlighted the bank’s excitement to “support the growth and adoption of RLUSD by facilitating the seamless movement of reserve assets and cash for conversions, working closely with Ripple to advance the future of the financial ecosystem”. Institutional Trust and Regulatory Alignment This collaboration is not just about technical custody; it represents a significant vote of confidence from the world’s institutional banking sector in the stability and regulatory compliance of Ripple’s offerings. RLUSD is regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services and is designed to provide a fast, low-fee, and transparent means of settlement for enterprises operating across borders. Ripple’s choice to work with BNY Mellon was strategic, aligning with its recent application for a national banking charter in the U.S. and its pursuit of a Federal Reserve master account. Achieving these milestones would allow Ripple to connect RLUSD reserves directly to central banking infrastructure, further integrating its operations with the existing financial system and elevating its legitimacy among traditional institutions. A Surge in Institutional and Enterprise Adoption Behind the BNY Mellon headline, Ripple has been quietly and methodically expanding its global network of institutional partners: Switzerland’s Amina Bank is the first globally licensed institution to offer RLUSD custody and trading, allowing both retail and institutional users access to the stablecoin for real-time cross-border settlements within the EU’s regulatory framework. In Asia, Ripple’s ongoing collaborations with SBI Holdings and Tranglo have led to surging On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) volumes, deepening Ripple’s reach in forex and payments. Ripple’s ecosystem has attracted prominent enterprise users in regulated markets, reflecting growing trust in its compliance-first, scalable approach. The partnership announcement has catalyzed renewed institutional and retail interest in Ripple and its digital assets. Following the news, XRP’s market capitalization surged, driven by expectations of further adoption in mainstream finance and speculation over future exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows. Market observers note that these advanced custody arrangements and the involvement of global banking leaders like BNY Mellon create a new standard for stablecoin security and transparency. They provide comfort to enterprises concerned about counterparty risk and liquidity in the digital asset space. Ripple’s Expanding Vision Ripple’s ambition extends beyond individual partnerships. The company is actively positioning RLUSD and the XRP Ledger as foundational layers for regulated finance, DeFi, and tokenization. The dual-chain nature of RLUSD—operating on both Ethereum and XRP Ledger—offers flexibility to suit different enterprise needs, and the company’s compliance initiatives are designed to future-proof its ecosystem against evolving regulations. With its growing slate of institutional partners, regulatory wins, and marquee custody alliances, Ripple is rapidly closing the gap between the world of traditional and digital finance. As more global finance leaders join its network, Ripple is poised to shape the next chapter of the digital asset industry. This development marks a defining moment for Ripple, with BNY Mellon’s custodianship of RLUSD solidifying its reputation in the eyes of regulators, enterprises, and institutional investors worldwide",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|XRP|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-17 15:26:52

The investment holding company recently unveiled a strategic move to bolster its Web3 initiatives, signaling a robust commitment to the next generation of the internet. This isn’t just another funding round; it’s a clear indicator of how established entities are eyeing the immense potential within decentralized technologies. But what exactly does this mean for the future of digital innovation, and how will this substantial investment shape the trajectory of Elate Holdings’ foray into Web3? What’s Driving Elate Holdings’ Bold Move into Web3 Development? On July 17, Elate Holdings made a pivotal announcement: the signing of a subscription agreement to issue HKD 19.95 million, approximately $2.55 million, in zero-coupon, six-year convertible bonds. These bonds, set to mature in 2031, are not just a financial instrument; they are the fuel for the company’s ambitious Web3 development expansion. The terms allow for conversion at HKD 0.25 per share, potentially introducing up to 79.8 million new shares under a general mandate. This strategic injection of capital underscores Elate Holdings’ belief in the transformative power of Web3 technologies. Why such a significant investment in Web3 now? The answer lies in the profound shifts occurring across industries. Web3, often described as the decentralized internet, promises a future where users have greater control over their data and digital assets, powered by blockchain technology. This includes everything from decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to metaverse experiences and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). For a forward-thinking investment holding company like Elate Holdings, venturing into this space isn’t just about exploring new trends; it’s about positioning itself at the forefront of innovation and capturing future growth opportunities. Understanding Convertible Bonds: A Strategic Blockchain Investment Tool The choice of convertible bonds as the funding mechanism is particularly insightful. For those unfamiliar, a convertible bond is a type of debt security that provides the bondholder with the option to convert their bond into a pre-determined number of common shares of the issuing company. It’s a hybrid instrument, blending features of both debt and equity. For the Issuer (Elate Holdings): Convertible bonds offer a flexible way to raise capital. They typically come with lower interest rates (zero-coupon in this case, meaning no periodic interest payments) compared to traditional bonds because investors have the upside potential of converting into equity if the company’s share price performs well. This allows Elate Holdings to conserve cash flow while funding its Web3 expansion. For the Investor: Investors receive the security of a bond (repayment of principal at maturity) coupled with the potential for capital appreciation if the company’s stock rises. If Elate Holdings’ Web3 ventures succeed and its share price increases, investors can convert their bonds into shares and participate in that growth. It’s a balanced risk-reward proposition, especially appealing for blockchain investment opportunities that carry higher growth potential but also higher inherent risks. This structure is particularly attractive for funding high-growth, emerging sectors like Web3, where future valuations can be uncertain but potentially very high. It provides a pathway for investors to participate in the success of Elate Holdings’ Web3 journey without the immediate volatility of direct equity investment. Elate Holdings’ Vision: Pioneering Digital Transformation This $2.55 million commitment is more than just a financial transaction; it represents Elate Holdings’ strategic intent to lead in the ongoing digital transformation. While the specific areas of their Web3 business expansion haven’t been fully detailed, the broad scope of Web3 suggests several exciting possibilities: Metaverse and Gaming: Investing in virtual worlds, digital economies, and immersive experiences that redefine interaction and entertainment. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Exploring new financial services built on blockchain, offering alternatives to traditional banking. NFTs and Digital Collectibles: Venturing into the creation, ownership, and trading of unique digital assets. Blockchain Infrastructure: Building foundational layers or tools that support the broader Web3 ecosystem. By securing this funding, Elate Holdings is positioning itself to not only participate in these burgeoning sectors but potentially to innovate within them. This proactive approach is crucial in a landscape where technological advancements are rapid and disruptive. Their move highlights a growing trend where traditional holding companies are leveraging their financial prowess to diversify into cutting-edge digital frontiers, aiming to capture the next wave of economic value creation. What Does This Mean for the Future of Web3 and Traditional Finance? Elate Holdings’ investment is a microcosm of a larger trend: the increasing convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) with the decentralized world of Web3. This isn’t just about big tech companies; it’s about established financial players and investment firms recognizing the long-term value proposition of blockchain technology and its applications. The infusion of capital from entities like Elate Holdings brings several benefits to the Web3 ecosystem: Increased Legitimacy: Traditional investment signals confidence, helping to legitimize the Web3 space and attract more mainstream adoption. Capital Infusion: Provides much-needed funding for innovative projects, enabling faster development and scalability. Expertise and Resources: Traditional companies bring extensive business acumen, operational experience, and networks that can accelerate Web3 projects. However, this convergence also presents challenges. Bridging the gap between the regulated, often slow-moving world of TradFi and the fast-paced, permissionless nature of Web3 requires careful navigation of regulatory uncertainties, technological complexities, and cultural differences. Elate Holdings’ success in its Web3 development will be a key indicator of how effectively this integration can occur. The Road Ahead: Actionable Insights for Investors and Innovators For investors looking at the evolving digital landscape, Elate Holdings’ move provides a fascinating case study. It demonstrates a strategic approach to blockchain investment that balances risk with high-growth potential. Key takeaways include: Diversification is Key: Companies are not just focusing on one aspect of Web3 but exploring a range of opportunities. Hybrid Funding Models: Convertible bonds offer a flexible and attractive way for companies to raise capital for innovative ventures. Long-Term Vision: The 2031 maturity date of the bonds signals a long-term commitment to Web3, acknowledging that significant returns in this space may take time to materialize. For innovators and entrepreneurs in the Web3 space, this signals continued interest from traditional capital. Building robust, sustainable projects with clear utility will be crucial to attracting such investments. The focus should be on solving real-world problems and creating tangible value within the decentralized framework. Conclusion Elate Holdings’ decision to issue $2.55 million in convertible bonds for its Web3 development is a significant statement. It underscores the growing conviction among established companies that the future of the internet is decentralized, and that early, strategic blockchain investment is essential for long-term relevance and growth. This move not only provides critical funding for Elate Holdings’ ambitious plans but also serves as a powerful testament to the increasing maturity and appeal of the Web3 ecosystem. As companies like Elate Holdings continue their digital transformation journey, the line between traditional finance and decentralized innovation will continue to blur, paving the way for a more integrated and exciting digital future.

The selection points to growing trust in selected altcoins in the new wave of funds. Canary Capital has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, starting the process for an ETF based on Injective (INJ). The new fund will include staking and will expose US investors to INJ staking, joining the trend of ETFs with on-chain passive income. Injective greeted the ETF opportunity as a potential institutional recognition of its technology. 1/ History is being made today! Canary Capital just filed the first US Staked $INJ ETF with the SEC, giving institutions and everyday investors a regulated path to access the native Injective token through traditional brokerages and banking rails. Here's why it's a big deal 🧵 pic.twitter.com/GkLtkR41N1 — Injective 🥷 (@injective) July 17, 2025 The Injective Trust set up by Canary Capital will stake INJ on the native Injective network, with an allocation of only a part of the total holdings. INJ staking is relatively high yield, with up to 11.5% in rewards. The exact INJ staking rewards depend on the selected validator , where each one has a different ranking and risk profile. If approved, the ETF will show a willingness to consider smaller networks and directly tap the value of staking coins and the ecosystem of validators. The Injective network relies on 51 validators for its security, with varying returns and reliability. Kiln remains the leading validator with over $68M in staking, followed by a node run by Deutsche Telekom. INJ rallies by 25% last week Following the exposure from Canary Capital, INJ expanded by 25% in the past week to $13.49. INJ has attempted to build a reputation of being a key platform for DeFi, though it has grown at a slower pace compared to other chains. INJ rallied in the past week, extending its rally after the Canary Capital ETF filing. | Source: Coingecko INJ is among the relatively smaller networks, with around 71K daily active addresses. Activity on Injective picked up in July, following a long period of inactivity. As of July, the Injective DeFi sector was still limited, with around $37M in total value locked. While Injective has been actively building, its DeFi sector lags behind larger networks. Despite the relatively slow performance, Canary Capital’s interest in INJ shows the focus is shifting to eligible altcoins. Canary Capital is one of the funds to expand to previously overlooked altcoins. The list of potential Canary funds includes LTC, TRX, SUI, and HBAR, in addition to the most closely watched filings for XRP and SOL. Injective taps RWA demand Injective is one of the networks aiming to tap the RWA narrative. Injective Labs introduced a BUIDL token listing, tracking BlackRock’s tokenized money fund. In general, Injective aims to build Web3 infrastructure, spanning both on-chain activity and financial value. So far, Injective has shown one successful ETP for the European Market. 21Shares launched its AINJ ETP, demonstrating the demand for regulated INJ products. Injective is a relatively new addition to the crypto space, launching just before the 2021 bull market. The project raised $59.7M in several funding rounds, with Binance and Mark Cuban joining in. The public sale raised around $7.1M, leaving most of the INJ tokens to insiders. All INJ tokens have been unlocked, and the token trades closed to its fully diluted valuation of $1.39B.

BTC is up nearly 1% in the past 24 hours as it recovers after dipping to a low of $117,771 earlier in the session. The flagship cryptocurrency reached $120,000 but lost momentum, slipping below $118,000 before moving to its current level of $118,759. Meanwhile, ETH is on an absolute tear as ETF inflows hit record levels. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency surged past $3,300, and is up over 7% at the time of writing. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) has surpassed $3, with an 8% price increase in the past 24 hours. Solana (SOL) is up over 5%, trading around $172, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is up almost 7%, trading around $0.211. Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Hedera (HBAR) , Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial increases. Dow Jones Rises As Markets Digest Inflation, Earnings Data The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 were up 140 points and 0.16%, while the Nasdaq Composite registered a marginal increase of 0.04%. The slight increases came as investors assessed earnings reports from banks, including the Bank of America, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs. Stocks declined on Tuesday amid rising inflation concerns and renewed tariff uncertainty. However, markets rebounded as Wall Street turned optimistic. The uptick has been helped by lower-than-expected producer price index (PPI) numbers, released Wednesday. June PPI rose 2.3% year-over-year, the lowest since September 2024, and below the forecasted 2.5% increase. PPI remained flat on a month-over-month basis, below an expected increase of 0.20%. Economist Mohamed El-Erian stated, “US producer price inflation for June was softer than the consensus forecasts, with no monthly change for the headline and core measures. Annual inflation moderated to 2.3% and 2.6% respectively. [However] the immediate reaction of yields on US Treasury bonds is muted as markets are also noting the unusually large upward revision in the prior (May) estimates.” Crypto Bills Progress After Nine-Hour Stalemate House Republican leaders agreed to move forward with three crucial crypto bills stuck in a procedural vote, as Republican hardliners refused to back down on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The vote was open for more than nine hours, the longest in the House’s history, eventually passing late on Wednesday with a 217-212 vote. A few Republicans refused to back the vote unless the ban on CBDCs was guaranteed to pass. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Republicans will now add a CBDC ban to a must-pass defense spending bill. The Republicans had also stalled an earlier resolution on Tuesday. Coinbase Unveils New “Everything App” Coinbase has launched the Base App, calling it a new “everything app” that integrates payments, trading, social media, and app discovery into a single platform. The platform made the announcement during the “A New Day One” livestream on July 16. The new app was introduced as a major rebrand and expansion of the Coinbase Wallet. The app, built on the Base Layer 2 network, offers seamless on-chain experiences built around USD Coin payments, decentralized apps, and social engagements. Coinbase described the app as a place where users can post, chat, send money, trade, and earn. The app’s social features are powered by Farcaster, allowing users to publish content, earn income, and preserve their identity across apps. The app also integrates Base Pay, a feature that allows users to pay in USDC across supported platforms. World Liberty Financial To Make WLFI Token Tradable The World Liberty Financial community has unanimously voiced its support to make the WLFI token tradable. The proposal closed on July 16 with a 99.94% approval after a week-long vote that began on July 9. The move will enable the WLFI ecosystem to move to a more open system, allowing peer-to-peer transfers and access to secondary markets. It will also enable more stakeholders to participate in governance related to ecosystem initiatives, token emissions, and treasury management. Trading of the WLFI token will begin in stages, with only a portion of the tokens sold to early backers unlocked initially. The remaining supply will remain locked until the community conducts more votes to decide on future token unlock schedules. The Trump family’s WLFI holdings will also be subject to these restrictions. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is marginally down during the ongoing session, trading around $118,346, as buyer momentum stalled around the $120,000 mark. BTC started the week positively, surging past $123,000 to set a new all-time high. However, it lost momentum and fell to a low of $115,701 on Tuesday before settling at $117,682. The price recovered on Wednesday, reaching an intraday high of $119,954 before settling at $118,641. The current session sees BTC marginally down, trading around $118,156. Despite reaching a record high earlier this week, analysts believe the BTC market is not overheated, suggesting that the price has more room to push higher. TradingView data shows that BTC has established a new range in lower timeframes as it trades above key support levels. CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. believes BTC is yet to hit its peak, sharing a chart showing the absence of a peak signal, typically occurring around major market tops. Adler stated, “It appears when the combined normalized market to realized price index and 30-day/365-day value days destroyed ratio score reaches or exceeds 1. The Peak Signal only appears at major market tops, and it hasn’t shown up this time, suggesting we’re not at a peak yet.” Crypto Dan, another CryptoQuant analyst, highlighted the realized Cap-UTXO Age Bands, a metric that shows the distribution of the realized cap of a specified age cohort. According to Crypto Dan, the metric suggests that BTC still hasn’t reached an overheated state. The analyst stated, “Despite the price rising even higher, the fact that overheating has significantly decreased compared to previous short-term peaks suggests that Bitcoin could continue to break all-time highs and rise significantly in the second half of 2025, leaving strong potential for growth.” According to the analysts, while BTC is showing resilience near its all-time highs, on-chain data suggests the flagship cryptocurrency still has room to extend its rally. The first major resistance beyond BTC’s all-time high sits at $124,000, while the upper resistance sits at $136,000. “When BTC pushes into this area, the market is typically in overbought conditions with excessive unrealized profit for new buyers.” On the downside, analysts marked $113,000, $111,000, and $101,000 as the levels to watch. “Historically, staying above this zone signals strongholder conviction and trend continuation.” BTC started the previous weekend in the red, dropping 1.41% to $108,097 on Friday. It rebounded from this level, registering a marginal increase on Saturday and rising nearly 1% on Sunday to settle at $109,231. BTC lost momentum on Monday, dropping 0.88% to $108,273, but recovered on Tuesday, rising 0.62% and settling at $108,942. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as BTC rose over 2% to cross $111,000 and settle at $111,255. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price rallied, rising 3.51% to $115,160. BTC continued to push higher on Friday, registering a 1.50% increase and settling at $116,885, but not before reaching an intraday high of $118,301.

Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as traders locked in their profits. As a result, BTC plunged to a low of $115,701 before settling at $117,682, down nearly 2%.

The buyback reflects Numerai’s continued investment in its staking ecosystem, a mechanism that aligns thousands of global data scientists with the long-term performance of its hedge fund. Over the past year, Numerai has more than doubled its assets under management (AUM), growing from approximately $173 million to over $441 million. The fund now trades more than $1 billion per month across over 30 global markets, relying on machine learning models crowdsourced from a global network of data scientists who stake NMR on their predictions. Each week, thousands of data scientists submit predictions to Numerai’s tournament and stake NMR on their models' performance. These stakes encourage aligned, high-quality contributions to the hedge fund, and it’s working. Numerai’s Stake-Weighted Meta Model , an ensemble of user models weighted by their NMR staked, has consistently outperformed individual models, reinforcing Numerai’s incentive-aligned approach to collective intelligence. “The success of our Stake-Weighted Meta Model speaks for itself: it’s outperformed every individual model over the past year. As our AUM grows and top institutional allocators join us, the role of NMR has never been more critical,"" said Richard Craib, Founder and CEO of Numerai. But as Numerai’s ecosystem has matured, NMR has become scarce. With a fixed supply capped at 11 million, and roughly 3 million NMR remaining in Numerai’s treasury, the company has limited capacity to continue distributing staking rewards at historical levels. The company says the buyback will help underscore its long-term commitment to its participants and maintain economic stability. The buyback will be executed gradually to ensure transparency. Orders will be placed at or near prevailing bid prices, allowing the program to unfold gradually over time. The full explanation behind the buyback can be found on Numerai’s newly launched blog . About Numerai Founded in 2015, Numerai is a San Francisco-based hedge fund that crowdsources stock market predictions to solve the hardest problem in finance. The fund is powered by thousands of data scientists globally who can stake NMR on their models and contribute to a crowdsourced Meta Model used in live trading.

48419029,https://coinpaper.com/10022/xrp-on-the-brink-of-ath-just-4-9-from-uncharted-price-territory,1752767242,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,XRP on the Brink of ATH: Just 4.9% From Uncharted Price Territory,https://coinpaper.com/10022/xrp-on-the-brink-of-ath-just-4-9-from-uncharted-price-territory,"After weathering years of legal turmoil and persistent FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt), XRP has regained strong momentum, reclaiming its position as the 3rd-largest cryptocurrency and nearing its all-time high (ATH) of $3.40. XRP Eyes Price Discovery Territory According to market analyst Adex crypt, “XRP is eyeing a breakout into price discovery territory, something we haven’t seen since 2017. If it clears the all-time high, things could get very interesting.” Having reclaimed the psychological price of $3, XRP might be gearing toward a price discovery phase, a scenario seen 8 years ago. If this sees the light of day by breaching the ATH price of $3.40, Adex crypt believes XRP might soar to unprecedented heights. Notably, XRP’s breakout is being fueled by a rare convergence of bullish technicals, rising futures ETF interest, and intensified whale activity. For instance, on‑chain metrics confirm institutional interest with more than over 2.2 billion XRP worth a whopping $6.6 billion has been acquired by whale‑level wallets in the past fortnight. Furthermore, open interest in XRP derivatives has swelled to approximately $9.25 billion, showing heightened market liquidity and activity. If the $3 level holds and volume keeps rising, XRP could break past historical resistance, paving the way for a potential run toward $4, $5, or beyond. Why XRP is Edging Closer to Its ATH of $3.40 Having overtaken Tether (USDT) to become the 3rd-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, XRP continues to witness explosive momentum. Now trading at $3.24 , it's just 4.9% shy of its all-time high of $3.40 set in January 2018. Technical Breakout Nearing XRP recently broke above the key psychological and technical threshold of $3, a breakout supported by tight consolidation between $2.85–$2.93, representing the strongest structure since May 2025. Chart patterns, such as symmetrical triangles, higher lows, and Bollinger Band compression all signal increasing odds of a breakout toward $3.40–$3.50. Institutional-Grade Catalysts July 18 brings the ProShares XRP Futures ETF , generating strong anticipation. Large trading desks are actively accumulating ahead of its listing, and Canada’s XRP ETF has already drawn over $50 million in inflows. Furthermore, a pending vote by the U.S. House on the GENIUS , CLARITY, and Anti‑CBDC bills is contributing to optimism around crypto legislation. A favorable outcome could also nudge the SEC to drop its appeal in the Ripple case. The launch of Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD and the company’s credible pursuit of a U.S. banking charter are also strengthening XRP’s real-world utility narrative. Momentum from Bitcoin & Broader Crypto Market Bitcoin recently hit an all‑time high above $120,000, fueling a broader crypto rally that has uplifted altcoins across the board, including XRP. As a result, XRP is currently scaling heights with a monthly surge of 46.1%. Bullish Analyst Targets Veteran chartist Peter Brandt has projected a 60% rally for XRP, targeting around $4.47, triggering further validation to its upside potential. Short-term forecasts also point to immediate targets between $3.40–$3.60, with potential for $4.50 if current momentum sustains. Conclusion XRP’s break above $3 backed by robust technical patterns, significant ETF progress , whale accumulation, and regulatory breakthroughs strongly supports the thesis that it’s entering price discovery, bringing it perilously close to its ATH of $3.40. If momentum holds, a rapid ascent through $4 and beyond seems increasingly plausible. However, caution should not be thrown to the wind due to short-term retracements, especially in the 2.85 to $3 range.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION|BTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-17 15:47:22

The buyback reflects Numerai’s continued investment in its staking ecosystem, a mechanism that aligns thousands of global data scientists with the long-term performance of its hedge fund. Over the past year, Numerai has more than doubled its assets under management (AUM), growing from approximately $173 million to over $441 million. The fund now trades more than $1 billion per month across over 30 global markets, relying on machine learning models crowdsourced from a global network of data scientists who stake NMR on their predictions. Each week, thousands of data scientists submit predictions to Numerai’s tournament and stake NMR on their models’ performance. These stakes encourage aligned, high-quality contributions to the hedge fund, and it’s working. Numerai’s Stake-Weighted Meta Model , an ensemble of user models weighted by their NMR staked, has consistently outperformed individual models, reinforcing Numerai’s incentive-aligned approach to collective intelligence. “The success of our Stake-Weighted Meta Model speaks for itself: it’s outperformed every individual model over the past year. As our AUM grows and top institutional allocators join us, the role of NMR has never been more critical,” said Richard Craib, Founder and CEO of Numerai. But as Numerai’s ecosystem has matured, NMR has become scarce. With a fixed supply capped at 11 million, and roughly 3 million NMR remaining in Numerai’s treasury, the company has limited capacity to continue distributing staking rewards at historical levels. The company says the buyback will help underscore its long-term commitment to its participants and maintain economic stability. The buyback will be executed gradually to ensure transparency.

Nearly 60% of the wallets that participated in Pump.fun’s ICO have either sold or moved their tokens to centralized exchanges (CEXs) or other wallets within a week of launch. BitMEX posted on X Thursday that out of the 10,145 wallets that took part in the $PUMP presale, 6,042 wallets, approximately 59.6%, had offloaded or transferred their holdings. Yet, 3,791 wallets, about 37.4%, are holding on to their allocations. A small minority, about 3% or 312 wallets, had increased their positions in the token. Token falls in value after $500 million ICO fundraise As reported by Cryptopolitan earlier this week, the token generation event (TGE) for $PUMP generated close to $500 million in just 12 minutes, setting a fully diluted valuation of around $4 billion, at a price of $0.004 per token and total supply of 125 billion tokens. It's been almost 1 week since the @pumpdotfun ICO💊 From 10,145 participants who contributed $448.5M: ➡️59.6% sold or transferred ➡️37.4% continue to HODL ➡️3% increased their holdings Our quant reveals traders are still BULLISH on $PUMP . Read on👇 https://t.co/mIH0MN8Tby pic.twitter.com/pFdAa2FXfH — BitMEX (@BitMEX) July 17, 2025 After the presale, $PUMP was listed on several exchanges, including BitMEX, Binance, Bybit, Kraken, KuCoin, and Gate.io. It was made available through both spot and perpetual contracts, allowing traders to access the token in several ways. Soon after listing, $PUMP surged to an all-time high of $0.006812 on Wednesday, as per CoinGecko data. However, by Thursday, the price had dipped to $0.005325, a 17.74% drop in the last 24 hours, and 55% down from its all-time high of $0.01214. BitMEX analysts mentioned how $PUMP supposedly “defied how most tokens perform” post-ICO. “Such conditions as $PUMP, large floats, and quick profits lead to hedging and strong downward pressure in derivatives markets,” they explained, arguing that tokens with a high unlock rate suffer in price because of high numbers of short-term traders. Pump.fun platform revenue could affect token valuation Despite the token’s better-than-expected launch, BitMEX analysts warned investors that sustaining its current valuation is not a guaranteed take. One of the reasons the price is currently on a downtrend is the declining trading volume on Pump.fun, the platform behind the token. Pump.fun saw its trading volume fall from $11.6 billion in January to just $3.65 billion in June. If the launchpad continues losing revenue, it could put pressure on the token’s long-term value. Competitor LetsBonk, the BONK-powered memecoin launcher, is also eating into Pump.fun’s user base. Although Pump.fun is an all-time chart topper compared to the almost 2-month-old platform, it generated less than 50% of LetsBonk’s weekly revenue between July 7 and July 13. Pump.fun generates about $540 million in annual profit, giving the $PUMP token a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 9.6x. This is higher than LetsBonk’s 5.4x, but significantly lower than Raydium’s P/E ratio of 65x. Pump.fun disclosed that of the 33% of tokens allocated to its ICO, 18% would be reserved for a private sale targeting institutional investors. The remaining 15%, or 150 billion tokens, was intended for public sale. However, on-chain data shows that only 12.5% of the total supply was actually distributed during the public sale. The platform has not provided an official explanation for the unaccounted 2.5%, and community members asked where the rest of the tokens were. Pump.fun later on wrote a post on X to thank presale participants, promising them that the platform, token, and Solana ecosystem as a whole will have a “bright future.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

What truly sets AGN apart isn’t just its cutting-edge tech stack, which is very impressive in its own rights, but the unique coinage and value-added staking logic powering its ecosystem. As blockchain adoption accelerates and the lines between digital identity, value, and behavior blur, one critical element has lagged behind: privacy infrastructure that’s actually profitable to use . AGN is stepping into that gap with a first-of-its-kind token economy that turns participation into yield, and demand into deflation. It’s privacy by design, and scarcity by architecture . Web3 Transparency Web3 promises decentralization, but the cost is often radical transparency. Wallets are doxxed. Transactions are public. DApps routinely demand full access to assets and metadata. On the Web2 side, device fingerprinting and behavior tracking have only grown more invasive. Traditional fixes like VPNs, mixers, and ad blockers are fragmented, non-interoperable, and rarely built for crypto-native users,often degrading user experience or introducing trust risks. AGN changes that by offering an integrated, decentralized privacy layer powered by AI, and turning every layer into an earning opportunity. What Makes AGN Different AGN isn’t just “a privacy token.” It’s a vertically integrated, modular stack covering: AI-powered fingerprint protection to mutate device identity Guardian Mixnet relays to hide IP addresses and traffic timing zk-DID login systems to prove credentials without leaking data Federated threat detection AI that trains locally and syncs globally A fully on-chain, gamified economy with zero pre-mining and no reserved tokens All powered by a single utility token: $AGN . Its most radical innovation is the way $AGN is created, distributed, and destroyed. Buy, Burn, Mint: A Game-Changing Coinage Protocol At the heart of AGN lies its DE Pool , a dual-channel mechanism that handles token buy-ins and redemptions via a decentralized formula. When a user buys AGN : USDT enters the DE Pool An equivalent amount of AGN in the pool is permanently burned The user receives a Minting Value-Enhancement Agreement , a smart contract that emits daily yield in $AGN Daily profit = 1% of the USDT principal , paid in $AGN Yield cap = 3× the original amount , then auto-termination Contracts are auto-triggered, no manual claim needed No inflation – all tokens are minted only when value is created This model ensures no pre-mine, no supply dump , and no central reserve . Every token originates from real participation and is backed by real economic input. Spiral Rise: Built-in Scarcity, Organic Price Pressure AGN’s DE Pool mechanics create a unique economic feedback loop dubbed the “Spiral Rise” model : When users buy AGN, old tokens are burned, and new ones are minted into personal contracts. The minting rate is fixed, but new deposits continue growing. As more users enter, USDT inflows outpace AGN emissions . This creates permanent net deflation , supporting price without artificial pumps. It’s a self-balancing economy that rewards patience and participation while penalizing manipulation or front-running. Every cycle strengthens the next, forming a natural upward trend in AGN’s value over time. Referral Rewards with Transparent Weekly Bonus Pool To expand adoption without relying on centralized marketing, AGN employs a decentralized referral bonus system : A 10% slippage fee is applied when users sell AGN. This fee goes into a publicly visible wallet , forming a bonus pool . Every 7 days, 50% of this pool is distributed to the top 50 referrers , ranked by direct referral volume. The reward split is transparent and fixed: 1st place: 5% 2nd place: 3% 3rd place: 2% Ranks 1–10: 30% shared evenly (3% each) Ranks 11–25: 30% shared evenly (2% each) Ranks 26–50: 30% shared evenly (1.2% each) The remaining 50% of the pool rolls over to the next week, ensuring consistency and momentum. DAO-Based Community Mechanics: Value + Voice AGN is governed by its DAO, not by insiders. Users who participate in minting, staking, or referrals automatically gain network influence and revenue share . Guardian Node Rewards: top earners become monthly nodes and share global network fees Voting Rights: AGN holders influence roadmap, fee structure, and treasury deployment Builder Incentives: SDKs allow third-party projects to integrate AGN privacy and earn from traffic Deflation Mechanisms: 30% of all service fees are burned 10% of mining rewards are burned Bonus pool and buyback programs increase scarcity With no central allocation or inflation, AGN aligns ecosystem growth directly with tokenholder value. AGN was designed for: Everyday crypto users who want private logins, safe browsing, and non-doxxed DeFi Referrers and promoters who want performance-based, on-chain income DeFi builders who want a seamless zk-identity SDK and privacy layer Privacy-conscious communities seeking self-learning, censorship-resistant tech The Future of Privacy Is Profitable, AND Deflationary AGN isn’t chasing trends but rather building a resilient infrastructure for the next decade of Web3, where privacy isn’t a premium – it’s a right , and participation becomes capital . No token unlocks.No supply cliffs.No insider advantage. Just real value for real users , with a deflationary spiral that makes AGN rarer, more useful, and more desirable the more it’s adopted.

BlackRock Ramps Up Bitcoin Acquisition BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is ramping up its Bitcoin purchases. According to data from Arkham Intelligence, the asset manager has purchased 3,478 BTC for around $416 million. BlackRock’s last Bitcoin purchase was last week when it purchased $216 million worth of the asset. The latest purchase takes BlackRock’s Bitcoin portfolio to 716,500 BTC , worth over $85 billion, making it one of the largest holders of the asset. “BLACKROCK IS BUYING BTC . BlackRock just bought $416M of Bitcoin. Current Holdings: $85.47 BTC (3.6% of circulating supply)” The asset manager’s purchase comes as demand for its IBIT ETF skyrockets. IBIT is leading US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs in daily inflows. According to the latest market data, Bitcoin ETFs recorded $799 million in inflows over the past 24 hours. Matador Technologies Plans 6,000 BTC Purchase Bitcoin solutions firm Matador Technologies plans to purchase 6,000 BTC by 2027, significantly accelerating its Bitcoin buying strategy. The firm announced that it plans to buy 1,000 BTC on or before 2026, as it plans to accumulate 6,000 BTC by 2027. Matador currently holds 77.4 BTC worth around $9 million. The firm’s long-term goal is to hold 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply and become one of the top 20 holders of the asset. Deven Soni, CEO of Matador Technologies, stated, “Our business is structured around Bitcoin as a core asset.” Soni added that the firm’s new approach extends beyond treasury management and also includes infrastructure and operational components. Matador had filed a 900 million Canadian dollar shelf prospectus to provide financing flexibility over the next 25 months. The firm plans to use various funding strategies, including at-the-market equity offerings, convertible financings, asset divestitures, Bitcoin-backed credit facilities, and strategic acquisitions or partnerships. Volcon Raises $500 Million To Fund Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Volcon Inc. has entered into a securities purchase agreement for a private placement expected to generate over $500 million in gross proceeds. The firm will issue 50,142,851 shares of its common stock at $10 per share to accredited and institutional investors. The company stated that it plans to use 95% of the gross proceeds to acquire Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. Empery Asset Management was the lead investor in the offering. Other participants included crypto venture capital firms like FalconX, Pantera, RK Capital, Borderless, and Relayer Capital. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered a sharp decline during the ongoing session, falling to a low of $117,389 as selling pressure intensified. However, the flagship cryptocurrency has rebounded to reclaim $118,000 and move to its current level of $118,777. While much of Bitcoin’s latest rally has been fueled by institutional demand, new data suggests that retail investors are stepping back in after an extended pause. According to a report by Glassnode, Bitcoin held by first-time buyers rose nearly 3% over the past two weeks, rising from 4.77 million BTC to 4.91 million BTC , indicating that fresh capital is entering the market. “Over the past two weeks, the supply held by first-time BTC buyers rose by +2.86%, climbing from 4.77M to 4.91M BTC . Fresh capital continues to enter the market, supporting the latest price breakout.” In previous bullish cycles, the rally was generally fueled by retail investors. However, the current cycle was marked by institutional and ETF demand, which helped Bitcoin surge past key levels as smaller investors remained on the sidelines. Glassnode’s report suggests retail investors may be re-entering the market. An analysis of trading activity on Binance shows a jump in retail-sized deposits while whale inflows registered a notable decline. This means a significant portion of recent momentum is being driven by retail activity. CryptoQuant analysts have also stated that the Bitcoin market is not overheated, and that the flagship cryptocurrency has room to push higher. CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. believes BTC is yet to hit its peak, sharing a chart showing the absence of a peak signal, typically occurring around major market tops. Adler stated, “It appears when the combined normalized market to realized price index and 30-day/365-day value days destroyed ratio score reaches or exceeds 1. The Peak Signal only appears at major market tops, and it hasn’t shown up this time, suggesting we’re not at a peak yet.” Crypto Dan, another CryptoQuant analyst, highlighted the realized Cap-UTXO Age Bands, a metric that shows the distribution of the realized cap of a specified age cohort. According to Crypto Dan, the metric suggests that BTC still hasn’t reached an overheated state. The analyst stated, “Despite the price rising even higher, the fact that overheating has significantly decreased compared to previous short-term peaks suggests that Bitcoin could continue to break all-time highs and rise significantly in the second half of 2025, leaving strong potential for growth.” BTC traded in the red on Friday (July 4), dropping 1.41% to $108,097. The price recovered over the weekend, rising 0.19% on Saturday and 0.86% on Sunday to settle at $109,231. BTC was back in the red on Monday, dropping almost 1% to $108,273. It recovered the following day, rising 0.62% to $108,942. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as the price rose over 2% to cross $111,000 and settle at $111,255. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC rallied, increasing 3.51% and settling at $115,160. The price continued pushing higher on Friday, rising 1.50% to $116,885. Source: TradingView Despite the positive sentiment, BTC registered a marginal decline on Saturday, dropping 0.23% to $116,616. It recovered on Sunday, rising nearly 2% to cross $118,000 and settle at $118,624. BTC raced to a new all-time high on Monday, surging past $123,000 to $123,091. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $119,714, ultimately rising 0.92%. Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as traders locked in their profits. As a result, BTC plunged to a low of $115,701 before settling at $117,682. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising almost 1% and settling at $118,641. BTC fell to an intraday low of $117,389 during the current session. However, it recovered to reclaim $118,000 and move to its current level of 115,506.

What truly sets AGN apart isn’t just its cutting-edge tech stack, which is very impressive in its own rights, but the unique coinage and value-added staking logic powering its ecosystem. As blockchain adoption accelerates and the lines between digital identity, value, and behavior blur, one critical element has lagged behind: privacy infrastructure that’s actually profitable to use . AGN is stepping into that gap with a first-of-its-kind token economy that turns participation into yield, and demand into deflation. It’s privacy by design, and scarcity by architecture . Web3 Transparency Web3 promises decentralization, but the cost is often radical transparency. Wallets are doxxed. Transactions are public. DApps routinely demand full access to assets and metadata. On the Web2 side, device fingerprinting and behavior tracking have only grown more invasive. Traditional fixes like VPNs, mixers, and ad blockers are fragmented, non-interoperable, and rarely built for crypto-native users,often degrading user experience or introducing trust risks. AGN changes that by offering an integrated, decentralized privacy layer powered by AI, and turning every layer into an earning opportunity. What Makes AGN Different AGN isn’t just “a privacy token.” It’s a vertically integrated, modular stack covering: AI-powered fingerprint protection to mutate device identity Guardian Mixnet relays to hide IP addresses and traffic timing zk-DID login systems to prove credentials without leaking data Federated threat detection AI that trains locally and syncs globally A fully on-chain, gamified economy with zero pre-mining and no reserved tokens All powered by a single utility token: $AGN . Its most radical innovation is the way $AGN is created, distributed, and destroyed. Buy, Burn, Mint: A Game-Changing Coinage Protocol At the heart of AGN lies its DE Pool , a dual-channel mechanism that handles token buy-ins and redemptions via a decentralized formula. When a user buys AGN : USDT enters the DE Pool An equivalent amount of AGN in the pool is permanently burned The user receives a Minting Value-Enhancement Agreement , a smart contract that emits daily yield in $AGN Daily profit = 1% of the USDT principal , paid in $AGN Yield cap = 3× the original amount , then auto-termination Contracts are auto-triggered, no manual claim needed No inflation – all tokens are minted only when value is created This model ensures no pre-mine, no supply dump , and no central reserve . Every token originates from real participation and is backed by real economic input. Spiral Rise: Built-in Scarcity, Organic Price Pressure AGN’s DE Pool mechanics create a unique economic feedback loop dubbed the “Spiral Rise” model : When users buy AGN, old tokens are burned, and new ones are minted into personal contracts. The minting rate is fixed, but new deposits continue growing. As more users enter, USDT inflows outpace AGN emissions . This creates permanent net deflation , supporting price without artificial pumps. It’s a self-balancing economy that rewards patience and participation while penalizing manipulation or front-running. Every cycle strengthens the next, forming a natural upward trend in AGN’s value over time. Referral Rewards with Transparent Weekly Bonus Pool To expand adoption without relying on centralized marketing, AGN employs a decentralized referral bonus system : A 10% slippage fee is applied when users sell AGN. This fee goes into a publicly visible wallet , forming a bonus pool . Every 7 days, 50% of this pool is distributed to the top 50 referrers , ranked by direct referral volume. The reward split is transparent and fixed: 1st place: 5% 2nd place: 3% 3rd place: 2% Ranks 1–10: 30% shared evenly (3% each) Ranks 11–25: 30% shared evenly (2% each) Ranks 26–50: 30% shared evenly (1.2% each) The remaining 50% of the pool rolls over to the next week, ensuring consistency and momentum. DAO-Based Community Mechanics: Value + Voice AGN is governed by its DAO, not by insiders. Users who participate in minting, staking, or referrals automatically gain network influence and revenue share . Guardian Node Rewards: top earners become monthly nodes and share global network fees Voting Rights: AGN holders influence roadmap, fee structure, and treasury deployment Builder Incentives: SDKs allow third-party projects to integrate AGN privacy and earn from traffic Deflation Mechanisms: 30% of all service fees are burned 10% of mining rewards are burned Bonus pool and buyback programs increase scarcity With no central allocation or inflation, AGN aligns ecosystem growth directly with tokenholder value. AGN was designed for: Everyday crypto users who want private logins, safe browsing, and non-doxxed DeFi Referrers and promoters who want performance-based, on-chain income DeFi builders who want a seamless zk-identity SDK and privacy layer Privacy-conscious communities seeking self-learning, censorship-resistant tech The Future of Privacy Is Profitable, AND Deflationary AGN isn’t chasing trends but rather building a resilient infrastructure for the next decade of Web3, where privacy isn’t a premium – it’s a right , and participation becomes capital . No token unlocks.No supply cliffs.No insider advantage. Just real value for real users , with a deflationary spiral that makes AGN rarer, more useful, and more desirable the more it’s adopted.",Press Release,EN,0,0,USDT|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-17 15:58:12

One such standout is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising performer in the DeFi lending market, which is currently witnessing a notable surge in whale accumulation. The 5th round of Mutuum Finance presale has already sold out over 80%. It is priced at $0.03 in phase 5 and the price will spike by 16.67% in the next phase. The amount raised so far exceeds $12.5 million with over, 13500 unique token holders. While PEPE holders weigh their next move in a cooling memecoin market, large-scale investors appear to be doubling down on Mutuum Finance, drawn to its real-world financial applications and forward-looking fundamentals. PEPE Market Update: Cooling Momentum Amid Whales’ Quiet Accumulation Pepe (PEPE) is recently trading around $0.00001238, marking a subtle 0.80% uptick in the past 24 hours on the heels of whale purchases totaling approximately $2.68 million. However, broader price action tells a more nuanced story: PEPE slid about 3% on the day, fluctuating between highs of $0.00001268 and lows near $0.00001169, as heavy trader sell-offs and elevated volatility, 7.7% capped any significant rebound. Despite the pressure, on‑chain data shows investors with deep pockets are accumulating, with Ethereum‑based whale holdings rising approximately 1.4% over the past week. For those shifting focus, projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are quietly attracting attention at the tail end. Investor Enthusiasm Continues to Drive Mutuum Presale Momentum More than $12.5 million has been raised and over 13500 investors have invested in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as presale 5 soars. This shows investor confidence in the project during its early stages is increasing. MUTM is priced at $0.03 before a 16.67% spike in phase 6. Smart investors are rushing to catch this lowest price. Mutuum’s Dual Lending Approach Is Shaping the Future of DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a dual lending platform that will serve active as well as passive users of DeFi. Users will receive passive income from lending their USDT through stable passive income-generating smart contract pools providing stable passive income in the project’s Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending system. Additionally, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model permits lenders and borrowers to be as active as they like when it comes to swapping as it does not require a third party. The trend is more prevalent among customers of less secure assets. Certified by CertiK and Backed by $50K Bug Bounty for Enhanced Security Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch a stablecoin that is pegged to the USD on the Ethereum network. Besides, the project is audited by CertiK with a 95.0 trust score. This type of audit provides evidence of the readiness of the platform to become reliable and be institutional-graded transparent. Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty. The bounty will be rewarded on the basis of four levels of severity: critical, major, minor and low. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Launches $100,000 Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance values its new investors and has launched a $100,000 giveaway that will give 10 lucky winners $10,000 MUTM as a gesture of gratitude for the investors’ initial trust in the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly emerging as a whale-favored DeFi asset, with over $12.5 million raised and 13,500+ investors already on board during its fast-moving presale. As traditional meme coins like PEPE cool off, the spotlight is shifting to real-world lending platforms with long-term value. Powered by a dual lending engine, a verified CertiK audit score of 95, and enhanced by a $100,000 giveaway and $50,000 bug bounty, Mutuum is setting a new benchmark for utility and trust. Phase 6 is approaching fast, enter before it happens.

As of this report, XRP has continued its upward momentum, climbing to $3.23. Cobb’s Alert: A Signal, Not Just Emotion Known for his timely insights and sharp market instincts, Cobb’s message wasn’t mere hype; it was a calculated signal. The phrase “retirement pump” hints at something deeper than a typical rally: a potential breakout strong enough to reward long-term holders in a transformative way. This surge follows a moment earlier in the year when XRP briefly reclaimed the $3 level before pulling back. The current rally, however, appears far more sustainable, underpinned by improved technical strength and stronger macro fundamentals. WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HOLY SHIT ITS ACTUALLY TIME TO PREPARE FOR THE RETIREMENT PUMP pic.twitter.com/cshL3pt3Wz — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) July 17, 2025 Fueling the Rally: Technicals, Institutions, and On-Chain Growth Several factors are driving XRP’s bullish momentum. Technically, the token has cleared key resistance zones and is holding above the $3 mark with increasing volume and trader conviction. Whale activity and accumulation have intensified, while total wallet addresses recently soared past 7.19 million, marking an all-time high and indicating growing retail and institutional participation. On the fundamentals side, Ripple’s ongoing expansion is reinforcing investor confidence. The successful launch of its stablecoin, RLUSD, and the operational go-live of Ripple Payments Europe SA in Luxembourg have amplified its global footprint. Meanwhile, the recent launch of the UXRP ETF adds another layer of legitimacy and exposure, opening XRP to traditional markets and institutional capital. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Bigger Picture: XRP Leading the Crypto Pack While the broader crypto market shows steady recovery, XRP is currently outperforming many major assets. Bitcoin is holding above $118,500, while Ethereum trades at $3,427.50. XRP, with its nearly 10% gain in the last 24 hours, stands out not just for its price movement but for the strength and structure of its breakout. Market analysts now believe that if XRP maintains support above the $3.10–$3.20 range, the next leg up toward $3.50–$3.60 is well within reach . Some are even projecting a run toward the $4 mark, should institutional demand and trading volume continue to build. The Retirement Pump May Be Real Cobb’s call may have captured the raw emotion of the moment, but the data backs it up. XRP is not just pumping; it’s showing signs of a sustained breakout, supported by legal clarity, growing adoption, and expanding infrastructure. For long-time holders and new entrants alike, this could be a defining moment. Whether or not this truly is the “retirement pump,” one thing is clear: XRP is finally moving with force, and the market is watching.

Leading the charge is Ethereum, which has surged above the $3,450 level, marking its highest price since mid-January. The breakout signals growing confidence among bulls and is sparking renewed interest across the altcoin sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rebounds – $0–$10K Transfer Volume Turns Positive Many altcoins have posted impressive gains in recent days, bouncing sharply from their April lows. The recovery is not just isolated to top names like ETH and SOL; mid- and small-cap tokens are also showing signs of strength, supported by increasing volume and improved market structure. A key technical development is adding weight to the bullish case: the altcoin market has once again pushed above a key daily moving average. This historically significant level often marks the transition from downtrends to sustained uptrends. Altcoins Reclaim 200-Day Moving Average Altcoins are showing renewed strength, and according to top analyst On-Chain Mind, the technical landscape is beginning to shift in their favor. In a recent chart shared on X, he highlighted that the altcoin market has once again broken above its 200-day moving average, a level that historically separates bearish phases from sustained uptrends. However, On-Chain Mind cautioned that this development has occurred multiple times during this market cycle, often followed by weeks of sideways chop and volatility rather than immediate upside. Still, this time may be different. With Ethereum rallying above $3,400—its highest level since mid-January—and Bitcoin consolidating above key support zones, conditions appear more favorable for a broader altcoin breakout. What makes this moment particularly important is the price structure across many altcoins, which has turned decisively bullish after months—and in some cases, years—of deep consolidation. Tokens across sectors such as DeFi, Layer 1s, and infrastructure are forming higher lows and showing clean breakouts on higher timeframes, indicating growing demand and fresh capital rotation.

This powerful move confirms a breakout above the 50-week, 100-week, and 200-week moving averages, signaling broad-based strength across the altcoin market. One key technical milestone is the bullish crossover of the 50-week SMA above the 100-week SMA. Meanwhile, the 200-week SMA—now positioned near $880 billion—has acted as strong support during previous corrections and continues to provide a solid foundation for the current uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Strike Back After ATH: Long/Short Ratio Flips Negative Ethereum’s breakout above $3,450 has been a key driver, supported by renewed retail activity and bullish sentiment.

Ethereum Price Analysis: Can the Rally Continue Through July? The Ethereum price rally stands to continue, with a full breakout from an ascending broadening wedge pattern still unfolding. ETH / USDT 1-day chart, ascending broadening wedge. Source: TradingView, Binance. The pattern sets a local top target around $3,750, the highest level reached by Ethereum year to date, but faces tough resistance today around $3,480 as buy pressure begins to show its cracks. The RSI now sits deep in overbought territory at 82, underscoring that the prevailing trend remains firmly bullish despite the near-term friction. Still, the MACD line continues to widen its gap above the signal line, a strong sign that an uptrend is the prevailing trend despite some friction. The immediate 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level at $3,190 is the most credible support, marking a correction of 6.3% that could form a base for the next move once volatility tapers off. From there, a decisive move above $3,480 would confirm a bullish continuation toward the $3,750 target—a potential 20% climb from current levels. A further advance would place ETH on track to retest its all-time high at $4,100 and potentially enter a price discovery phase, though this likely depends on final approval of the 3 crypto bills.

According to sources, the European Commission is considering export control measures on goods worth $845 billion, equating to roughly 74 billion euros. Still, it has yet to share the list with EU member states. So far, its tariff package is set to include levies on several goods, including cars and bourbon from the US. Trump threatened to impose a 30% levy on the EU Since April, the US and EU have been engaged in trade discussions . Trump first unveiled a 20% tariff on European goods in April. He later suspended the move, cutting the rate to 10%. However, on Sunday, he declared a new 30% tariff set on the bloc to begin August 1, saying he wanted to rebalance the $235.6bn trade deficit between the EU and the US. The new levy announcement, however, resulted in French and German bonds slumping to levels last seen during the eurozone’s 2009–11 debt crisis. It also caused investors to raise concerns about the future of the $1.7 trillion transatlantic trade partnership. On Monday, the Trade EU commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, even argued that new rates would be “almost impossible to continue the trading as we are used to in a transatlantic relationship.” Before the EU negotiated for tariffs to remain at 10% and for several tariff exemptions and reductions for major exports like automobiles, the newly proposed levies have only added more complexity to the talks. So far, the American President has threatened at least 20 other trading allies with more levies, including Canada, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, and Brazil. He also warned he would set a 50% tariff on all copper imports. Sefcovic maintains they need to protect the EU economy Trump had placed a 25% levy on European steel, aluminum, and cars to reduce the nation’s reliance on metal imports and encourage domestic production. Back then, Brussels slapped retaliatory tariffs on the country of $23.8 billion worth of US goods, calling the American measures “unjustified and harmful.” However, during negotiations, the EU later put off their tariffs as a show of good faith. In April, the European Commission President, Ursula Von der Leyen, had proposed a tariff-free deal for industrial goods like cars. Still, Trump dismissed the idea as inadequate in addressing the trade deficit. To the most recent round of tariffs, Von der Leyen only urged EU members to keep negotiating with Washington. Sefcovic, however, claimed they are preparing for retaliatory tariffs in case negotiations fail before the August 1 deadline. He claimed they needed to shield the EU economy and focus on rebalancing. Nevertheless, he insisted he would do what he could to avoid a “super-negative scenario.” Brussels plans to target about 11 billion euros if negotiations break down, or roughly $13 billion worth of US aircraft and parts. Their tariffs will also extend to cars, machinery, electrical products, chemicals, fruits and vegetables, and alcoholic drinks like bourbon and rum. One person familiar with the matter claimed the commission may impose retaliatory measures on US tech companies’ products. However, the Commission’s trade policy committee still has to greenlight the tariff list before it can be implemented.

""We Want to Be the Biggest!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/nasdaq-listed-company-moves-to-create-500-million-treasure-from-unlikely-altcoin-we-want-to-be-the-biggest/,"Recently, the treasury strategy for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and altcoins has begun to accelerate. Companies are announcing multi-million dollar moves one after another, with the latest announcement coming from Bit Origin. Nasdaq-listed company Bit Origin has announced that it will raise $500 million and create a large treasury of Dogecoin (DOGE). According to the official statement, Bit Origin announced that it plans to raise $500 million, including $400 million in equity and $100 million in convertible debt, to accumulate Dogecoin as a core asset. The company has already raised $15 million and plans to use a significant portion of the proceeds for its first Dogecoin purchase. The company aims to become one of the largest public Dogecoin holders by showcasing the benefits of DOGE, its low fees, and its strong community. “Bit Origin aims to become one of the largest publicly traded Dogecoin holders. The strategy aims to create long-term value by increasing Doge per share.” Bit Origin CEO and President Jinghai Jiang said: “Bit Origin goes beyond mining infrastructure to directly participate in the value and utility of digital assets. What started as a joke has evolved into a globally liquid asset with ease of payment. Few digital assets can compete with the payment speed and community power of Dogecoin, which continues to drive adoption in peer-to-peer payments and online commerce. In an age of broken institutions, DOGE represents a shared culture of optimism and resilience that transcends current political and financial systems.” *This is not investment advice.

Per the report, Bitcoin DeFi has recorded a massive TVL surge over an 18-month period between January 2024 and July 2025. More precisely, it increased from $307 million in January 2024 to $6.5 billion by December 2024. It then settled at $6.36 billion as of early July 2025. At the time of writing, TVL stands at $7.049 billion. This would mark a whopping 2,196% rise since the December 2024 amount. Source: DeFiLlama The report noted that the surge was fueled by several key factors. These include protocol launches, novel token standards, growing institutional inflows, a rally pushing BTC to an all-time high, and the rise of liquid restaking. Moreover, Ethereum has been the undisputed DeFi leader for years now, thanks to smart contracts and a strong developer ecosystem. Yet, “the narrative is evolving,” Arch Network claims. “A new wave of builders is bringing DeFi to Bitcoin.” These developers are attracted by Bitcoin’s security, untapped liquidity, institutional interest, and increasing user demand for composable financial tools. Furthermore, Layer 1 innovations and protocols are unlocking Bitcoin’s native programmability. “Many view Bitcoin as the next DeFi frontier, set to even outpace Ethereum,” it claims. “As this momentum grows, Bitcoin’s role as a foundational layer for DeFi is becoming increasingly undeniable.” According to Arch Network CEO and co-founder, Matt Mudano, “Bitcoin’s true potential lies beyond being a passive store of value. As a $2 trillion asset, unlocking its liquidity to build a truly open and permissionless financial system on its base layer is the next frontier. Bitcoin DeFi is the greatest opportunity not only for crypto, but for financial innovation as a whole.” You may also like: Matt Mudano, CEO of Arch, on Bitcoin Momentum, Programmability on Bitcoin, and the Future of Bitcoin DeFi | Ep. 443 Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi) has seen a massive 1,971.7% rise in total value locked (TVL) over just a year and a half, according to the latest report by Arch Network.Per the report, Bitcoin DeFi has recorded a massive TVL surge over an 18-month period between January 2024 and July 2025.More precisely, it increased from $307 million in January 2024 to $6.5 billion by December 2024.

Also, 29% use BTC as DeFi collateral, 22% for bridging, 20% in Bitcoin-native DeFi, and 28% as liquidity provision. 7% aren’t actively using their coins. Moreover, among those who don’t use BTC in DeFi, 36% cited lack of trust, and 25% said risk and fear of loss. Other reasons include technical barriers (poor tooling and low liquidity), UX, and regulation. Also, 16% simply prefer to HODL. The same amount waits for better infrastructure. “Only 11% don’t see clear benefits, suggesting that most concerns can be addressed rather than indicating a lack of interest in leveraging Bitcoin more actively,” the report argues. Meanwhile, among those who use Bitcoin DeFi, there are both veterans and newcomers, the researchers found. The majority of respondents are in Asia (61%) and Africa (17%). Source: Arch Network 55% of respondents are involved in lending and borrowing protocols, while 51% are in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and 40% in stablecoins. Most builders (44%) chose Bitcoin DeFi for its security and decentralization, and 27% are in it for growing liquidity and ecosystem expansion. Other reasons include Bitcoin’s long-term vision and community (26%), the opportunity for Layer 2 innovation (20%), ecosystem growth (17%), censorship resistance (12%), and privacy (8%). However, despite its advantages, Bitcoin wasn’t built for complex smart contracts, the report notes. For 43% of the respondents, this is the main challenge. Lack of developer tools (22), poor documentation (15%), low composability (16%), and liquidity (12%) are other reasons. These show “that Bitcoin DeFi is still early.” As solutions to many of these issues, respondents named better infrastructure (45%) and broader L2 adoption (43%). Many developers also work on Ethereum (63%), Solana (47%), and Base (44%), with 60% preferring other chains for smart contract flexibility and 33% for developer tools. That said, 49% of responding developers working on other chains plan to switch fully to Bitcoin. 39% will stay multichain, and 12% haven’t decided yet.

Marshals Reveal Shocking Bitcoin Holdings",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/us-government-dump-170000-bitcoin/,"A rumor is rapidly spreading among crypto investors that the US government may have quietly sold off nearly 170,000 BTC, leaving a fraction of its assumed holdings intact. The speculation began after the US Marshals Service, in response to a FOIA request, revealed that it currently holds only 28,988 BTC valued at approximately $3.4 billion. Many crypto investors took this disclosure to mean that the federal government’s total Bitcoin reserves had declined from the long-assumed figure of around 200,000 BTC. The claim was amplified across the social media platform X, where even some public figures reacted to what appears to be a massive strategic sell-off by the US government. FOIA Request Misinterpreted The confusion of the US government selling the majority of its Bitcoin holdings appears to stem from misinterpretations of the specific holdings of the US Marshals Service with those of the entire federal government. The FOIA request that sparked the debate was submitted by journalist L0la L33tz, and it accurately reflects that the Marshals control just under 29,000 BTC. However, this only accounts for the Bitcoin under the custody of that particular agency. Related Reading: This Analyst Predicted Bitcoin’s Rally To $120,000 Months Ago, Here’s The Rest Of The Forecast On-chain data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence provides a very different picture. According to Arkham, the US government as a whole still holds approximately 198,000 BTC, worth over $23.46 billion at the current price of Bitcoin. These coins are distributed across various federal agencies and are not limited to the Marshals’ holdings. Nevertheless, the misrepresentation took hold quickly. Even US Senator Cynthia Lummis, who is a well-known advocate of Bitcoin, responded to the rumor, saying, “I’m alarmed by reports that the U.S. has sold off over 80% of its Bitcoin reserves, leaving just ~29,000 coins. If true, this is a total strategic blunder and sets the United States back years in the bitcoin race.” What If the US Quietly Sold 170,000 BTC? The repercussions on the broader crypto market would be immense if the US government had indeed sold off 170,000 BTC in secret. A sale of that scale would unleash massive selling pressure and cause a strong drop in the price of Bitcoin. This would erode confidence among investors in the wider crypto market and set off a chain reaction of liquidations across other cryptocurrencies. Such a move would not only cause technical breakdowns in price structure but also cancel out the possibility of governments around the world holding crypto as a form of strategic reserve. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Just Got Rejected From TSDT Resistance That Triggered Last Altcoin Season — Details Moreover, such a dump would directly contradict the federal policy direction set earlier this year. In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order instructing all federal agencies to transfer their Bitcoin and digital asset holdings to the US Treasury. The order formalized the creation of a Bitcoin reserve, which was meant to recognize the cryptocurrency as a national asset. In light of that policy, the notion that the US would quietly sell off the majority of its Bitcoin holdings seems highly improbable under the current Trump administration. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $118,360.

While big caps grab the spotlight, many believe true growth potential hides in smaller, lesser-known coins with innovative visions. PI, KAS, and XLM are three such contenders. PI is tapping into everyday users through mobile mining, KAS boasts high-speed blockDAG architecture for seamless transactions, and XLM continues to expand its role in cross-border payments. But BlockDAG (BDAG) is the name on everyone’s lips lately, thanks to massive presale traction and a smart referral model. Read on to discover how these projects measure up and why BDAG could be the standout among the best low cap cryptos to buy this year. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Turning Connections Into Crypto Wealth BlockDAG is proving that growing a crypto portfolio doesn’t have to mean constantly dipping into your own funds. Its referral system lets users earn 25% extra BDAG every time someone makes a purchase through their unique link, while the new buyer enjoys a 5% bonus as well. There’s no upper limit to how much can be earned, making even one referral worth thousands of dollars in BDAG rewards, which sets BlockDAG apart from other projects. Accessing this opportunity is simple. Users log into the BlockDAG Dashboard to find and share their personal referral link wherever they choose, from social channels to private conversations. Each successful referral not only increases personal BDAG holdings but also grows the wider network, helping BlockDAG secure its reputation among the best low cap cryptos to buy for those seeking community-driven potential. Meanwhile, BlockDAG’s presale has already attracted $341 million, selling over 23.9 billion coins. Although its price has surged by 2,660% from the initial batch, buyers still have a chance to secure BDAG for $0.0016 until the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11, fueling speculation that today’s referral rewards could be tomorrow’s substantial gains. 2. Pi Network (PI): Transforming Mobile Mining into Mass Adoption Pi Network (PI) has captured widespread interest by pioneering mobile crypto mining, amassing tens of millions of users who earn PI tokens from their smartphones. This strong user base could give Pi a unique edge once its mainnet goes live, potentially propelling it into the spotlight among the best low cap cryptos to buy. Anticipation is building around possible exchange listings, which could unlock significant value for early participants. Yet, Pi’s future hinges on delivering real utility. If it successfully integrates payment systems, DeFi applications, or merchant networks, its ecosystem could thrive. However, as with any low cap project, risks remain high, and investors should tread carefully while monitoring Pi’s technological and regulatory progress. 3. Kaspa (KAS): Speeding Ahead with BlockDAG Innovation Kaspa (KAS) is carving a niche as a high-speed Layer‑1 network, using a blockDAG architecture to achieve rapid transactions without sacrificing security. Its proof‑of‑work consensus can handle over 3,000 transactions per second, positioning Kaspa as a potential star among the best low cap cryptos to buy. Many miners and developers are taking note, drawn to its instant confirmation times and scalable infrastructure. Still, Kaspa remains under the radar, with limited DeFi or dApp adoption so far. Future growth depends on developers building meaningful use cases on the network. If successful, Kaspa could attract significant market attention, but it’s crucial for investors to keep an eye on ecosystem developments before making bold moves. 4. Stellar (XLM): Powering Cross-Border Payments Stellar (XLM) sits in a unique space, balancing enterprise partnerships with blockchain’s decentralised ethos. While not strictly a micro‑cap, its current valuation leaves room for growth, placing it firmly among the best low cap cryptos to buy for those seeking undervalued assets. Stellar’s network excels in cross-border payments and stablecoin issuance, fueling optimism about its potential to capture greater financial flows. Over the next year, Stellar’s expansion into remittances and collaborations with financial institutions could drive substantial price action, possibly pushing XLM closer to the $2 mark. However, stiff competition from rivals like Ripple means Stellar must continue innovating to maintain its relevance and realize its upside potential. Final Analysis PI, KAS, and XLM each bring unique strengths to the table, from PI’s vision of mobile-powered adoption to KAS’s rapid blockDAG performance and XLM’s established presence in global payments. These projects highlight how niche innovations and focused communities can drive future value, making them intriguing prospects for anyone exploring emerging crypto opportunities. But its BlockDAG’s impressive momentum that’s becoming hard to ignore. Having raised $341 million and sold over 23.9 billion coins, it’s offering a $0.0016 presale price ahead of its GLOBAL LAUNCH release. Between its generous referral system and powerful tech promises, BDAG could be the most exciting choice among the best low cap cryptos to buy right now.

33767162,[object Object],1752771646,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Ripple Makes List Of The World’s Top Fintech Companies In 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-a-worlds-top-fintech/,"Popular American-based payment company, Ripple Labs or Ripple , has made it into the headlines once again with its latest key development. The company continues to demonstrate its strong presence in the broader financial sector, reaching several significant milestones. Top 2025 Fintech Honors Go To Ripple Fintech is flourishing, and Ripple, a technology company, is at the forefront of this renewed wave. In a recent report , it was revealed that the firm has received official recognition as one of the top fintech companies in the world. The 2025 survey, which includes fintechs both big and small across seven different market segments, was carried out by CBNC and Statista. Ripple’s appearance among the 2025 top fintech companies marks a major milestone in its evolution from a blockchain-based payment network to a global financial technology leader. Furthermore, this distinguished award emphasizes the firm’s ongoing innovation in enterprise blockchain adoption, cross-border payments, and its expanding impact on the direction of digital finance . The payment company has taken to the social media platform X to celebrate this notable achievement and landmark. According to the report, this milestone marks the third consecutive year for the firm as one of the world’s top fintech companies. “We’re honored to be named one of CBNC’s World’s Top Fintech Companies for the third year in a row,” the company stated. Thus far, the company has expressed its appreciation for this recognition. Ripple stated that this milestone demonstrates our continued dedication to creating the Internet of Value and revolutionizing global financial transactions. A Shift Into The Banking Sector It is worth noting that this significant milestone comes as the firm takes a step forward into the banking landscape. “True to our long-standing compliance roots, Ripple is applying for a national bank charter from the OCC,” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated . According to the CEO, if authorized, the payment company would have federal and state oversight (through NYDFS), which would set a new and distinct standard for confidence in the stablecoin market. His statement follows the team application for a national bank license, joining the swarm of cryptocurrency businesses attempting to bridge the gap into traditional finance. In addition, the firm has applied for a Fed Master account through Standard Custody, while banks are leaning in, and Congress is moving toward clear rules and regulations. Garlinghouse highlighted that this access would give the team the ability to hold RLUSD reserves with the Federal Reserve (Fed) directly, and add another degree of protection to RLUSD’s future proof of trust.

This move has reignited speculation across the XRP community: what exactly does this whale know that the broader market doesn’t? With XRP now trading around $3.26, up more than 10% in the past 24 hours, the timing and size of this trade suggest something bigger may be on the horizon. This isn’t just a large bet; it feels like a message. And many believe it points to one thing: a potential breakthrough in the Ripple vs. SEC case. Speculation Around SEC Vote Intensifies July 17 marks a potentially pivotal date. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is holding a closed-door meeting today, and optimism is running high among XRP supporters that the Commission might finally vote to drop its appeal in the Ripple lawsuit. $15.58M $XRP Long Just Opened Whale jumped in at $3.1589 What does he know that we don’t? Settlement today? Final move before moon? This isn’t just a trade… it’s a signal. pic.twitter.com/GR2jCFiCeZ — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) July 17, 2025 This expectation follows months of legal back-and-forth. Ripple has announced its intention to withdraw its counter-appeal, leaving the SEC to decide whether to continue pressing its case. If the agency chooses to end the fight, it would bring long-awaited closure to the legal saga that has loomed over XRP since late 2020. However, as exciting as this possibility may be, industry experts urge caution. Former SEC Regional Director Marc Fagel warned that nothing is guaranteed . He emphasized that the agenda for such closed meetings is confidential and that anyone claiming to know what will happen “is making it up.” While Fagel believes the SEC will eventually dismiss its appeal, he stressed that it may not happen today, and that even if a vote is held, the official dismissal could still take weeks due to procedural filings.

Xaif’s post didn’t just highlight the whale’s trade; it asked a compelling question: “Settlement today? Final move before the moon?” That’s exactly what the XRP community is hoping for. If the SEC formally drops its appeal and brings the case to a close, it could trigger a powerful rally in XRP’s price, especially with momentum already building during Crypto Week. Whether this $15.58 million long is a brilliant prediction or a calculated risk, it has undoubtedly added fuel to the anticipation. Whales don’t move on emotion; they move on information, insight, and timing. The size and precision of this position suggest that something major may be unfolding behind the scenes. As the market waits for confirmation, one thing is clear: this isn’t just a trade, it’s a signal. And if the signal proves accurate, XRP could be on the brink of a historic breakout.

On July 17, the digital asset manager filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The filing seeks approval to launch a staked Injective (INJ) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. In the filing, the firm outlined its plans to offer investors a regulated way to gain exposure to Injective’s token while earning staking rewards. The move comes as staking-based products gain popularity. Canary Capital Eyes New Crypto Fund The proposed Canary Staked INJ ETF will track the price of Injective’s native token (INJ) and distribute staking yields. This new fund follows a growing trend of staking-based investments. It will let investors earn rewards from staking while also tracking the price of a cryptocurrency. Canary’s filing comes shortly after it created a trust in Delaware for the ETF. This process mirrors the approach taken by other firms seeking to introduce stakeholder products to the market under U.S. regulation. Although the regulatory environment remains complex, signs of progress are visible. SEC Chair Paul Atkins and Commissioner Hester Peirce have both suggested that some staking products may not fall under traditional securities laws. The SEC is currently developing guidance to clarify how such products can be approved. Growing Interest in Staking-Based ETFs Canary’s new filing comes on the heels of the launch of the REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF, the first staking ETF approved in the U.S. Meanwhile, Grayscale also received conditional approval for a crypto fund that includes staking assets. However, that decision has since been put on hold. According to Canary, this new INJ ETF is a direct response to rising demand for regulated exposure to Injective. The firm added that the fund aims to remove technical hurdles and offer a safe, compliant way for more people to participate. This is not Canary Capital’s first attempt at a staking ETF. The firm has also filed for ETFs based on Cronos (CRO), Tron (TRX), SEI, and other networks, including Pengu, Sui, Hedera, and Litecoin. Canary is not alone in targeting Injective. In Europe, asset manager 21Shares launched an Injective exchange-traded product in July. Injective Rises with EVM Support and Big-Name Backing Injective is a high-speed, Layer 1 blockchain that supports both traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) use cases. It recently added full support for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), making it more compatible with existing Ethereum-based apps. Backed by top investors such as Binance, Jump Crypto, Pantera Capital, and Mark Cuban, Injective continues to attract significant attention. At the time of writing, INJ is trading at $13.88, up by nearly 4% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.

The surge came as a wave of capital flowed into spot exchange-traded funds tied to the crypto. Nine ETH ETFs saw their largest-ever daily net inflow, totaling $726.74 million, with BlackRock’s ETHA ETF alone pulling in $499 million. This spike in ETF interest comes as part of a larger July trend. So far this month, ETH funds have attracted $2.27 billion in net inflows, the highest monthly figure since these investment vehicles launched in July 2024. This is straight-up institutional firepower. Eight of the nine funds logged positive flows for the day. Institutions stack Ether and treat it like gold Rachael Lucas, a crypto analyst at BTC Markets, said Ethereum is no longer being treated like a trading token. “Ethereum is increasingly being seen as a long-term institutional asset, not just a trading vehicle,” Rachael said. She pointed out that the ETFs now hold about 4% of Ethereum’s total market cap, a number that spells just how much capital is pouring in. She didn’t stop there. “Combine that with more than US$2.5B in daily trading volume, bullish chart setups, and capital rotation out of bitcoin, and you’ve got a breakout that’s being driven by both fundamentals and sentiment,” Rachael added. The second-largest crypto is also being stockpiled on-chain. SharpLink Gaming, which is backed by Consensys, has now overtaken the Ethereum Foundation as the largest known ETH holder. As of July 15, it controls 280,706 ETH, and it added another 20,279 ETH on Wednesday. The data was confirmed by Arkham. This is an entity moving tens of millions of dollars in ETH like it’s a normal Wednesday. Gamesquare pours over $90 million into Ethereum Elsewhere, GameSquare Holdings priced a major underwritten public offering of 46,666,667 shares at $1.50 each, raising $70 million in gross proceeds before costs. The company said it plans to use the bulk of this raise to expand its Ethereum position. That’s built into the company’s roadmap through its alliance with Dialectic, a crypto-focused capital management and yield firm. Justin Kenna, GameSquare’s CEO, made it clear. “This raise marks a pivotal milestone for GameSquare. It enables us to move with speed and scale to continue to build what we believe is one of the most ambitious Ethereum treasury strategies in the public markets. Our goal is to transform a traditional treasury function into a high-performance business vertical generating durable, recurring cash flows.” The deal includes a 15% overallotment option, which, if exercised, would increase the total raise to $80.5 million. That comes on top of another $9.2 million raised just last week. If you’re counting, that’s more than $90 million in total gross proceeds aimed directly at Ethereum. Justin said the company is targeting ETH deployments across Dialectic-engineered strategies that have historically produced 8–14% on-chain yields. He explained, “We believe this approach, combined with staking income and potential ETH appreciation, has the potential to deliver millions in annual incremental revenue. That cash flow can fund further ETH purchases and support broader growth initiatives across our platform.” He ended the statement by saying the company is staying fully committed to its Ethereum strategy and is focused on building long-term value for shareholders. Lucid Capital Markets is managing the offering as the sole book-runner. That means the entire raise, allocations, and institutional pipeline is flowing through them.

The former Fed governor, now one of Trump’s top picks to lead the central bank, didn’t dance around it during a Thursday interview on CNBC. He said the Federal Reserve needs a full-on “regime change” and slammed the people still running it, especially Jerome Powell, for what he sees as a total failure in leadership. Kevin says the Fed’s current crew lacks credibility and that their slow moves on interest rate cuts prove it. He’s not just talking about replacing Powell when his term expires in May 2026. Kevin is positioning himself as the guy who can rip up the Fed’s current playbook and build a tighter partnership with the Treasury Department. He’s echoing Trump’s constant criticism of Powell and aligning with the former president’s calls for lower rates. And he made sure to emphasize that if he’s in charge, the Fed won’t be acting on its own anymore. Kevin blames Fed officials for inflation screw-up During the interview , Kevin didn’t just go after Powell. He took a swing at the entire group of “holdover” Fed officials. “The credibility deficit lies with the incumbents that are at the Fed, in my view,” he said. Then he added, “Their hesitancy to cut rates, I think, is actually quite a mark against them.” He also backed Trump’s strategy of publicly attacking the Fed, saying it’s necessary. “So one of the reasons why the president, I think, is right to be pushing the Fed publicly is we need a regime change in the conduct of policy,” Kevin said. He’s not pretending to be neutral here. He wants Powell out, and he’s using every talking point Trump’s ever tweeted about the Fed to make his case. Kevin also didn’t brush off the White House’s other criticisms. The Trump camp has called out Powell for signing off on a pricey renovation at two of the Fed’s buildings in D.C., and Kevin didn’t bother defending him. When asked directly if Trump should fire Powell, Kevin kept it cool but firm: “I think regime change at the Fed will happen in due course.” That’s about as close to saying “yes” as you can get without actually saying it. Kevin pushes Fed-Treasury coordination to handle U.S. debt Kevin then dropped a bigger idea: bringing the Fed and Treasury into sync to deal with the country’s $36 trillion debt. Trump’s team has already said rate cuts would ease the cost of carrying that debt. Kevin went a step further, floating the idea of a new agreement between the two institutions, like the one in 1951. “We need a new Treasury-Fed accord, like we did in 1951,” Kevin said, referring to the post-war pact that separated Fed monetary decisions from Treasury’s fiscal needs. But in his view, the current situation has the two bodies working at cross purposes. “That’s the state of things now,” he said. In his ideal setup, the Fed chair and Treasury secretary would talk openly to markets and clearly outline the goals for the size of the Fed’s balance sheet. Right now, the Fed is shrinking that balance sheet by letting debt roll off without reinvesting, what’s known as quantitative tightening. Kevin said he supports the idea in general, but made it clear he thinks the Fed is doing it wrong without Treasury input. “I think the Fed has the balance wrong,” he said. “A rate cut is the beginning of the process to get the balance right.” That’s a direct swipe at Powell’s current course of action. Kevin wants the Fed to pivot—and fast. There’s a problem though. The last time the Fed cut rates, bond yields didn’t behave the way they were supposed to. Instead of dropping, Treasury yields actually went up. That throws a wrench into the argument that cuts will help ease debt costs. But of course, Kevin didn’t mention that part. Kevin has now publicly ticked every box: back Trump, call for lower rates, question Powell’s judgment, and propose a Treasury-Fed coordination. If Trump’s goal is to shake the Fed’s foundations, Kevin wants to be the guy holding the sledgehammer.

XRP was trading at $3.24, up 9.35% in the past 24 hours and more than 33% over the past week. The rapid accumulation, especially compressed into such a tight timeframe, signals intense buying interest and possibly institutional involvement. $XRP just clocked $50 MILLION in trading volume in 1 F*CKING MINUTE The bulls have lost their minds — are you even watching this?! #XRP #Crypto #Ripple pic.twitter.com/jfI8VIqz3e — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) July 17, 2025 XRP Price Rally Confirms Market Strength The current trading price of $3.24 does more than reflect short-term optimism. It indicates a broader market shift, as today’s rebound comes amid several bullish developments. A well-known analyst recently described XRP as entering an “ Ultra Bullish Region ,” citing strong momentum between $2.20 and $3.20 and pinpointing a potential breakout above $3.30. Furthermore, significant whale activity has underscored this rally. Data shows that wallets holding between 100 million and 1 billion XRP increased their holdings by 2.2 billion tokens over two weeks. This accumulation supports the notion that the volume spike shared by Xaif is more than speculative hype, and ties into a large-scale market move.

Other products, such as leveraged XRP ETFs, have outperformed expectations , and spot ETFs in some other countries have performed remarkably . Investors have been anticipating approval of similar products in the U.S. for years. With multiple pending applications , experts are confident that approval will give XRP a significant boost as institutional investment floods the market. What Comes Next for XRP XRP currently has a 24-hour volume of $14.4 billion, representing a 114.44% increase from the previous day. Looking ahead, market observers will monitor whether the current volume spike could translate to a more rally. Achieving and holding above $3.30 could open the path for new highs. Continued whale buying and institutional investment could also help XRP sustain this momentum and aim for higher targets.

Backing this momentum is a growing base of over 165,000 $FARTCOIN holders. Source: SOLSCAN Recent on-chain data reveals two whales who sold 4.76 million $FARTCOIN tokens , worth approximately $6.07 million, in exchange for over 1 billion $PUMP tokens, leading to a 10% dip in $FARTCOIN’s price and a volume spike in $PUMP. However, whales aggressively reaccumulate and control over 50% of $FARTCOIN’s 1 billion supply.

HOT AIR MUST RISE. pic.twitter.com/oogNo9cLt1 — Hydraze (@Hydraze420) July 16, 2025 While Fartcoin was created as part of the meme coin trend, blending humor with blockchain technology to engage a wide audience, its story has taken a fascinating turn. Operating on the Solana blockchain, it benefits from low transaction fees and fast processing, which are essential for large-volume meme trades. An intriguing aspect of the token’s evolution is its adoption by small businesses for payroll payments. Some employees opted to be paid in it for fun and potential upside, demonstrating $FARTCOIN’s cultural penetration beyond purely speculative trading. Some analysts believe that $FARTCOIN could be gearing up for a 100x rally, especially if it continues leveraging its unique mix of AI narrative, meme virality, and community-driven momentum. With centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Binance.US already on board and whales preparing the battleground, $FARTCOIN may be about to unleash its next explosive chapter. $FARTCOIN/$USDT—Rounded Bottom Formation With Strengthening Order Flow The price chart for $FARTCOIN on the one‑hour timeframe shows a clear journey from extended weakness into a pronounced recovery phase. Earlier in the month, the asset was stuck in a downtrend, grinding lower and finding little sustained buying interest. Not anymore. That prolonged slide eventually found a floor around the $1.10–$1.15 area, where $FARTCOIN began to show signs of stabilization and consolidation. $FARTCOIN/USDT volume footprint, July 17 (Source: TradingView) Over several days, the market formed a rounded bottom pattern, as dips became shallower, and each subsequent small rally began to hold higher than the previous one. This gradual curvature in price action is often seen as a sign that sellers are losing control and buyers are accumulating quietly in the background. As the price worked through this bottoming process, volume bars began to grow, particularly on green candles, suggesting that participation was increasing on advances. The rounded bottom became more pronounced as the price climbed past $1.25, then $1.30, and continued to hold higher lows. Once above $1.35, momentum visibly accelerated, creating a steeper trajectory that fits the dotted parabolic guide on the chart. The most recent pump pushed the price to test the $1.50 region, where current candles are consolidating just under the highs. $FARTCOIN/USDT price chart, July 17 (Source: TradingView) Supporting indicators mirror this shift in behavior in a unique way. $FARTCOIN’s RSI climbed into the mid‑60s, showing improved momentum without yet reaching extreme overbought territory, while the MACD crossed into positive territory with expanding histogram bars, reflecting a strengthening bullish bias. The four‑hour volume footprint complements this picture by revealing the order‑flow dynamics behind the move. Large positive deltas, such as 5.15 million and 3.63 million, show buyers have been stepping in aggressively during upward drives, outmatching selling pressure on those intervals. Even during periods of consolidation, footprint bars maintain a slight positive tilt, indicating that dips are being absorbed rather than heavily sold into. Although some red delta clusters appear, such as – 913.76k, they have so far been followed by swift recoveries, suggesting that sellers are unable to sustain control. The price chart tells the story of a market that transitioned from weakness into a rounded bottom and has now shifted into a rising trend with solid momentum. The footprint data supports the idea that buying interest is real and sustained, with order flow leaning positive on each push. If $FARTCOIN can break and hold above the $1.52–$1.53 resistance zone with continued strong buy imbalances, the path opens toward further upside. However, a failure to defend support around $1.45 could invite a deeper pullback into the $1.38–$1.40 accumulation area before another attempt higher.

Retail participation remains muted, as seen in declining spot exchange volumes and high Bitcoin dominance, suggesting we’re still early in the bull cycle. BITB offers asymmetric upside, providing direct exposure to Bitcoin’s spot price with institutional tailwinds now and retail momentum still to come. It's been ~18 months since the spot Bitcoin ETFs began trading, and at this juncture, most investors have moved beyond the granular details in their preference for a specific ETF to gain direct exposure to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). The ETFs all offer similar structure and tracking accuracy, save for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), which has maintained a higher 1.5% expense ratio. We're also now past the early marketing incentives, like the six-month fee waiver on some of the ETFs. Personally, I favor the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (NYSEARCA: BITB ) as my preferred vehicle because of the fund’s alignment with the broader Bitcoin development ethos; they donate 10% of their profits to open-source Bitcoin development. Bitwise was also the first fund manager to publish the Bitcoin addresses for its ETF holdings. Investors can track the inflows and outflows of the actual BTC in the fund in real-time, using the addresses. This week, Bitwise retired the approach of verifying the ETF's BTC holdings via the published addresses and has introduced a more robust and institutional-grade framework for verifying the fund’s on-chain reserves and financial integrity through a third-party proof-of-reserves system, verified daily by a U.S.-based licensed CPA firm. Instead of just listing on-chain BTC holdings, this new verification method reconciles on-chain holdings with the ETFs' outstanding shares and will soon include CPA-attested reports that verify both assets and liabilities, thereby delivering a more comprehensive and investor-friendly form of transparency. Think of this in a similar vein to the independent audit performed on companies prior to a 10-Q or 10-K filing, but the scope here is limited to on-chain digital asset balances and ETF share liabilities. And the verification happens daily. With the latest updates on BITB and their proof-of-reserves verification already mentioned, the truth is, there’s not much left to say about the structure of spot Bitcoin ETFs themselves that hasn't already been covered by analysts here on Seeking Alpha. The products are now largely standardized - same underlying asset, similar tracking, fees narrowing, and with early incentives fading. I believe the questions now on most investors' minds would be whether Bitcoin's momentum sustains, navigating macro headwinds and their potential impact on Bitcoin and its related assets, and the profit-taking strategies at BTC's all-time highs. For most investors, it is now much less about which specific spot Bitcoin ETF to choose and more about how the underlying asset performs and how to position to maximize returns. BITB vs BTC price trend on a YTD basis (Seeking Alpha) With the spot Bitcoin ETFs' underlying asset, Bitcoin, showing momentum lately, the ETFs have naturally followed the price action of Bitcoin. The spot Bitcoin ETFs themselves have been an immense catalyst that has made Bitcoin more mainstream this past year, and recently broke a new all-time high just above $121,000 . Since the April Liberation Day tariffs sell-offs when BTC dipped below $80,000, the spot Bitcoin ETFs have added over $6 billion in inflows. The spot ETFs now hold a total of ~1.28 million BTC or about 6% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply, bringing total assets under management [AuM] for the total ETFs to a staggering $154 billion (as of July 17, 2025). Since the launch of the spot ETFs, Bitcoin has seen accelerated comebacks after every price dip. Every dip has been followed by an uptrend that breaks the previous all-time high; basically, higher highs and higher lows. TheBlock The interest in the spot Bitcoin ETFs has been increasingly institutional - the trade volumes of the spot Bitcoin ETFs and the increasing adoption of Bitcoin treasury strategy among publicly-traded companies prove this institutional interest. The cumulative trade volume since the spot Bitcoin ETF launched now surpasses $1 trillion (shown in the preceding chart). And for the first half of this year, spot Bitcoin ETFs nearly matched about 40% of the net inflows into physically backed gold ETFs. Which is impressive, considering the spot Bitcoin ETFs launched less than two years ago. Physically-backed gold ETFs recorded $38 billion in inflows in H1, while the physically-backed Bitcoin ETFs (ditto the spot Bitcoin ETFs) have seen $14.83 billion in net inflows so far this year, already flipping its own 2024’s net inflows (see the chart below). As both the gold and the Bitcoin flows data show, digital gold (Bitcoin) is gaining ground and competing strongly with physical gold. 2024 cumulative net inflows vs 2025 YTD cumulative net inflows (CryptoQuant) Having highlighted these data points that show Bitcoin’s institutional appeal and structural maturity as a mainstream asset, let's go back to the more pressing question for most retail investors at the moment, who make up a great number of the readership here and for the broader retail cohort: how much longer can BTC’s momentum sustain before retail FOMO kicks in and accelerates price discovery even further? I believe retail participation has always been pivotal for the peak of Bitcoin market cycles, as retail trades typically make up much of the final wave of market momentum, before an inevitable drawdown or price correction. In the current cycle, the late-stage retail buyers (the so-called “dumb money”) have mostly been sidelined so far (as I’ll show from some data), and this absence of broader retail euphoria suggests that the final leg of the bull run is still ahead. I think it is too early to call a cycle top. In Bitcoin’s cycles, historically, retail FOMO tends to accelerate price discovery dramatically toward the cycle top. Therefore, positioning before this general retail FOMO has always been one of the most effective strategies to capture outsized gains from Bitcoin bull markets. How Has Retail Been Sidelined in the Current Bitcoin Market Cycle In the past, the price trend of Bitcoin has closely mirrored the volume trend of retail trades on crypto exchanges. That price/volume relationship has been noticeably weaker since the launch of the spot Bitcoin ETFs. Notice from the chart below, how since early 2024 (time of the spot ETFs launch), Bitcoin price has decoupled from retail-driven BTC trade volume on crypto exchanges. And it has been more pronounced lately: as BTC rose above $100k, retail volume took an inverse trajectory (as seen in the chart below). Bitcoin price vs spot volume trend (Bitcoinity) Meanwhile, the spot ETF flows and volume have been directly influencing the Bitcoin spot price. As shown in the next chart, there's a clear visual correlation between periods of sustained positive inflows (green bars) and rising Bitcoin prices and periods of sustained outflows (red bars) and falling Bitcoin prices. Bitcoin price vs spot ETFs new flows (SoSoValue) Now, the essence of these two comparisons in this piece—showing waning retail activity vs. BTC price correlation with the spot ETF flows—is to highlight the thesis that the market still has room to run. The next big question is timing when retail re-enters in full force. I’d say there is no analysis that would definitely pinpoint that timing, but based on historical patterns and market psychology, retail typically piles in late in a bull cycle—once price is already well into price discovery, then the media is flooded with back-to-back headlines of fresh all-time high price (the “Bitcoin is going to $1 million” type frenzy), and anecdotal FOMO is everywhere. The current sentiment backdrop hasn't shown any of these yet. The spot volumes on crypto exchanges I already mentioned and Google Trends data for Bitcoin search terms suggest retail is still sidelined. Further on-chain data shows that the retail trade hasn't been going into altcoins either, as some investors may speculate; Bitcoin dominance still remains elevated above 62%. Even Ethereum's ( ETH-USD ) surge over $3,000 since Tuesday (July 15) has been primarily linked to institutional flows into the spot Ethereum ETFs. The spot Ethereum ETFs saw record daily net inflows of ~$726 million . Bitcoin dominance (TradingView) My goal in this piece is to make investors understand that the retail frenzy, which typically marks the later stages of a crypto bull cycle, hasn’t arrived yet (as data shown throughout this article has shown). This means Bitcoin still likely has room to run, especially if this early momentum driven by institutional flows continues and draws more attention from mainstream media, thereby giving retail that psychological green light for an entry. Until then, institutional capital will keep driving the trend. But when retail does finally flood in, history suggests it won’t be a subtle entry; it’ll most likely come with euphoric headlines, parabolic price moves, and a FOMO that feeds on itself. We’re not there yet, and that’s exactly where the opportunity lies. Investors should bear in mind that the spot Bitcoin ETFs’ share prices are directly impacted by the underlying Bitcoin spot price, and with Bitcoin being an inherently volatile asset, the spot ETF shares also carry significant potential for volatility. In the near term, let’s not forget the potential for a tariff-driven macro shakeup as the August 1 deadline for President Trump’s reciprocal trade tariffs draws closer. I'll close this piece with this simile: the Bitcoin bull market is like a twin-engine jet. At the moment, it’s flying on just one engine, which is institutional flows. The other engine—retail participation—hasn't powered on yet. But when it does, that’s when things really take off.",BTC-USD|GBTC|BITB,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-07-17 17:16:53

On July 17, Bitcoin traded between $117,506 and $119,244, showing low volume and no breakout. HYPE closed at $46.11 after failing to hold above $47, with visible intraday rejection on the daily chart. James Wynn made $473,900 in one day by shorting BTC and HYPE on Hyperliquid, according to on-chain data published by Lookonchain.

The successful pivot shows a nimble trading strategy that capitalized on a stalling market momentum. James Wynn’s Winning Trade According to Lookonchain, Wynn used 40× leverage on BTC and 10× leverage on his HYPE short on the derivatives platform Hyperliquid. The trades were executed and closed within a 24-hour window. This move came just two days after Wynn deposited $467,999 into Hyperliquid, which enabled the short positions.

According to Arkham Intelligence data, the value of Bitcoins in wallets thought to belong to Nakamoto has surpassed that of Microsoft founder Bill Gates ($117 billion) and Dell Technologies founder Michael Dell ($126.5 billion), with the BTC price increasing by 14 percent in the last month. Calculated at Bitcoin's current price of $118,912, this wealth puts Satoshi just $12 billion behind Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett, who has long been known for his critical stance against Bitcoin. Buffett's net worth, according to Forbes, is $141 billion. If Bitcoin rises by about 8 percent to $128,650, Satoshi will surpass Buffett. Related News: BREAKING NEWS: The US Government Allegedly Holds Far Fewer Bitcoins Than Estimated - Big if True In a 2022 statement, Buffett described Bitcoin as “rat poison” and said he wouldn't buy all the Bitcoins, even for $25. Since then, Bitcoin's value has increased by 204%. While the exact amount of Bitcoin owned by Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown, a widely accepted analysis is known as the “Patoshi Pattern.” The consistent activity of a single miner observed in early Bitcoin blocks suggests that Satoshi mined approximately 22,000 blocks. This analysis suggests that Nakamoto may have approximately 1.1 million BTC. Arkham Intelligence's estimate of 1.09 million BTC also aligns with this approach. Satoshi's true identity remains unknown. An HBO documentary released last fall suggested that Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd might be Satoshi, but Todd and many viewers dismissed this theory. Similarly, early Bitcoin contributors Adam Back and Hal Finney have also been cited, but both have denied these claims. Tech giants like Elon Musk have also been suggested as Satoshi, but his identity remains unclear. *This is not investment advice.

Our Pepe price prediction for 2025 is a maximum price of $0.000035 In 2030, we expect the Pepe price to touch $0.0258. The meme coin sector momentarily slowed down, hinting at a potential rally if the broader market stabilizes after its recent downturn. Specifically, PEPE coin prices display a bullish pattern, presenting an opportunity for a breakout based on the daily chart analysis. Moreover, the volatility of meme coins is exacerbated by the prevailing market uncertainty.

The hourly price chart confirms that Pepe attempts to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a further recovery rally in the coming hours. If Pepe’s price holds momentum above $0.00001401, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.00001606. Pep eusd Chart By TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.00001164, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00000905. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe down today? Pepe’s price gained minor selling pressure after sellers gained control. This triggered strong selling pressure toward $0.000013. Will Pepe Recover? If buyers hold the price above the $0.00001 level strongly, we might see further upward rally in the Pepe price chart. What is Pepe price prediction for 2025? The Pepe price prediction for 2025 expects the meme coin to record a maximum level of $0.000035. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040. Recent news A whale moved 500 billion $PEPE worth $3.85M to Binance after facing a huge $450,000 loss for holding $PEPE for 40 days. PEPE Price Prediction July 2025 If BTC price records robust surges this month, we might see PEPE price skyrocketing. We expect the PEPE price to record minimum and maximum prices of $0.000008 and $0.000017, respectively. The average price might be around $0.000011. Month Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) July 2025 0.000008 0.000011 0.000017 Pepe price prediction 2025 The Pepe roadmap is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. Despite its robust community, this lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2025 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. In 2025, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000005. It may peak at a maximum value of $0.000035, with an average trading price of $0.000027 throughout the year.

For instance, Shiba Inu is developing Shibarium, a layer-two scaling solution on Ethereum , alongside various protocols and tools for its community.

The records revealed several outgoing transactions from Larsen’s wallet to Coinbase, totaling over 8 million XRP on July 15. Larsen’s wallet activity comes against the backdrop of an XRP surge, which has gone up by roughly 50% this month, reaching $3.25, just 4.4% shy of its all-time high of $3.40 set in January 2018, according to Coingecko. Jed Larsen moves 9.6M XRP to Coinbase and external wallets Per the blockchain explorer, the first transfer to Coinbase occurred at 14:44 UTC, with 1.6 million XRP sent from Larsen’s wallet. This was immediately followed by a second transaction at 14:46 UTC, involving an additional 2 million XRP. Both transactions were sent to the same Coinbase destination tag: 371918471. Transactions on Larsen’s wallet. Source: xrpscan.com Minutes later, at 14:49 UTC, two more identical payments were made. One transaction sent 2 million XRP to Coinbase, then another 2 million XRP, again using the same destination tag. In total, Larsen transferred 7.6 million XRP to Coinbase within a five-minute window on July 15. That same day, at 14:50 UTC, another outgoing payment of 1 million XRP was made to a wallet identified as rNLrQvgfLZNL…, which could be a fund movement to a secondary or auxiliary wallet, not an exchange. Another 1 million XRP payment followed at 14:51 UTC, directed to the wallet rhmkfhYZY3XJ…, most likely a non-exchange address. The most recent transaction occurred on July 17, 2025, at 04:17 UTC, but this was an inbound payment of 0.000038 XRP to Larsen’s wallet from address rBuTRUFGt9M…, a negligible amount that could have been testing out system transactions. The four outgoing transactions to Coinbase account for the bulk of the movement, totaling 7.6 million XRP, while an additional 2 million XRP was dispersed to external wallets. So far, none of the tokens have been sold, but market watchers believe the Ripple co-founder could be cashing in on his gains in the green market run. Chris Larsen, a person of interest in the XRP community Larsen co-founded Ripple in 2013 to enable blockchain-based cross-border payments, and then stepped down as CEO in 2016 for Brad Garlinghouse. He is still the company’s executive chairman. The 65-year-old’s crypto wallet , as tracked by XRPscan, now holds approximately 332,499,979.29 XRP, valued at about $1.08 billion. On January 30, ZachXBT posted his findings on X, showing that wallets linked to Larsen had transferred over $109 million worth of XRP to Coinbase, Bitstamp, and Bybit in January alone. In total, wallets attributed to Larsen have moved 106 million XRP since the beginning of the year, now worth an estimated $344 million. Well I guess it’s a good thing no stalks XRP transfers from wallets tied to the founders/foundation. $109M+ sent to exchanges (Coinbase, Bitstamp, Bybit) just this month from rhREXV which was activated by Chris Larsen. rhREXVHV938ToGkdJQ9NCYEY4x8kSEtjna — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) January 30, 2025 In the same month, Larsen became a point of discussion when he confirmed that his personal XRP accounts had been compromised in a security breach. His statement came shortly after ZachXBT alleged that 213 million XRP, then worth roughly $112.5 million, had been stolen from wallets linked to Larsen in 2024. According to ZachXBT, Larsen had stored his private wallet keys using LastPass, leading to the loss of around $150 million in XRP. Forbes estimates his current net worth at $10 billion, up from $3.2 billion in 2024. Meanwhile, XRP has entered a steep upward trajectory after breaking out of a prolonged consolidation phase. “The surge has positioned the price inside the upper half of the channel, with strong momentum driving toward the 3.40–3.55 target zone,” she wrote on X. The current price is the asset’s strongest performance since the 2018 bull run.

This has fueled speculation of an impending multi-billion-dollar sell-off. According to on-chain analyst Lookonchain, nearly half of the whale’s 80,000 BTC (worth over $4.7 billion at current prices) was moved into new wallets recently. The abrupt action has spooked traders, especially with Bitcoin’s recent price strength above $123,000. $4.7B in BTC Transferred Between Wallets The whale began transferring with a 9,000 BTC transaction—approximately $1.06 billion—to wallets linked with Galaxy Digital. Shortly after, 7,823 BTC (around $927 million) was sent next. Then the mass migration occurred: 40,009 BTC—worth $4.68 billion—was dispersed into new wallet addresses. Though some analysts theorize the activity may represent internal restructurings or security precautions, the destinations suggest another possibility. Hints of a Potential Sell-Off? The transfers to Galaxy Digital were just the beginning. On-chain metrics show the firm moved 6,000 BTC ($706 million) to major exchanges like Binance and Bybit—a strong indication that some of the coins may be about to hit the market. Whales sell at tops, and with Bitcoin changing hands for approximately $118,200, traders are on high alert. Should all 40,000 BTC find its way to exchanges, it could lead to high short-term volatility. More Dormant Wallets Stir This whale isn’t alone. A different long-dormant wallet transferred 1,042 BTC ($122.5 million) earlier today after being inactive for six years. Purchased when Bitcoin was trading at just $8,746, the stash was worth less than $10 million initially. The heightened activity among older wallets aligns with Bitcoin flirting with new highs.

The company, formerly known as China Xiangtai Food Co., Ltd, could become the first publicly traded holder of Dogecoin. According to a press statement released on Thursday, finance for the Dogecoin treasury will come from sale of up to $400 million in Class A ordinary shares and an additional $100 million in convertible debt. Bit Origin has already closed $15 million under the debt facility, funds it intends to use for its initial Dogecoin acquisitions. The financing was overseen by Chardan, the official placement agent, and is backed by ATW Partners. Bit Origin provided more information on the transaction in a regulatory Form 6-K filing dated July 17. According to CoinGecko, Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at $0.2113, a 3.2% increase over the past 24 hours, and a 14.9% uptick in the last seven days. The coin has surged past a descending triangle formation on the 3-day chart. Bit Origin takes strides towards Dogecoin Jinghai Jiang, Chairman and CEO of Bit Origin, called the treasury initiative a “transformation” in the company’s business model. He mentioned that the company is adding a crypto treasury on top of its mining activities to become more involved in the digital asset market. “ Bit Origin is evolving beyond mining infrastructure to engage directly in the value and utility of digital assets, ” Jiang said in a statement. “ What started as a joke has evolved into a globally liquid asset with payments utility. ” Bit Origin’s newly announced Doge-focused roadmap includes asset accumulation and more interactions with the Dogecoin ecosystem. The company could use the treasury to service miners, develop payment applications, and pursue other Doge-based operations with long-term shareholder value. “ We hope Doge’s performance and community make it a natural fit for X Money, ” said Jiang. “ DOGE embodies a shared culture of optimism and resilience that transcends existing political and financial systems .” The company is also launching a Doge-per-share performance metric. According to its documents, the treasury value will increase over time, where shareholders will be holding stakes pegged to the token’s performance. Company regains Nasdaq compliance On July 1, 2025, Bit Origin released a statement saying it had regained compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum equity requirement. This followed a previous warning from Nasdaq issued on January 3, 2025, citing deficiencies in the company’s stockholder equity levels. In response to the warning, Bit Origin submitted a compliance plan and by June 30 had demonstrated the necessary improvements. As a result, Nasdaq confirmed the company’s return to compliance with listing standards. Still, Nasdaq said that the company is still “under monitoring,” and any future failures could result in delisting proceedings. In that event, the company would retain the right to appeal the decision before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel. “ We are pleased to have regained compliance with Nasdaq’s equity standard ,” said CEO Jiang. “ We are focused on building long-term growth and fulfilling compliance with all listing requirements .” Dogecoin analysts have spotted a breakout verified by a strong candle close above two technical indicators, the 50-day Simple Moving Average at $0.1859 and the 200-day SMA at $0.1774.

The self-driving software can drive a car in normal traffic conditions and optimal weather conditions without human intervention. The autonomous software company has begun testing the prototype vehicle at its Las Vegas proving grounds. Nuro said the collaboration forms a plan for the robotaxi program that will be manageable and scalable in a commercial setup. The collaboration aligns with Uber’s goal to become the leader in electric and autonomous vehicles of all kinds. Uber revealed that it plans to use its financial muscle to support the expansion of autonomous vehicles worldwide. Uber has partnered with more than 18 global autonomous vehicle, delivery, and trucking companies. This year alone, it partnered with Michigan’s Ann Arbor, Mobility Volkswagen, and the Chinese self-driving companies Momenta, WeRide, and Baidu.

Uber will host the Lucid Gravity SUV, which has an estimated 450-mile EPA range. The SUV is expected to reduce charging downtime, improve vehicle availability, and reduce operating costs. Uber is expected to price the Gravity SUV in the upper tier, just like Uber Black. Lucid produced 3,309 EVs in Q2 2025, with the Air luxury Sedan going from $69,900 and the Gravity SUV starting at $79,900. Marc Winterhoff, interim CEO at Lucid, revealed that Uber’s investment confirms Lucid as a fully redundant zonal architecture capable of delivering ideal self-driving vehicles. He added that the collaboration allows Lucid to compete in a new market that has yet to be tapped. Tesla’s autonomous cars fall under the level 2 category, requiring human intervention at the wheel. The EV company, owned by Elon Musk , began testing its robotaxis in Austin in June. It has a few robotaxis in Austin; the rest are still in beta, including the self-driving trucks, which posed problems initially. According to Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, self-driving cars have the potential to improve American cities. The CEO was happy to team up with Lucid and Nuro, which he believes will bring Uber’s self-driving vision to more people worldwide.

Pakistan plans a national Bitcoin reserve and regulatory body for oversight. El Salvador maintains active Bitcoin purchases under an IMF deal. Pakistan and El Salvador have initiated formal diplomatic ties centered on cryptocurrency cooperation, according to a report published by Bloomberg . The partnership follows a meeting in San Salvador between Bilal Bin Saqib, special assistant to Pakistan’s prime minister on crypto and blockchain, and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele. Pakistan and El Salvador Partner for Digital Assets The discussions focused on knowledge-sharing in digital asset infrastructure and policy, while Pakistan plans to structure its crypto markets under regulatory oversight. Pakistan recently allocated 2,000 megawatts for Bitcoin mining and intends to establish a national Bitcoin reserve. The government previously launched the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) to oversee the domestic digital asset market. Pakistan creates digital assets regulator PVARA to oversee crypto industry with @cz_binance and @saylor as strategic advisors amid massive 40M users and $300B annual trading volume. #Pakistan #Crypto https://t.co/sGm3VPdu1M — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 8, 2025 Earlier this year, Saqib stated that up to 20 million Pakistanis currently hold crypto, despite ongoing caution from the country’s central bank. El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021 and continues to acquire the asset while under an International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreement. According to government figures, the country holds 6,238 Bitcoins. Tether also opened a headquarters there in January. Bitcoin Acquisition vs IMF Agreement Pakistan is currently under a $7 billion IMF program that runs through 2027. The fund has expressed concerns about state-level digital asset purchases, but El Salvador has continued its policy regardless of the terms. “Bitcoin keeps being an important project,” said El Salvador’s economy minister , Maria Luisa Hayem, when the government purchased seven Bitcoins despite the agreement with the IMF. “There is an asset accumulation that we’re seeing from the government perspective, from the private sector perspective.” By forming bilateral channels focused on infrastructure and governance, countries under IMF influence may seek greater autonomy in structuring digital asset policies without triggering compliance issues or threatening macroeconomic stability. Other emerging economies with large unbanked populations are also exploring sovereign digital asset programs, seeking to reduce reliance on foreign exchange reserves and expand financial access without altering core monetary frameworks. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Could this agreement lead to joint mining or shared infrastructure between Pakistan and El Salvador? While not disclosed in current statements, both countries are actively investing in Bitcoin mining. Future collaboration could include technology transfer, operational partnerships, or coordinated infrastructure planning if aligned under bilateral frameworks. How does Pakistan’s crypto stance compare with other IMF program countries? Most IMF-supported nations have either restricted or delayed digital asset integration. Pakistan’s move to create a national reserve and regulatory authority places it ahead in formal crypto adoption among peers under similar fiscal supervision. What challenges might Pakistan face in implementing a national Bitcoin reserve? Potential obstacles include central bank resistance, volatility management, custodial infrastructure, and compliance with existing IMF conditions. Legal clarity on asset classification and secure storage mechanisms will also be essential.

Despite gaining 6.28% in the past 24 hours and breaking past the $0.21 resistance zone, there’s an ongoing battle between bulls and bears at the $0.23 level. Analysts tracking the DOGE/USD pair have spotted a weakening support around the $0.20 level, a price mark that, if broken, could trigger a correction on the downside. Yet, while Dogecoin fights to keep its momentum alongside the rest of the crypto market, a new token, Pepeto, has become the talk of the community with its structured and utility-driven ecosystem. A verified and audited infrastructure, coupled with massive staking rewards could help Pepeto become the next 100x memecoin this crypto summer. Dogecoin Strong Display Precedes Tense Performance Dogecoin has seen a modest recovery, trading at $0.2121 on July 17 after bouncing from a low of $0.1880. The doge-themed memecoin crossed the $0.2120 and touched highs near $0.2205 before shedding some of its short-term gains. According to TradingView, the coin is changing hands above the 100-hourly simple moving average, with price support forming around $0.2060. Technical indicators show a shaky uptrend, but the risk of downside persists if bulls fail to protect the support level. Dogecoin’s market cap is roughly $31.8 billion, and its 24-hour trading volume is $3.36 billion. Without any price catalysts or infrastructure upgrades, DOGE may continue to rely on trading volume and has no guaranteed growth in the long term. Pepeto Steals DOGE Investors With Price Potential Pepeto is introducing functional value to the meme coin market, something that tokens like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE have failed to do. According to its whitepaper, Pepeto stands for Power, Energy, Precision, Efficiency, Technology, and Optimization. These six pillars are baked directly into its development roadmap and will guide investors towards a project that is more than its price. Already, 31 trillion Pepeto tokens, roughly 7% of the total supply, have been staked. Stakers are set to receive an estimated 269% annual return, equivalent to about 22% monthly. The project’s staking rewards are distributed at a fixed rate of 32,015,981.73 PEPETO per Ethereum block and are scheduled to roll out over two years. On July 15, Pepeto’s official X account confirmed that the project’s website is “smoother, stronger, and fully ready for what’s next.” That update is against the backdrop of news that the Pepeto team had completed additional audits, finalized a bridge and exchange demo, and received approval for its licensing. Auditors have issued a full verification of the team’s business operations and documentation, and Pepeto’s ecosystem has been confirmed as 100% legitimate.

We rise together my brothers and sisters.” The post, shared on X, was more than a price prediction, it was a call to arms for the XRP Army, a loyal global network of XRP holders who have stood firm through market volatility and regulatory headwinds. At the time of Bitlord’s post, XRP was trading at $3.19. As of this report, it has already advanced to $3.25, adding fuel to what many now believe could be a sustained upward breakout. The Rally Gains Real Momentum XRP’s resurgence is not merely speculative, it’s rooted in a solid technical and market foundation. The token had briefly touched the $3 mark earlier this year before pulling back, but its return above this level in recent days, and the current climb to $3.25, signals a shift in market structure. The asset is showing resilience, carving higher highs and holding key support zones, suggesting buyers are firmly in control. Nothing's stopping $XRP now… -We waited our whole lives for this pump. $100 will be our new standard. We rise together my brothers and sisters #XRPARMY who's in? pic.twitter.com/uzwkvH1y5k — Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7) July 17, 2025 This rally follows weeks of steady accumulation and increasing investor confidence, especially after Ripple and the SEC reached a procedural impasse, leaving room for further appeal developments but removing immediate legal overhang. With regulatory uncertainties gradually lifting, XRP is now being reevaluated not just as a digital asset, but as a serious infrastructure play in global finance. The market appears to be responding in kind, with XRP outperforming many altcoins and attracting new trading volume across major exchanges. Can $100 Really Become the New Standard? Crypto Bitlord’s $100 projection has stirred debate within the crypto space. While the figure may seem far-fetched, especially given that XRP’s all-time high is still under $4, it represents more than just a numerical milestone. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 For long-term believers, it reflects a vision of XRP becoming integral to global payment systems, central bank interoperability, and institutional-grade liquidity solutions. In that context, $100 becomes not just a price target, but a symbol of XRP’s ultimate utility and recognition. Even so, analysts have urged caution, noting that a move to $100 would imply a multi-trillion-dollar valuation, territory no digital asset has ever sustained. However, the crypto market has a history of exceeding expectations, and XRP’s current momentum is creating space for bullish long-term speculation, even if such levels remain aspirational for now. XRP Army Rallies Behind the Vision Beyond price action, what stands out most in this moment is the energy surging through the XRP community. The XRP Army has long endured periods of suppression, both market-driven and regulatory, but with the current uptrend gaining traction, many believe their patience is finally being rewarded. The price action has become a rallying point, with influencers, analysts, and retail traders uniting behind the belief that XRP is ready to fulfill its long-awaited potential. As XRP trades firmly at $3.25 and continues to post strong performance in a rebounding altcoin market, Crypto Bitlord’s statement is resonating louder than ever. His message isn’t just about numbers, it’s about conviction, timing, and belief in what XRP can become. And for now, as the charts trend higher and community sentiment intensifies, it’s hard to argue with his words: nothing seems to be stopping XRP.

Zachary Gollan from Sydney has already inked the word on his arm 415 times as of Thursday morning. Known on social media platform X as Donnie Darko, Gollan has been livestreaming his tattoo sessions to prove his plot to break the current world record of 667 tattoos of the same name.

Owens clinched the feat in 2022 after briefly losing it for five years. Tattoo removalist searches for record in full-time streaming Gollan’s marathon inking session is scheduled to culminate in a livestream on Saturday, where he plans to complete all 700 tattoos to go beyond the standing record. He says he has submitted an application to Guinness World Records to have the feat officially recognized. The 27-year-old is on the precipice of changing his career to a full-time tattoo content creator and internet personality. Currently working as a full-time removalist, he hopes to build his own livestreaming tattoo sessions, specifically for the crypto community.

Since then, he has been streaming daily while tattooing himself. Pumpink/SOL chart.

Pump.fun gets ink recognition The Sydney-based former tattoo artist claims that his decision to tattoo Pump.fun was intentionally meant to “draw attention to the launchpad” and his personal brand. He believes the repetitive inkings are a conversation starter and a subtle form of viral marketing , even in unexpected situations. “ Say I’m in the hospital and I get a blood test, the nurses will see the tattoos, and even if they don’t ask, their curiosity will wonder why I have Pump.fun hundreds of times on my arm ,” he surmised. “ Same with if I got arrested, the police will see and ask, or just go home and search .” The tattoos, he explained, will prompt people to Google the name, even if they never speak to him directly. Gollan was previously affiliated with a biker gang that is now classified as a criminal organization under Australian law . As a result, current licensing laws restrict individuals with those ties from owning or operating tattoo studios. That restriction forced him to leave the professional industry and find work elsewhere, including truck driving and now removals. Gollan is preparing to break more records. He promised to continue the livestream format under the PUMPINK banner and look for more tattoo-related world records. His next targets include tattooing the most hashtags on the body, specifically using #PUMPINK, or the most tattoos of the same cartoon character, likely tied to a meme coin or NFT collection. “ I want to try to break at least five or six records before the end of the year, ” he stated.

In a new thread, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 141,000 followers on the social media platform X that XRP may have an explosive move as the payments altcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) metric is forming a golden cross. The last time the signal flashed bullish was in November 2024, when XRP exploded by triple percentage points. The MVRV metric gauges the market’s sentiment and valuation of a crypto asset. A golden cross occurs when the MVRV metric crosses above its 200-day moving average, signaling long-term bullish momentum. “The last time the MVRV ratio flashed a golden cross, XRP soared 630%. That signal just appeared again.” Source: Ali Martinez/X A 630% increase from XRP’s current value would put the token at more than $20. The analyst previously said XRP is primed to print new all-time highs, setting his initial target to the upside at $4.80. “XRP is screaming all-time highs. Are you seeing this? XRP is testing the top of the channel at $3. A weekly close above the $3 resistance could trigger a breakout to $4.80.” The analyst also says that crypto whales are accumulating massive amounts of the payment token. “Whales have bought 2.20 billion XRP in the last two weeks!” Source: Ali Martinez/X XRP is trading for $3.25 at time of writing, up 8.8% in the last 24 hours.

The Dogecoin’s Futures Open Interest (OI) has surged to the highest level since early February 2025 of about $3.19 billion, signaling a renewed interest from speculative traders. The Dogecoin’s funding rate has also recorded an increased positive growth, whereby the average daily funding rate is higher than the second week of May, which resulted in an upsurge towards 25 cents. Historically, positive funding rates are associated with bullish sentiment and vice versa. Institutional Investors Adopt Dogecoin The Dogecoin network has remained unrivaled by the emergence of thousands of memecoins in the past years. The unwavering support Dogecoin gets from tech billionaire Elon Musk has helped the memecoin attract the attention of more institutional investors. As Coinpedia previously reported, several fund managers are seeking to offer spot DOGE ETFs in the United States. Earlier on Thursday, Bit Origin Ltd. (NASDAQ: BTOG) announced it has secured $500 million in equity and debt facilities to launch a Dogecoin treasury. “What started as a joke has evolved into a globally liquid asset with a payments utility. Few digital assets rival Doge’s settlement speed and scale of community, which continues to drive adoption across peer-to-peer payments and online commerce,” Jinghai Jiang, CEO and Chairman of Bit Origin, noted . What’s Next for the DOGE Price? Following the rising bullish sentiment for the altcoin market, DOGE price has surged over 15 percent in the last seven days to trade at about 21 cents on Thursday, July 17, during the mid-North American trading session. The large-cap memecoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $31.7 billion, has seen its daily average traded volume gain over 71 percent to hover about $3.67 billion. From a technical analysis standpoint, DOGE price has already broken from a falling logarithmic trend that was established since the beginning of 2025. The bullish sentiment for DOGE price is bolstered by the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) which has approached the 70 level amid the MACD line that recently crossed above the zero line, signaling the bulls have taken higher ground.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-17 18:05:53

The offering targets 3-6% monthly returns, delivered through automated smart contract distributions. Bridging Bitcoin Mining and Tokenized Assets The infrastructure fund represents a significant innovation in the real-world asset tokenization space, allowing investors to participate in Bitcoin mining economics without the operational complexity of running a mining operation themselves. Investor capital funds modular Bitcoin mining operations across ERCOT (Texas), with revenue generated from both mining rewards and participation in energy market programs such as curtailment and ancillary services. ""This launch reflects the next stage of blockchain's evolution—from speculative finance to scalable, compliant capital formation,"" said David Packham, CEO of Chintai. ""It's a live example of how real-world assets can be made investable, auditable, and automated through blockchain."" Innovative Financial Engineering The fund combines elements of structured credit and infrastructure investing, creating a novel financial product native to blockchain. With development costs averaging $200,000 per megawatt and a projected break-even period of just over 12 months, Alteri's operations are designed for capital efficiency. The fund's architecture ensures verifiable on-chain distributions, with additional yield derived from energy arbitrage opportunities in the ERCOT grid. ""We've structured this offering to provide institutional-grade access to Bitcoin mining infrastructure—at a valuation that's significantly lower than public market comps,"" said Alteri's founder. ""It's designed to be transparent, operationally sound, and now fully accessible on-chain."" Tax Advantages and Market Position US-based investors may benefit from 100% bonus depreciation on equipment in 2025, offering the potential for significant after-tax advantages. This feature makes the fund particularly attractive for institutional investors seeking tax-efficient exposure to digital asset infrastructure. The Alteri fund joins a growing ecosystem of tokenized real-world assets on the Chintai platform, which has previously facilitated the tokenization of real estate yields, ESG infrastructure investments, and carbon credits. Each new asset class brought on-chain demonstrates blockchain's expanding utility beyond purely digital assets. Expanding the RWA Ecosystem This launch represents a key milestone in the evolution of blockchain-based finance, moving beyond speculative digital assets to tangible, yield-generating infrastructure investments. By bringing Bitcoin mining economics on-chain, Alteri creates opportunities for greater market efficiency and investor accessibility. The tokenized structure also opens possibilities for future DeFi integrations that would be impossible with traditional securities, including potential composability with lending protocols, liquidity pools, and other on-chain financial primitives. About Chintai Nexus Chintai Nexus is a leading blockchain platform backed by prominent financial institutions, revolutionizing the integration of real-world assets into the digital economy. By leveraging blockchain's inherent security and transparency, Chintai empowers businesses and creators to tokenize RWAs, unlocking new opportunities for liquidity and global accessibility. About Alteri Alteri specializes in Bitcoin mining infrastructure deployment and tokenization, combining expertise in energy markets, cryptocurrency operations, and financial engineering. The company focuses on capital-efficient mining strategies with comprehensive management of operational aspects, including power sourcing, equipment deployment, and ongoing maintenance.

Russia's Sberbank offers custody services for Russian crypto assets https://t.co/TvWlwh3hrF https://t.co/TvWlwh3hrF — Reuters Business (@ReutersBiz) July 17, 2025 The bank’s plan reflects a growing acceptance of crypto within the country, as government institutions reconsider their earlier hardline stance. Anatoly Pronin, executive director of Sberbank’s alternative payment solutions division, revealed that proposals have already been submitted to the central bank outlining how crypto custody could be introduced under existing financial structures, Reuters reports. The proposals suggest treating digital assets similarly to traditional bank-held funds, offering both user protection and legal control. If approved, these custody services would allow tokens to be frozen upon request by law enforcement, while also reducing transaction complexity and lowering vulnerability to hacks. Geopolitical Pressures Drive Regulatory Recalibration Russia’s stance on digital currencies has been shifting in light of sanctions from Western governments tied to the conflict in Ukraine. Last year, the central bank backed legislation allowing the use of cryptocurrencies in cross-border trade, a sharp turn from its previous resistance. This pivot is seen as a way for the Russian economy to circumvent international financial restrictions. By building internal infrastructure for digital asset transactions, including custody solutions, Russian institutions are working to reduce dependence on foreign crypto firms. Gleb Zemskoy, director of blockchain development at Insight Finance, stressed the importance of local custody options, stating that no fund or serious user could operate without one, Reuters reports. He warns of the dangers of relying on international custodians, which could introduce exposure to foreign jurisdiction risks. A Domestic Custodian for a Global Market The central role of custodians in the digital finance world is becoming increasingly apparent. With the custody market currently dominated by private firms based outside of Russia, local entities like Sberbank are positioning themselves to fill that void domestically. Zemskoy describes custodians as the “backbone” of the digital economy, emphasizing the urgency of Russia developing its own infrastructure. Sberbank’s ambition is not only to safeguard clients’ tokens but to integrate crypto asset handling into the country’s broader financial network. If approved, the bank’s initiative could make it easier for businesses and consumers in Russia to conduct crypto transactions with greater trust and regulatory protection. Russian Lawmakers Pass Digital Ruble Bill Earlier this week, Russian lawmakers voted in favour of a digital ruble bill that mandates a September 2026 rollout for the CBDC. Per the state-run news agency TASS , the Duma has adopted a law on the “gradual introduction” of the digital ruble, beginning next year. Lawmakers voted in favor of the bill in its second and third readings. The bill will now pass to the Russian upper house, the Federation Council, for approval. The bill will then pass on to President Vladimir Putin, who will officially sign the bill into law. These two steps are mere formalities, however, with the law slated to come into force on September 1, 2026. This is the central bank’s new date for a nationwide rollout, following its last-gasp decision to postpone its summer 2025 CBDC launch plans.

As key regulations continue to be reviewed, the adoption landscape is evolving. New Chapters Being Written The news of the plan was shared yesterday by Reuters, with the Bank of America (BOA) joining the ranks of various institutional bodies that have endorsed the stablecoin plan under President Trump’s crypto-friendly legislation. Brian Moynihan, the CEO and President of BOA, noted that “ investors can expect the lender to move forward with it, ” but did not disclose any information as to when this can be expected. Further speaking to analysts during a post-earnings call, the CEO’s approach appears to be cautious and calculated, as they are currently exploring customer demand, which is presently low. The groundwork will likely begin “ at the appropriate time ” and “ in partnership with other players, ” with Moynihan comparing current stablecoin adoption levels of the industry with those of payment platforms like Zelle and Venmo. “ We’ve done a lot of work, ” said Moynihan, hinting that this may have been in development for a while now, but with “ banks still awaiting legal clarity, ” the progress has been slower than some investors would have liked. The wait will likely not be very long, as the trio of anticipated legislation bills —CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC — were advanced to the House floor for debate and consideration after a 9-hour stall of the vote. After speaking with the President late on Wednesday, the House Speaker told reporters: “I’m pleased that we’ll be able to get this done. The president is as well. I just spoke with him, and this is a big priority for him, and it was for us.” A Change of Heart The widespread adoption and ongoing plans for stablecoins by central US banks are in stark contrast to how they were viewed not that long ago. For example, when the BOA’s lead was asked if they planned to incorporate cryptocurrency in their services during a past World Economic Forum, the answer was a straightforward “no.” Previously skeptical as well, the third-largest bank in the United States, Citigroup, is also considering issuing its own stablecoin.

Larsen sent approximately $26 million worth of XRP to Coinbase earlier this week, according to on-chain data. This transfer brings his total XRP sent to the exchange since the beginning of the year to close to $40 million. Transactions from Larsen's public wallet include a transfer of 10 million XRP on January 6 and 1.5 million XRP on June 16. According to XRP Scan data, Larsen also made several transfers to external wallets that facilitate exchanges like Binance. However, it has not yet been confirmed whether these assets were sold. Larsen sent a total of $344 million worth of XRP to exchanges and wallets throughout 2025. XRP is currently trading at $3.26. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Finally Makes Listing Announcement For Anticipated Altcoin Larsen, who founded Ripple in 2013, served as the company's CEO until 2016. He owns approximately 2.6 billion XRP, worth over $8.5 billion at current prices, bringing his net worth to $9.7 billion, according to Forbes. This is more than three times the $3.2 billion estimate last year. Ripple has entered a period of rapid growth after securing significant victories in a lengthy legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In June, the parties mutually withdrew their appeals, officially ending the lawsuit, which began in 2019, with a $50 million settlement. Chris Larsen has been frequently in the news for his XRP sales in the past. The SEC lawsuit alleges that CEO Brad Garlinghouse sold $150 million worth of XRP between 2017 and 2020, while Larsen and his wife sold $450 million worth of XRP during the same period. *This is not investment advice.

The volatile rally has left certain over-leveraged traders in limbo, as the liquidations for XRP alone are well above $40 million on a daily scale. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView As the immortal Metallica song goes – ‘So close, no matter how far.’ XRP is just in reach of a new all-time high, more than seven years after it set a record at $3.4. The asset has jumped by roughly 50% since last week when it broke out of its consolidation phase, and has skyrocketed by 75% since the late June low of $1.9. CryptoPotato asked ChatGPT about the cryptocurrency’s chances to go into uncharted territory in July since it failed to do so in January this year when it matched the 2018 record. The AI chatbot outlined why the $3.4 resistance could be harder to penetrate than most people expect, but also laid out several bullish factors that could propel another rally. Since then, XRP has increased by a few more cents and jumped to a new six-month peak of $3.34 (on Bitstamp) minutes ago. Thus, it was less than 2% away from a new all-time high. Although it has retraced slightly since then, it’s still above $3.3 as of press time. Its volatile ride has liquidated thousands of speculative traders with both shorts and longs. However, short positions dominate, with over $29 million such liquidations out of the total $44.32 million. Liquidation Heat Map.

With the program, they can change their digital assets to Thailand’s baht currency . This project comes when Thailand aims to attract more tourists to increase revenue, contributing to the nation’s economic growth. Initially piloted in Phuket, the initiative now expands nationwide after receiving positive feedback and strong adoption. Thailand hopes the sandbox will boost tourism revenue and cement its role as a regional fintech leader by embracing crypto-friendly policies. Thailand embraces the crypto sandbox project under stricter regulatory measures The crypto sandbox project has greatly supported the crypto ecosystem. For instance, tourists possessing cryptocurrency like Bitcoin do not have to worry about how they will survive in Thailand. This is because the project permits them to freely access digital asset trading platforms like crypto exchanges, cryptocurrency middlemen, and dealers to convert their cryptocurrencies to the baht. Afterwards, the tourists can pay for goods and services using the QR codes obtained when they use Thailand’s currency on online payment platforms and digital wallets. Notably, based on the country’s regulations, one cannot directly make payments using cryptocurrencies. Therefore, as the project promotes financial technology, it provides a safer way to convert cryptocurrencies into regular money for use under the strict regulations set. The crypto sandbox project also includes protective measures to address economic challenges and ensure tourists use their funds responsibly. To achieve this, the project has outlined well-defined limits on how things will be operated in this sector. According to rules released in Thailand, all service issuers should obtain a license permitting them to carry out their operations and strictly adhere to the country’s know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. In addition, the sandbox has set aside rules that require foreign tourists in the country to undergo identity confirmation processes before taking the initiative to change their digital assets to Thailand’s currency. Similarly, the SEC has also applied spending measures to foreign tourists. Based on this regulation, the regulators will monitor and manage their transactions. For example, the tourists will only be allowed to consume a maximum of ฿50,000, worth nearly USD 1,375 monthly. This spending limitation will apply to local shops like food stalls and markets. On the other hand, for certified businesses like hotels and expensive restaurants, tourists’ monthly consumption limitation is raised to ฿500,000, which is approximately USD 13,750. Since this project is being exercised for the first time, it will effectively last 18 months. This may, however, be extended after regulators examine its performance, public reaction, and safety reports. Thailand’s sandbox project faces criticism from individuals Concerning the sandbox project, the SEC and BOT have opened room for public feedback with a deadline of August 13 this year. The regulators have also called on the individuals involved in the industry, banks, and companies in tourism to weigh in on the situation. This initiative aims to solidify the country’s position as the leader in the fintech space and make Thailand a region of new ideas. With safeguarding measures and regulations in place, it is anticipated that this will create a conducive environment for crypto and traditional money to cooperate and attract proprietors of digital assets worldwide. In the meantime, the project has faced criticism from several Phuket tourism sectors. Based on their argument, there is a shortage of education and communication on the project. This was not all, questions have been raised concerning which cryptocurrencies will be applied in this project, and the risk of abuse in the situation when monitoring systems are not strong enough. Despite all this, the project is still viewed as a game-changer for the tourism sector. If successfully adopted, other countries will be eager to apply it in their tourism sector, becoming a global FinTech trend. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

48425510,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74684,1752776138,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s How CLARITY Act Could Turn Things Around for XRP,https://timestabloid.com/heres-how-clarity-act-could-turn-things-around-for-xrp/,"The popular XRP-themed account “$589” posted an extensive update outlining the current status and implications of the Digital Asset Market Structure Clarity Act (H.R. 3633), commonly referred to as the CLARITY Act. According to the post , if the U.S. House of Representatives enacts the bipartisan legislation, it could officially classify XRP as a commodity , potentially ending regulatory uncertainty surrounding the asset. Provisions of the CLARITY Act The tweet provided details on what the legislation contains and why it is significant for digital assets. The CLARITY Act, formally named the Digital Asset Market Structure Clarity Act, aims to define the circumstances under which a digital asset is considered a commodity. It also seeks to limit what the account described as regulatory overreach by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, instead assigning primary oversight of digital assets to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The post emphasized that this proposed law aligns with Judge Analisa Torres’ prior ruling in the Ripple case, which determined that XRP was not a security when sold on secondary markets. However, as “$589” noted, the new bill would elevate that principle from case law to federal legislation, providing a statutory framework rather than a judicial interpretation. Implications for Ripple and XRP According to the tweet, Ripple has been advocating for such regulatory clarity since 2013. The account suggested that Ripple’s business model, particularly its cross-border payments network and enterprise-grade liquidity solutions, requires a clear legal status for XRP. The tweet mentioned Ripple’s products RippleNet and RLUSD, clarifying that stablecoins like RLUSD do not replace XRP but instead complement it. It explained that while stablecoins function as local vehicles, XRP remains the global bridge asset for transactions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The tweet further argued that the passage of this legislation could open the door for broader institutional adoption of XRP by removing the legal uncertainties that have deterred banks, payment companies, and other institutional players. It also stated that clear regulatory guardrails would reduce risk, potentially paving the way for new financial products such as exchange-traded funds based on XRP. Market Response and Outlook The account also commented on recent market behavior, noting that options data indicate XRP volatility has increased by nearly 100 percent, with expectations of price swings exceeding 13 percent in the near term. The post interpreted this as a sign that institutional investors are already positioning themselves in anticipation of the vote. The tweet framed the upcoming House vote as a historic moment for the U.S. digital asset market, with XRP positioned “front and center.” The account underscored that passage of the CLARITY Act in the House would leave only Senate approval before it could become law, describing it as potentially the most significant regulatory shift in U.S. crypto history. According to “$589,” XRP remains the bridge asset for the emerging financial system, and this vote marks a decisive step toward that vision.
