On July 15, crypto exchange Bitget executed a massive burn of 30 million BGB tokens, an event that sent ripples of optimism through the market. This substantial token destruction, valued at approximately $130 million, was reported by LookOnChain via X, highlighting Bitget’s ongoing commitment to its native token. What Does the Bitget BGB Burn Mean for Investors? The news of the 30 million Bitget BGB burn on July 15 is more than just a headline; it’s a clear signal of strategic intent from one of the leading global crypto exchanges. For investors, a token burn fundamentally aims to reduce the total supply of a cryptocurrency, thereby increasing its scarcity. In theory, reduced supply, coupled with consistent or increasing demand, can lead to an appreciation in the token’s value. The BGB token, currently trading at $4.67 and showing a healthy 3.8% increase over 24 hours post-announcement, certainly reflects this positive market sentiment. This isn’t an isolated incident for Bitget. Over the past eight months, the exchange has systematically burned an astounding 860 million BGB tokens. This consistent, long-term strategy underscores Bitget’s dedication to creating a deflationary mechanism for BGB, potentially benefiting long-term holders. Such actions are often interpreted by the market as a strong vote of confidence from the exchange itself in its token’s future. Why do exchanges burn tokens? Deflationary Pressure: Reducing supply can make the remaining tokens more valuable. Value Appreciation: Scarcity can drive up demand and price. Commitment & Trust: Demonstrates the exchange’s dedication to the token’s ecosystem and its community. Profit Sharing: Often, a portion of exchange profits is used to buy back and burn tokens, aligning the exchange’s success with token holders. Understanding the BGB Token’s Role in the Bitget Ecosystem The BGB token is not merely a digital asset; it is the utility token powering the entire Bitget ecosystem. Launched to enhance the user experience and provide significant benefits within the exchange, BGB plays a pivotal role in Bitget’s growth strategy. Holders of BGB gain access to a multitude of perks, making it an attractive asset for active traders and long-term investors on the platform. Let’s delve into some of the core utilities that make the BGB token indispensable within Bitget: Utility Feature Description Benefit to Holder Trading Fee Discounts Use BGB to pay for spot and futures trading fees. Significant cost savings on transactions. Launchpad Access Participate in exclusive token sales on Bitget Launchpad. Early access to promising new projects. Launchpool & Earn Stake BGB to earn new tokens or high APY on existing assets. Passive income generation and asset growth. Voting Rights Participate in community governance for new listings and proposals. Influence over the platform’s future direction. Futures Copy Trading Benefits Access exclusive features and higher profit sharing ratios for traders. Enhanced profitability and unique trading tools. Withdrawal Fee Discounts Enjoy reduced fees when withdrawing assets from the platform. Lower operational costs. These utilities create a strong demand for BGB, as users seek to maximize their benefits on the Bitget platform. The token burn mechanism further strengthens this demand by reducing supply, creating a virtuous cycle that supports the token’s value proposition. Exploring the Crypto Exchange Bitget’s Growth and Strategy Bitget has rapidly ascended the ranks to become a formidable player in the global cryptocurrency landscape. As a comprehensive crypto exchange Bitget offers a wide array of services, including spot trading, futures trading, copy trading, and an innovative launchpad. Its commitment to user-centric features, robust security measures, and continuous innovation has attracted millions of users worldwide. The exchange’s strategic approach is multifaceted, focusing on expanding its product offerings, enhancing liquidity, and fostering a vibrant community. The consistent token burn strategy for BGB is a testament to this long-term vision. It’s not just about reducing supply; it’s about signaling confidence in the platform’s future earnings and its ability to sustain such deflationary measures. This approach is similar to traditional stock buybacks, where companies repurchase their shares to reduce outstanding stock and boost shareholder value. Bitget’s proactive stance in the market, including its aggressive marketing campaigns and partnerships, further solidifies its position. The token burns are an integral part of this broader strategy, aiming to create a sustainable and attractive investment for its users and the wider crypto community. The Impact of Strategic Token Burn on Value and Trust The concept of a token burn is a powerful tool in the crypto economy, designed to create scarcity and, by extension, enhance value. When an exchange like Bitget removes a significant amount of its native tokens from circulation, it directly impacts the supply-demand dynamics. With fewer tokens available, each remaining token theoretically becomes more valuable, assuming demand remains constant or increases. Beyond the direct economic impact, token burns also play a crucial psychological role. They demonstrate a strong commitment from the project team to the long-term health and prosperity of their token. This builds trust among investors, assuring them that the team is not simply focused on short-term gains but is invested in creating sustainable value. For Bitget, the repeated and substantial BGB burns, totaling 860 million over eight months, are a clear indication of their dedication to the BGB token’s future. Challenges and Considerations: Market Volatility: While burns can boost value, the broader crypto market remains volatile, and external factors can still influence price. Sustainable Burn Mechanisms: The long-term impact depends on the sustainability of the burn mechanism, often linked to exchange profitability. Transparency: Transparent reporting of burns (like LookOnChain’s report) is crucial for maintaining investor confidence. Ultimately, a strategic token burn is a statement of intent, a powerful mechanism that, when executed consistently and transparently, can significantly contribute to a token’s perceived and actual value. Navigating the Bitget Ecosystem: Future Prospects and Actionable Insights The continuous development and strategic moves within the Bitget ecosystem paint a promising picture for the future of the BGB token. Bitget is not resting on its laurels; it consistently introduces new features, expands its global reach, and invests in technological advancements to enhance its platform. These efforts, combined with the robust token burn strategy, position BGB for potential long-term growth. For individuals looking to engage with the Bitget platform or invest in BGB, here are some actionable insights: Research Thoroughly: Understand the BGB token’s utilities and Bitget’s roadmap. Knowledge is power in the crypto space. Consider BGB’s Utilities: If you’re an active trader on Bitget, holding BGB can significantly reduce your costs and unlock exclusive features. Monitor Burn Events: Keep an eye on future token burn announcements as they can often precede positive price movements. Diversify Your Portfolio: While BGB shows promise, always maintain a diversified investment portfolio to mitigate risks. Stay Informed: Follow official Bitget channels and reputable crypto news sources for the latest updates on the exchange and the BGB token. The future of BGB is intrinsically linked to the success and expansion of the Bitget exchange. As Bitget continues to innovate and attract more users, the demand for BGB and its utility will likely grow, potentially reinforcing the positive impact of its token burn strategy. Conclusion: Bitget’s Bold Commitment to BGB Value The recent 30 million BGB token burn on July 15, following a pattern of 860 million BGB burned over the past eight months, clearly demonstrates Bitget’s unwavering commitment to enhancing the value and utility of its native token. This strategic token burn is a powerful signal to the market, showcasing the exchange’s dedication to creating a deflationary asset and fostering long-term trust within its community. As the BGB token continues to serve as the backbone of the thriving Bitget ecosystem, providing a wide array of benefits to its holders, its future looks increasingly bright. Investors and users alike will undoubtedly be watching closely as Bitget continues to execute its vision for a robust and valuable digital asset.

Recently, a significant development emerged from Washington D.C. that has caught the attention of investors, innovators, and enthusiasts alike: House Republicans crypto initiative has taken a crucial step forward. This procedural vote signals a potential turning point for US crypto regulation , paving the way for more structured governance in the digital asset space. Let’s dive into what this means for the future of finance and technology. A Pivotal Moment for US Crypto Regulation: What Just Happened? In a move that has sent ripples through the digital asset community, U.S. House Republicans successfully passed a procedural motion. This isn’t just a minor bureaucratic hurdle; it’s a critical legislative maneuver that allows two specific crypto bills to advance further through the complex congressional process. As reported by Infinity Hedge via Telegram, this action indicates a growing momentum within the legislative branch to address the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. You might be wondering, what exactly is a ‘procedural motion’? In simple terms, it’s a vote that dictates the rules for how a bill will be debated and voted on in the future. It’s like setting the agenda for a crucial meeting. For the cryptocurrency industry, this means: Faster Pace: The bills can now move more quickly through committee and potentially to a full House vote. Increased Focus: It brings specific legislative proposals regarding digital assets into sharper focus for lawmakers and the public. Bipartisan Potential: While initiated by Republicans, advancing bills often requires some level of bipartisan engagement to ultimately become law. This development is a clear indicator that lawmakers are increasingly recognizing the importance of establishing a robust framework for US crypto regulation , moving beyond mere discussions to tangible legislative action. What Does Advancing Digital Asset Legislation Really Mean for the Market? The advancement of these bills represents a significant stride in the ongoing effort to define and regulate the cryptocurrency landscape. When we talk about digital asset legislation , we’re discussing laws that could impact everything from how cryptocurrencies are classified (e.g., as securities or commodities) to how stablecoins are issued and regulated, and even consumer protection measures for crypto investors. The absence of clear rules has long been cited as a major barrier to mainstream adoption and institutional investment in the U.S. This procedural step, while not a final vote on the bills themselves, signifies that Congress is serious about providing that much-needed clarity. It could lead to: Aspect Potential Impact of Legislation Investor Confidence Increased protection and reduced risk perception, potentially attracting more traditional investors. Innovation & Growth Clear rules could foster a more predictable environment for blockchain startups and existing crypto businesses. Market Stability Specific rules for stablecoins and other assets could reduce volatility and systemic risk. Global Competitiveness Positions the U.S. as a leader in the digital economy, rather than falling behind other nations with clearer frameworks. The specifics of the two bills are crucial, but the general direction suggests an attempt to create a more defined and potentially more secure environment for digital assets within the existing financial system. Decoding the Path Ahead for Crypto Bills: What are the Hurdles? While the advancement of these crypto bills is a positive sign, it’s important to remember that the legislative journey is long and complex. A procedural motion is just one step in a multi-stage process. The next significant hurdles include: Committee Review: The bills will undergo detailed scrutiny and potential amendments in relevant House committees. Full House Vote: If they pass committee, they will then be put to a vote by the entire House of Representatives. Success here is not guaranteed, as bipartisan support will be critical. Senate Consideration: Even if passed by the House, the bills must then go through a similar process in the Senate, where they may face different priorities and amendments. Presidential Assent: Finally, for any bill to become law, it must be signed by the President. Each of these stages presents opportunities for the bills to be altered, delayed, or even rejected. The political climate, differing views between parties, and lobbying efforts from various stakeholders will all play a role in shaping their ultimate fate. This is where the intricacies of US crypto regulation truly come into play, as various agencies and lawmakers weigh in on how best to approach this innovative, yet often disruptive, technology. The Impact on Blockchain Policy and Innovation: A Double-Edged Sword? The move by House Republicans crypto supporters to advance these bills has profound implications for broader blockchain policy and the future of technological innovation in the U.S. On one hand, clear regulatory frameworks can provide the certainty that businesses need to invest heavily in blockchain technology, knowing the rules of the game. This can spur innovation, attract talent, and lead to the development of new applications beyond just cryptocurrencies, such as supply chain management, digital identity, and more efficient financial services. However, there’s also a delicate balance to strike. Overly restrictive or poorly designed legislation could stifle innovation, pushing companies and talent to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions. The challenge for lawmakers is to craft legislation that protects consumers and ensures financial stability without stifling the very innovation that makes blockchain technology so promising. Key considerations for the future of blockchain policy include: Regulatory Clarity: Defining what constitutes a security, commodity, or currency in the digital realm. Consumer Protection: Safeguarding investors from fraud and market manipulation. Financial Stability: Addressing potential systemic risks posed by large-scale digital asset adoption, particularly stablecoins. Taxation: Clarifying how digital assets are taxed. Interoperability: Ensuring that U.S. regulations can work effectively with international standards. The outcome of these legislative efforts will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of blockchain development in the United States for years to come. House Republicans Crypto Initiative: A Step Towards Clarity? The recent procedural vote underscores the increasing bipartisan, though primarily Republican-led, push for clear crypto legislation. Many House Republicans crypto advocates argue that the current regulatory landscape is fragmented and uncertain, hindering America’s competitiveness in the global digital economy. They believe that providing a clear legal framework will not only protect investors but also encourage innovation and prevent businesses from moving offshore. While the specific content of the bills is still under review and subject to change, the overarching goal appears to be to establish a more coherent regulatory environment. This includes efforts to clarify the roles of various regulatory bodies, such as the SEC and CFTC, in overseeing different types of digital assets. For the industry, this could mean an end to the ‘regulation by enforcement’ approach that has often characterized U.S. oversight of crypto. What This Means for You: Actionable Insights For anyone involved in or interested in the crypto space, this legislative advancement has several implications: Stay Informed: Follow the progress of these bills closely. Understanding the nuances of emerging digital asset legislation will be crucial for making informed decisions. Engage & Advocate: If you’re part of the crypto industry, consider engaging with industry associations and advocacy groups that are working to shape these policies. Your voice can make a difference. Prepare for Change: Businesses operating in the crypto space should begin to assess how potential new regulations might impact their operations, compliance requirements, and business models. Evaluate Your Portfolio: Investors should consider how regulatory clarity (or continued uncertainty) might affect the long-term prospects of various digital assets. The Unfolding Saga of US Crypto Regulation The recent procedural motion by U.S. House Republicans marks a significant, albeit early, step in the journey towards comprehensive US crypto regulation . The advancement of these crypto bills reflects a growing recognition within Congress of the need for clear rules governing digital assets. While the path ahead is fraught with legislative hurdles and political debates, this development offers a hopeful sign for those seeking clarity and stability in the rapidly evolving world of blockchain and cryptocurrency. The coming months will be critical in determining whether these efforts lead to a transformative era of innovation and investor protection, or if the challenges prove too great to overcome. The digital asset community will be watching closely.

How Much Is In The Country’s Bitcoin Reserve Really? The saga began when Bitcoin Magazine Chairman David Bailey offered a $10,000 bounty to the journalist who could uncover the exact amount of Bitcoin currently held by the U.S. government in a July 16 X post.

Bullish.” Senator Cynthia Lummis Speaks Out Amid Crypto Concerns U.S. President Donald Trump formally launched the country’s Bitcoin Reserve and U.S. Digital Assets Stockpile back in a March 2025 executive order . “This move harnesses the power of digital assets for national prosperity, rather than letting them languish in limbo,” the executive order states. Just a few minutes ago, President Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it… — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 7, 2025 At the time, White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks estimated that the U.S. government held around 200,000 Bitcoin, although no formal audit on the cryptocurrency had been completed. Following the news, crypto-friendly Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) openly expressed her shock over the claims. “I’m alarmed by reports that the U.S. has sold off over 80% of its Bitcoin reserves—leaving just ~29,000 coins,” Lummis wrote. “If true, this is a total strategic blunder and sets the United States back years in the Bitcoin race.” The White House has yet to publicly comment on the matter.

Imagine waking up to news that a major player has offloaded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of a leading digital asset. This isn’t just a hypothetical scenario; it’s precisely what transpired, leading to considerable discussion and analysis among investors and market watchers alike. This substantial Trend Research ETH sale has undeniably captured the attention of the entire crypto community, prompting questions about its implications for market stability and future price action. Decoding the Massive Ethereum (ETH) Offload: What Exactly Happened? In a move that underscores the dynamic nature of the crypto market , Trend Research executed a series of large-scale transactions involving Ethereum (ETH). According to on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, which reported the activity on X (formerly Twitter), the firm divested a staggering 69,946 ETH over the past 24 hours. This massive sell-off translated to approximately $218.3 million at the time of the transactions. The sale wasn’t a single event but included a notable recent transaction of 21,000 ETH, valued at roughly $67 million. Such large-volume movements by a single entity are often referred to as “whale activity” due to their potential to influence market dynamics. Despite this significant divestment, Trend Research still retains a substantial portion of its digital assets , holding onto 115,187 ETH, which is currently valued at an impressive $376.35 million. This indicates that while they’ve taken considerable profits or rebalanced their portfolio, they remain a significant holder of Ethereum. To put these figures into perspective, let’s look at the breakdown: Transaction Detail Ethereum (ETH) Amount USD Value (Approx.) Total ETH Sold (Past 24 hours) 69,946 ETH $218.3 Million Recent Single Sale 21,000 ETH $67 Million Remaining ETH Holdings 115,187 ETH $376.35 Million Why Did a Crypto Whale Like Trend Research Make This Move? The motivations behind such a significant sale by a major entity like Trend Research are often multi-faceted and can range from strategic portfolio rebalancing to a shift in market outlook. While the exact reasons remain speculative without direct confirmation from the firm, several possibilities come to mind when observing such a substantial crypto whale move: Profit Taking: Ethereum has seen significant price appreciation over various periods. Selling a portion of holdings could simply be a classic profit-taking strategy, cashing in on gains to secure returns for investors or internal operations. Portfolio Rebalancing: Large firms often manage diverse portfolios. A sale of ETH might indicate a reallocation of capital into other digital assets, traditional investments, or even into operational liquidity for new ventures. Market Outlook: While not necessarily a bearish signal, a large sale could suggest a cautious short-to-medium term outlook on Ethereum’s price trajectory. It might be a hedge against potential volatility or a belief that other assets offer better immediate growth prospects. Operational Needs: Like any large entity, Trend Research might have significant operational expenses, investment commitments, or upcoming projects that require substantial capital, for which liquidating a portion of their digital assets would be a practical solution. Understanding these potential drivers is crucial for interpreting the broader implications of such sales on market sentiment . What is the Impact on Ethereum (ETH) and Broader Market Sentiment? The immediate effect of a large sale like this is often a ripple of concern or speculation throughout the market. When a major holder sells, it increases the supply on exchanges, which can put downward pressure on prices in the short term. However, the market’s reaction also depends on overall liquidity and demand. If there are enough buyers to absorb the sell pressure, the impact might be minimal or quickly absorbed. Key impacts include: Price Volatility: Large sales can trigger short-term price dips, especially if the market is already sensitive or lacking strong buying interest. Traders might react by selling, exacerbating the downward trend. Investor Confidence: Such moves can sometimes dent investor confidence, leading to questions about the asset’s future performance or whether other large holders might follow suit. This directly influences market sentiment . Liquidity Test: These large sales act as a test of the market’s liquidity. The fact that $218 million worth of ETH was sold indicates the deep liquidity of the Ethereum market, which is a positive sign for its maturity. Focus on On-Chain Data: Events like the Trend Research ETH sale highlight the increasing importance of on-chain analytics. Platforms like Lookonchain provide transparency into whale movements, allowing investors to make more informed decisions. Despite the sale, the fact that Trend Research still holds over $376 million in ETH suggests a long-term conviction in the asset, even if they are actively managing their exposure. This remaining significant holding can somewhat mitigate the negative perception of the sale. Navigating the Waters: Actionable Insights for Your Digital Asset Strategy For individual investors and those interested in the crypto market , understanding these large institutional movements offers valuable insights. While it’s tempting to panic or mimic whale actions, a more nuanced approach is often beneficial. Here are some actionable insights: Don’t Blindly Follow: Large entities have different risk appetites, investment horizons, and financial obligations than individual investors. Their reasons for selling might not align with your personal financial goals. Monitor On-Chain Data, But Interpret Wisely: Tools that track crypto whale activity are valuable for understanding market flows. However, always combine this data with fundamental analysis of the asset (e.g., Ethereum’s network upgrades, adoption, dApp ecosystem) and broader macroeconomic factors. Focus on Long-Term Fundamentals: For assets like Ethereum (ETH) , sustained growth often comes from technological advancements, network utility, and increasing adoption. Short-term whale movements, while impactful, might not derail a strong long-term thesis. Manage Risk: Ensure your portfolio is diversified and that you’re not overexposed to any single asset. Use stop-loss orders or take profits incrementally to protect your capital from sudden market shifts. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of news, analysis, and on-chain metrics. Knowledge is your best defense against impulsive decisions driven by market FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) or FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). This event serves as a powerful reminder that the digital asset management landscape is constantly evolving, requiring vigilance and strategic thinking from all participants. The Future of Trend Research’s Digital Assets: What Comes Next? With a remaining holding of over $376 million in Ethereum (ETH), Trend Research clearly maintains a substantial stake in the asset. This suggests that their recent sale might be more of a strategic maneuver rather than a complete exit from their digital assets position. Future movements from this entity will continue to be closely watched by the market. Possible scenarios include: Further Sales: Depending on market conditions and their internal strategies, they might continue to gradually reduce their ETH holdings. Re-Accumulation: Conversely, if they believe the market has bottomed or a new bullish trend is emerging, they might start re-accumulating ETH at lower prices. Long-Term Hold: Their remaining large sum could simply be a long-term strategic investment, with no immediate plans for further significant sales. The actions of such a significant crypto whale like Trend Research offer a fascinating case study in institutional behavior within the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Their decisions, while individual, contribute to the collective narrative and dynamics of the crypto market . Conclusion: The Enduring Significance of Whale Movements in the Crypto Market The recent Trend Research ETH sale of over $218 million serves as a powerful illustration of the immense capital flows that characterize the modern digital asset management landscape. While the sheer volume of Ethereum (ETH) involved is noteworthy, it’s the ripple effect on market sentiment and the broader implications for the crypto market that truly capture attention.

As the original crypto continues to chart a course to new price highs, demand for projects across the entire market concurrently increases. That’s why leading altcoins and the best meme coins —including TRON, Sui Network, Solana, Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin—have also recorded new peaks in recent months, bolstering the belief that both market segments retain strong upside potential. With optimism building ahead of the next anticipated bull cycle, investors are focusing on select altcoins that could surpass their historical price ceilings. Ripple (XRP): Leading Cross-Border Payments Crypto Shows Massive Price Potential Ripple’s XRP token continues to cement its role as a bridge between conventional banking systems and blockchain-powered remittance solutions. Thanks to its near-instant global transfers at extremely low fees, XRP has attracted strong institutional attention, even earning recognition from the United Nations as a viable platform for sending funds worldwide without third-party intermediaries. After a prolonged legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple scored a decisive court victory in 2023, with the judge ruling that retail sales of XRP were not securities transactions. The SEC formally ended the case in 2025, concluding a lengthy four-year dispute. This legal resolution reinforced XRP’s position within the industry, establishing an important regulatory precedent for the broader altcoin space. As a result, investor confidence soared, pushing XRP’s price up by an impressive 439% in one year, far exceeding Bitcoin’s 87% gains during the same period. Currently encountering resistance around the $3 mark, XRP is poised to potentially break through, solidifying its reputation as one of the most resilient billion-dollar market cap altcoins. However, should markets take an adverse turn, or a sell-off ensue, XRP could lose some of its recent gains, but it will likely find strong support at $2, enabling an easy rebound once the market flips bullish. Earlier this year, technical charts revealed a bullish flag pattern, indicating a possible surge towards $3.50 this summer, surpassing its prior all-time high of $3.40 recorded in January 2018. Solana ($SOL): Can This “Ethereum Killer” Set a New Record Before Fall? Solana ($SOL) has firmly established itself in decentralised finance, delivering lightning-fast transaction speeds, minimal fees, and powerful smart contract capabilities. Its market capitalisation has surpassed $89.5 billion, while the chain itself has over $9.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama. Speculation is mounting over potential approval of a spot ETF for Solana, akin to the green light recently granted to Bitcoin and Ethereum, which could attract substantial institutional inflows and solidify Solana’s status as a legitimate Ethereum competitor. Adding to its momentum, former U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of integrating Solana into a proposed U.S. Crypto Reserve, suggesting the government could hold confiscated Solana coins seized in law enforcement actions. Price-wise, Solana rebounded from an April low of $100 after peaking at $250 in February and is now trading around $153. With its RSI climbing from 63, further gains may be on the horizon as the bullish momentum remains. While geopolitical risks have constrained its short-term growth, this period of consolidation is reinforcing $SOL’s market foundation. Resistance levels are set at $200 and $250, but a decisive breakout could drive Solana past its all-time high of $293.31, potentially reaching around $300 by fall. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme Coin Powerhouse Eyes New Peaks Pepe ($PEPE) has rapidly ascended the meme coin ranks in its two years of existence, establishing itself among the top three thanks to strong cultural relevance and market performance. Based on Matt Furie’s legendary frog character, $PEPE has yielded extraordinary returns for early backers and now boasts a market cap above $5.4 billion. Launched in April 2023, Pepe spurred the emergence of numerous imitator tokens, though none have replicated its traction. Its popularity surged even further when Elon Musk briefly switched his X (formerly Twitter) profile picture to a Pepe-themed image. Currently valued near $0.00001286, $PEPE has climbed 7.4% in the last 24 hours and 26% over the past week, although it remains around 54% below its peak of $0.00002803 set in late 2024. In Q1 this year, a falling wedge pattern forms across Pepe’s lines of support and resistance—a formation typically signalling an impending upward breakout. With its RSI now at 68, bullish momentum remains strong, though it is approaching 70, where assets tend to become overbought, usually pre-empting selloffs. If macroeconomic and geopolitical stability persists, Pepe could embark on another major rally before the close of summer. Snorter ($SNORT): Low-Price Entry to a Promising New Crypto Spotting emerging crypto projects before mainstream adoption often yields the highest returns. While established altcoins continue to dominate, upcoming tokens are unlocking novel opportunities for growth. One such contender is Snorter ($SNORT) , a hybrid meme token and advanced trading bot built on Solana, with cross-chain expansion planned for the future. Integrated directly into Telegram, Snorter delivers live market analytics within chat groups. Charging fees as low as 0.85%, Snorter offers a competitive edge over rivals like BonkBot, Maestro, and Trojan. Its comprehensive toolkit features MEV-protected swaps, copy trading capabilities, rug pull prevention, and limit order sniping, positioning it as a full-suite trading platform. Investor enthusiasm has surged, with the presale raising more than $1.9 million to date. Its staking programme offers up to 203% APY, rewarding early supporters generously. Investors can buy it now via the official website at the fixed low price of $0.0983, although this rises fractionally throughout the course of the presale, with the next leg expected in under 24 hours. Whether you’re an experienced trader or exploring meme coins for the first time, Snorter seeks to provide a seamless platform to navigate today’s fast-paced crypto landscape.

On Monday, Bitcoin set a new record, reaching $122,838 and marking its highest price ever. Analysts note further upward movement could follow if this momentum sustains, potentially ushering in widespread global adoption. This powerful rally has sparked intense optimism among crypto investors, with speculation rising that an even stronger bull market than the famed 2021 run could be forming, pushing numerous major altcoins to uncharted valuation levels. Outlined below are cryptocurrencies that ChatGPT predicts will have significant near-term growth prospects. XRP (Ripple): ChatGPT Predicts This Cross-Border Payment Giant Could Easily Double ChatGPT’s analysis indicates that Ripple’s XRP could hit $20 by late 2025, reflecting a near sevenfold surge from its current price of around $2.96. This bullish forecast stems from increasing institutional integration, clearer regulatory frameworks, and speculation around a potential XRP spot ETF, which could unlock large-scale retail and institutional investments. Furthermore, XRP maintains strong recognition as a fast, affordable, and compliant option for global payments. In 2024, the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) praised XRP for enabling instant cross-border transfers without traditional intermediaries. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! UN Endorses @Ripple and @StellarOrg as Cornerstones of New Global Payments Network! #XRP and #XLM will run the new financial system! pic.twitter.com/ufewexCKmR — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 13, 2024 A landmark ruling in 2023 determined that XRP’s retail sales did not qualify as securities transactions, weakening the SEC’s long-held stance on XRP and the wider crypto industry beyond Bitcoin that they were trading as unlicensed securities. In March, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the official conclusion of the prolonged legal dispute, removing a major barrier and lifting investor sentiment for XRP and the broader altcoin market. Looking forward, XRP faces key resistance at $3. Should it convincingly surpass this threshold, ChatGPT’s more conservative target of $10 by year-end appears attainable. However, a catalyst is needed to achieve the ambitious $20 milestone. This will depend on regulatory progress in the U.S., where the industry have long asked lawmakers for clarity. The perception of Trump prior to his reassuming the presidency was that he’s the “crypto president” but he has yet to deliver on essential substance. Additionally, political stability across regions like the Middle East is spooking investors. XRP has been among the top-performing major cryptocurrencies, rising 429% in the past year, compared to Bitcoin’s 87% increase. Dogecoin ($DOGE): The Original Meme Coin Set for a Strong Rebound Dogecoin ($DOGE) , the original meme token, continues to maintain a solid market cap of roughly $30.2 billion. Initially created in 2013 as a parody, it has evolved into a legitimate digital asset with wide usage and a loyal international community. Frequently mirroring Bitcoin’s movements, Dogecoin combines meme-driven volatility with notable staying power. At present, DOGE is trading near $0.201 after rising 3% on the day and 16% on the week. Its RSI stands at 65 and is trending upwards, indicating growing buying interest as Bitcoin’s rally continues. Technical indicators show a pronounced falling wedge pattern from November to April, indicating strong potential for an imminent upward breakout. ChatGPT predicts DOGE could reach $1.50 during an extended bullish phase, equating to a potential 7.5X gain. On the adoption front, Dogecoin continues to receive endorsements from major corporations and celebrities alike. Tesla accepts DOGE for select merchandise, while platforms like Revolut and PayPal have integrated it as a payment method, enhancing its mainstream utility. Shiba Inu (SHIB): ChatGPT AI Predicts 7x Gains by Year-End Shiba Inu (SHIB) , launched in August 2020, has emerged as the second biggest meme coin and a serious high-utility contender to Dogecoin with a market value exceeding $8.1 billion. Currently priced at $0.00001384, SHIB has risen 4.3% over the last 24 hours and 14.1% in the past week. It is now approaching a breakout from two significant technical patterns: a descending wedge between November and March, and a bullish flag identified in mid-May. The next key resistance lies at $0.000022, with potential to climb towards $0.00003. Should this momentum persist, OpenAI’s ChatGP forecasts SHIB could hit $0.0001 before year-end – representing a more than sevenfold rise from current prices. This outlook is supported by SHIB’s evolution into a utility-focused ecosystem. Built on Ethereum, SHIB has improved scalability with its Layer-2 network, Shibarium, enabling quicker transactions, lower fees, expanded dApp integration, and enhanced privacy features. TOKEN6900: Could This New Meme Coin Deliver 1000x Returns? While ChatGPT predicts some dazzling returns on well-established altcoins this year, the vast market caps of the projects above often limit their explosive growth potential. For traders pursuing dramatic returns, lesser-known meme coins may offer sharper upside. One such project is TOKEN6900 (T6900) , an ERC-20 meme token that launched its presale just a week ago. Hey Siri, define aura pic.twitter.com/NVYT1pZmed — Token6900 (@Token_6900) July 8, 2025 So far, TOKEN6900 has raised over $585,215 from early backers, signalling strong investor enthusiasm and prospects for a powerful launch rally. Unlike many meme coins that attempt to pivot towards utility, TOKEN6900 embraces its identity as a purely hype-driven asset, leveraging irony, aggressive marketing, and FOMO to fuel growth. Its website boldly proclaims: “It’s Not Built On Fundamentals. It’s Built On Delusion, Irony, And The Collective Hallucination Of Terminally Online Traders.” Inspired by SPX6900, a meme token celebrating absurdist dot-com aesthetics, TOKEN6900 has a total supply of 930,993,091 tokens – exactly one more than SPX6900’s, emphasising its competitive branding approach. This strategy appears effective, as shown by its presale performance. Although it lacks inherent utility, TOKEN6900 offers staking options for additional yield alongside speculative price gains. Interested buyers can purchase T6900 on its official website at a current presale price of $0.0066. With the next price increase scheduled within 48 hours, those seeking the lowest entry point may wish to act quickly.

Per the state-run news agency TASS , the Duma has adopted a law on the “gradual introduction” of the digital ruble, beginning next year. Digital Ruble Bill Passes Duma Lawmakers voted in favor of the bill in its second and third readings. The bill will now pass to the Russian upper house, the Federation Council, for approval. The State Duma building in Moscow, Russia. (Source: State Duma/Facebook) The bill will then pass on to President Vladimir Putin, who will officially sign the bill into law. These two steps are mere formalities, however, with the law slated to come into force on September 1, 2026. This is the Central Bank’s new date for a nationwide rollout, following its last-gasp decision to postpone its summer 2025 CBDC launch plans. The law was spearheaded by a group of lawmakers and senators. The group was headed by Anatoly Aksakov, the Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets. Aksakov is the chief architect of all of Russia’s crypto and CBDC legislation passed to date. The draft law effectively enshrines the Central Bank’s CBDC timeline for banks and other financial providers into law. From September 1, 2026, all firms with an annual revenue of 120 million rubles ($1.5 million) or above must provide their customers with access to digital ruble services. Medium-sized firms (those with revenues of up to 30 million rubles or $383,000) will have an extra year to comply. Smaller firms and financial industry startups, meanwhile, will have to comply by September 1, 2028. The rules will also apply to foreign banks and firms that have branches in Russia. Several Chinese banks and a handful of European and American banks continue to operate in Russia. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned that Brazil, China and India will face secondary sanctions from the US if Russia doesn’t negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine https://t.co/fhhSFOOlin — Bloomberg (@business) July 15, 2025 QR Code Clauses The bill also mandates the use of digital ruble QR codes in payments for goods and services. The law will allow individuals to pay companies or individual traders CBDC tokens for goods and services using app-based QR codes. Many vendors will also be obliged to allow their customers to pay in digital RUB if requested. This, too, will involve a gradual rollout. Bigger companies will be obliged to provide CBDC payment options from the outset. But some smaller firms will be allowed to opt out of the system altogether. The bill also addresses lingering questions about the feasibility of rolling out the digital ruble in parts of the country that have poor mobile network coverage and internet access. In many rural areas, coverage remains spotty. While China’s digital yuan pilot has seen the People’s Bank of China and its partners resolve such problems with hard or offline CBDC wallets , the Russian Central Bank is yet to reveal details of any such trial. As such, the bill dictates that vendors without internet access or mobile network coverage will not be obliged to accept digital ruble payments. Vendors with annual revenue under 5 million rubles ($63,900) per year will also be exempted. China said that there are no winners in a trade war after US President Trump threatened to hit buyers of Russian exports with sanctions unless Russia agrees to a peace deal in 50 days.

In its first stage, 600 citizens and 22 firms from 11 cities began using the CBDC. These companies ranged from major banks to small beauty salons . The Moscow Metro has also begun trialing CBDC payments. However, commercial banks have repeatedly questioned the need for a Russian CBDC. The latest challenge has come from German Gref, the head of the megabank Sberbank. German Gref, the head of Sberbank. (Source: Duma.gov.ru [CC BY 4.0]) Earlier this month, Gref said he could not see how the digital ruble could lead to a large-scale transformation of the Russian economy. CNews quoted Gref as saying: “I don’t understand why an individual needs the option to use a CBDC. And neither do banks. And businesses, too. I still don’t really understand why this is necessary.” However, Gref did suggest that there was a “possible future” for the digital ruble in cross-border settlements, provided overseas trading partners wanted to use it. The Central Bank claims that the CBDC will allow citizens and companies to make faster, more transparent, and more secure transactions. The Ministry of Finance, meanwhile, says it wants to use the CBDC to issue benefits and pay government contracts. It claims that this will help eliminate benefits fraud and corruption.

Following a recent price spike above the $3 mark, its first in five months, industry experts warn that many investors risk repeating costly errors from previous bull markets. The recent upswing in XRP’s price follows a series of bullish catalysts, including the launch of futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the resolution of Ripple’s legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and expanding institutional involvement in digital assets. Although XRP has pulled back slightly to around $2.95 , analysts believe the momentum could be far from over. In a recent episode of the Good Morning Crypto podcast, host Abdullah “Abs” Nassif emphasized that the market is only entering the early stages of its next growth cycle. He highlighted increasing support from traditional finance institutions and the expected rise in capital inflows through tokenized assets and stablecoins as significant indicators of what lies ahead. Long-Term Strategy: Avoid Premature Selling One recurring warning shared by podcast guests is the temptation to exit too soon. A featured crypto educator advised holders to avoid selling at the first sign of a price surge. Instead, he recommended that investors consider leveraging their assets or placing them in secure cold wallets and trusts. According to him, short-term selling often results in tokens returning to the control of institutional investors, those best positioned to hold long-term. He further noted that long-term holding can play a role in larger systemic shifts, encouraging individuals to act with foresight rather than react to temporary price movements. Co-host Johnny Crypto added weight to the discussion by recalling a personal experience from the late 1990s. Having sold his Amazon stock prematurely, he missed out on what would have been approximately $52 million in gains. This time, he said, he plans to retain a substantial portion of his XRP holdings regardless of future price activity. Rather than selling entirely, he is exploring financial strategies such as borrowing against the asset or placing it in a trust to maintain long-term exposure. The Case for XRP’s Continued Growth The panel pointed to several structural trends that could contribute to a substantial rise in XRP’s value over the medium to long term. One key factor is the anticipated approval of more than ten XRP-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by October 2025, which could increase accessibility and investor participation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, the stablecoin market is expected to expand significantly, from its current valuation of around $200 billion to approximately $3.7 trillion. Another critical projection comes from Citibank, which estimates that tokenized real-world assets will exceed $19 trillion in value by 2030. Collectively, these developments could channel large-scale capital inflows into the digital asset ecosystem, benefiting XRP’s market position. These trends suggest that over $23 trillion could eventually enter the digital asset space, potentially benefiting XRP and other top-tier cryptocurrencies. Legal Clarity May Spark Next Surge Further developments in the Ripple vs. SEC case may act as an additional growth trigger. Ripple has already announced its willingness to end ongoing appeals . With a confidential SEC meeting scheduled for July 17, some commentators believe an official settlement announcement is likely, which could increase investor confidence and drive another wave of market interest. According to Nassif, the next major technical breakout for XRP could occur once the token consistently closes above $3.25. He maintains that targets in the $10 range are plausible within the next bull cycle. His key message to investors is clear: avoid acting out of short-term excitement and instead position yourself for long-term advantage. The central advice from experts is to remain patient, avoid panic selling, and explore strategic ways to maintain exposure to XRP.

48376314,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=178900,1752708633,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/48376314.jpeg,El Salvador Bitcoin: Unleashing New Horizons in Digital Asset Policy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/el-salvador-bitcoin-talks/,"BitcoinWorld El Salvador Bitcoin: Unleashing New Horizons in Digital Asset Policy The world of digital assets is constantly evolving, with nations increasingly exploring the transformative potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. A recent, highly significant development has sent ripples through the global crypto community: a meeting between El Salvador’s visionary President, Nayib Bukele, and Pakistan’s State Minister for Blockchain and Crypto, Bilal Bin Saqib. This high-level dialogue signals a growing international interest in leveraging digital currencies for national development and hints at a future where El Salvador Bitcoin initiatives could inspire wider adoption. The Historic Meeting: What Does It Mean for Pakistan Crypto? The encounter, reported by Watcher Guru via X, brought together two key figures from nations with vastly different approaches to the digital asset space. President Bukele, globally recognized for making Bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador, met with Minister Saqib, who represents Pakistan’s efforts to explore blockchain and crypto within its economy. This meeting is more than a mere handshake; it represents a burgeoning interest from emerging economies in understanding and potentially adopting innovative financial technologies. For Pakistan Crypto enthusiasts and policymakers, this meeting offers a unique opportunity. Pakistan has historically maintained a cautious, often restrictive, stance on cryptocurrencies. While the State Bank of Pakistan has issued warnings against decentralized digital currencies, there have also been discussions within government circles about developing a national cryptocurrency or regulating the existing market. The presence of a dedicated State Minister for Blockchain and Crypto underscores a recognition of the technology’s potential, even amidst regulatory ambiguities. Key areas of potential discussion during such a high-profile meeting could include: Regulatory Frameworks: How El Salvador navigated the legal complexities of adopting Bitcoin as legal tender. Economic Integration: Strategies for integrating digital assets into the national economy, including remittances and financial inclusion. Technological Infrastructure: Building the necessary digital infrastructure to support widespread crypto use. Education and Awareness: Public campaigns to foster understanding and adoption of new financial tools. This dialogue could pave the way for Pakistan to learn from El Salvador’s pioneering, albeit challenging, experience, potentially influencing its future digital asset strategy. Nayib Bukele’s Vision: A Blueprint for National Crypto Strategy At the heart of this meeting is Nayib Bukele , a leader who has fundamentally reshaped El Salvador’s economic narrative by betting big on Bitcoin. In September 2021, El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, a move that garnered both praise and criticism globally. Bukele’s administration has since launched several initiatives aimed at integrating Bitcoin into daily life, including the Chivo Wallet, Bitcoin mining powered by geothermal energy (Volcano Energy), and the ambitious “Bitcoin City” project financed by “Volcano Bonds.” Bukele’s vision is rooted in several core beliefs: Financial Inclusion: Providing banking services to the unbanked population through Bitcoin. Remittance Cost Reduction: Significantly cutting down fees on remittances, a vital source of income for many Salvadoran families. Economic Sovereignty: Reducing reliance on traditional financial institutions and the U.S. dollar. Attracting Investment and Tourism: Positioning El Salvador as a hub for crypto innovation and attracting foreign capital. While El Salvador’s journey with Bitcoin has faced hurdles, including price volatility and skepticism from international bodies like the IMF, it has undeniably placed the small Central American nation on the global stage as a trailblazer in digital finance. For other developing nations, Bukele’s bold strategy serves as a compelling case study, highlighting both the immense potential and the inherent risks of such a profound economic shift. Driving Global Crypto Adoption: Lessons and Opportunities The meeting between Bukele and Saqib is a clear indicator of a broader trend towards Global Crypto Adoption . It signifies that discussions about digital assets are moving beyond niche tech circles and into the highest echelons of national governance. Countries are increasingly recognizing that ignoring the crypto revolution is no longer an option; instead, they must engage with it, understand it, and determine how it fits into their national economic goals. The potential for global crypto adoption extends across various sectors: Cross-Border Payments: Facilitating faster, cheaper international transactions. Supply Chain Management: Enhancing transparency and efficiency using blockchain technology. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Opening up new avenues for financial services without intermediaries. Digital Identity: Secure and verifiable digital identities leveraging blockchain. El Salvador’s experience, while unique, offers valuable lessons. It demonstrates that political will and a clear vision can drive rapid technological integration. However, it also underscores the importance of public education, robust infrastructure, and a balanced regulatory approach to ensure stability and consumer protection. As more nations explore this path, collaboration and shared learning become paramount to fostering responsible and sustainable global crypto adoption. Shaping Digital Asset Policy: Challenges and Collaborative Paths One of the most critical aspects of this evolving landscape is the development of sound Digital Asset Policy . The lack of clear, harmonized regulations is often cited as a major barrier to mainstream crypto adoption and innovation. Meetings like the one between Bukele and Saqib provide a platform for nations to discuss best practices, regulatory challenges, and potential frameworks that can foster growth while mitigating risks. Developing effective digital asset policy involves navigating several complex considerations: Consumer Protection: Safeguarding users from fraud, scams, and market manipulation. Financial Stability: Ensuring that the integration of digital assets does not destabilize traditional financial systems. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF): Implementing robust measures to prevent illicit activities. Innovation vs. Regulation: Striking a balance that encourages technological advancement without stifling it with overly restrictive rules. Taxation: Establishing clear guidelines for taxing crypto transactions and holdings. International collaboration is vital in shaping these policies. By sharing insights on regulatory successes and failures, countries can collectively work towards a more coherent global framework for digital assets. This collaborative approach can help prevent regulatory arbitrage, promote cross-border innovation, and build a more secure and efficient global digital economy. A Landmark Dialogue for the Digital Future The meeting between President Nayib Bukele and Minister Bilal Bin Saqib is a significant moment in the ongoing narrative of global digital transformation. It highlights El Salvador’s continued role as a pioneer in the Bitcoin space and underscores Pakistan’s growing recognition of blockchain and cryptocurrencies as vital components of future economic development. While the immediate outcomes of this specific meeting remain to be seen, its symbolic importance is immense. This dialogue signifies a shift from mere curiosity to active engagement among nations regarding digital assets. It suggests a future where international cooperation on crypto and blockchain policies becomes more common, leading to more robust frameworks, increased adoption, and ultimately, a more integrated and innovative global financial system. The road ahead for digital asset integration is complex, but with leaders willing to engage in such high-level discussions, the potential for a truly transformative digital future appears increasingly within reach.

The lawsuit, filed with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg last month, argues that Spain violated Ver’s legal protections when it approved a U.S. request to extradite him to Los Angeles. Roger Ver Fights $48M U.S. Tax Extradition in Spain, Calls Case a “Denial of Justice” In court documents reviewed by Bloomberg , Ver’s legal team described the Spanish extradition order as a “clear denial of justice” and a breach of international extradition protocols. Spanish authorities arrested Ver last year on the island of Mallorca after a U.S. indictment was unsealed, charging him with mail fraud, tax evasion, and filing false tax returns. He was later released on bail while legal proceedings continued. U.S. prosecutors allege that Ver failed to pay over $48 million in taxes related to his 2017 sale of tens of thousands of bitcoins , worth approximately $240 million. 'Bitcoin Jesus' Roger Ver’s lawyers call for dismissal of tax evasion charges, claiming the IRS’s exit tax violates the Constitution. #BitcoinJesus #RogerVer https://t.co/Lnez1FgsMQ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 4, 2024 Though Ver renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2014 and acquired citizenship in St. Kitts and Nevis, prosecutors argue he remained liable for U.S. taxes due to his continued ownership of U.S.-incorporated businesses, including MemoryDealers.com and Agilestar.com. The case also centers on the so-called “exit tax,” a requirement that wealthy Americans who expatriate pay capital gains tax on their global assets. In his legal filing, Ver’s Spanish attorney, Jaime Campaner Munoz, accused Spanish authorities of failing to consider the “legal uncertainty and insecurity” surrounding U.S. tax policy on crypto assets during the relevant period. He also argued that extraditing Ver would illegitimately curtail his right to liberty. A spokesperson for the European Court of Human Rights confirmed receipt of the complaint, which is currently under review. Neither Spain’s government nor the U.S. Department of Justice has commented on the ongoing case. Ver’s legal team in the United States has challenged the indictment, describing the charges as flawed and politically charged. David Schoen , Ver’s U.S. attorney, said in an interview that the case “should have never been indicted criminally,” pointing out that the crypto industry was still “completely in flux” in 2017 regarding token valuations and tax implications. According to Schoen, Ver had sought advice from U.S. tax professionals before selling his bitcoin and acted based on that guidance. “He did not commit any crime,” Schoen insisted. “There was no intent to defraud. He followed the advice of professionals. That’s not a crime.” Roger Ver’s Legal Fight Sparks Political Drama and Crypto Community Clash The crypto entrepreneur’s legal battle has drawn widespread attention in both political and blockchain circles. In a January video posted to his X account, Ver appealed directly to President Donald Trump, asking for help. “For decades, I’ve been terrorized by rogue U.S. government agents who hate American freedom. This is my story,” he said. The plea sparked online backlash. Elon Musk posted on X , writing, “Roger Ver gave up his U.S. citizenship. No pardon for Ver. Membership has its privileges.” Despite that, Ver reportedly paid $600,000 to Trump ally Roger Stone earlier this year to lobby Congress and influence the legal environment surrounding his charges. ₿ Roger Ver has reportedly paid $600,000 to longtime Trump associate Roger Stone to lobby him. #BitcoinJesus #RogerVer #DonaldTrump https://t.co/PrZ5ZEY1Is — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 25, 2025 According to congressional filings, Stone’s lobbying efforts sought to challenge the law under which Ver was charged. However, Schoen has since confirmed that Ver is no longer pursuing a pardon. The case has stirred heated reactions within the crypto community. Ross Ulbricht, the recently pardoned founder of the Silk Road darknet marketplace , expressed his support for Ver, citing Ver’s prior advocacy on his behalf . “Roger Ver was there for me when I was down and needed help. Now Roger needs our support,” Ulbricht posted on X . “No one should spend the rest of their life in prison over taxes. Let him pay the tax (if any) and be done with it.” @RealRossU , pardoned founder of the Silk Road marketplace, is publicly advocating for clemency for @rogerkver , known as ""Bitcoin Jesus."" #RogerVer #Bitcoin https://t.co/nFhN9IIBdn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 21, 2025 But not everyone shares that sentiment. Dan Held, a prominent crypto figure and former Kraken executive, called Ver “toxic” and accused him of doing long-term damage to Bitcoin’s development. “He misaligned expectations around Bitcoin so much that it led to a civil war.” Roger attacked my livelihood by trying to get me fired, called up others to hurt my relationships, and attacked my reputation. He misaligned expectations around Bitcoin so much that it led to a civil war. He deserves everything that he's about to get.

The trader, identified by the wallet address “0x2258…”, is betting heavily that ETH won’t climb anytime soon—and so far, the gamble is paying off. Related Reading: Avalanche Shatters Record With 20M Transactions—Is Real-World Use Finally Here? Based on blockchain data monitored via Hyperdash, the whale shorted 20,474 ETH at an entry point of $3,060. As ETH has been trading at levels lower than $3,000 at the time of writing, the whale is already enjoying an unrealized profit of approximately $1.14 million, or returns of 30%. Ethereum Under Pressure Below $3,500 The liquidation value of the position is at $3,505 — near where ETH traded previously in January 2025. That point is now serving as very powerful resistance. If the price exceeds that level, the position stands to be completely liquidated. Whale 0x2258, who’s already made over $15M, is shorting $ETH with 18x leverage, holding a position of 20,474 $ETH($62.5M). This whale has previously profited big by trading against James Wynn.https://t.co/BALllYbUXbhttps://t.co/NhOE1YD4QN pic.twitter.com/7k5ZE81Noa — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 15, 2025 Despite that narrow buffer, the trader seems confident. The use of 18x leverage suggests a high-conviction call that ETH will drop further or, at the very least, won’t bounce past that resistance level in the short term. This kind of heavy shorting is raising eyebrows in a market that’s still undecided on whether Ethereum can regain bullish momentum alongside Bitcoin. Track Record Of Outsmarting James Wynn This isn’t the first time “0x2258…” has stepped in with bold trades. The wallet has gained a reputation for taking positions that go directly against crypto influencer James Wynn—often with profitable results. Back in May, Wynn went long on ETH and Bitcoin. Almost immediately, 0x2258 shorted both. When Wynn closed his positions, 0x2258 did the same and walked away with $1.36 million. The next day, as Wynn flipped bearish, 0x2258 went long and bagged another $2.54 million. The back-and-forth continued. By May 26, the whale had locked in $5.6 million in profits in just three days. Since then, the strategy has snowballed into more than $15 million in realized gains, most of it from flipping against Wynn’s positions. Related Reading: If You’re Wealthy, 1 Bitcoin Should Already Be In Your Wallet, Expert Says Big Bet Reflects Uncertainty In ETH’s Path While Bitcoin continues to break through key resistance zones, Ethereum seems stuck in a tougher fight. Traders like 0x2258 appear to believe that ETH lacks the strength right now to push past the $3,500 level. Still, shorting with this level of leverage is a double-edged sword. If ETH bounces sharply, traders like 0x2258 could get caught in a squeeze, forced to buy back in at a loss—driving the price up even faster. So far, though, the whale is winning again. Whether it ends in another multi-million-dollar gain or a hard reset depends on what ETH does next. For now, the market is waiting to see what happens next.

33767162,[object Object],1752710417,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Holders Capitulate: Nearly 50K BTC Sold At A Loss in 24 Hours,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-holders-capitulate-nearly-50k-btc-sold-at-a-loss-in-24-hours/,"Bitcoin is entering a pivotal moment as the US Congress kicks off “Crypto Week,” where lawmakers will debate and vote on landmark cryptocurrency legislation. The decisions made this week could shape the regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States for years to come—and investors are watching closely. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is holding above critical support levels after recently setting a new all-time high of $123,200 and retracing to key demand near the $116,000–$118,000 zone. Despite the pullback, the broader trend remains bullish, with the price structure intact and support levels being defended by buyers. However, fresh data from CryptoQuant reveals signs of investor capitulation following Tuesday’s sharp correction. On-chain metrics show a significant spike in volume, with large sales recorded as Bitcoin fell, an indication that some holders may have exited positions in panic. This wave of selling added short-term pressure but also potentially flushed out weaker hands, setting the stage for a more stable recovery. Panic Selling Surfaces As Investors Dump 50K Bitcoin At A Loss Top analyst Axel Adler has shared key data revealing that nearly 50,000 BTC were sold at a loss in the last 24 hours—one of the largest capitulation events seen in recent months. This sharp wave of selling came on the heels of Bitcoin’s retrace from its all-time high of $123,200, and it reflects clear signs of panic in the market. The data suggests many investors exited positions below their entry points, a classic sign of capitulation among weaker hands. While this might appear alarming, such events often precede a continuation of bullish price action, especially in strong uptrends. By shaking out uncertain holders, the market may now be positioned for healthier, more sustainable growth, driven by long-term conviction rather than speculative noise. However, broader uncertainty remains. On Tuesday, all three major crypto bills were rejected in the US Congress during the opening of “Crypto Week,” raising concerns over the lack of regulatory clarity for digital assets. This unexpected legislative setback could fuel short-term hesitation from institutional investors awaiting clearer rules of engagement. Despite these headwinds, Bitcoin’s fundamentals and on-chain metrics remain strong. Exchange reserves are low, long-term holder supply remains steady, and network activity continues to rise. Moreover, the recent uptick in retail demand and altcoin participation points toward a potential expansion phase, not just for Bitcoin, but for the broader crypto market. BTC Holds Strong After Sharp Correction The 8-hour Bitcoin chart shows that BTC is holding up well after a volatile drop from its all-time high of $123,200. The price retraced sharply to the $115,700 level but found immediate support, printing a bullish wick and now trading around $118,800. Despite the correction, the structure remains bullish, with higher lows and higher highs still intact. Importantly, the 50, 100, and 200-period SMAs (Simple Moving Averages) are aligned to the upside, confirming a strong uptrend. BTC is also holding well above the key support level of $109,300, previously a major resistance zone, which now acts as a crucial demand area. If bulls manage to maintain momentum and reclaim the $120,000 zone, a retest of all-time highs is likely. Volume during the drop spiked significantly, suggesting either panic selling or a well-executed shakeout of weak hands. However, the fast recovery indicates strong underlying demand and continued conviction among long-term holders.

48377627,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74573,1752710434,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,SEC Commissioner Reveals Reason For XRP ETF Delay,https://timestabloid.com/sec-commissioner-reveals-reason-for-xrp-etf-delay/,"United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw has addressed ongoing concerns from the crypto investment community regarding the repeated delays in the approval of spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In a recent interview, Commissioner Crenshaw emphasized that the delays are procedural and do not reflect a definitive stance against the launch of such products. Understanding the Cause of Delays In a conversation on The David Lin Report, Commissioner Crenshaw explained the underlying reasons for the SEC’s slow pace in reviewing spot XRP ETF applications. She acknowledged the growing dissatisfaction among investors but clarified that the delays result from the SEC’s structured and methodical evaluation process. According to Crenshaw, the agency operates within a bureaucratic framework that mandates careful analysis rather than rapid decision-making. She noted that she had anticipated the frustration and had previously advised market participants that the approval process would likely take time. Crenshaw reiterated that the SEC must adhere to procedural requirements, which naturally extend the timeline for reviewing exchange-traded product applications, including those tied to cryptocurrencies like XRP. Despite the delays, Commissioner Crenshaw confirmed that the SEC continues to actively assess numerous applications for crypto-related ETFs. These include a broad range of filings, not limited to XRP-based products. She stated that the commission is methodically working through a large volume of applications and that this process is consistent with how the agency has traditionally approached new financial instruments. Crenshaw stated that the fact that a filing has not yet been approved should not be interpreted as an outright rejection. She further explained the importance of a comprehensive review before granting regulatory clearance. No Final Decision Yet on Spot XRP ETFs Importantly, Commissioner Crenshaw clarified that the ongoing delays should not be interpreted as a denial of future XRP ETF products. She emphasized that the SEC has not made a final decision on whether to approve or deny these applications. The delays are part of the agency’s formal evaluation protocol, which aims to ensure that all aspects of a proposed product meet regulatory standards before approval. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Crenshaw added that although the pace may appear slow, the SEC’s review process is designed to safeguard market integrity and investor interests. She encouraged stakeholders to remain patient as the agency continues its evaluations. Timeline for Potential ETF Approval Currently, more than ten firms, among them Franklin Templeton and Bitwise , are pursuing the launch of spot XRP ETFs in the United States. The SEC has already postponed decisions on these filings twice, missing the first two regulatory deadlines. The third deadline for some applications is set for August, while the final deadline for review and approval falls in October 2025. Market analysts, including Bloomberg ETF experts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, have projected that approval may occur before the final October deadline. Although spot XRP ETFs remain under review, the SEC has previously granted clearance to futures-based XRP products, such as the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF, indicating some level of openness to XRP-related investment instruments. Commissioner Crenshaw’s recent remarks aim to reassure market participants that the SEC’s approach to XRP ETF applications is guided by established procedures, not resistance. While the delays have raised concerns among investors, the agency remains engaged in a detailed review process. With multiple deadlines approaching, the coming months will likely provide further clarity on the future of spot XRP ETFs in the United States.

Let’s start with Ethena , the spotlight hit when Arthur Hayes dropped $1.5 million into ENA shortly after it jumped 20% on Upbit. That bold move hints he’s betting big on altcoins gaining momentum again. Meanwhile, FET is turning heads on the charts. Traders are watching closely as a classic harmonic pattern forms, paired with a strong weekly rise that could set up a major breakout. And while the market heats up, BlockDAG (BDAG) is stepping beyond the usual crypto crowd. Its new partnership with the Seattle Seawolves is grabbing attention, aiming to blend blockchain with sports through NFTs, digital collectibles, and special fan perks. On top of that, the project’s presale has already pulled in $340 million and sold over 24 billion coins, paving the way for a high-energy launch. Arthur Hayes Drops $1.5M On ENA After 20% Surge Arthur Hayes just made waves in the crypto world by buying $1.5 million into Ethena (ENA) right after the coin surged 20% following its listing on Upbit. He picked up around 4.2 million ENA coins through big-name platforms like Binance, Wintermute, and Galaxy Digital, showing strong faith in a coming altcoin rally. The price of ENA jumped from $0.22 to a peak of $0.37 before settling around $0.3371, reflecting growing excitement in the market. Hayes called the Upbit listing a key moment for Ethena, tying it into his bigger belief in the future of altcoins and the growing synthetic dollar space, which is gaining serious traction among buyers. FET Gains 10% As Bullish Pattern Takes Shape FET is back in the spotlight this week after posting a solid 10% gain. What’s catching traders’ eyes is a clear harmonic pattern forming on the daily chart, specifically, a Bearish Bat setup. It’s now entering the final CD leg, which often points to a potential push higher, possibly toward the $1.50 to $1.65 range. After dipping to around $0.55, FET has made a strong recovery and is now testing key resistance at the 200-day moving average near $0.78. Analysts say if the price breaks above this level, it could confirm the bullish pattern. But if it slips below $0.64, that might weaken the outlook and signal caution ahead. BlockDAG Scores Big With Seattle Seawolves Deal Surging Past $340M BlockDAG is making waves beyond the crypto crowd, thanks to a new partnership with the Seattle Seawolves, one of Major League Rugby’s top teams. This move brings blockchain right into the hands of sports fans through NFTs, digital collectibles, and behind-the-scenes content. It’s a strong step in showing how crypto can offer real-world value and stronger fan connections, not just trading hype. The numbers back up the buzz. BlockDAG’s presale has already raised over $340 million, with over 24 billion BDAG coins sold across 29 presale batches. Since its early days, the coin’s price has jumped 2,660%, climbing from just $0.001 to $0.0276. Despite that major run-up, there’s still a limited-time offer available. The price is temporarily set at $0.0016 until the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. That deadline has sparked a wave of new buying as more people take notice. Analysts believe BlockDAG has room to grow, with long-term price targets as high as $10. Its growing presence in mainstream sports, strong presale success, and focus on real-world use cases make it one of the more talked-about crypto projects this year. With demand heating up and the clock ticking toward launch, many see this as a chance that might not last long, especially as both fans and traders jump in. Final Thoughts Arthur Hayes’ big $1.5 million move into Ethena is still turning heads, boosting confidence in altcoins, and alerting buyers to more price action. At the same time, FET continues to draw attention, with its bullish chart pattern suggesting more upside could be on the way if key levels hold. But it’s BlockDAG that’s really capturing the spotlight. Its partnership with the Seattle Seawolves is pushing crypto into the mainstream, showing real-world value beyond just trading. With over $340 million raised, 24 billion coins sold, and a limited-time price of $0.0016 ahead of its August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release, the hype around BlockDAG is building fast.

The tech and retail titan emitted 68.25 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent over the year, according to its annual sustainability report, which was released Wednesday, well above its 2023 output. The spike results from an explosion in data center construction to support the growing demand for artificial intelligence technologies. These sites consume vast amounts of energy and raw materials, including enormous amounts of steel and concrete, two of the materials that are also most carbon-intensive to produce. The new data underscore a growing tightening at Amazon. The company had publicly pledged to achieve net-zero carbon by 2040 as part of its Climate Pledge, a much-heralded effort that set a bar for corporate climate action. But five years later, Amazon’s emissions had grown by a third. AI’s soaring power demands push Amazon’s emissions higher The Amazon report also admitted that, considering the company’s electricity purchases, its emissions will increase by 1 percent in 2024. It was the first time it had observed growth in that category since it began tracking it in 2019. The energy antenna focuses more on the power-greedy aspect of AI workloads, explaining to a large extent the boost in electricity consumption. The large AI models are trained across enormous computing resources, creating extravagant electricity consumption at data centers. In the report, Amazon acknowledged that it is crucial for collective efforts to reduce energy peaks and expand access to green, carbon-free energy to continue supporting the advanced technologies their customers rely on. And for all the money Amazon has thrown at renewable energy, including wind and solar projects around the globe, the company is finding it increasingly hard to keep up with the headlong growth of AI. The rest of big tech, including Amazon, Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Meta, and Microsoft, have increasingly turned to AI to discover their next great leap forward. However, the environmental costs are getting a second look. The companies’ growing AI data centers require more electricity, and the electricity demand has spiked. In some parts of the country, that need has been filled by power plants that run on natural gas and coal, sources that many companies had largely shunned to gravitate toward greener ones. AI is revolutionizing the energy sector, but it is not always for the better. In places where clean energy infrastructure has failed to keep pace with surging demand, especially driven by tech-powered growth, progress toward sustainability is beginning to reverse. Meanwhile, Amazon and other giants are signing contracts to secure carbon-free nuclear power for future operations. Both batches of deals should come online in a couple of years, but the divide between demand for energy and supply of the clean stuff is only growing. Amazon struggles to balance innovation with sustainability Amazon says it is still committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2040, noting its efforts to decarbonize its delivery fleet and grow its purchases of renewable energy and its investments in nascent technologies such as carbon capture. However, Amazon’s current path, particularly its effort to drive the AI boom, means its climate promises are in jeopardy. But as the company invests in its AI infrastructure, there are increasing calls from many quarters for more transparency, faster renewable adoption, and clearer accountability for tracking and curbing emissions. For now, Amazon’s 2024 vision is of a tech superpower pushing the future of AI, and pushing back even farther — at least for now — from the green promises it made just five years ago.

They call it an existential threat to the country’s democracy. Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden said there is a strong case for making crypto donations illegal in the UK. He was responding to Labor MP Liam Byrne, who had asked if the government was reviewing a crypto ban in political funding, which was ordered during the Beitbridge inquiry into xenophobia. During Parliament’s summer recess, McFadden emphasized the need for the UK to update its political finance laws to preserve public trust continuously. He said it was important to know who the donation was received from, whether it was correctly registered, and to understand the entire path of money in and out to assure the donation was safe. The concern is that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum can move across borders without being attached to names, banks, or identities. That is the tricky part for officials when trying to track the trail of money and verify that it is the source of the donation. To one set of people, crypto is a clear-eyed modern method of raising money; to another, it is a potential opening into the shadowy and potentially illicit world of campaign finance. Reform UK Bitcoin move sparks outrage It is just two months since Reform UK , led by Nigel Farage, said the party would begin taking donations in Bitcoin. The move made Reform UK the first UK political party to take donations in cryptocurrency publicly. Although many have hailed it as a metric innovation, the regulators and watchdogs are worried about that. A UK-registered anti-corruption charity warned in a recent report that accepting cryptocurrency donations could open up British politics to the dangers of foreign interference and the proceeds of crime. The report said digital assets like crypto could be used in “future political interference schemes,” especially if combined with lax oversight. McFadden and Byrne urged the government to ensure that institutions regulating political financing are strong. They called for greater resources and power for the National Crime Agency and the Electoral Commission, which monitors and investigates donations to political parties. Governments tighten rules on crypto funding It’s not just Britain that is worried. Elsewhere in the world, other countries are considering regulating or banning cryptocurrency donations to politics . Like many democracies, Ireland aimed to shield its democracy from “foreign interference,” fake news, and clandestine campaign financing. It’s different in the United States, state by state. A handful of states, including Oregon, Michigan, and North Carolina, have outlawed donations made in cryptocurrency altogether. They raised questions around traceability and transparency. Some states, like California, had bans in place but rolled back those restrictions so money from crypto could again flow into campaigns, as happened when the new year arrived. However, in countries with weak oversight, the risks are even greater. For example, El Salvador, which made Bitcoin legal tender, permits political donations in cryptocurrency. Civic groups have cautioned that external forces can easily manipulate the democratic process anonymously.

The top cryptocurrency has been struggling as major holders take profit at BTC’s current level. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Index Spikes Above 30, But Bitcoin Dominance Remains High, What Next? At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price trades around $118,800 with a 2% gain over the last 24 hours and a 9% gain over the past week, according to data from CoinGecko. Conversely, Ethereum, XRP, and Dogecoin have seen gains north of 16% on similar timeframes. BTC's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Bitcoin Price At Critical Levels, More Gains On The Horizon Following a major upside push from below $100,000, the Bitcoin price broke a persistent downtrend and managed to hit a fresh all-time high close to its current levels. As mentioned, a report from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode claimed an increase in profit taking from short-term holders. As these players exited the market, taking over $3.5 billion in profits in just 24 hours, the Bitcoin price lose steam and began moving sideways. While Bitcoin has been on a violent bull run, there are still fears of a major pullback from the $118,000 area to the support zone at around $110,000. However, a report from CryptoQuant, with data from top analyst Crypto Dan, suggests that the Bitcoin bull run still has some room for another leg up. As seen in the chart below, the current BTC market is nowhere near the overheated levels recorded in March and December of 2024. BTC's Realized Cap Age Bands as measured by UTXOs far from previous bear market levels. Source: Crypto Dan via CryptoQuant The CryptoQuant post stated the following, sharing an insight from Crypto Dan: (…) unlike in March and December 2024, on-chain data indicating market overheating shows that the market still hasn’t reached an overheated state. Despite the price rising even higher, the fact that overheating has significantly decreased compared to previous short-term peaks suggests that Bitcoin could continue to break all-time highs and rise significantly in the second half of 2025, leaving strong potential for growth. Bitcoin Bull Run Far From Over? In this context, and if bulls are able to sustain the momentum, Bitcoin is likely heading for higher. As NewsBTC covered earlier, a prediction from a top analyst claims that the levels of BTC adoption are unprecedented.

Uniswap (UNI) price forecasts point to a steady rise, with buyers testing the $9.20 resistance after holding support near $8.00. Meanwhile, Aptos (APT) price today remains strong above $5.00, setting a new support at $4.96 backed by solid trading volume. BlockDAG (BDAG) is moving beyond price shifts alone. It’s creating real value by teaming up with the Seattle Seawolves rugby and Orcas cricket teams. These deals bring ticketing, rewards, and NFTs on the blockchain. By focusing on sports fans in North America, BlockDAG aims to take blockchain use beyond niche groups. This sports partnership has pushed presale beyond $340 million. But BlockDAG currently offers coins at a special $0.0016 price until the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. This makes BlockDAG a top option for those looking at clear plans and real adoption. UNI Targets $9.20 Following $7.00 Rally Uniswap (UNI) is gaining strength after weeks of slow recovery. Price forecasts highlight a possible climb toward $10 if buyers keep their momentum. UNI has held steady above $8.00 support, with the $9.20 resistance level now in focus for the next move. Recent price action shows strong demand, with UNI rising from $7.00 to above $9.00 before a slight pullback. Hourly charts reveal higher highs and higher lows, meaning buyers are still active. Futures open interest is also growing, indicating more traders are positioning for price changes. However, if the price falls while open interest remains high, it could trigger forced selling. Watching these key price levels will be important to see if the upward trend continues or pauses. Aptos (APT) Maintains Support Level At $4.96 Aptos (APT) price today climbed 4.5% in 24 hours, with heavy buying at 01:00 UTC when volume reached 1.64 million units, 29% above average. Prices jumped from $4.97 to $5.06 in one hour, setting $4.96 as a new support level. The rally then pushed to a peak of $5.20 by 04:00 UTC. This rise aligns with broader crypto market gains of 3.6%. Recently, APT has traded near $5.13, about 3.2% higher. Support at $5.09 held well with strong volume confirming buyer interest. The trading range showed 6% volatility between $4.91 and $5.20, but recent action suggests price stability around $5.13 after intense buying. BlockDAG Focuses On Real Adoption Through High-Profile Seattle Seawolves Team BlockDAG is working closely with the Seattle Seawolves rugby team and the Orcas cricket team to bring blockchain technology to sports fans. These partnerships provide fans with new digital experiences such as ticketing on the blockchain, exclusive rewards, and collectible NFTs. By teaming up with well-known sports teams in North America, BlockDAG aims to reach a wider, loyal audience and increase its visibility beyond the usual blockchain circles. These deals aren’t just for show, they give fans real benefits, making blockchain practical and easy to use. This approach helps grow BlockDAG’s network by increasing user activity and improving security. More users mean a stronger and more useful platform. These partnerships clearly show BlockDAG’s goal to bring blockchain technology into everyday life, where regular people can understand and enjoy it. The BlockDAG presale has already raised $340 million in just a few months, and the push is stronger after this partnership. Right now, buyers can take advantage of a special price of $0.0016 per coin until the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. This presents a potential return of 3,025% compared to the original launch price of $0.05. Currently, Batch 29 coins are priced at $0.0276 but are frozen for now. This limited-time offer at $0.0016 offers a great chance for those looking for coins with clear real-world use and growth potential. BlockDAG’s plans and partnerships suggest it is one of the best projects to watch for practical adoption and long-term progress. Summing Up! Uniswap (UNI) price prediction targets $9.20, maintaining strong support at $8.00. This points to steady buyer interest and demand. Aptos (APT) price today stays firm above $5.00, with $4.96 confirmed as a support level and trading near $5.13 on solid volume. BlockDAG stands apart by focusing on real-world use.

These new mobile phones included the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The smartwatch is also a Pixel version , incorporated with a fourth-generation model. The announcement came after Samsung’s recent disclosure of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, a slender, new standard foldable mobile phone with a market valuation of $2,000. The availability of these mobile phones in the market is set for July 25. Google discloses new unique features for its Pixel 10 smartphone series Following the growing advancements of technology, Google is now eyeing to produce Pixel 10 products this year after releasing Pixel 9 on August 13, 2024. Notably, the 2 types of Pixels will look nearly the same, but the newest Pixel version will have more advanced processors, better hardware, among other minor enhancements. Another significant upgrade in producing the Pixel 10 series is that the Tensor G5 processor, the tech firm’s customized processor for its Pixel mobile phones with a fifth-generation model, will drive the whole series. Interestingly, the American multinational corporation and technology company has shifted its dependence on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company to create this chip after years of heavy dependence on Samsung to produce chips for its production. In addition, the tech company has vowed not to imitate Samsung’s Z Fold 7 make but instead will use an entirely new design that will use the Gemini AI application. In the era of foldable mobile phones, just as Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Google will also launch the Pixel 10 Pro Fold series, which will be more budget-friendly than Samsung’s. Meanwhile, Google’s new smartphone will utilize Android 16 features and demonstrate a more enticing user experience, which Google mentioned earlier during its annual developer conference in May. Google has an event in Mountain View, California called “Made by Google.” Last year it was conducted on August 13. It comes before Apple’s September iPhone event. The event focused on demonstrating the company’s new products to its users. Despite all these efforts, Google’s market valuation of its mobile phones is below that of Samsung and Apple’s in the US. Even so, the tech firm’s phones have passionate fans due to their impressive features, such as the high-quality camera and their updates on Android applications. Its enhanced features have also given its users reasons to stay loyal. Google incorporates several unique features in its production to surpass its rivals With its latest update on its mobile phones, Google took a significant step before Apple, its competitor, demonstrated its renovated iPhone package . In its blog post, Google highlighted its plans to unveil Material 3 Expressive, its new features created to showcase modern, applicable, and distinct design. The company will use it for its apps, such as Gmail, and in its Android system. It is worth noting that this is not the first feature Google has used to make its products unique. Several features have been implemented, such as incorporating bouncier animations, different shapes, strong contrasts, and bigger fonts in its production. Google promised to make its latest updated version of its package available to its users before this year ends.
